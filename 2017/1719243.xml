    <AbstractNarration>Wildfires have a tremendous impact on lives and property around the country and the globe. One aspect of wildfires that has not received as much attention is the the smoke plume and how it interacts with the atmosphere. In the late summer of 2016, NSF approved a short deployment of the Wyoming King Air research aircraft to provide airborne measurements of a fire near Boise, Idaho. This award will fund the analysis of that data to determine whether the measurements are able to provide enough information to answer the many outstanding questions about the characteristics of wildfire plumes. The potential impact of the project is on the validation and improvement of fire behavior models, which may allow a safer and more efficient usage of air and ground resources for fighting wildfires. There is also a significant connection between wildfire plumes and aviation and air quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will analyze data collected during the Rapid Deployment to Wildfires (RaDFIRE-2016) campaign which sampled a large wildfire northeast of Boise, Idaho in August 2016. Studies of wildfire plume dynamics and microphysics have mainly been conducted through numerical modeling simulations and observed through ground-based remote sensing. The RaDFIRE campaign was an initial test to determine whether instruments on the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft could successfully observe important wildfire characteristics. Initial analysis suggests that the test was successful, but more thorough analysis is needed to determine whether the data is adequate enough to answer unresolved questions about plume dynamics and microphysics. The project fits within the EAGER program at NSF due to the focus on untested but potentially transformative research ideas that employ a radically different analysis approach.</AbstractNarration>
