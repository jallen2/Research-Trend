    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be in the modernization of the electrical power grid and solving the challenges of integrating large scale renewable sources to the grid while improving the reliability, resilience, affordability, and flexibility of the electric power grid. This project's hardware/software controller turns the battery energy storage system from a passive component in the grid to an active and smart component which is able to benefit both grid operators and customers automatically. This technology will benefit utilities and independent system operators through providing enhanced grid services and reducing investment cost of system expansion. The commercial potential of this technology is due to its capabilities for improving power quality, increasing power system reliability, decreasing green gas emission, reducing peak demand, and maximizing renewable energy utilization. This technology will also benefit commercial, residential, and industrial customers by potentially reducing their electricity bill, increasing power reliability, and providing them with revenue in the energy market. The end product is a software/hardware controller panel which will be integrated with a battery energy storage system consisting of battery modules, inverter and measurement devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project involves a real time hardware/software controller for smart operation of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in the grid. The developed technology incorporates a novel control algorithm/structure in the form of an integrated hardware/software device, to control the power flow of BESS. The control hardware is configured for effective interaction of the controller with inverter, battery management system, and measurement units. The control software is structured to manage the communication, safe operation and monitoring of the system. This product, by employing control, machine learning, discrete signal processing, and optimization methods, enables BESS as a buffer to dynamically compensate for the renewable intermittency and load uncertainty in the power grid. The main advantage of the controller is to minimize the size of allocated battery for applications such as voltage regulation, renewable compensation, and load compensation.</AbstractNarration>
