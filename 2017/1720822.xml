    <AbstractNarration>This project is to support student travel and participation in the IEEE Conference on Connected Health (CHASE 2017) in Philadelphia, PA. CHASE provides a supportive scientific forum for students focusing on computing and engineering research associated with the multidisciplinary field of connected health. CHASE provides a forum for expert and peer critique of students' research with the goal of improving their science. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the travel support brings together people who might not otherwise engage with one another and engage in multidisciplinary research in fields involving connected health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal supports doctoral students by providing a Student Research Forum focused on encouraging students to examine technologies from multiple perspectives to understand how innovative technology, usable systems, and sound medical information combine to make the most impact. In addition, the Career Panel enables students to see different career paths for researchers in this area. The CHASE conference exposes participants to different scientific disciplinary approaches, supports networking with conference attendees and is designed to support the development of the next generation of scholars in connected health.</AbstractNarration>
