    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for speakers and participants in the Mid-Atlantic Algebra, Geometry, and Combinatorics (MAAGC) workshop, the next of which will take place at Drexel University on May 5-6, 2017. MAAGC is an annual conference series held in Philadelphia which brings together senior researchers and junior mathematicians to promote collaborations and regional interactions, while highlighting recent significant developments in algebra, geometry, and combinatorics. Each MAAGC workshop has brought four outstanding mathematicians from across North America to give talks about new advances in algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and other related fields. In addition to these invited lectures, there is a poster session for junior participants, a panel discussion featuring concrete and timely professional advice for mathematicians at varying stages in their careers, and plenty of unstructured time for forging mathematical collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAAGC workshops are designed to strengthen and connect the scientific communities in algebra, geometry, and combinatorics by facilitating positive interactions among students, postdocs, and faculty at research universities as well as small colleges in the Mid-Atlantic. We aim to include even more graduate student and postdoctoral participants throughout the region, providing early career researchers the opportunity to learn about recent trends in the field, disseminate their own work, build professional connections, and advance new mathematical results. The majority of the budget is thus dedicated toward funding students and young researchers without other means of financial support, prioritizing participants who also present posters. This grant will support the MAAGC conference series for three years (2017, 2018, 2019).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information is available on the MAAGC website at http://www.maagc.info.</AbstractNarration>
