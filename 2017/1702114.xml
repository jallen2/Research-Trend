    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a conference entitled "A View Toward Algebraic Geometry" which will be held May 1-5, 2017, at the Harbor View Hotel, on Martha's Vineyard. This meeting brings together leading experts in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry to inform the audience of the major developments from the past few years, to advance new research problems and directions, and to establish innovative connections between different subfields. While all of the speakers were chosen for their role in the recent developments, many were also chosen for their communication skills, and their dedication to developing young researchers in mathematics. The organizers expect that all talks will have an important didactic component, aimed at the junior researchers in the audience. The award will be used to support the participation of 40 junior mathematicians (defined as graduate students, postdocs, and researchers within 5 years of their PhD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expertise of the speakers covers a broad, but interrelated, range of topics. Nevertheless, explicit algebraic methods and applications of algebraic geometry form a coherent underlying theme. Major themes of the conference include the recent progress on syzygies in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra; rationality and stable rationality of algebraic varieties; and asymptotic stability. These three distinct topics are not disjoint, with many of the speakers and participants working in more than one area. In general, an effort has been made to bring together participants from related, but different, fields, in order to encourage the cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques.
