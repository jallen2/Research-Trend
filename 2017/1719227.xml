    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project seeks to advance concrete construction technology by reinventing cement production with carbonate-based, near CO2-neutral cement and concrete surrogates. It is proposed to utilize flue-gas borne CO2 as an 'ingredient' to rapidly mineralize digitally fabricated construction components. The reinvented cementation chemistry and process enable producing high-quality building elements faster than it is possible today. It also enables the integration of a confluence of technologies, mating carbonate-based cementation solutions with digital fabrication technologies to overcome challenges facing the construction sector today, including its large CO2 footprint, while also potentially improving productivity. By rationalizing workflows, enhancing automation, and originating new materials, this project develops innovative pathways to disruptively transform the construction sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project exploits new advances made the rapid ambient temperature mineralization of carbonate solids. The central technology is based on approaches for sequestering CO2 borne in flue gases in light metal carbonates. This renders carbonate-based cementation agents, which offer performance that is equivalent or superior to traditional cement and concrete. Recent studies have revealed that carbonation hardening process is rapid. Under suitable conditions it proceeds to completion in 24 hours or less, substantially faster than existing cementation solutions. Due to their simple composition and chemical homogeneity, the carbonate cement precursors offer flexible, and well-controllable rheology, an important prerequisite for enabling digital fabrication using these materials. Taken together, carbonate-cements offer new routes towards CO2-neutral cementation, and construction.</AbstractNarration>
