    <AbstractNarration>This award is in support of the 2017 Tropical Cyclone Operations and Research Forum (TCORF) at the 71st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference (IHC) to be held on March 14 -16, 2017 at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, in Miami, FL. The TCORF/IHC brings together representatives from Federal agencies and the academic research community to discuss the latest research into tropical cyclone observing, forecasting, and warning such as: 2016 hurricane/typhoon season challenges and the opportunities for research that they offer, research priorities of the operational centers, observations and observing strategies, tropical cyclone model development, transitioning research to operations, and advances in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is important to the Nation because it brings the academic research community, together with Federal agencies, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the Nation's hurricane forecasting and warning program.</AbstractNarration>
