    <AbstractNarration>This award is for the partial support for the NIST-ASTM-NSF-ASME workshop and competition on Formalizing Manufacturing Processes for Sustainability Assessment. The workshop will be hosted by the ASME 2017 Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference, which will be held at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, June 4-8, 2017. The funding will partially support the attendance of US scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students. Participating students will be selected following a competition on modeling of manufacturing processes for system level sustainability assessment. The workshop and competition will inform the manufacturing community of the ASTM E60 Subcommittee on Sustainable Manufacturing, provide an opportunity for practitioners to put the standards into practice when modeling processes of interest, and provide a source of candidate models to populate the repository that will be developed by NIST and its partners for the use of the manufacturing community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will partially support the participation of junior participants, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career faculty members, and, especially, women and under-represented minority students and faculty. The workshop focuses on modeling of manufacturing processes for system level sustainability assessment. All manufacturing processes, whether batch, continuous, or discrete event type, and all size scales, nano- to macro-manufacturing, will be considered. Models can span from traditional scale down to nanoscale processes and be based on mechanical, electrical, chemical, biochemical, and bio technologies. Since sustainability is a balance of competing objectives, including cost, time and environmental considerations, many different types of process performance metrics may be considered. It is anticipated that the workshop and associated modeling competition will advance the field of advanced manufacturing and its relationship to sustainability to a significant extent.</AbstractNarration>
