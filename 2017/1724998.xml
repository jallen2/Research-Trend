    <AbstractNarration>1724998 Brezinsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to provide partial travel supports to students who will attend the 10th International Conference on Chemical Kinetics, to be held in Chicago, May 21 to 25, 2017. This award is anticipated to support 50 students, each with $200 to offset their travel costs. Attending a conference is essential to enrich the educational experience of graduate students. The experience in interacting with other participants will stimulate novel ideas and further motivate students to pursue advanced research. In particular, this international conference will bring together experts across the world. The participating students from the U.S. institutions will gain rare opportunities to learn from many international experts. Such an experience will be very valuable and can help advance the research capabilities of the U.S. institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This biennial conference brings together experts from university, research laboratories, and industrial organization to exchange knowledge in theoretical and experimental chemical kinetics. This cross-disciplinary meeting highlights the importance of fundamental understanding of elementary reactions to the full range of chemical investigations in both gas and condensed phases. The presentations also include studies of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions and polymer engineering. This conference provide a unique forum to discuss how the same reactive species and reaction motifs manifest under very different reaction conditions. Particularly, gas phase chemical kineticists and liquid phase catalyst scientists can learn from each other. The results of such learning will further expand scientific understanding of the complex chemical reaction paths and outcomes. These knowledge will help engineers design cleaner and more efficient combustion or energy conversion devices, which will benefit the environment.</AbstractNarration>
