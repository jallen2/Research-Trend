    <AbstractNarration>Mobile devices are revolutionizing how geoscientists approach field-based research, and new technologies are being developed that are significantly different from methods used by previous generations. For example, hardware built into many smart phones and tablets allow these devices to function as digital geologic compasses. The ease of use and speed of taking digital measurements seem to represent distinct advantages over using an analog geologic compass in the field. However, preliminary investigations suggest that digital compass apps may not provide the accuracy that a professional field geologist needs. To address these concerns, this project will statistically evaluate the relative accuracy of orientation measurements using digital compasses on mobile devices as compared with analog compasses. This project will produce results that impact all geoscientists that use geologic compasses to take orientation measurements, and as such, the potential impacts across geoscience disciplines are substantial. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will tap into students' facility with mobile devices to make them the primary collectors of field data. Students in upper-level geology courses will take orientation measurements with both analog and digital compasses, which will then be used for statistical evaluations of the relative accuracy of digital vs. analog compass measurements. The researchers will assess statistical variation in their datasets to include variation between platforms, variation within measurements by observers on different locations in the field, and variation in repeated measurements on the same surface. Statistical analyses, such as Fisher distribution and Watson-Williams analyses, and Bland-Altman tests, will be applied to the field datasets. The researchers will assess the magnitude of the discrepancy and limits of agreement between types of measure and software; the existence of any systematic trends in variation across measurements, platforms, and software; as well as evaluate the consistency of measurement across the range of collected field data. In addition to the practical aspects of the research, the project will contribute to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education by the engagement of undergraduate students in the project.</AbstractNarration>
