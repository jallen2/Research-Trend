    <AbstractNarration>#1719193 &lt;br/&gt;2017 Environmental Nanotechnology Gordon Research Conference and Seminar: A Platform for Cutting Edge Research in Nanotechnology Applications and Implications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thee 2017 Environmental Nanotechnology Gordon Research Conference (GRC), The Next Generation of Nanotechnology: Materials, Applications, and Implications, and the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), Product Innovations and Novel Methodologies in Environmental Nanotechnology, which will be held, in conjunction, June 18-23 in Stowe, VT. The conference brings together leading scientists and engineers from across the globe in academia, industry and government who are motivated to advance nanotechnologies in a way that is safe for human health and the environment. Increasingly commercial, industrial and environmental products and processes are using nano-enabled systems. Nanotechnology offers tremendous opportunities to improve human health, product performance, energy and food production efficiency, and environmental protection. Benefitting from such opportunities must be accompanied by knowledge and policy that protects the environment. This fourth GRC builds on a successful conference history, and will challenge speakers and participants to consider the horizon of these emerging innovations and implications of environmental nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC has a tremendous success and track record of facilitating meetings that are in depth, intense scientific discussions involving scientific leaders in their disciplines and communities. This Environmental Nanotechnology GRC will focus on emerging topics, including i) applications of nanomaterials in food and agriculture, ii) translational issues and design opportunities in manufacturing, and iii) question the why, why not and how of nano-enabled products as well as recurring themes at the heart of the field, including engaging the public and nano-bio-phenomena and processes. This will be the second Environmental Nanotechnology GRS, which is organized by and for early career scientists and engineers. Graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and a group of invited mentors will come together to contribute to engaging technical research sessions and a mentorship panel. This year, sessions include, i) Nanotechnology: Novel Applications and Advantages to Current Alternatives, ii) The Yin and Yang of Nano-initiated Biological Inactivation, and iii) Novel Methodologies for Evaluating Environmental Impact-Benefit Tradeoffs of Nanotechnology. The mentorship component will include editors of leading journals in the field to discuss and provide guidance on publishing success.</AbstractNarration>
