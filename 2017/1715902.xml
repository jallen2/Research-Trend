    <AbstractNarration>This NSF award provides partial support for the 15th annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference, which will be held at Michigan State University on April 8-April 9, 2017. It is specifically aimed at graduate students, and many of the talks will be delivered by student participants. The conference will represent a large body of students in different stages of their Ph.D., and will provide a venue for students from a diverse collection of institutions and geographic regions to come together and interact. It aims to create a highly collaborative environment that will stimulate research and foster lasting connections between researchers at particularly crucial moments early in their careers. The conference will also provide a venue for students to hear about cutting edge research from established senior leaders and early career faculty. The early career faculty speakers, in particular, will be part of a panel for the students, intended to help bridge their transition from graduate school to the forefront of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal goal for this conference is to give graduate students the opportunity to present their research. Particular attention will be paid to ensure that a broad collection of topics are represented, so that rising generations of mathematicians are aware of the current frontiers of geometry and topology. To this end, there will be also be talks by distinguished plenary speakers Mark Behrens (University of Notre Dame), Danny Calegari (University of Chicago), Karsten Grove (University of Notre Dame) and early career faculty Renato Ghini Bettiol (University of Pennsylvania), Adam Levine (Princeton University), Tye Lidman (North Carolina State University), Sara Maloni (Brown University), Jose Perea (Michigan State University), and Wouter Van Limbeek (University of Michigan). These will provide the opportunity for early career researchers to personally engage with experts outside of their home university, expanding and consolidating the network of mathematical scientists.
