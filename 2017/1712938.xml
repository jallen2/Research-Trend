    <AbstractNarration>The workshop Women in Numbers 4 will take place from August 14 to 18, 2017 at the Banff International Research Station. This workshop is the fourth in a series of research collaboration conferences for women in number theory. The format differs from a typical conference in that much of the time is reserved for collaboration in small groups. The specific goals of this conference are: produce significant and impactful research in number theory, broaden the research programs of women in number theory, especially of those who are pre-tenure, train female graduate students and postdocs by providing experience with collaborative research and the publication process, strengthen and extend a collaborative research network of women in number theory and related fields, enable women who are faculty at small colleges to participate actively in research activities, and highlight research activities of women in number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will support the continued development of the community of women in number theory by bringing together researchers at various stages of their careers (from graduate students to senior mathematicians) for research collaboration and mentoring. The scientific focus of the workshop is on cutting-edge topics in number theory, including Apollonian circle packings, arithmetic dynamics, the Chabauty-Coleman method, computational aspects of supersingular elliptic curves, mock modular forms, Newton polygons on the Torelli locus, sieve techniques in analytic number theory, supersingular isogeny graphs in cryptography, and torsion subgroups on elliptic &lt;br/&gt;curves.
