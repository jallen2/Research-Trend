    <AbstractNarration>The international conference entitled "Recent Advances and Challenges in Discontinuous Galerkin Methods and Related Approaches" will be held at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications at the University of Minnesota from June 29 to July 1, 2017. This award supports junior participants' travel. The event brings together a variety of researchers from at least 14 countries/regions. They range from internationally renowned experts to early career mathematicians and PhD students. The event will summarize recent advances made both in the theory and implementation of the Discontinuous Galerkin and related numerical approaches, and to identify new challenges and opportunities in these areas. The conference will also have a significant educational component, with each talk required to feature introductory parts at a level accessible to graduate students, and ample discussion sessions throughout the conference. To further promote cross-pollination and mentoring, there will be moderated panel sessions where participants explore the frontiers of different research areas, possibilities of new connections between areas and new applications, and exciting opportunities of new collaborations. It will help junior researchers broaden their perspective and create research ties with more senior members in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discontinuous Galerkin and related approaches have been adopted in areas ranging from mechanical engineering to the simulation of muscles. In recent decades, deep theoretical advances have been made and wide-ranging applications discovered for these approaches. They often lead to design of novel methods (e.g. Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods, Virtual Element Methods, etc.) with superior properties in terms of accuracy, versatility, robustness and computational efficiency. They also leave open many exciting problems. This conference presents a rare but timely opportunity to summarize recent advances both in the theory and implementation of these methods, identify new challenges, and map out future research directions in related areas. The bringing together of people from different fields such as engineers, applied mathematicians, national lab researchers, will lead to cross-fertilization of ideas that normally does not happen in a conference of this size.</AbstractNarration>
