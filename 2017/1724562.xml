    <AbstractNarration>DePaul University proposes to host a meeting for National Science Foundation (NSF) aspiring Principal Investigators. The NSF released a new solicitation -- Computer Science for All: Researcher Practitioner Partnerships (CSforAl:RPP, NSF 17-525) -- in November of 2016. It requires that proposals be submitted by partnerships of education researchers and practitioners. Schools, districts, and even entire states are working to implement CS education across their classrooms but few of them are involved in Researcher Practitioner Partnerships (RPPs). In order to help teams of researchers and practitioners build appropriate partnerships and generate strong proposals, the NSF is funding a series of three regional, informational workshops to provide technical assistance to aspiring Principal Investigators. This is the third of those workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will connect researchers with practitioners in order to explore the ways they could work together and the kinds of research questions that their collaborations might address. The content of the meeting (funded under a separate proposal), is designed to generate interest in the value of RPPs in supporting new efforts in sustainable, equity-oriented CS education, advance understanding on the formation and maintenance of robust RPPs, and support teams in the development of appropriate RPP research questions and project designs that could result in benefits to both practice and theory. The Chicago workshop will host 125-150 participants covering their travel expenses and local arrangements.</AbstractNarration>
