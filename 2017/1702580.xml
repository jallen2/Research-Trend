    <AbstractNarration>California faces a constant fresh water problem. This problem is intensified by its complex water geography. In other words, where California receives precipitation is as important as how much precipitation it receives. This project will investigate the history of where and why it rains in California over the past 3000 years. Knowing where and why it rains in California is critical to water management, water storage infrastructure, and water conveyance from regions of excess to regions of deficit. As the largest state economy in the United States, the health of California is important to the health of the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal's goal is to investigate California's precipitation history as related to the position and strength of its North-South antiphased precipitation regime over the past 3000 years. To accomplish this goal, tubes of mud will be extracted from three lakes. Like a history book, these tubes of mud record California's precipitation history. The team will study the mud's physical, chemical, and biological properties to infer a history of floods, droughts, vegetation change, and fire activity. Training of students from groups historically underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math is a key component of this study.</AbstractNarration>
