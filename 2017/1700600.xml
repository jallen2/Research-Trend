    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a meeting on mathematical and philosophical logic at UCLA, a meeting entitled "A Very Informal Gathering of Logicians," from Friday, February 3, to Sunday, February 5, 2017. For additional information see the meeting's webpage: http://www.logic.ucla.edu/vig2017/ .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the nineteenth in a series of biennial logic meetings at UCLA which, starting in the mid 1970s, has been one of the most important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast. The meeting is a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific projects. About half the grant funds are dedicated to travel awards for graduate students and early career researchers, to allow them to come to the meeting. Most of the participants will be research mathematicians and university teachers. What they learn at the meeting will have a positive impact on their research and teaching.</AbstractNarration>
