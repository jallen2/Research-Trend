    <AbstractNarration>The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research. CREST promotes the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CREST Center for Interfase Design and Engineered Assembly of Low-Dimensional Systems at City University of New York (CUNY) City College requests National Science Foundation support for the 18th International Conference on II-VI Compounds and Related Materials.&lt;br/&gt;II-VI semiconductor compounds are composed of a metal from either group 2 or 12 of the periodic table. The scope of the conference spans synthesis techniques, investigation of new physical phenomena and innovative device development. Specific topics that will be covered include growth, characterization, structure, physics and devices of II-VI and related compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference has been a significant contributor of modern science and technology since it was established. Ground breaking research in the growth and characterization of materials and design and implementation of new devices of interest in medical, military or imaging domains has been carried out since the conference began. The recent strategic importance of solar cells based on II-VI compounds and the development of new materials with related fabrication properties have increased activity in this field with enormous potential, and has led to a surge in interest in the conference worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will provide a unique forum for researchers from two CREST Centers (CUNY and University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez) to expand and promote the Centers' collaborations and allow CREST Center students and faculty to interact in a unique global research environment. Student participation will be encouraged through the availability of travel support and a student presentation competition.</AbstractNarration>
