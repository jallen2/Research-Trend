    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively&lt;br/&gt;selected by a 14-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont&lt;br/&gt;Forum. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world?s major and emerging&lt;br/&gt;funders of global environmental change research and international science councils. It&lt;br/&gt;aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently&lt;br/&gt;needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing&lt;br/&gt;international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers&lt;br/&gt;within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This&lt;br/&gt;approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent&lt;br/&gt;research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach,&lt;br/&gt;recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have&lt;br/&gt;provided support for research projects that utilize existing Arctic observing systems,&lt;br/&gt;datasets and models to evaluate key sustainability challenges and opportunities in the&lt;br/&gt;Arctic region, to innovate new sustainability science theory and approaches to these&lt;br/&gt;challenges and opportunities, and support decision-making towards a sustainable Arctic&lt;br/&gt;environment. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in&lt;br/&gt;consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and&lt;br/&gt;that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and end users (e.g., policy&lt;br/&gt;makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).&lt;br/&gt;ARCTIC-ERA unites a core team of experts from the United States, France and Russia.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to address critical aspects of human well-being and&lt;br/&gt;sustainable use of Arctic infrastructure and resources under current and projected&lt;br/&gt;conditions. This projects seeks to analyze critical data that will help develop&lt;br/&gt;recommendations on adaptation of coastal settlements and ports, transportation,&lt;br/&gt;fishery, oil and gas exploitation to the ongoing and future changes and mitigation of their&lt;br/&gt;negative effects, and to identify new opportunities associated with the "Opening of the&lt;br/&gt;Arctic". In addition to publications and presentations, the results of the project will be&lt;br/&gt;disseminated through a series of dialogues between the researchers, decision makers,&lt;br/&gt;and end-users. These dialogues will focus on co-design and co-production of options.</AbstractNarration>
