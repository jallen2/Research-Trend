    <AbstractNarration>While there has been progress in recent years in solving numerous wireless sensor networking challenges, the key problem of enabling real-time quality-aware video streaming in large-scale wireless networks of resource-constrained devices is still open and largely unexplored. Existing wireless networking protocol stacks based on transmitting predictively-encoded video are computationally expensive, have limited resilience to wireless channel errors, and use available network resources inefficiently. This project is attempting a new approach based: (a) On the development of a novel wireless streaming framework for resource-constrained devices rooted in the theory of compressed sensing (CS) and (b) co-design/optimization of the video encoder and key wireless networking functionalities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new networked wireless streaming system being developed is referred to as Compressive Video Streaming (CVS) and has the potential to significantly reduce power consumption for a given target video quality for resource-constrained sensing devices. New network control algorithms are designed and integrated with the video encoder that, unlike TCP and TCP-friendly approaches, use the estimated received video quality as the basis for resource allocation decisions. Project implementation and extensive testing is being carried out on several experimental platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology to be developed has the potential to strongly impact the state of the art in resource-constrained wireless video sensor networks. Important educational objectives of the program include mentoring of minority graduate and undergraduate students, and development of new interdisciplinary course materials.</AbstractNarration>
