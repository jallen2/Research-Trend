    <AbstractNarration>The Honorary Symposium for Prof. K.K. Chawla: Fibers, Foams, and Composites - Science and Engineering, to be held at the Materials Science &amp; Technology 2011 Conference and Exhibition (MS&amp;T 11) October 16-20, 2011 in Columbus, OH, was selected by the MS&amp;T programming committee as the only symposium at MS&amp;T 2011 to be designated as an "honorary" symposium. It is a tribute to Prof. Krishan Chawla's longstanding and distinguished contributions to all types of composite materials. The MS&amp;T conference is expected to have an attendance of approximately 3,500, including participants from the Americas, Europe, and Asia. All types of research institutions (academia, government, and industrial research laboratories) will be represented. The symposium will bring together researchers in an informal setting with ample time for discussion and interaction. The annual MS&amp;T conference is organized cooperatively by four leading materials societies, including The Minerals Metals &amp; Materials Society (TMS), Association for Iron and Steel Technologies (AIST), American Society for Metals (ASM) International, and The American Ceramic Society (ACerS), bringing together professional members of the materials community to interact. This international symposium will involve experts who will present the latest developments in processing, interfaces, mechanical behavior, and properties of composites and foams. Participation by students will be encouraged, in order to help foster future generations of composites scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
