    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant will investigate the impact of project and problem based learning techniques on student performance in engineering statics, a course that serves as a "gateway" to engineering degree programs at most universities. The study will rigorously investigate the effects on learning and motivation using sample and control groups drawing on expertise from both engineering and learning sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is that by understanding the impact of these teaching methods on students in large, introductory engineering courses it may be possible to improve student performance at the large number of engineering schools that offer similar courses. The proposal includes a plan to develop a strong research partnership. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
