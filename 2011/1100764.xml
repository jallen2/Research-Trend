    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to model the effect of aerodynamic damping on the dynamics and stability of flapping flight, based on our recent discovery of flapping counter torques and flapping counter forces. We will undertake a combined experiment and analytical method, including aerodynamic force measurements using dynamically scale robotic wings, flow visualization and measurement using Digital Particle Image Velocimetry, and mathematical modeling based on dynamics and control theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will advance scientific bases and develop comprehensive theories of flapping flight in animals and man-made systems. It is the first attempt to model the flapping flight dynamics under different flight conditions and the first step in explaining why flying animals possesses both superior stability and maneuverability. The research results will be disseminated broadly to the biology, physics, and engineering communities. The theories developed in this work can be translated into other forms of locomotion such as walking, crawling and swimming. Advances in flapping wing micro aerial vehicles can be used in various civilian and defense applications. The project will provide a unique, interdisciplinary training environment for graduate and undergraduate students. In particular, the undergraduate researchers will participate through Purdue SURF and NSF REU programs.</AbstractNarration>
