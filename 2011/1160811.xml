    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the workshop is to facilitate the exchange of information among leading scientists investigating the interplay between microbial pathogens and the plant immune system. The participants will address two fundamental questions pertaining to the molecular determinants that impact plant disease in agriculture: 1) What are the critical plant immune pathways that inhibit pathogen growth and how are they regulated? 2) What are the mechanisms by which pathogens suppress plant immunity to persist in plants? Scientists from the US, Israel, Europe and China using diverse tools and approaches to study plant-microbe interactions will participate in the workshop. The workshop will provide an interactive platform to share technology, establish collaboration, and develop innovative technology to improve plant health, productivity and security. Participants will: (1) critically review the status of research and technology in the field; (2) address the agricultural impacts of biotechnology aimed to improve plant disease resistance in the US and Israel; (3) assess biotechnology and set priorities for future research in this area; and (4) assemble integrated teams to develop novel research programs to combat plant pathogens in the field. The workshop will advance discovery in the early cell biology and signal transduction events that cover plant immune responses in model and natural hosts. The workshop design will provide a unique format for participants to critically evaluate the challenges and roadblocks that impede research progress. Students will be active participants. They will gain knowledge and feedback from leading scientists while providing a fresh perspective for future work. Several participants have links to companies working on agricultural technology development. Student exposure to the infrastructure and goals of business models will be educational for their professional development for industry-related work. Special attention has been made to promote participation of women and minorities actively working in this area.</AbstractNarration>
