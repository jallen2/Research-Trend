    <AbstractNarration>SES-1122619&lt;br/&gt;Jake Rosenfeld&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Wage Inequality in the US, UK, and Canada"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past few decades, the liberal democracies have experienced increases in pay inequality marked by steadily rising top-level incomes combined with stagnant wages for average workers. This rise in inequality has occurred alongside increases in productivity levels. In decades past, productivity improvements were generally spread across a wide swath of the workforce, spurred on by labor unions that helped institutionalize norms of pay allocation, patterning wages across broad industries among union and nonunion workers, and internal labor markets within firms that smoothed over changes in individual productivity over the life course. This de-coupling of productivity and earnings over the past generation represents a profound shift in how wages are allocated to workers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project utilizes five individual- and business establishment-level datasets on U.S., English, and Canadian workers, and has three specific objectives. The first is to estimate the causes and consequences of the collapse of union wage bargaining among remaining union members. The second objective is to document the rise of personalized pay at the workplace and measure how this wage-setting institution has exacerbated within-group inequality among union and nonunion workers. The third objective is to estimate how personalized pay practices help de-couple average wages from productivity levels. Each objective explores workplace dynamics that have widened wage gaps while de-linking average pay from productivity levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have broad reaching social impacts in the following ways. First, the data depository made available to the public will combine establishment-level data from three different nations standardized with a common codebook, and will serve as one of the most comprehensive sources of establishment-level workplace data available. Second, the availability of establishment-level information combined with the dissemination of the results of the analyses will open up new areas of inquiry, especially for researchers interested in racial and gender discrimination at work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the focus of this project centers on patterns of within-group inequality and their relation to new wage-setting institutions, the analyses can be easily adapted to focus on the employer characteristics that lead to inequality between ascriptive categories. The data and analyses provided by this project will allow future researchers to explore how ascriptive categories translate into unequal economic outcomes in the contemporary era of growing employer power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third, the analyses proposed in this project will help illuminate debates surrounding inequality trends that extend well beyond the research community. As policymakers and public intellectuals wrangle over potential remedies for recent inequality trends, rigorous research about the causes and consequences of these much-discussed developments is crucial.</AbstractNarration>
