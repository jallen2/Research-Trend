    <AbstractNarration>This project at California State University-Long Beach (CSULB) is developing a hands-on laboratory- and project-based virtual course on sustainability of the built environment using Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology. Demand for specialists who can integrate BIM and Green Design is increasing because sustainability is becoming a driving force in industrial practice. Using BIM to analyze building performance enables students to go beyond conventional 2D and 3D models used for purely visualization purposes. The outcomes of this project include ten core modules and five advanced modules, including solar radiation analysis, day-lighting analysis, shading analysis, ventilation and air flow analysis and quantification and analysis of greenhouse gas emissions due to the building materials and energy use of the buildings. Through these modules, the students develop a strong foundation for understanding global environmental problems such as climate change and ozone depletion, being familiar with the concept of building assessment, gaining a clear understanding about sustainable development and sustainable construction, and understanding the relationships between sustainability and building materials, building forms, and building systems. The modules cover seven credit categories of the United States Green Building Council's rating system, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), including sustainable sites, energy and atmosphere, water efficiency, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in designs, and regional priority. The project has the following educational components: 1) Sustainability in Built Environment; 2) Changes of Teaching Method in Engineering Education using BIM, and 3) Sustainability in Construction Education. One component of the project introduces K-12 students to green buildings and BIM technology through outreach programs available at CSULB campus, which is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution.</AbstractNarration>
