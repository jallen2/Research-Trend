    <AbstractNarration>Vanderbilt and Leipzig Universities in the area of Chemical Biology will establish a sustainable collaboration in education and research to study the fundamentals of ligand-macromolecule recognition by combining chemical tool compounds with biophysical techniques. The similar research foci of both institutions combined with complementary technologies will provide students and post-doctoral fellows with a comprehensive education. Jens Meiler of Vanderbilt University (VU) and Annette Beck-Sickinger of Leipzig University (LU) spearhead this initiative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Although ligand-macromolecule recognition is at the core of biological&lt;br/&gt;processes, it is still poorly understood. LU offers basic science expertise with unique tool compounds&lt;br/&gt;such as carbaborane analogues, non-natural amino acid peptides, leading technology for expression of labeled human membrane proteins and solid-state NMR studies of such membrane proteins. This is complemented by VU?s translational science expertise in liquid-state NMR and EPR studies, a high-throughput screening facility to identify novel tool compounds, and computational modeling technologies unique for ligandmacromolecule recognition. The collaboration is further strengthened through&lt;br/&gt;the joint development of novel biochemical assays. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will support a) planning visits, and b) exchange of students and&lt;br/&gt;post-doctoral fellows on all levels. Four planning visits of Jens Meiler and five other VU faculty to LU in&lt;br/&gt;Leipzig, Germany will occur on an annual basis. During their stay the VU researchers will present at scientific symposia, participate in roundtable discussions, and meet with potential collaborators one-on-one. Technology exchange will be&lt;br/&gt;fostered through tutorials offered by the faculty. The faculty will also develop and implement mentorship&lt;br/&gt;plans for student exchanges. At least six research visits per year will involve the exchange and co-mentoring&lt;br/&gt;of students or post-doctoral fellows from VU. Participating in an international program, teaching&lt;br/&gt;and learning new ideas, publication of a scientific manuscript, and attending research seminars are&lt;br/&gt;collectively experiences that are invaluable for a young scientist. Their participation in international&lt;br/&gt;exchange will broaden their perspectives, thus making them more competitive in their field. The students&lt;br/&gt;will share ideas and techniques with their collaborators, and similarly instruct their home laboratory with&lt;br/&gt;the knowledge gained at LU. Additionally, their experiences will enhance applications to the ?International&lt;br/&gt;Research Fellowship Program? and ?Graduate Research Fellowship Program?. Exchange visits are&lt;br/&gt;complemented by a comprehensive set of off-site tools such as joint website (www.leipzig.vanderbilt.edu),&lt;br/&gt;project wiki pages to exchange data and tutorials, and video conferences. The proposal further involves&lt;br/&gt;exchange of undergraduate students with focus on groups underrepresented in science leveraging the&lt;br/&gt;PI?s CAREER award undergraduate open house. The collaboration is mutually beneficial as it provides&lt;br/&gt;access to complementary knowledge and technologies. Researchers will travel in both directions: U.S.&lt;br/&gt;researchers supported through the present proposal, German researchers through grant support from the&lt;br/&gt;German Academic Exchange Service and the German Research Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
