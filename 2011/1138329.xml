    <AbstractNarration>Proposal # 1138329&lt;br/&gt;PI: Prof. Olivia A. Graeve, Alfred University&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Prof. Erica Corral, University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;Title: Enabling participation of Hispanic Students in SHPE 2011 Graduate Activities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposers are requesting support from the National Science Foundation Human Resource Development (ENG) to provide travel funds for undergraduate students, both from 2-year and 4-year colleges, graduate students, high school teachers, and faculty, to participate in the SHPE 2011 annual meeting (October 26-30, 2011, Anaheim, CA). The PI's are very experienced at providing technical assistance with paper and poster presentations. A draft of the proposed agenda is included in the proposal as well as evaluation information and its implementation. The proposal well done, very cost-effective and I highly recommend approval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal provides travel funds to enable the participation of Hispanic students, engineering faculty and high school teachers in the Annual Meeting of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). Attendance to the meeting will promote mentorship between students and faculty; broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in engineering; and enhance students, faculty and high school teacher's ability to develop engineering-related ideas and projects. The Principal Investigator is a valuable resource for students given her work with the SHPE meeting over the past 10 years.&lt;br/&gt;Student, faculty and high school teacher's participation in the annual meeting of SHPE will lead to improved research and mentorship, regionally and nationally, as well as to attracting and retaining underrepresented minority students in engineering. Moreover, the conference will give students access to faculty and researchers in the field of engineering; thereby building and enhancing networks, partnerships, and potential mentoring relationships between students, universities, and the engineering research community-at-large. The results will be disseminated nationally through the SHPE magazine and website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omnia El-Hakim, Program Director of Diversity and Outreach</AbstractNarration>
