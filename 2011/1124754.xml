    <AbstractNarration>This project is awarded under the Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond competition, with support by multiple Directorates and Divisions at the National Science Foundation as well as by the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative of the Semiconductor Research Corporation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this proposal is to design and synthesize structurally precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and incorporate them into high-performance electronic devices. GNRs are narrow strips of single-layer graphene that have garnered considerable attention as a possible replacement for silicon in high-performance nanoelectronic devices. Exploring the full potential of GNRs has been hampered by their limited availability and poor control of their width and edge structure. The proposal involves a collaboration between researchers at Cornell University and Princeton University. This project involves the synthesis of precursor polymers and their oxidative annealing into GNRs. The effects of edge structure and doping levels on materials properties will be determined, and the effect of changing structural parameters on the fabrication and testing of transistor and sensor device performance of GNRs will be undertaken. Computational modeling to support both the synthesis and device fabrication will be accomplished using a variety of approaches from ab initio studies of the electronic properties to Molecular Dynamics and Kinetic Monte Carlo studies to determine the structural characteristics. The proposal also integrates several educational initiatives with the research efforts. A new national group called "Women in Nanoelectronics" will be formed as part of this project, and the goal of the group will be to attract young women to nanoscience disciplines. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in an interdisciplinary, collaborative research environment and will be encouraged to broaden their skills through exchanges among the Princeton and Cornell laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computing using graphene nanoribbons, ultrasmall strips of matter comprised of a single layer of carbon atoms, has the potential to generate efficient, ultrasmall devices; however, many significant technical hurdles must be overcome to realize the benefits. The project addresses an important, longstanding problem in using graphene in electronics and will further our understanding of this technologically important material. Such work could impact industries that use microprocessors in their products, including computer, consumer electronics, automotive, etc.</AbstractNarration>
