    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Fisher from Colorado State University will investigate the effect of plasma modification processes on surfaces. Plasma processing has become indispensable in a wide range of applications where high performance materials with tailored surface properties are employed. Moreover, development of new plasma surface modification processes and deposition chemistries is a burgeoning area with impact on biomaterials, coatings, and sensor applications. A more complete understanding of the underlying chemistry in these systems could lead to manufacturing improvements with economic impact across many industries. Thus, the goal of the proposed work is to improve understanding of the fundamental chemical processes that occur at surfaces during plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and surface modification of polymers. Professor Fisher and her students will achieve this goal through an integrated, comprehensive approach to understanding the molecular-level chemistry in these systems. The primary experimental tools to be employed are in situ sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and the laser-based imaging of radicals interacting with surfaces (IRIS) technique, which provides steady-state surface interaction data for plasma species. The SFG experiments are designed to examine the evolution of plasma modified films upon exposure to atmospheric gases to study labile intermediates formed in plasma modification, thereby elucidating mechanisms involved in aging and hydrophobic recovery processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasma processing is used to prepare high performance materials with tailored surface properties. These materials are used in many fields and industries including computational science, information processing, data management, sensor fabrication and communications. In this project, Prof. Fisher and her students will use a combination of experimental tools to study plasma processing. The results will enable the development of new materials and the improvement of existing ones. The intrinsic interdisciplinary nature of this research will afford students a broad exposure to and education in chemistry, engineering, and materials science, beyond the traditional boundaries in chemistry. Professor Fisher will continue her efforts in broadening participation of underrepresented groups and use the proposed experiments to develop demonstrations of plasmas and lasers for visitors, high school groups and K-12 teachers.</AbstractNarration>
