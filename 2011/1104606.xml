    <AbstractNarration>Recently one has witnessed tremendous developments in research in geometry and topology, which are two central areas in mathematics. In particular, major progresses have been made in important questions in subjects such as geometric analysis, Riemannian geometry, topological field theory, and Gromov-Witten theory. The Great Lakes Geometry Conference 2011, to be held in Ohio State University, will bring together experts who work in the areas related to topological field theory, Gromov- Witten theory, and geometric analysis to discuss exciting recent developments and to provide a common ground where mathematicians share ideas and visions towards the goal of further our understanding of these subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Lakes Geometry Conference (GLGC) is a well-established conference of geometry and topology held in the Great Lakes region. The year 2011 conference is its 12-th anniversary and will be held in the Ohio State University in Columbus. The two main themes of the GLGC 2011 are Gromov-Witten theory and geometric analysis. In this conference, the PIs draw the speakers from a diverse spectrum of active research areas in geometry and mathematical physics. Gathering the experts of various aspects of the main themes will provide a common ground where mathematicians share ideas and visions and will encourage collaborations between researchers in the areas. An important goal of this conference is to expose graduate students and early career mathematicians in the related fields to some recent exciting new developments in this active area of geometry and physics. The conference will benefot the students and the early career mathematicians at the Ohio State University and other Midwestern universities, encourage interaction between the universities in the Midwestern region and beyond, and help graduate students and post-docs to work in these exciting areas.&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: http://www.math.osu.edu/hhtseng/glgc11 main.html</AbstractNarration>
