    <AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on the study of geometric, analytic and &lt;br/&gt;information-theoretic aspects of high dimensional phenomena&lt;br/&gt;on the border of probability, convex geometry and analysis. &lt;br/&gt;One part of the project concerns the problem of rates of&lt;br/&gt;convergence in the entropic central limit theorem, and is devoted &lt;br/&gt;to obtaining new asymptotic expansions for the relative entropy &lt;br/&gt;with respect to the growing dimension. In other part, &lt;br/&gt;it is proposed to perform a systematic study of the &lt;br/&gt;dimensional behavior of the entropy and information for &lt;br/&gt;different classes of probability distributions, satisfying &lt;br/&gt;convexity conditions. In particular, new concentration properties &lt;br/&gt;of the information content will be considered for dependent &lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional data. It is planned to introduce and explore &lt;br/&gt;special positions of probability measures, responsible for &lt;br/&gt;correct behaviour of sums of independent summands&lt;br/&gt;(when the entropy power inequality can be reversed).&lt;br/&gt;Another part addresses the stability problem, raised by Kac &lt;br/&gt;and McKean, in the entropic variant of Cramer's&lt;br/&gt;characterization of the normal law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of the proposal is the development of the &lt;br/&gt;information-theoretic approach to high dimensional phenomena,&lt;br/&gt;with focus on obtaining new asymptotic bounds on the entropy and &lt;br/&gt;information. The study of entropy is dictated by various &lt;br/&gt;applications within and beyond pure mathematics. Entropy plays &lt;br/&gt;a key role in statistical physics (in order to capture&lt;br/&gt;the amount of disorder in a system), in statistics&lt;br/&gt;(to measure the performance of statistical estimators),&lt;br/&gt;in engineering and mathematical theory of communication.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research also aims to provide new connections between &lt;br/&gt;probability, geometric functional analysis and information theory,&lt;br/&gt;and to demonstrate an increasing role of entropy&lt;br/&gt;bounds in purely mathematical fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An integral component of the project is the involvement and &lt;br/&gt;training of the graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
