    <AbstractNarration>The Innovations in Data-Intensive Astronomy workshop, to be held in Green Bank, WV, will be a cross disciplinary meeting to bring together computer science experts in data intensive computing and infrastructure, and leading astronomy researchers motivated by the need to analyze and curate massive astronomical data sets. The workshop will focus on discussions devoted to the development and deployment of next generation data intensive software applications and infrastructure to satisfy the science goals of the 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will facilitate discussion and foster the establishment of collaborations for data intensive scientific computing across a number of disciplines, including all branches of astronomy as well as computer science. The workshop is timely with regard to the topic of data curation. There is much discussion and debate surrounding the decision of what data to archive long term. Complimentarily, the idea of software as an instrument is gaining popularity and shows promise for enabling science to a wider audience. That is, by retaining unreduced data indefinitely, we enable future reuse and reanalysis of the data in new, unanticipated ways, perhaps even by researchers outside the field of astronomy.</AbstractNarration>
