    <AbstractNarration>The M6.3 Christchurch earthquake struck the Canterbury region in New Zealand's South Island on 22&lt;br/&gt;February 2011, causing widespread damage and multiple fatalities. The earthquake occurred at 5 km&lt;br/&gt;depth, 10 km south-east of Christchurch, New Zealand's 2nd-most populous city. It followed ~6 months&lt;br/&gt;after the Sept. 4, 2010 M7.1 Darfield earthquake in the same region. The Christchurch earthquake was&lt;br/&gt;part of a series of earthquakes and aftershocks in the region following the 2010 M7.1 Darfield. New&lt;br/&gt;Zealand's GNS Science describe it as "technically an aftershock" of the earlier event while other&lt;br/&gt;seismologists from USA and Australia consider it a separate event, given its location on a separate fault&lt;br/&gt;system. Seismologically, this M6.3 quake is classed as an aftershock because of its relationship to the&lt;br/&gt;ongoing activity since September last year. However, it has generated a significant series of its own&lt;br/&gt;aftershocks, many of which are considered big for a M6.3 earthquake. Over 200 aftershocks including a&lt;br/&gt;M5.7 were experienced in the first week. It did not occur on the Greendale Fault, on which the 2010 M7.1&lt;br/&gt;Darfield quake occurred, but on a previously unknown blind fault line running 17 km east-west south of&lt;br/&gt;Christchurch, at depths of 3?12 km. On the contrary, precise aftershock relocations suggest that at least&lt;br/&gt;two north-east/south-west trending faults lie between the two and that there is no evidence from the&lt;br/&gt;earthquake data of an extension of the Greendale Fault. However, there are still many aftershocks of the&lt;br/&gt;2010 M7.1 Darfield earthquake spread along the fault line of the 2011 M6.3 Christchurch earthquake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to document the complicated subsurface structure of the damage zones caused by the&lt;br/&gt;sequence of the 2010 M7.1 Darfield and the 2011 M6.3 Christchurch earthquakes in the Canterbury&lt;br/&gt;region of NZ?s South Island, the investigator proposes to record fault-zone trapped waves (FZTWs) generated by&lt;br/&gt;aftershocks, and use the FZTWs to image the rupture zones composed by damaged fault rocks at&lt;br/&gt;seismogenic depths. Because the amplitude and dispersive feature of FZTWs are sensitive to the&lt;br/&gt;geometry and physical properties, and the location of aftershocks (within or outside) of the low-velocity&lt;br/&gt;fault-zone waveguide formed by severely damaged rocks in these two earthquakes, observations and&lt;br/&gt;numerical modeling of recorded FZTWs allow us to learn more about (1) the width, velocity reduction, Q&lt;br/&gt;value and depth extension of damage zones of the 2010 M7.2 and 2011 M6.3 earthquakes, (2) the shape&lt;br/&gt;of subsurface rupture zones with the principal slip plans of the mainshocks, and if the two rupture&lt;br/&gt;segments are connected at seismogenic depths, (3) the difference in rock damage magnitude caused by&lt;br/&gt;these two earthquakes occurring at different depths with different sizes, (4) the fault healing with time&lt;br/&gt;after the mainshock.This RAMP experiment will be collaborated by USC/UoA /UoC/GNS in NZ to pursue the value of&lt;br/&gt;the work proposed, likewise with the ongoing efforts by the NZ national GEONET seismic network and&lt;br/&gt;researchers. GNS will offer to follow the USC/UoA/UoC work and help them keep up with other&lt;br/&gt;initiatives and projects concerning the Darfield event.</AbstractNarration>
