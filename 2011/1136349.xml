    <AbstractNarration>The proposed collaborative research will build on computational models developed by S. Ghosh (principal investigator, OSU) and R. Ghanem (co-principal investigator, USC) to develop an integrated computational system for probability based multi-scale model (PMM) of ductile fracture in lightweight metals and alloys with precipitates and inclusions. It will incorporate (a) a probabilistic multi-scale pre-processor consisting of a multi-scale image builder and morphology based domain partitioning; (b) image based microstructural Voronoi Cell finite element model for accurate, high resolution analysis and probabilistic characterization of plastic deformation, strain localization and ductile fracture; (c) stochastic homogenization based continuum plasticity-damage model for macroscopic analysis in the multi-scale material model. The PMM simulator will help in the development of light alloy components with optimal material microstructures for superior failure properties such as ductility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major materials, automotive and aerospace industries will benefit significantly from the comprehension and flexibility of this computational system in handling a variety of problems for different materials, loading and geometric constructs. Specifically the research will aid the materials industry, to leapfrog present technology and use these lightweight alloys in new safety-critical applications. Graduate students at two institutions will work together with researchers at Ford Research Laboratory to develop significant interdisciplinary expertise and industrial exposure. This interaction will provide a well-rounded education as students train to enter the technical workforce. New courses in Stochastic Material Modeling and Multiscale Analysis will be developed. The PI?s will organize workshops at respective universities to introduce students and industrial partners to this novel area of research.</AbstractNarration>
