    <AbstractNarration>The scientists and engineers of the University of North Dakota (UND) Sustainable Energy Research Initiative and Supporting Education Group (SUNRISE), a faculty organized, student-centered research group located in the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering departments at UND, will continue hosting an REU site based on chemistry-focused undergraduate research that contributes to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies. As the number of issues related to energy proliferates, the next generation of scientists and engineers will be required to understand, develop, and improve sustainable energy technologies. For three years, a 10-week summer program will be implemented where nine NSF-funded students conduct research in biofuels, wind energy, solar energy, clean coal, and fuel cells. SUNRISE is committed to training individuals who will develop innovative solutions to these problems and who can speak to the impact of these issues to diverse populations. Native American and Hispanic students comprising a significant fraction of each REU cohort will be recruited using bridge programs. Weekly sessions will be dedicated to improving students' communication skills; four weekly sessions will focus heavily on motivating students to think about the ethical impacts of their actions and instilling in them the desire to make the right decisions in ethical situations. A major goal of this program is to foster team work, promote the continued interest in research, and encourage professional development in the student participants while they are making a real contribution to chemical research.</AbstractNarration>
