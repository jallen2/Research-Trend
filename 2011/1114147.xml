    <AbstractNarration>The mechanical behavior of large faults is controlled by thermal, chemical, and hydraulic factors,&lt;br/&gt;as well as each fault's intrinsic structure and the ambient stresses. Understanding what conditions&lt;br/&gt;prevail within the interiors of active faults is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms governing&lt;br/&gt;long-term fault evolution and, in particular, the earthquake rupture process. This project involves&lt;br/&gt;a detailed study of microearthquakes and crustal structure within and surrounding the Alpine&lt;br/&gt;Fault, South Island, New Zealand, around the Whataroa fault zone drilling site. It will be carried&lt;br/&gt;out close collaboration with a team of New Zealand scientists. The key scientific issues to be&lt;br/&gt;addressed by this research project include: (1) determining the geometry of the AF to mid-crustal&lt;br/&gt;depths and the depth to the base of the seismogenic zone, (2) determining focal mechanisms and&lt;br/&gt;estimating principal stress orientations, (3) seismic imaging of crustal structure using multiple&lt;br/&gt;methods, and (4) searching for possible nonvolcanic tremor (NVT). Our project is designed to&lt;br/&gt;test a number of hypotheses, including: (1) that the complexity of the surface fault trace does not&lt;br/&gt;reflect the fault trace at depth, rather the partitioning seen at the surface merges into a throughgoing&lt;br/&gt;fault with oblique slip in the upper crust; (2) that the depth to the base of the seismogenic&lt;br/&gt;zone is elevated to 15 km, or perhaps shallower, on the AF beneath the Whataroa area; (3) that&lt;br/&gt;the AF dip remains close to 50° to the base of the seismogenic zone; (4) that principal stress&lt;br/&gt;orientations do not vary with distance from the AF; (5) that the relatively low velocity zone&lt;br/&gt;imaged at large scale through much of the crust along the SIGHT transects is actually a narrower&lt;br/&gt;zone closer to the AF, similar to the resistivity model; (6) that NVT is not present beneath the&lt;br/&gt;AF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to examine the structure and microearthquake characteristics of a&lt;br/&gt;major active continental fault, the Alpine Fault, South Island, New Zealand. The Alpine Fault is&lt;br/&gt;late in its earthquake cycle and is the focus of a long-term, multidisciplinary scientific&lt;br/&gt;investigation. In this project, we will carry out seismic field work and subsequent analyses of&lt;br/&gt;microearthquakes associated with the Alpine Fault. The research will be conducted in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with an ambitious fault zone drilling project focused on the mechanical properties of&lt;br/&gt;the Alpine Fault and the adjacent crust. Their work will help (1) define the geometry of the fault&lt;br/&gt;at depth, (2) determine the depth range of seismic activity (the "seismogenic zone"), (3) establish&lt;br/&gt;a three-dimensional structural context for interpreting borehole observations and core, and (4)&lt;br/&gt;potentially help to define rupture zones of shallow earthquakes as future drilling targets.</AbstractNarration>
