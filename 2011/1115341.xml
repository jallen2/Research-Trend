    <AbstractNarration>Thermal fluctuations in non-equilibrium systems exhibit remarkable&lt;br/&gt;behavior compared to equilibrium systems. Giant fluctuations in&lt;br/&gt;binary mixtures of miscible fluids have been observed, including&lt;br/&gt;in recent experiments in microgravity. Novel mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational challenges need to be addressed in order to include&lt;br/&gt;thermal fluctuations in traditional computational fluid dynamics in&lt;br/&gt;a way that is consistent with statistical mechanics. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;is concerned with the design, mathematical analysis, and computer&lt;br/&gt;implementation of finite-volume methods for fluctuating hydrodynamics&lt;br/&gt;of fluid mixtures, as well as applications to diffusively mixing&lt;br/&gt;fluids in gravity. The following research directions are proposed:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Multi-resolution numerical schemes for solving the compressible&lt;br/&gt;stochastic continuum equations; (2) Algorithms for incompressible,&lt;br/&gt;and (3) low Mach fluctuating hydrodynamics of miscible mixtures on&lt;br/&gt;staggered and collocated grids; (4) Simulations of giant fluctuations&lt;br/&gt;and comparisons to experiments; (5) Study of the contribution&lt;br/&gt;of advection by velocity fluctuations to transport in finite&lt;br/&gt;non-equilibrium systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flows at micro and nano scales typical of new devices and biological&lt;br/&gt;systems are affected by thermal fluctuations. These effects are often&lt;br/&gt;assumed small and are not included in traditional computational&lt;br/&gt;fluid dynamics. However, giant fluctuations in the concentration&lt;br/&gt;of a polymer solution have been observed in recent experiments&lt;br/&gt;conducted in microgravity on a research space shuttle. Computer&lt;br/&gt;simulations are ideally suited for studying the details of this&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon and comparing the predictions of existing theory to&lt;br/&gt;the experimental findings. However, our community still lacks&lt;br/&gt;the appropriate computational tools, including both algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;large-scale parallel codes, to attack this problem. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;and his colleagues will develop such tools and use them to answer&lt;br/&gt;important scientific questions concerning fluctuations in fluids, in&lt;br/&gt;close collaboration with experimentalists. The developed algorithms&lt;br/&gt;will be implemented in a public domain code whose development is funded&lt;br/&gt;through a Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation NSF grant.</AbstractNarration>
