    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a stretchy, disposable, textile glove intended to prevent cross-contamination with 3-log reduction against bio-pathogens in under 90 seconds. Its chlorine coating lasts for three days and unlike nitrile, latex, and vinyl gloves, is breathable, reducing dermatitis associated with continual barrier glove use. Currently antiseptic test standards for textiles, hand wash and hand rubs, AATCC TM-100, BS EN 1499 and EN 1500 are inadequate to accurately evaluate project's goal of 3-log reduction in 30-90 seconds. We developed a new protocol appropriate to these faster times and that specifically measures contact transfer - the Contact Transfer Test Protocol - that measures cross-contaminating efficacy in seconds. This new protocol can be used in the evaluation of other biocidal systems aiming for short pathogen kill speeds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is an innovation in the field of cross-contamination control. While other attempts to make a self-decontaminating fabric have been made, their 3-log kill times are much longer than the 30-90 second goal of the BioTecT Glove. The new BioTecT Glove represents a significant contribution to the field of pathogen control, such as Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA) and Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) that persist even where strong hand antiseptic and barrier glove programs are in place. While the largest demand for the introduction of an innovative solution intended to decrease the number of facility acquired infections (FAIs) may be in the healthcare field, many other markets such as hospitality facilities, the janitorial field, and correctional institutions can also benefit greatly from this technology. From a financial perspective, the cost of an infectious outbreak to a healthcare facility can be catastrophic. Moreover, the socio-political consequences and the impact on a facility's reputation can create long-term negative impressions that may remain in the public's conscience for extended periods of time. As a rapid, self-decontaminating garment, the BioTecT Glove provides an active, innovative solution to this common and serious problem in an affordable, easy-to-use, and effective manner.</AbstractNarration>
