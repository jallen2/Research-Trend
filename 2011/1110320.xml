    <AbstractNarration>Animals interact with a variety of microorganims and these interactions range from harmful to beneficial. One of the most important beneficial relationships is that between cnidarians (e.g., corals and sea anemones) and single-celled algae that live within cnidarian tissues. It is this relationship that enables coral reefs to thrive and to provide a number of ecosystem services. The stability of this relationship likely involves the interplay between the cnidarian immune response and the algal symbiont. However, we have a poor understanding of cnidarian immunity. The proposed research employs microarrays, a tool for looking at the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously, to characterize the immunological ?tool kit? of cnidarians and to determine how this ?tool kit? interacts with both harmful and beneficial microorganisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because cnidarians are relatively simple animals, this study will provide insight into the development of animal immune systems and the subsequent changes that allowed for more complex responses. This study will leverage a vast literature on interactions between animal cells and parasitic protozoans, like those that cause malaria, to initiate a comparative exploration of the parallels and novelties of beneficial and harmful interactions. This research will also enable a better understanding of coral bleaching and disease, both of which are responsible for substantial coral reef decline. Finally, this research will support undergraduate training and a number of outreach programs catering to local middle-school students, undergraduates, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
