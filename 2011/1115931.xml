    <AbstractNarration>The unifying theme of this project is the development and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods for high-dimensional diffusion problems. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the research will be focused in two areas, namely solving&lt;br/&gt;boundary value problems to the heat equation in three dimensions using&lt;br/&gt;thermal layer potentials. The second issue is the computation of the&lt;br/&gt;discrete Gauss transform for data sets in many dimensions. Both&lt;br/&gt;topics involve computations with integral operators that have a Gauss&lt;br/&gt;kernel. Since these operators are non-local, naive algorithms scale&lt;br/&gt;quadratically in the number of data points. Realistic problems can&lt;br/&gt;involve enormous data sets and are therefore tractable only if fast&lt;br/&gt;methods, that exploit certain analytic properties of the kernel, are&lt;br/&gt;applied. This project will employ high-order Nystrom techniques that&lt;br/&gt;are combined with Chebyshev and exponential expansions for the rapid&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of integral operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to solve the heat equation efficiently is fundamental in&lt;br/&gt;many applications of science, technology and medicine. For instance,&lt;br/&gt;heat conduction plays an important role in the modeling of geothermal&lt;br/&gt;systems, melting, welding, and in thermography as a means to detect&lt;br/&gt;breast cancer. Often, the task is to identify an unknown heat source&lt;br/&gt;from known surface temperatures and fluxes. The solution of such&lt;br/&gt;inverse problems involves solving the forward problem many times,&lt;br/&gt;therefore speed is essential for numerical methods. The discrete&lt;br/&gt;Gauss transform is used to find relations in large data sets. This can&lt;br/&gt;be patterns, correlations, or accumulations in images, texts, or&lt;br/&gt;internet traffic. Concrete applications are, for instance, machine&lt;br/&gt;recognition of faces, voices and handwriting. By engaging a graduate&lt;br/&gt;as well as undergraduate students in research, the proposed activities&lt;br/&gt;will also contribute to excellence and growth in the education of the&lt;br/&gt;future workforce.</AbstractNarration>
