    <AbstractNarration>Despite widespread interest in aggressiveness, the genes, experiences, and evolutionary forces contributing to individual differences in aggression remain mysterious. Clearly, genes and social experience both contribute to aggressiveness; but, increasingly, researchers are aware that genetic and social environmental influences on behavior may be connected. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are an ideal system for addressing questions about individual differences because multiple, natural individuals with a particular set of genes can be grown repeatedly in the lab. Using a design similar to studies of identical twins, experimenters can thereby untangle the effects of genes and experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will determine whether individuals with genes that make them more aggressive also have different social experiences. Preliminary data suggests that more aggressive flies are more likely to be socially isolated than non-aggressive flies -causing aggressive flies to become even more aggressive, and non-aggressive flies to remain non-aggressive. This type of positive feedback may explain why individuals in many species show the animal analog of personalities -that is, long-lasting individual differences in behavior. The interaction between heritable behavioral types and situation choice can be critical for many questions in many systems. For example, there is evidence that humans with a hereditary predisposition to certain mental illnesses -including alcoholism and schizophrenia-are at greater risk of illness because they experience risky environments. These hypotheses are impossible to directly test in humans, where systematic manipulation of genotype and environment are not feasible. Thus, work on Drosophila will allow researchers to test and refine these theories, and thus guide future research. Finally, Drosophila behavioral research provides an ideal entrée for undergraduates interested in research experiments. The PIs will involve undergraduates in every stage of the research, requiring students to read papers from the scientific literature and working with them to contribute their own ideas to the project.</AbstractNarration>
