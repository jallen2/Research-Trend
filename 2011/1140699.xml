    <AbstractNarration>In this collaborative project Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the University of Massachusetts at Boston are joining forces to provide undergraduate students with experience in computational modeling, simulation, and systems approaches to biology. Using StarLogoTNG software, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, students can represent various levels of biological organization from molecules to cells or even organisms. They can define the rules anticipated to govern the behavior of the designated agents and compare the simulated behavior to that observed experimentally. The closeness of fit estimates the accuracy of the definition of the rules. Through hypothesis testing and successive refinement of the simulation, the important rules are revealed. This hands-on, team-project-oriented approach not only immerses students in engaging learning but also provides an appreciation for the value of mathematics and computational modeling in understanding biology. Ongoing evaluation measures how successful these strategies are at influencing student learning in both a small, private, technological institution and a large public university. Widespread dissemination is anticipated.</AbstractNarration>
