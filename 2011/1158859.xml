    <AbstractNarration>The PI and the organizers are holding the "Variational and Topological Methods: Theory, Applications, Numerical Simulations, and Open Problems" conference during June 6-9, 2012, at Northern Arizona University (NAU) in Flagstaff, AZ. This conference covers topics in variational and topological methods for nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDE), with two special emphasis sessions, in singular problems and in numerical simulations for nuclear physics. The scope of the conference will be fairly wide, to include theory, applications, and scientific computations, with emphasis on the two special session areas. The principal speakers, Monica Clapp (Instituto de Matemáticas, UNAM, Mexico), Pavel Drábek (Univerzita v Plzni, Czech Republic), Jacques Giacomoni (Université de Pau, France), Jean-Michel Rakotoson (Université de Poitiers, France) and Peter Takáè (Universität Rostock, Germany) have all committed to giving a series of keynote lectures. This format was beneficial to researchers at all levels attending the previous two conferences organized with the support of NSF in 2002 and 2007 in NAU. The conference website is http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jmn3/var12/var12.html. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support to eligible participants, with priority given to underrepresented mathematicians, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty. One of the goals of the conference organizers is to encourage young researchers by providing them an opportunity to listen to and interact with experts. It is a theme that there will be time in the schedule to allow this discussion, to include open problems for potential new research areas of mathematics that feature a blend of the analysis, scientific application, and numerical solution of the key relevant equations of our subject.</AbstractNarration>
