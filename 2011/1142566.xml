    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use waste methane gas&lt;br/&gt;(biogas) as a feedstock to produce pellets of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a valuable&lt;br/&gt;polymer that is converted into a variety of eco-friendly plastic products such as&lt;br/&gt;children?s toys, electronic casings, water bottles, and food packaging. The current&lt;br/&gt;plastics market is dominated by traditional petroleum-derived, non-biodegradable,&lt;br/&gt;energy-intensive plastics. Alternative plastics are derived from rapidly renewable&lt;br/&gt;biological resources (biobased) and consumed by microbes when no longer needed&lt;br/&gt;(biodegradable). Unfortunately, these alternative plastics are often costly and energyintensive&lt;br/&gt;to produce. The company has a novel, energy-efficient method to produce a&lt;br/&gt;biodegradable, biobased plastic at a cost competitive with petroleum-based plastics.&lt;br/&gt;Phase I will assess the feasibility of this novel process for full-scale commercial&lt;br/&gt;production using biogas from a wastewater treatment plant. The main objective is to&lt;br/&gt;achieve stable-operation and increased bioplastic production through optimization of&lt;br/&gt;parameters including biological yields, rates, and costs at the Phase I scale. This&lt;br/&gt;optimization will result in the production of bioplastic from waste biogas at a price&lt;br/&gt;competitive with petroleum-based plastics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will ultimately be the widespread&lt;br/&gt;production of low-cost bioplastics from waste biogas and the eventual displacement of&lt;br/&gt;petroleum-based plastics. Bioplastics have the potential to capture an increasing&lt;br/&gt;fraction of the plastics market, thereby giving consumers the choice to purchase&lt;br/&gt;affordable, environmentally friendly, bioplastic-based products. When bioplastic&lt;br/&gt;products produced by the company are disposed in modern wastewater treatment&lt;br/&gt;plants or landfills, they biodegrade anaerobically (without oxygen) to methane. This&lt;br/&gt;methane can be cycled back and reenter the process as feedstock to produce more&lt;br/&gt;PHA. Thus, the life cycle may be closed, creating a ?cradle to cradle? system. This use&lt;br/&gt;of biogas will provide a strong economic incentive for facilities to capture their methane,&lt;br/&gt;rather than releasing or flaring it, which will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and&lt;br/&gt;reduce corresponding impacts on global warming. The innovation will enhance scientific&lt;br/&gt;understanding by studying the production of bioplastic from waste biogas and by&lt;br/&gt;characterizing the microbial species responsible for this conversion. This project&lt;br/&gt;represents one of the first times that waste biogas will be used commercially to feed a&lt;br/&gt;community of bacteria to produce a valuable product.</AbstractNarration>
