    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 2011 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference (CSHL) on Eukaryotic DNA Replication and Genome Maintenance will be held September 1-5, 2011 at the Cold Spring Harbor Lab in Cold Spring Harbor, NY. The meeting has been held every second year since September 1987. This meeting is the only regularly occurring meeting that is exclusively focused on eukaryotic DNA replication. The specific aims for the 2011 meeting include: 1) promote collaboration and bring together scientists interested in all areas of eukaryotic DNA replication and genome surveillance and maintenance, 2) foster discussion for participants in new areas in the field; and 3) provide attendees an opportunity to present data. The meeting will include eight plenary sessions, with each presentation being fifteen minutes long. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;CSHL has an established record of ensuring there is a balance of young scientists and established scientists. Young scientists are encouraged to present at the meetings. In addition, CSHL seeks to ensure underrepresented groups are given equal representation at the meetings. The CSHL meetings and programs are announced via channels that would certainly target underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
