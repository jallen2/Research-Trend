    <AbstractNarration>This enhanced renewal S-STEM project is awarding 64 scholarships to academically talented STEM students (in all majors) with financial need. The objectives of the project are: 1) decreasing student reliance on loans and full-time work 2) increasing the graduation rate of the Scholars compared to the graduation rate of other students in STEM disciplines who are not receiving scholarship support; 3) improving the educational support system by providing cohort activities, academic support services, research projects, STEM internships, and mentoring; 4) increasing the number of students entering the STEM workforce or graduate school; 5) widening the pipeline to STEM programs via outreach to local schools and in-reach to CSU freshmen; 6) increasing access to education to underrepresented minorities and first generation students. Recruitment, selection, and career placement are the responsibility of a faculty committee with the support of an industrial/community advisory board. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the expected increased understanding of how to best engage underrepresented minorities and first generation college students in obtaining a baccalaureate in a STEM field. The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are extensive academic support activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this activity is directly related to providing better systems of support and cultivation of untapped natural resources within their communities: human capital unrealized. Many underrepresented minority and first generation students are very talented but face many barriers that impede their success. The project is enabling these students to complete a STEM major and enter the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
