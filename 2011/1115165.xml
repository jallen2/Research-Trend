    <AbstractNarration>The fifth Mathematical Field of Dreams Conference will be held at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona on October 14-16, 2011 with the support of the National Science Foundation. The goal of this project/conference is to inspire and facilitate the access of students underrepresented in quantitative disciplines, to doctoral programs in the mathematical sciences while providing a forum where the knowledge and information that facilitates the selection of and application to relevant graduate programs is provided. The Field of Dreams Conference is one of the principal activities of the National Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences (http://www.mathalliance.org/), a conglomerate of colleges and universities dedicated to encouraging and supporting students seeking doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. As with previous Field of Dreams Conferences, the 2011 meeting will allow students to identify opportunities for graduate study in mathematics, applied mathematics, computational biology, statistics, biostatistics and bioinformatics, mathematics education, and others. Participants will include approximately 100 undergraduate students recruited nationwide from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences, 30 undergraduate mentors, and at least 22 faculty members from the National Alliance graduate programs. Priority for support will be given to students from minority-serving institutions that lack extensive resources and programs in the mathematical sciences, or related research programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US Department of Labor reports that jobs for mathematicians are expected to increase more than 20% from 2008 to 2018. http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos043.htm Further, "Ph.D. holders with a strong background in mathematics and another discipline ? and who apply mathematical theory to real world problems will have the best job prospects" (Ibid.) There is a shortage of U.S. citizen and permanent residents applying to doctoral programs in the mathematical sciences; the situation is worse for students from U.S. underrepresented minority groups. The Field of Dreams Conference introduces underrepresented undergraduates and their faculty mentors to relevant, exciting, and important research in mathematical sciences and/or to scientific research programs that required the participation of students with strong quantitative/computational training. The Field of Dreams Conference provides students with the knowledge and tools required to apply for doctoral studies in the mathematical sciences. At the Field of Dreams Conference students will have the opportunity to meet and interact with faculty, graduate students, and other undergraduates doing quantitative scientific research. Students will be encouraged to apply to graduate school and their faculty mentors will be provided with information that they may disseminate at their home institution. Therefore, doctoral studies in the mathematical sciences information will spread beyond the conference throughout National Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences (http://www.mathalliance.org/). The participation of both undergraduate mentors and graduate faculty from the Alliance facilitates (i) the transition from undergraduate to graduate programs and (ii) the establishment of partnerships (research, curricular development and coordination). The Field of Dreams Conference will continue to be an important driving force in increasing the number of underrepresented U.S. students obtaining doctoral degrees in mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
