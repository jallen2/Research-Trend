    <AbstractNarration>This research project aims to identify the related material processing parameters, feasibility of scaling up CNT coated filler production to create relatively large samples and develop/extend suitable mechanical characterization methods to study the behavior of the composites under static and dynamic loading conditions. Creation and characterization of novel, cost-effective, lightweight, structured, particle-filled polymer foams is the primary goal of this research. The resulting composites based on microwave radiation could offer hierarchical materials where carbon nanotubes (CNT) grown directly on hollow microfillers improve the ability of the filler to anchor to the matrix by enhancing tensile/fracture characteristics without compromising the compression properties, circumventing agglomeration effects, and/or improving electrical characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, it is conceivable that a new class of engineered particulate composites can be introduced based on this research. Multifunctional lightweight structural foams and composites are of great value in a variety of engineering applications including aerospace, transportation and marine industries. Additional societal benefits of the proposed research include education of graduate students in multidisciplinary areas of processing and characterization of materials. Students from underrepresented groups will be attracted to this research through existing on-campus programs at Auburn. Also K-12 outreach resources will be utilized to expose students to aspects of microscopy and mechanical testing. A display will be presented during graduate recruitment events to attract domestic students to engineering programs at Auburn. The findings of the research will be disseminated through topical symposia as well as archival publications.</AbstractNarration>
