    <AbstractNarration>Géométrie Algébrique en Liberté, also known as GAeL, is an annual workshop organized by and for young algebraic geometers. It gives these young mathematicians an opportunity to explore concepts from algebraic geometry they are not yet familiar with, discuss recent developments in their subspecialities, and present their work to their colleagues. The upcoming 19th edition of GAeL will take place in Berlin, Germany from July 18th until July 22nd. All participants give talks or present posters. Participant talks will be supplemented by short courses on the topics of Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants, the minimal model program, and theta characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop provides a unique opportunity for young mathematicians to present research to their peers and experts as well as widen their mathematical horizons through the short courses. Support from the National Science Foundation will cover the costs of up to &amp;#64257;ve US-based participants each year for the next three years. The other participants come from a wide range of countries, and the communications and collaborations started at GAeL will serve to strengthen ties between young researchers in the US and their international peers.</AbstractNarration>
