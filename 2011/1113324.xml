    <AbstractNarration>This grant will partially fund a workshop titled: Workshop on Communicating STEM through STEM Education in Hawaii. The funds provided in this award will be used exclusively to pay for the participation of undergraduate and graduate students in this workshop. The primary goals of the workshop are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Improve the communication skills of students and early-career scientists and engineers&lt;br/&gt;* Improve the understanding of how improvements to high school and college science curricula can help advance diverse students into STEM careers&lt;br/&gt;* Make connections between students and the technology industry on Maui&lt;br/&gt;* Enhance the participation of local students into the Akamai Workforce Initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student participants will attend two seminars on effective communication and then present a poster using the methods of communication they learned in the seminars. The posters will be presented at the Maui Science and Technology Education Exchange meeting. After the workshop and poster presentations the students will write-up their projects and those project summaries will be included on a web page and in a published booklet. This workshop will concentrate on the theme of 'workforce development', especially as related to the astronomy research that is conducted on Maui and the island of Hawaii.</AbstractNarration>
