    <AbstractNarration>The project focuses on multi-frequency phenomena arising in biological, electrical and mechanical oscillatory systems with or without damping. It consists of two separate but closely related parts: 1. Quasi-periodic and weakly quasi-periodic motions; 2. Biological oscillations and complexities. Part 1 of the project aims at the study of the existence, stability, and mechanism for both regular and irregular multifrequency oscillations in properly degenerate Hamiltonian systems, Poisson-Hamilton systems, and Hamiltonian networks. Part 2 of the project is devoted to the study of biological oscillations and complexity in bio-chemical reaction systems and bio-networks, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, with respect to issues such as stransient oscillations, stochastic oscillations, stability of invariant measures, and the connections among degeneracy, robustness, and system complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on multi-frequency phenomena in nature especially those arising in biological, electrical, and mechanical systems. It is predicted by many experiments and computer simulations that physical systems involving multi-frequency can produce many complex dynamical outcomes oscillating in multiple phases. But the mechanism of such complexity is far from well-understood, especially when ambient noise is present. In the project, the PI plans to develop a mathematical theory towards a fundamental understanding of such complexity.</AbstractNarration>
