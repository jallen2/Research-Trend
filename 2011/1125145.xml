    <AbstractNarration>PI: Hicks, Jason&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1125145&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological advancement in the area of energy production from sources other than fossil fuels is a critical need facing the world. As such, this topic is of great interest to students and scientists from all segments of society. One attractive alternative energy technology is biofuels derived from biomass, but the most important aspect currently missing in the quest to generate economical, stable, useable biofuels is the development of highly active and selective heterogeneous catalysts.1, 2 The experimental focus of this proposal is the determination of the mechanisms for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-based model compounds using novel supported bimetallic FeMo phosphide catalysts for use in advanced biofuels processes using a detailed experimental approach. Once the reaction mechanisms are clearly determined, catalyst synthesis can be tailored to maximize activity and selectivity for use in next-generation biofuels processes. Pyrolysis GC/MS experiments with an in-line catalytic reactor to upgrade the vapor phase product and batch reactions in a stirred vessel to compare vapor phase upgrading and liquid phase upgrading will be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Ultimately, the results of this proposal will provide evidence of lignin upgrading to fuels for potential industrial scale operation. This work will expand existing lignin HDO understanding from studies on simple, substituted phenol compounds to more complex lignin-based model compounds, for which studies are lacking. In addition, we will synthesize and characterize new bimetallic catalytic materials for HDO of lignin-based compounds. This work will significantly advance the understanding of this process by providing key fundamental information on the reaction mechanisms, which will subsequently lead to better catalytic processes for biofuels production. In addition to biofuels production, this knowledge could be used to increase fundamental understanding of specialty chemicals syntheses from lignin-based resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Advancement toward the effective use of biomass as a resource for energy production will move society closer to the goal of meeting the world?s energy needs in a sustainable manner. The determination of the foundational knowledge of reaction mechanisms will enable the creation of new catalysts with high selectivity towards biomass liquefaction and deoxygenation, which will expedite biofuels- usability. Through membership in the Notre Dame Energy Center and Sustainable Energy Initiative, the results from this proposal will be disseminated across a wide audience. The annual Energy Week at Notre Dame is an opportunity to present research solutions to energy problems to groups across campus as well as alumni and the local community. Targeting this broad audience spurs student inquiry, attracts student researchers, and increases public awareness and knowledge of energy research at Notre Dame and energy issues in general. Also, the results obtained from this BRIGE proposal will be incorporated into current and future graduate/undergraduate courses, and specifically into a special topic in catalysis course that is currently being designed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening Participation: This proposal seeks to integrate research in energy, biofuels, and catalysis with educational efforts targeted at high school groups in the community at large and female undergraduates from St. Mary's College, specifically seeking to mentor underrepresented students. A "Catalysis and Biofuels" laboratory open house day will be held every year for local high school students to spend a day in the lab assisting with biofuels experiments and learning about energy issues and research. In addition, female undergraduates from St. Mary's College will be recruited to conduct research in the PI's lab as part of the dual degree program offered with the University of Notre Dame. Lastly, diversity will be modeled in our research group and will be a key goal of the PI?s group over the coming years.</AbstractNarration>
