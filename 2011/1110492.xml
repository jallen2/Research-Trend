    <AbstractNarration>The helmet orchid genus Corybas contains about 140 species with exquisitely complex flowers, distributed from Asia to Australia and other parts of the southwest Pacific basin. Corybas has been poorly studied due to their small size and the large number of species in tropical montane forests. The goals of this project are to use DNA variation from a broad sample of species to examine relationships within Corybas; to reconstruct the historical timing and geographic patterns of distributional changes and species diversification; and to examine the frequency and ecological context for changes in flower structure. One group of closely related species in Australia will be studied in detail to investigate these questions on a finer scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will result in the discovery and description of new species, in development of a revised classification, and in helping set conservation priorities by quantifying patterns of genetic uniqueness and diversity. The results will provide an important context for future studies on the ecology of individual species, and will further our understanding of historical biogeography and speciation. This project involves substantial collaboration with foreign researchers, including several in developing countries, and will contribute to the professional development of scientists in these regions.</AbstractNarration>
