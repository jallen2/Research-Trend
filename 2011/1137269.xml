    <AbstractNarration>This NSF award by the Office of Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation supports work to understand how dynamic signaling and cell fate decision circuits in individual cells give rise to multicellular system-level behaviors such as developmental pattern formation and how perturbations to these circuits lead to undesirable consequences such as cancer. These questions will be addressed using three integrated methods: (a) Physical devices for tracking stem cell behaviors in a physiologically relevant environment; (b) Mathematical modeling of cell fate decision circuits; and (c) Engineering of synthetic genetic circuits capable of elucidating fundamental design principles.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The team will study the role of intercellular Notch signaling in intestinal colon crypt formation and colorectal tumorigenesis. In Goal 1, an integrated platform including in vitro microscale devices and in vivo mouse homing models will be developed to track signaling dynamics and cell fate decisions in a physiologically realistic environment. In Goal 2, signaling dynamics will be characterized to develop mathematical models of pattern formations in colon crypts. These models will help interpret experimental data and predict perturbation results. In Goal 3, synthetic circuits based on Notch signaling and bacterial quorum sensing components will be implemented in colon cancer stem cells to form de novo patterns, which will be tested using the integrated platform from Goal 1.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;This work will have three main broader impacts: (a) facilitating biomedical applications, (b) generating broadly useful tools for the exploration of multicellular patterning systems, and (c) direct impacts on science education through specific activities of the principal investigators and other team members.&lt;br/&gt;Facilitating development of therapeutics. The model system, colon cancer stem cells, is resistant to conventional chemotherapies. Developing effective therapeutics that specifically target cancer stem cells without damaging normal stem cells will require a deeper understanding of the underlying circuits that control self-renewal, differentiation and homeostasis in normal and cancer stem cells.&lt;br/&gt;Tools for understanding differentiation and patterning. The physical devices developed here can be further developed into high throughput drug screening platforms; the synthetic constructs can be used to study signaling mechanisms in diverse cell types; and the mouse homing models enable in vivo studies of human colon stem cells and CRC tumorigenesis.&lt;br/&gt;Educational activity. Using materials from the proposed study, the PIs will work together to teach synthetic biology and mathematical modeling for mammalian systems in systems and synthetic biology courses. The materials will also be included in a synthetic biology textbook in development. The proposed project will be used as an example for K-12 outreach lectures. Finally, simplified versions of the physical devices and the mathematical model from this project will be used as teaching tools for the CURIE Academy, which is a one-week summer residential program focused on creating an interactive atmosphere to engage female high school students in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
