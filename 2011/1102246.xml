    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to create topological integrated optomechanics to enable transformational solutions to current limitations in high confinement photonic integrated circuits. The approach is based on the realization of three-dimensional optical waveguides that guide light out-of-plane. The comprehensive research program involves design, fabrication, and test. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Three-dimensional photonic integrated circuits will harness phenomena of purely topological origin to create broadband polarization transparent photonic integrated circuits. Out-of-plane optical waveguides will also be developed to realize broadband and low loss fiber-to-chip and vertical chip-to-chip couplers. Broadband coupling and direct access to devices on an entire chip surface without dicing or cleaving the chip are enabled. Tunable, broadband, polarization transparent, and compact system architectures involving high speed transport of data between and within photonic integrated circuits are envisioned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The universality of topological phenomena enables the development of optical laboratory experiments with results that may be extrapolated to a variety of physical systems where laboratory experiments are economically unfeasible. The research concept extends to applications in future high performance optical networks, all-optical switching, and optical logic computing. The program responds to the challenge of preparing science and engineering students to be successful in an increasingly interdisciplinary and global environment by developing a global scientists and engineers pipeline at Ohio State University. Furthermore, modules will be created for an integrated optics curriculum that engenders integrative research thinking. Finally, undergraduates, minority student, and students from underrepresented groups will be involved in the research program.</AbstractNarration>
