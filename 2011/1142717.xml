    <AbstractNarration>The 2011 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine provides an open, interactive forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary research and education in bioinformatics, computing science and biomedicine, facilitating development of new ideas for bridging gaps. In addition to contributed talks and special publication in top scientific journals, the meeting provides focused workshops, tutorials and posters. BIBM has made a significant effort to engage your researchers in the meeting organization and also provides mentoring activities in the program. In the past BIBM conferences, many authors of accepted papers have requested travel support; a good number of them are handicapped, women and minorities. The committee feels obligated to support these students. The committee would like to provide support for both early career researchers and graduate students, providing both training and broadening the overall scientific impact of the conference.</AbstractNarration>
