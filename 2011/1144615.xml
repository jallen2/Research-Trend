    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the annual Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting (VOTCAM) to be held at Virginia Commonwealth University during the three years 2011-2013. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VOTCAM meetings bring together both experienced and junior researchers, including graduate students, and postdocs to discuss recent work and advances in a variety of areas of Analysis ranging from traditional operator theory, complex analysis and Banach space theory to non-traditional applications such as quantum computing. The goal is to enable students and researchers learn more about the field of analysis outside their own research area while encouraging the participation and professional development of both junior members of the community and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The program consists of talks by a group of speakers carefully chosen to broaden participation among the lecturers. In accordance with the VOTCAM tradition, priority for funding and speaking opportunities will be given to graduate students and other young researchers. These meetings will aid the professional development of junior participants and be events with significant research and training impact.&lt;br/&gt;Conference website is at www.people.vcu.edu/~kbeanland/VOTCAM</AbstractNarration>
