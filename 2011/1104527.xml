    <AbstractNarration>This program is for theoretical research and education for a revolutionary recent idea for quantum computation, known as topological quantum computation (TQC). TQC has been shown to be free of many of the serious problems facing other more conventional means of quantum computation. Although this has been proved as a point of principle in mathematics, suitable platforms to support TQC are yet to be found in nature and this program addresses this issue. In the absence of suitable natural platforms, the PIs will devise practical methods to artificially induce the desired properties for TQC on cold atom systems and semiconductors. They will also develop the appropriate TQC architectures on the considered physical systems and study the fundamental limits on quantum coherence due to thermal and disorder effects in the various TQC platforms. In contrast to other more conventional means of quantum computation, TQC is inherently fault-tolerant and scalable. The studies performed in this program, consisting of TQC platforms, limits on quantum coherence, and suitable computation architectures, will result in TQC being one step closer to experimental realization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will seek to realize synthetic TQC platforms and to design appropriate TQC architectures. A deep theoretical understanding of the fundamental limits of quantum protection in these systems would not only pioneer coherent control of quantum information, but would also influence the basic strongly-correlated atomic and electronic physics in the classroom. The latter has broader impact beyond the field of quantum computation. This research will foster training of graduate students at both Clemson University and Washington State University at the interface of quantum information science, atomic physics, condensed matter physics, and numerical methods. The diverse nature of this training will prepare the students in a multidisciplinary employment market. This research will also help both universities update the physics curriculum to reflect the modern trends in science and technology. Per NSF mission of promoting science and engineering education, these integrated research and education activities will promote the participation of undergraduate and graduate students from the state of Washington and the EPSCoR state of South Carolina in science and technology, and will improve the two states' long-term infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
