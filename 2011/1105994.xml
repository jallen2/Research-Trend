    <AbstractNarration>A program of investigations of generation, storage, and distribution of quantum information, using individual photons and trapped ultra-cold atoms will be continued. Work in our group has previously demonstrated entanglement of spin-wave hyperfine qubits to optical qubits encoded in the polarization, spatial or frequency degrees of freedom of single photons, as well as entanglement of two remote spin-wave qubits. Most recently, quantum memory times have been extended beyond 0.1 seconds and low-noise, high-efficiency wavelength conversion between telecom and storable fields achieved. This opens a path toward long-distance atomic entanglement using light propagation in optical fibers. However to date, the success probability of the entanglement generation protocols in a given trial is always very small, as the light fields contain a large vacuum component. By exploiting the physics of Rydberg atom interactions the success probability will be increased by a factor of up to one thousand, fast, efficient deterministic single photon sources will be created, quantum gates between qubits encoded in trapped ultra-cold atoms implemented, and storage of entangled quantum states with lifetimes in excess of 1 second achieved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity will expedite the development of a new generation of capabilities for creation, distribution and storage of multi-qubit entangled states and contribute to future implementations of long-distance quantum repeaters and distributed quantum computing. Moreover efficient production of multi-qubit entangled states will impact fundamental physics investigations and advance quantum-enhanced technologies. The research will have a significant influence on the future development of quantum information processing, resulting in the development of new tools for light-matter entanglement generation and distribution. The project will involve extensive graduate and undergraduate student training and participation.</AbstractNarration>
