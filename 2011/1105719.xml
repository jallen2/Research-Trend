    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this workshop is to address the complexities of cyberinfrastructure and effective use of technology to increase the productivity and capabilities of the geosciences community. Building on a substantial bibliography of reports from workshops, advisory committees, and government agencies, the focus of this workshop will be in three principle areas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Develop and nurture a community of practice. Identifying and encouraging the use standards in cyberinfrastructure, such as use of SOAs for access and use of data, that will support trans-disciplinary work well into the future (e.g. GIS standards that have been adopted by geosciences researchers). It is recognized that there will be a variety of approaches used by different groups within geosciences. However, these standards, and interoperability among them, will improve over time, if technology history provides any guidance. It is important the geosciences community influence the development of standards that are widely used in more diverse communities. Developing effective methods to influence standards and practices will benefit the geosciences. &lt;br/&gt;2) Address the full lifecycle of data. NSF data policy encourages researchers and educators to share data. The recent implementation of a required data management plan for each project proposal submitted to NSF encourages the community to consider the full lifecycle of data that is generated during a grant. There are several approaches to lifecycle paradigms and adoption of community practices, the choice of technology employed, and the development of partnerships all influence the implementation of the full lifecycle of data. &lt;br/&gt;3) Symbiotic partnerships. Partnerships with Federal agencies, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and industry are essential for the long-term success of the geosciences. Much of the geosciences community supported by NSF depends on data, software, and practices gathered, developed and encouraged by other entities. For example, data provided by USGS, NOAA, and NASA are invaluable in the conduct of many NSF supported research activities. However, the full value of the research community to the agencies and organizations nationally and internationally has yet to be realized because symbiotic interactions have not been developed to their full potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal deliverable from the workshop will be a state-of-the-field report to NSF and the USGS (a co-convener of the workshop) of the geoinformatics community?s capabilities and needs that could in turn ultimately benefit from an academic-multi-agency community-focused set of development activities. Additional deliverables would include: a) readiness assessment and identification of gaps for both technology and education around geo-data informatics and their priorities;;b) grand challenge opportunities as well as immediate next steps; and c) Identification of additional stakeholders and means to include their inputs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this workshop is successful in setting directions for the development of: community cyberinfrastructure practices, a culture of consideration for the lifecycle of data, and paradigms for mutually beneficial partnerships, then the foundation for cross-directorate and trans-disciplinary research will be greatly enhanced.</AbstractNarration>
