    <AbstractNarration>The 2012 Joint Statistical Meetings Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program is a multi-day activity which will take place during the 2012 Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) in San Diego. It will consist of a series of interactive sessions and small group mentoring activities which aim to &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Establish critical mentoring and networking relationships for minority statisticians at early- to mid-career levels (i.e., undergraduate students, graduate students, early statistics professionals);&lt;br/&gt;2. Motivate students to pursue graduate study and careers in statistics;&lt;br/&gt;3. Share best practices for recruiting and mentoring minority students and faculty; and&lt;br/&gt;4. Increase the active participation of minorities in the American Statistical Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the workshop and mentoring program include underrepresented minority graduate students in statistics or biostatistics programs; top minority undergraduates in statistics, mathematics, or related disciplines; minority statisticians in academia, government, and the private sector; key faculty from minority-serving institutions who advise and mentor undergraduates in math or related disciplines; and faculty influential in the faculty and/or student recruitment processes at their home institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is unique in that it does not limit its focus to students only, but also provides opportunities to benefit early career professionals. It is further unique in its holistic approach to career development which allows individuals to participate in the program as both mentor and protégé simultaneously. These elements help create a community of support and accountability for the success of all involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This awarded is supported jointly by the Infrastructure Program and the Statistics Program within the Division of Mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
