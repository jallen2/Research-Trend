    <AbstractNarration>Bryn Mawr College and Purdue University are creating a set of upper level undergraduate course materials in the emerging multidisciplinary area of science of information. Materials and course modules developed during this project lead students to an understanding of the concept of "information" that transcends boundaries between disciplines, especially between physical and life sciences, communication, and knowledge extraction from massive datasets. The course materials ground the study of information in concrete computational models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past six decades have brought information theory to the crossroads of several traditional disciplines: mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, biology, and electrical engineering. A repository of tangible, hands-on course modules is helping students, faculty, and researchers draw upon the latest discoveries from multiple disciplines, replicate recent research, and learn to apply the techniques and tools of information-based inquiry in their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resources and infrastructure of the NSF STC Center for Science of Information (CSoI) are being used to maximize the educational impact of this project, including a focus on increasing diversity, gender and ethnic balance, and broadening of participation. Workshops are being conducted to train faculty in the use of the course materials.</AbstractNarration>
