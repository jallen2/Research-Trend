    <AbstractNarration>The Mw 9 March 11, 2011 Tohoku earthquake, resulting in 25,000 fatalities, was the largest&lt;br/&gt;earthquake to strike Japan in modern times. The failure of long-term forecasts to anticipate an&lt;br/&gt;event of this magnitude is leading to a reevaluation of our scienti c understanding of subduction&lt;br/&gt;zone fault dynamics. At the same time, the enormous Japanese investment in seismic and&lt;br/&gt;geodetic monitoring provides an unprecedented opportunity to study processes leading to giant&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes. The investigators will focus here on two aspects of the quake that raise central issues for our ability&lt;br/&gt;to forecast future hazards globally: 1) the constraints that geodetic strain accumulation place&lt;br/&gt;on the seismic moment budget, and 2) how the distribution of mechanical properties on the&lt;br/&gt;plate interface control seismic versus aseismic slip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forecasts of seismic hazard rely primarily on the historical record, paleoseismology, and&lt;br/&gt;geodetic strain accumulation. While a strict time-predictable model has proven inconsistent&lt;br/&gt;with geodetic data in some areas, the rate of strain accumulation must strongly in&lt;br/&gt;uence the recurrence rate and/or size of large earthquakes. Previous analyses of the extensive Japanese&lt;br/&gt;GPS data set regularize the underdetermined inverse problem; the inferred plate coupling is&lt;br/&gt;thus conditional on the choice of regularizing functional. In addition, most assumed no coupling at the trench, an area that effectively lies in the model null-space. The researchers propose rather to estimate rigorous bounds on the moment deficit rate, independent of any regularizing functional. They also propose to systematically explore the effects of time-dependent viscoelastic effects on estimates of slip deficit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tohoku earthquake also raises profound questions about the frictional properties of&lt;br/&gt;the subducting plate interface. Mw &gt; 7 events along the Japan-Kurile trench have repeated&lt;br/&gt;in nearly the same locations. Substantial afterslip following these events suggested that the&lt;br/&gt;fault surrounding these seismic `asperities' have different frictional properties, e.g., velocity&lt;br/&gt;weakening `asperities' surrounded by velocity strengthening regions. The fact that the March&lt;br/&gt;11 earthquake seems to have ruptured through both areas raises important questions. Is the&lt;br/&gt;asperity paradigm fundamentally flawed? Or did the M 9 activate other weakening mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;(thermal pressurization?) that allowed it to rupture through velocity strengthening regions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To distinguish between competing hypotheses the researchers will use a combination of GPS data based&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis testing and physics based fault modeling. They will test whether or not post-seismic&lt;br/&gt;GPS data can be fit with afterslip only in regions that have not experienced seismic slip in&lt;br/&gt;the last several decades. They will test alternative physical models that could account&lt;br/&gt;for the observed behavior, by extending our numerical codes that couple rate-state friction,&lt;br/&gt;thermal pressurization, and dilatant strengthening to three dimensions. This will allow them to&lt;br/&gt;test for example whether dilatancy could stabilize slip in otherwise velocity weakening regions,&lt;br/&gt;or thermal pressurization could allow ruptures to extend into velocity strengthening areas.</AbstractNarration>
