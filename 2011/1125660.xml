    <AbstractNarration>This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grant in Engineering (BRIGE) provides funding for the development of a novel approach to the fabrication of copper-zinc-tin-sulfide alloy (CZTS) photovoltaic cells. The project will investigate critical aspects of the fabrication of solar cells, starting from the selection of viable precursors and ending with device characterization. For the first time, CZTS nanoparticles will be synthesized using a gas-phase, continuous flow non-thermal plasma reactor starting from solutions of metal salts. This process generates a highly reactive environment which is expected to enable high-rate production of high-quality nanoparticles. Particle morphology and composition will be carefully characterized with the goal of tight control of particle stoichiometry which is expected to have a crucial influence on the performance of the photovoltaic device. The particles will be functionalized using in-flight plasma-initiated surface chemistry and the resulting ink is expected to be compatible with roll-to-roll coating techniques. A densified semiconducting layer will be realized by annealing using various techniques. The prototype solar cell will be tested with the goal of improving the power conversion efficiency (currently 10%) as compared to devices based on the same material system. And the feasibility of the plasma-based fabrication approach for the production of efficient CZTS solar cells will be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the application of a scalable process for the CZTS system would provide a new, commercially viable approach to renewable energy production. This material system is attractive because it is based on cheap, earth-abundant, non-toxic elements. This project will also advance the field of plasma processing of materials by investigating the gas-phase chemistry and the dynamic of particle formation for a material system that has not been widely investigated.</AbstractNarration>
