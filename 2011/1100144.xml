    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses the harvesting and conversion of mechanical energy from low-level ambient vibration into usable electrical energy. Utilizing the unique properties of "essentially" nonlinear vibrating systems, it develops multi degree-of-freedom, passive, broadband devices that will increase the efficiency and performance of energy harvesting systems acting on low-level ambient vibrations. Three research tasks are undertaken: 1) analysis of the system-level dynamics including nonlinearity in both the mechanical resonator and the electrical charging system; 2) design and application of multidegree-of-freedom resonators to enhance harvesting; and 3) experimental verification of proposed designs. Furthermore, collaboration with a group at the University of Bristol (UK) seeks to incorporate state of the art energy conversion strategies that can work efficiently in conjunction with the broadband resonator to produce a reliable, consistent source of power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is anticipated to lead to an enabling technology for next-generation portable devices and wireless sensors and provide a novel framework for the design and optimization of systems that incorporate nonlinear elements. Finally, this project enhances the diversity of the engineering community through targeted outreach, undergraduate research programs, and the support of students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
