    <AbstractNarration>Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1128748 &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1127923 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility located at the Missouri University of Science and Technology and the University of Houston site, respectively. Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will provide a novel insight into EMC coupling path physics, especially in complex geometries such as systems and printed circuit-boards. The project will provide solid theoretical and numerical basis for coupling path direction, which can open an entirely new solution strategy for EMC problems, thus transforming the practice of electromagnetic problem solving in EMC and provide the industrial consortium members with a practical and useful diagnostic and mitigation methodology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of coupling path detection methods can drastically improve the understanding of complex EMC problems, enabling more functionality to be integrated into products as diverse as high-speed electronics, automobiles, or military hardware. The proposed project will help assure the relevancy of the research to industry and ensure that results will be integrated into the development of real products that make their way to the consumer. The center will gain the unique capability to visualize coupling paths; this will allow an increase in the scope of the center by addressing additional audiences.</AbstractNarration>
