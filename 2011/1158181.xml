    <AbstractNarration>Auxin is an essential plant hormone that regulates nearly every aspect of plant life cycle, from embryo development to defense against pathogens. Despite the key importance of this hormone for plant fitness, very little is known about the multiple auxin biosynthetic pathways proposed to co-exist in plants. The study of this hormone's biosynthesis is further complicated by the presence of multiple metabolic pathways that feed on the same basic metabolic precursors employed in the production of auxins. These critical knowledge deficiencies in such an important biological process prompted the current project that focuses on addressing two main aspects of auxin biology: 1) What are the genes that compose the different auxin biosynthetic routes, and 2) how are the auxin biosynthetic pathways coordinated within the large metabolic network in which they are embedded? Taking advantage of the latest genetic and metabolic tools, the biosynthetic routes that plants use to produce this hormone will be defined. The metabolic network that integrates the different auxin biosynthetic pathways will be examined at cellular resolution and the information obtained will be compiled to generate three-dimensional predictive models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The anticipated findings of this proposal will reshape the current understanding of auxin biosynthesis in plants. The output of this project will include the generation of essential tools that can be used by the scientific community to examine the role of auxin biosynthesis in a wide array of plant processes. Furthermore, the three-dimensional analysis of the auxin metabolic network represents a proof of principle for new strategies to study networks and systems at cellular resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outreach component of this project includes: 1) a web-based bilingual (English and Spanish) set of 14 experimental modules designed specifically for young children (ages 5 to 12) that have English or Spanish as their home language; 2) experimental demonstrations at local elementary schools, and 3) monthly hands-on plant experiments at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. The overall objective of all these activities is to make science and the scientific methods more accessible and interesting to young people.</AbstractNarration>
