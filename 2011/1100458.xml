    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to understand how routine measurements of pressure, flow and water quality data could be used to characterize leaks and contaminant intrusion in urban water distribution systems and illustrate how this information could be used to aid in the risk assessment of these systems. Research will be conducted in adaptive simulation methods and optimization algorithms enabled by high performance computing to develop a quantitative framework for leak detection and contaminant intrusion characterization that utilizes real time pressure, flow, and water quality data. In addition, this framework will integrate new methodologies for incorporating spatially varying macro indicators and demand uncertainty. The research will also provide a risk analysis capability for analyzing economic and public health risks associated with gradual leaks and contaminant intrusion during routine operations. This quantitative prototype framework is envisioned for use by decision-makers to generate and identify operational strategies as well as to develop long-term maintenance and expansion plans. In addition, it will enable decision-makers to evaluate the risk reduction potential of different response, retrofit and maintenance actions. In collaboration with a major water utility in North Carolina, this quantitative prototype framework will be applied and validated using data from a mid-sized urban area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will address one of the nation's critical infrastructure security priorities in a real setting and contribute to the development of adaptive simulation methods and optimization algorithms that are enabled by harnessing the power of high-end computing resources. The computational framework that is formulated and implemented through this research project will set the stage for using emerging automated data collection systems for real time water distribution infrastructure condition assessment. The research methods and tools will also be made available via web-accessible interfaces for instructional and outreach purposes.</AbstractNarration>
