    <AbstractNarration>Jackson State University (JSU) and its LSMAMP partners are pleased to submit this competitive renewal proposal to support an ninth (9th) Cohort in the Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program, which addresses our continued efforts to solve the critical shortages of underrepresented minorities (URM) in STEM disciplines. This will be accomplished by continuing the synergy between LSMAMP partners that have transformed the instructional, research and administrative aspects of cooperation among these institutions in ways never before envisioned. STEM disciplines targeted for BD include: chemistry, mathematics, biology, environmental science, computer science, and engineering. The requested support will continue to accelerate and increase the numbers of minority students entering the Ph.D. pipeline. The success of the BD is based upon the theory that minority students who pursue the MS degree, have the potential to complete the PhD degree in STEM areas if provided sufficient financial support, rigorous curricula, committed mentoring and national and international extensive research experiences. The addition of an ninth Cohort will increase the number of students who have been supported by the program to 106. The impact of the LSMAMP-BD has been profoundly dramatic in achieving the goal of increasing the number of underrepresented (URM) PhD participation. To date, of a total of 94 students, 72 have been admitted into PhD programs, 11 have earned their PhDs, and 40 are completing their dissertations or coursework (from Cohorts 1-6). Furthermore, 90% of the students in Cohorts 1 through 6 were admitted into Ph.D. programs. In Cohort 7, so far, nine (9) students have been admitted into Ph.D. programs and three (3) have applied to doctoral offering institutions and are expected to start during fall 2010. Cohort Eight (8) students are progressing well and are currently acquiring international experience before they begin their summer internships.&lt;br/&gt;The BD is an intensive, highly interactive program covering the first two years of the students' graduate tenure leading to the MS degree. Students are expected to continue their work through to the doctorate. The first year the students satisfy the required core courses and select their research advisor. The first summer, the students are exposed to scientific and technical workforce environments internships at national or international laboratories, corporations and universities. During this time, students and their faculty advisors continually interact on the learning experience and initiation of research projects. The second year is dedicated to research, writing the MS thesis, specialized courses and applying to doctoral programs and fellowships.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The goal of the LSMAMP BD Program is to establish a secure pathway for underrepresented minority students to obtain doctoral degrees in STEM disciplines. This proposed project will build upon existing relationships between JSU and major national and international universities; national laboratories such as LBNL and LLNL; and NSF programs such as CREST, AGEM, IGERT, etc. to increase the number of minority students enrolling and matriculating in MS and Ph.D. STEM graduate programs within and outside of the state of Mississippi. Disciplines targeted for graduate studies include: chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, environmental science, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The LSMAMP program will increase the number of Ph.D. degrees in STEM areas awarded to minorities, especially African-Americans. The project will provide well-qualified and diverse faculty members for U S universities and colleges, as well as impact the number of scientists and engineers holding the doctorate. This is already taking place as exhibited by the number of BD students placed in Ph.D. programs and by the number of those who have earned the Ph.D.</AbstractNarration>
