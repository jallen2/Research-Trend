    <AbstractNarration>Many of the tectonic processes expressed at Earth's surface are the&lt;br/&gt;manifestation of processes rooted deeper within the planet. Variations in&lt;br/&gt;temperatures and composition of the upper mantle (the layer below the&lt;br/&gt;crust) combined with the forces that drive motion contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;deformation patterns at the surface and/or melt generation (possibly&lt;br/&gt;resulting in volcanoes). Models of the mantle further our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the evolution of these processes, but these models require accurate&lt;br/&gt;estimates of temperature and composition of the upper mantle---neither&lt;br/&gt;of which can be measured directly. To estimate the state of the mantle,&lt;br/&gt;geophysical models of a physical property sensitive to temperature and&lt;br/&gt;composition are typically used as a proxy (e.g. seismic velocity and electrical&lt;br/&gt;conductivity). Using electrical conductivity as a proxy requires&lt;br/&gt;laboratory measurements on minerals at a range of conditions expected&lt;br/&gt;for the mantle. Most interpretations of upper mantle&lt;br/&gt;electrical conductivity are based only on the mineral olivine,&lt;br/&gt;which comprises 60-70% of the mantle, and often ignore the possible&lt;br/&gt;influence of the remaining mineral components. While olivine typically&lt;br/&gt;dominates the electrical conductivity, there are cases, particularly&lt;br/&gt;when bound water content is high, where electrical conductivity&lt;br/&gt;contributions from orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene, the next most&lt;br/&gt;abundant upper mantle minerals, may be disproportionate to their volume.&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve the collection of electrical conductivity on&lt;br/&gt;mantle pyroxenes in a laboratory controlled setting over a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;physical conditions, leading to an improved model of dry pyroxene&lt;br/&gt;conductivity. This model will help improve current,&lt;br/&gt;and aid in future, interpretations of mantle conductivity models and the&lt;br/&gt;processes that potentially drive melt generation and surface dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;This project will also include the building of a conductivity apparatus&lt;br/&gt;than can be used in future studies as well as the training of a postdoc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been few electrical conductivity studies on orthopyroxene and&lt;br/&gt;fewer on clinopyroxene. While they suggest anhydrous conductivity of&lt;br/&gt;orthopyroxene is similar to that of olivine, with clinopyroxene about one&lt;br/&gt;order of magnitude lower, they were conducted along predetermined oxygen&lt;br/&gt;fugacity paths, thus limiting their application to specific conditions. This project&lt;br/&gt;will focus on the collection of electrical conductivity and thermopower&lt;br/&gt;measurements on mantle derived pyroxenes over a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;temperatures and oxygen fugacities relevant to the mantle. By&lt;br/&gt;collecting thermopower measurements in tandem with electrical&lt;br/&gt;conductivity at several oxygen fugacity states and temperatures it&lt;br/&gt;will be possible to estimate the concentration and mobility of the&lt;br/&gt;various charge carriers and build point defect models that extend&lt;br/&gt;conductivity estimates to a much larger range of mantle conditions. A&lt;br/&gt;similar model for olivine has become a standard for comparison with&lt;br/&gt;laboratory experiments and repeatedly verified in recent experiments.&lt;br/&gt;In the past few years there has been a great deal of attention paid to&lt;br/&gt;the effect of water on olivine conductivity. However, water partitioning&lt;br/&gt;experiments show that pyroxenes may hold ten times as much bound H2O as&lt;br/&gt;olivine. Apart from contributing to bulk composition, pyroxenites (rocks&lt;br/&gt;with &gt;50% pyroxene) are found regionally in veins which are important to&lt;br/&gt;the geochemical budget, and may be responsible for the "garnet&lt;br/&gt;signature" in mid-ocean ridges and ocean island basalts. If such veins&lt;br/&gt;form interconnected networks they would have a disproportionate effect&lt;br/&gt;on mantle conductivity. A reliable anhydrous pyroxene conductivity&lt;br/&gt;model developed as part of this study will aid interpretation of future&lt;br/&gt;electrical conductivity experiments on hydrous pyroxenes, as well as &lt;br/&gt;improve the interpretation of mantle conductivities inferred from&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic sounding.</AbstractNarration>
