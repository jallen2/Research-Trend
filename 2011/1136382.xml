    <AbstractNarration>The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMass Dartmouth) and its school and community partners are preparing 20 new science and mathematics teachers (Teaching Fellows) and 10 Master Teaching Fellows as STEM educators for the middle and secondary schools of Fall River, New Bedford, and Wareham, MA. The project is preparing STEM teachers by focusing on three major program strands: 1) educators deepening their STEM content knowledge and instructional practices through content-intensive learning experiences; 2) educators developing critical 21st century skills through the active exploration of emerging technologies in STEM education; and 3) educators developing teacher leadership skills via a collaborative approach, based on a proven model that utilizes peer-coaching, mentoring, and professional learning communities. Teaching Fellows earn a Master of Arts in Teaching-Initial licensure in 15 months, an accelerated schedule that includes a full year of teaching residency in a high-need school. Master Teaching Fellows earn a graduate-level 12-credit STEM Teacher Leadership Certificate within one year, developing mentoring skills, and ushering the TFs into the teaching profession. While participating in the program, the Teaching Fellows are developing into master teachers, earning a professional teaching license and a STEM Teacher Leadership Certificate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the training and mentoring activities of the TFs and MTFs, together with the project's in-depth data management and thorough evaluation, the project is uncovering direct relationships between teacher preparation and student achievement. The project is tracking the growth of content knowledge and pedagogical skills in beginning teachers, and also tracking the development of leadership and mentoring skills in experienced teachers. With the requirement that both TFs and MTFs complete coursework in educational research, the participants engage in interpreting and sharing their own research, contributing to change in STEM classrooms. In addition, the program is contributing to the development of a Technology/Engineering teaching license at UMass Dartmouth, meeting an urgent regional need.</AbstractNarration>
