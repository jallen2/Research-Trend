    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of the iPuzzle project is to develop a model for supporting student engagement in learning mathematics using innovative technologies. Researchers will develop this model by creating and examining an interactive puzzle environment that could be used locally in a single networked classroom or created for the web so that it could be used at multiple schools using different computing devices and platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mixed-methods will be employed in this research and development project to examine the impact of the proposed learning environment on student engagement and learning. The puzzles will be tested with students in formal and informal settings and revision will be undertaken according to the testing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term vision of developing puzzle-based comprehensive curriculum is innovative and potentially transformative. This project will contribute to this long-term vision. This project has the potential to change the culture of the learning environment - instead of expecting that learning is done only because one must, their long-term vision is to build a culture in which learning is something one (mostly) enjoys doing and expects others to enjoy as well. With a clear vision, a coherent set of proposed activities, and a great team, this project has the potential to truly Transforming STEM Learning.</AbstractNarration>
