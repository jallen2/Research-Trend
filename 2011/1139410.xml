    <AbstractNarration>WestEd and the University of California-Berkeley are improving student learning and workforce preparation in science as well as information and communication technology by embedding the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program into curricula of selected high school-level green energy career academies in California. Embedding GLOBE within California's green energy academies will pave the way for broader GLOBE implementation in California and other states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GLOBE California Academy Program (CAP) is engaging students, particularly at-risk students, in research related to climate science and renewable energy technologies, providing professional development and support for academy teachers, connecting scientists and industry to academy classrooms, and linking students to GLOBE's international student community. GLOBE's data collection and analysis activities will become an integral and sustainable part of a rigorous inquiry-based approach to science education that prepares students for postsecondary education and science careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating GLOBE into CAP will produce a replicable model program that improves high school students' preparation for postsecondary education and careers in science and technology fields. Outcomes for students include improved science/technology knowledge and skills, higher grades, increased interest in pursuing postsecondary education and science/technology careers, and development of 21st century workforce skills. Outcomes for teachers include increased facility with GLOBE and scientific practice.</AbstractNarration>
