    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to Virginia Tech that will provide research training for 10 students for 10 weeks, during each of the summers of 2012- 2014. The REU program trains students in research on a wide range of microbiological phenomena, covering both fundamental and applied topics and employing both genome-based technologies and focused approaches. The program includes i) a student-led independent research project; ii) discussion sessions and seminars given by faculty members and an external speaker; iii) visits to specialized laboratories and research centers such as genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics facilities, the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, and the Center for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Diseases; iv) workshops on responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and how to gain admission to graduate school and pursue graduate studies productively; v) visits to companies that utilize or study microbiological processes; vi) informal lunch meetings with mentors and graduate students; vii) weekly participant meetings aimed at sharing learning experiences; and viii) presentation of research results by each student in a seminar format at a mid-summer symposium and in a poster format at a campus-wide symposium at the end of the program. Students are expected to do full-time research as well as participate in all site activities. The site recruits through traditional "hard copy" formats as well as digital-based advertising. Students are selected based on the potential for outstanding research as judged from academic transcripts, recommendation letters, and personal statements. Preference will be given to students who lack the opportunity to conduct research at their home institution. The program will emphasize participation of students from underrepresented groups. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in microbiology, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The performance of the program will be assessed by various means, including an REU common assessment tool.
