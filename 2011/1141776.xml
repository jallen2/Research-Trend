    <AbstractNarration>This is a supplement to a RAPID proposal to support analysis completion, preparation of journal publications, and subvention of a publication of the Wales Archaeological Report. This would allow for the PI to bring over a decade of archaeological excavation at a key site near the village of Wales in Northwest Alaska to conclusion. The Wales site is unique in its faunal preservation, architectural features, organic materials, artifact assemblage, and the potential for understanding prehistoric social relationships between coastal and interior cultural groups. The PI has been working at Wales for over a decade and has created model relationships with the community. This supplement would give him the resources necessary to complete the data analysis; prepare several papers for publication, as well as a major site report; and prepare the artifacts for curation at the Museum of the Arctic, Fairbanks, Alaska, as agreed by the Wales community.</AbstractNarration>
