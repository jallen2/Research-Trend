    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to investigate how fast photons can be generated successively and deterministically, down to the single-photon level and up at a terahertz rate, in semiconductor quantum dots. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to advance the single-photon generation rate from semiconductor materials up by at least 3 orders of magnitude into the terahertz regime. The extremely short radiative lifetime can also allow indistinguishable photons to be robustly generated. Together with the choice of wide-bandgap semiconductor quantum dot materials, it is expected to realize the above goals at a liquid nitrogen temperature and above, which is transformative in the field of semiconductor optics. Successful conclusion of this project will provide critical resources for quantum cryptography and quantum information processing applications, and may open up a new opportunity for optical interconnect at an extremely high speed and requiring only a sub-atto joule of switching energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the advancements of materials science, synthesis, device physics, quantum optics, and many-body physics in the context of ultrafast dynamics of single-photon generation in semiconductor materials and the education components. The results can be far reaching and impact energy-efficient communication network, optical interconnect on the chip, and solid-state lighting. The education plan focuses on outreach and diversity programs aiming to engage K-12 students for physical and engineering science. It also includes curriculum developments on solid-state lighting and multidisciplinary projects for undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
