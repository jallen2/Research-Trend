    <AbstractNarration>In this proposal, Professor Stoll of Georgetown University will synthesize and characterize nanostructured electron doped magnetic semiconductors. The work is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry. A new route was discovered to produce both nanoparticles as well as nanorods of lanthanide chalcogenide semiconductors, which is easily adapted for doping studies. These novel materials may have useful applications in microelectronic devices, and should provide important mechanistic details of electronic and magnetic coupling in these unusual materials. Nanoparticles have been prepared by solution thermolysis of molecular precursors to form Eu1-xGdxS materials. The ferromagnetic ordering temperature can be increased by tuning the doping level, x. In addition, using hydrothermal synthesis it is possible to synthesize Eu2O3 nanowires and nanorods that can be chemically converted into EuO nanomaterials maintaining morphology and single crystal structures. This procedure should provide a route to forming Gd doped EuO materials. This proposal will study the effect of electron doping (Gd) on magnetic semiconductors EuS and EuO, as well as the effect of morphology (nanoparticle diameter and nanowire structures).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the study of magnetic semiconductors which have applications in both data storage and information processing. The work is highly interdisciplinary between chemistry and physics, and involves both the synthesis and characterization of novel nanostructured magnetic materials. The team spans the educational ladder from high school seniors to senior graduate students, who work in a collaborative laboratory setting. In order to fully characterize these materials, a new collaboration has been established with a faculty at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris. The PI is also involved in outreach programs as co-Director of Science in the Public Interest, which introduces science students to science policy in government.</AbstractNarration>
