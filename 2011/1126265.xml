    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Dwight Matthews from University of Vermont &amp; State Agricultural College and colleagues Giuseppe Petrucci and Matthias Brewer will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer with solids and solution capabilities. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesis of nanoporous materials for catalytic and biomedical applications, (b) polymers with phosphorus-based molecular architectures, (c) effect of cis/trans Isomerization of vicinal disulfide bond on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, (d) preparation of N-heterocyclic systems synthesized following a 2-aza-Cope-dipolar cycloaddition approach, and (e) preparation of nitrogen or oxygen containing heterocycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at the University of Vermont and neighboring colleges such as SUNY Plattsburg, St Michael's College, Middlebury College and Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Science.</AbstractNarration>
