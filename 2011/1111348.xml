    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Suits of Wayne State University will conduct investigations of the dissociation of polyatomic molecules using laser techniques that are sensitive to the electronic and spin angular momentum of the products. The findings can then be used to unravel the detailed dynamics of these dissociation events. A key aspect of the proposed work is development of an approach for efficient detection of electron spin polarization in hydrogen atom photo-fragments, a principal product of the dissociation of a great many polyatomic molecules. A second aspect of the proposed studies is a strategy to control the novel "roaming radical" reaction mechanism identified in formaldehyde and acetaldehyde decomposition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed work include development of a new high-resolution image acquisition system that will be freely distributed to other groups. In addition, recruitment and training of a diverse group of undergraduate students, graduate students and post-docs in methods in ion imaging, laser spectroscopy and data analysis is a core aspect of the group activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important question in the decomposition of photoexcited molecules is the sequence of electronic states that are encountered in the course of dissociation, and the ways in which they influence the final outcome. This question has direct bearing in many diverse areas from solar energy capture to vision to atmospheric chemistry: almost anywhere that molecules interact with light.</AbstractNarration>
