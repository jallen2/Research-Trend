    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project leverages the game changing&lt;br/&gt;Transformative Integrated Power Solution (TIPS?) power conversion technology, to&lt;br/&gt;bring a radical breakthrough to the traditional tradeoff between efficiency and circuit&lt;br/&gt;size, pushing this figure of merit to a new frontier. By storing the required energy&lt;br/&gt;primarily electrically (capacitive energy storage) rather than magnetically (inductive&lt;br/&gt;energy storage), harnessing a 1000x improvement in energy density, and using the&lt;br/&gt;adiabatic (lossless) mechanism to charge and discharge the capacitors, the novel&lt;br/&gt;TIPS? power conversion architecture is able to deliver miniaturized products of 30X&lt;br/&gt;smaller than the traditional approach, or cut the power losses due to conversion by 50-&lt;br/&gt;75%, at cost parity. The project proposes a radically novel systems architecture for the&lt;br/&gt;data center market, and investigates the lower voltage end of the system, namely the&lt;br/&gt;12:1 step down ratio necessary for servers. To de-risk the commercialization path, this&lt;br/&gt;project researches, designs and fabricates prototypes based on the TIPS? technology,&lt;br/&gt;by pushing the limit along three distinct dimensions: conversion efficiency, size, and&lt;br/&gt;cost. This project will generate a feasible 3D space of viable specifications to accelerate&lt;br/&gt;bringing this game changing technology to market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, enables commercial&lt;br/&gt;power conversion products, at no cost to the consumer, data center, or server&lt;br/&gt;manufacturer, that can save $1 billion a year in electricity cost, amounting to annual&lt;br/&gt;savings of 7 million tons of CO2 emissions worldwide. Data centers emit more heat and&lt;br/&gt;green house gasses than the entire airline industry worldwide. By 2020, data centers?&lt;br/&gt;energy consumption will exceed 200 billion kWhr per year. While server equipment&lt;br/&gt;spending has been declining, electricity spending has increased 10 fold over the last&lt;br/&gt;fifteen years, approaching $50 billion annually. More than 50% of this cost is due to&lt;br/&gt;power conversion losses and the resultant cooling needs. The TIPS? power converter&lt;br/&gt;technology can cut these power losses by 50%. Additionally, by enhancing the scope&lt;br/&gt;and technological understanding of this novel technology, and by making power&lt;br/&gt;conversion more efficient, significant value flows to numerous other markets, such as&lt;br/&gt;increased battery life in Mobile Devices ($3 billion), more power generated by Solar&lt;br/&gt;Cells (&lt;$1 billion), extended driving range of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles ($0.2 billion),&lt;br/&gt;no standby losses in consumer electronics ($6 billion), and reduced component count&lt;br/&gt;and higher reliability in the Industrial and Measurement sector ($4 billion).</AbstractNarration>
