    <AbstractNarration>New Mexico State University and El Paso Community College are collaborating to create a new introductory course that fully integrates instruction in biology and mathematics. The idea grew from a successful Undergraduate Biology and Mathematics project in which teams of faculty and students worked together on common research questions. Now that effort is being broadened and tested on a larger and less experienced student population. Targeted to students beginning their studies of STEM disciplines, the course is offered at both institutions in parallel with more traditional courses and the effectiveness of the two instructional models are compared using common assessment tools. If the combined approach is as successful at influencing student learning and conceptual mastery as expected, it will replace traditional instruction at both institutions. Not only does this innovative interdisciplinary approach provide a solid foundation for future studies in quantitative STEM subjects, it also allows development of strategies to encourage participation of more underrepresented minority students, a large part of the population in Southern New Mexico and Western Texas.</AbstractNarration>
