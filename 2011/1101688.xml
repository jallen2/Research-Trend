    <AbstractNarration>The project is devoted to the study of finite point configurations in metric spaces. Classical results in harmonic analysis and group representations imply the existence of functions that satisfy certain positivity constraints when evaluated on such configurations. These constraints give a set of necessary conditions for the existence of the configuration. The project studies the extent to which the positivity constraints are also sufficient in that they imply that a configuration with desired properties exists. A related topic studied in the project is the maximum size of point sets with few distances in metric spaces. The context for the development of the project is related to the recently established semidefinite programming bounds on codes in homogeneous spaces. The project also pursues a link between uniformly distributed sets of points known as spherical and Euclidean designs and a more general concept of cubature formulas with the aim to use methods of algebraic combinatorics to study cubature formulas in metric and functional spaces. One of the goals is to establish new universal bounds on cubature formulas in homogeneous spaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finite collections of points in space find applications in reliable and numerical analysis. Studying the structure of point configurations creates insights into construction of optimal signal transmission schemes and of optimal nets for Monte-Carlo integration.</AbstractNarration>
