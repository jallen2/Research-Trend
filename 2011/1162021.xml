    <AbstractNarration>While races in multithreaded programs have drawn huge attention from the&lt;br/&gt;research community, little has been done for API races, a class&lt;br/&gt;of errors as dangerous and as difficult to debug as traditional thread&lt;br/&gt;races. An API race occurs when multiple activities, whether they be&lt;br/&gt;threads or processes, access a shared resource via an application&lt;br/&gt;programming interface (API) without proper synchronization. Detecting&lt;br/&gt;API races is an important and difficult problem as existing race&lt;br/&gt;detectors are unlikely to work well with API races. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software reliability increasingly affects everyone, whether or not&lt;br/&gt;they personally use computers. This research studies and&lt;br/&gt;automatically detects for the first time an important class of races&lt;br/&gt;that has a significant impact on software reliability. The study&lt;br/&gt;quantitatively demonstrates how API races are numerous, difficult to&lt;br/&gt;debug, and a real threat to software reliability. To address this&lt;br/&gt;problem, this research is developing RacePro, a new system to&lt;br/&gt;automatically detect API races in deployed systems. RacePro checks&lt;br/&gt;deployed systems in-vivo by recording live executions then&lt;br/&gt;deterministically replay and check them later. This approach&lt;br/&gt;increases checking coverage beyond the configurations or executions&lt;br/&gt;covered by software vendors or beta testing sites. RacePro records&lt;br/&gt;multiple processes and threads, detects races in the recording among &lt;br/&gt;API methods that may concurrently access shared objects, then explores&lt;br/&gt;different execution orderings of such API methods to determine which races&lt;br/&gt;are harmful and result in failures. Technologies developed will help&lt;br/&gt;application developers detect insidious software defects, enabling &lt;br/&gt;more robust, reliable, and secure software infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
