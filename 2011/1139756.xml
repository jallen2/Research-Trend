    <AbstractNarration>The Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ALSAMP)under the leadership of the University of Alabama (UAB) will sponsor its ninth (9th) cohort of Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) students at the institution. The program will focus on the recruitment, retention, mentoring, and graduation of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields at the postbaccalaureate level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve NSF-sponsord historically underrepresented minority students pursuing science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines will participate in the program for the 2011-2013 academic years. UAB has a proven record of recruitment, retention, graduation and placement of STEM students in doctoral degree programs. BD participants receive an assigned faculty mentor and the opportunity to attend and participate in at least one professional scientific meeting each year. In addition, BD participants attend special topic seminars concerning graduate school matriculation designed specifically for the program and procedures for applying for NSF and other fellowships. Linkages will be established with the NSF Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) and other research and academic programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the two year award period, BD students are guaranteed continuation of the same level of financial support through a combination of departmental fellowships and additional financial support from the university. BD students not remaining at UAB will be connected to doctoral programs at other institutions and are assisted in securing fellowship and other support at the selected institution. All BD students will be tracked into doctoral degree programs and the workforce, including the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation and assessment data will be collected and evaluated at intervals during the two year program. Dissemination of results and success will be published in vsrious venues. The magazine is an excellent source of publicity for the BD program as well as an important networking tool for BD students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an important step in advancing the knowledge of underrepresented minority students in STEM. The experiences gained by these students working with science and education faculty will position them for excellent career advancement and contribute to the nation's great need for minority scientist in both research and the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project broadens participation of underrepresented groups in graduate education with the real prospect of increasing the number of such groups attaining doctoral degrees in STEM and entering the professoriate. Discovery and understanding resulting from this project will be disseminated to other institutions and programs focusing on graduate education.</AbstractNarration>
