    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Supporting the largest national Antarctic science program in the world, the United States plays a special role in setting national and international research and stewardship priorities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. As the focus for Antarctic scientific research in the United States, the National Science Foundation?s Office of Polar Programs (NSF OPP) is responsible for managing the support of scientific research in the Antarctic Treaty Area on behalf of the federal government and in the spirit of the Antarctic Treaty. One element of the United States' national and international leadership role is active participation in the Council of Managers of Antarctic Programs (COMNAP).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMNAP will hold its 2012 meeting in Portland, Oregon. The location and timing of the meeting were chosen to match the planned Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) business meetings and Open Science Conference. The study of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, and their role in the Earth system, has never been more important. The region is experiencing changes that are global in scope and the rapid pace of technological development makes new observations and discoveries possible every day. As research programs diversify and grow, so does the need for well coordinated and thoughtful program management across the Antarctic. Hosting both the COMNAP and SCAR meetings now will enhance the United States? leadership role in the full complement of Antarctic activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Created in 1988, COMNAP supports working relationships among National Antarctic Programs from around the world in order to develop and promote best practice in managing the support of scientific research in Antarctica. This goal is met by serving as a forum to develop practices that improve effectiveness of activities in an environmentally responsible manner, facilitating and promoting international partnerships, providing opportunities and systems for information exchange; and providing the Antarctic Treaty System with objective and practical, technical and nonpolitical advice drawn from the National Antarctic Programs? pool of expertise. COMNAP maintains a special, complementary relationship with SCAR - the respective executives meet annually and both organizations attempt to coordinate their bi-annual meetings to facilitate cross-participation in both meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal are in that the meeting will promote international collaboration, broaden the perspective of U.S. scientists, and provide an opportunity for the next generation of polar scientists to interact with leaders in the field. Hosting the joint XXXIIII COMNAP and XXXII SCAR offers a unique opportunity to present Antarctic and Southern Ocean science to the public in a framework that emphasizes the importance of cross-disciplinary approaches and international collaboration. A diverse range of education and public engagement activities are planned to coincide with the meetings in 2012. These include public art and music events, public lectures in formal and informal settings, exhibit development at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, and professional development activities intended to bring informal education professionals together with Antarctic scientists, in particular, early career scientists. Students at Portland State University and other regional institutions will be involved in meeting organization and operations, as both interns and volunteers.</AbstractNarration>
