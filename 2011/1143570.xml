    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to demonstrate proof-of-concept of the transformative idea of self-powered photo-electrochromic system based on 1D and 2D ZnO nanostructures on flexible substrates for significant potential payoffs. The power conversion efficiency may be below 3%, but the important metric of open circuit voltage to drive the electrochromic material is computed to be acceptably high (~2.25-2.75 V). Initially, UV photovoltaic Schottky and p-n junction devices, based on ZnO NWs and thin films, will be fabricated and characterized. Finally, monolithic integration of ZnO NW photovoltaic cells and electrocrhromic layers will be demonstrated using a flexible polymer as the substrate, to achieve self-powered smart windows. The intellectual merit of this work lies in the interdisciplinary and integrated approach, the&lt;br/&gt;success of which will be transformative in a number of areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall promise of this project is in creating a breakthrough for developing self-powered nanostructure based electrochrmoic devices on flexible substrates. In addition, future engineers will gain hands-on, problem-solving skills in multiple disciplines including nanosciences, while taking necessary courses in advanced characterization, solid state devices, nanofabrication, and photoelectrochromic technologies at ASU.</AbstractNarration>
