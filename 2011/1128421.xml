    <AbstractNarration>The US-Finland Workshop on Wireless Networks will be held in the Finland Embassy in Washington DC from May 16 to May 17, 2011. There will be approximately 20 US participants and 20 Finland participants. The objective of this workshop is to bring together experts in the field of wireless networking from the US and Finland, as well as funding agency representatives from the NSF, the Academy of Finland and Tekes, to discuss future research and education collaboration between the two countries. This proposal requests funds to support 10 US participants, which will include researchers at various ranks, and will represent various demographics and races including individuals from under-represented groups. The workshop is expected to result in the formation of a long-term research and education collaboration between US and Finland in the field of wireless networking.</AbstractNarration>
