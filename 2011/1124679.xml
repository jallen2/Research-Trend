    <AbstractNarration>DeVincent Wolf&lt;br/&gt;1124679&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for the partial support of a symposium titled "Synthesis and Processing of Organic and Polymeric Materials for Semiconductor Applications", to be held at the 2011 Materials Research Society (MRS) Spring Meeting, Apr. 25-29, 2011, in San Francisco, California. The synthesis and processing of organic materials for photovoltaics and solid-state lighting constitutes a multidisciplinary research area which converges at the interface of synthetic organic chemistry, materials science and engineering, semiconductor physics, and device engineering. This symposium provides an ideal opportunity for scientists and engineers from different disciplines to share their results and insights in the field of organic semiconductors, with a highlight on novel synthesis and processing methods to fabricate organic and functional polymeric materials which applications to photovoltaics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will provide travel support for oral and poster presenters, who consist mainly of new and emerging workers in the field. In particular, this support will provide an opportunity for student attendees to become familiar with state-of-the-art organic semiconductor technologies. Undergraduate participation in the poster sessions will be encouraged as a means of exposing students to a high level of research at an early stage in their careers.</AbstractNarration>
