    <AbstractNarration>Many model search strategies involve trading off model fit with model &lt;br/&gt;complexity in a penalized goodness of fit measure. Asymptotic properties &lt;br/&gt;for these types of procedures in some conventional situations, such as &lt;br/&gt;regression and ARMA time series have been studied. Yet, such strategies &lt;br/&gt;do not always translate into good finite sample performance. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;such standard model selection procedures encounter difficulties for &lt;br/&gt;nonconventional model selection problems as well. This project aims at &lt;br/&gt;developments of a new model selection strategy, called fence methods, in &lt;br/&gt;following four major areas of methodology research and applications: (i) &lt;br/&gt;development of adaptive fence methods for high dimensional and complex &lt;br/&gt;model selection problems using the idea of restricted maximum likelihood; &lt;br/&gt;(ii) development of data adaptive fence methods for nonparametric model &lt;br/&gt;selection problems such as penalized smoothing spline estimation; (iii) &lt;br/&gt;development of fence methods for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping; &lt;br/&gt;and (iv) development of user-friendly standalone software for implementing &lt;br/&gt;the fence methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fence idea is generally based on building a statistical fence, or &lt;br/&gt;barrier, to carefully eliminate incorrect models. This is done by &lt;br/&gt;determining which models are within variation of a goodness-of-fit &lt;br/&gt;measure of an anchor model. Once the fence is constructed, the optimal &lt;br/&gt;model is selected from amongst those within the fence according to &lt;br/&gt;a criterion which can be made flexible. For example, the criterion can &lt;br/&gt;incorporate scientific or economic concerns. The adaptive fence method &lt;br/&gt;may be viewed as comparing signals with noises to come out with an optimal &lt;br/&gt;decision supported by the data. Given such a wide spectrum of models that &lt;br/&gt;can be handled, the range of applications seems enormous. Of particular &lt;br/&gt;interests are applications in human genetics, medical research and surveys. &lt;br/&gt;To facilitate such translational research, the investigators plan to freely &lt;br/&gt;disseminate available computer software to implement the fence methods.</AbstractNarration>
