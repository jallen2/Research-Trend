    <AbstractNarration>Our vision is to develop caregiver robots that interact fluidly and flexibly with humans during functional&lt;br/&gt;motor activities, while providing motor assistance, enhancement, and communication to facilitate motor&lt;br/&gt;learning. However, we currently lack theories to understand how rehabilitation and movement therapists&lt;br/&gt;provide timely and appropriate physical feedback and assistance to improve mobility in individuals with&lt;br/&gt;motor impairments. To develop devices that could accompany an individual as both assistant and&lt;br/&gt;movement therapist, our goal is to study human motor coordination during cooperative physical&lt;br/&gt;interactions with a humanoid assistive robot. We will use rehabilitative partner dance as a paradigm to&lt;br/&gt;examine a sensory-motor theory of cooperative physical interactions relevant to walking and other&lt;br/&gt;functional motor activities. We will use a "partnered box step", a constrained and defined pattern of&lt;br/&gt;weight shifts and directional changes, as a paradigm for a cooperative physical interaction with welldefined&lt;br/&gt;motor goals.&lt;br/&gt;Objectives: To 1) experimentally verify a hierarchical theory of human sensory-motor control and&lt;br/&gt;learning and 2) develop predictive models of whole-body human movement for cooperative physical&lt;br/&gt;interactions with machines. Over four years, we will test our models by demonstrating the successful&lt;br/&gt;participation of the robot in a box step as leader or follower and adapt its movements to the motor skill&lt;br/&gt;level of a human partner.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Our work will provide transformative experimental, theoretical, and practical&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary frameworks that will forge new paths toward autonomous cooperative robots with&lt;br/&gt;physical intelligence to enhance, assist, and improve motor skills in humans with varying motor&lt;br/&gt;capabilities. These advances will aid prosthetic and robotic design and may advance our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the brain.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The expected project outcomes would have long-term impact on the quality of life of&lt;br/&gt;millions of Americans by improving fitness, motor skills, and social engagement. Applications include&lt;br/&gt;healthcare devices or sports robots that entertain and improve fitness. We will provide seminars on&lt;br/&gt;mobility-related issues and rehabilitative dance instruction to older adult living communities and&lt;br/&gt;populations with motor impairments. The broad appeal and social nature of this work will likely garner&lt;br/&gt;media publicity that will increase public interest in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
