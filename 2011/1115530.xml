    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop some robust and high accuracy numerical algorithms and related mathematical theory for Hamiltonian systems. The research efforts will be devoted to constructing "essentially" (accuracy is in a range of the computer round-off error) volume conserving (symplectic) and energy conserving algorithms. Some recent mathematical theory in spectral methods, finite element superconvergence, as well as discontinuous Galerkin methods will be employed in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phenomena in different scientific disciplines such as classical mechanics, molecular dynamics, hydrodynamics, electrodynamics, plasma physics, relativity, and astronomy, etc. can be described by Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The success of the project will impact science and engineering practices. This research will widen the body of knowledge in the scientific community on both mathematical theory and practical algorithmic design. The project contains solid multi- and interdisciplinary components and has wide application in scientific computing.</AbstractNarration>
