    <AbstractNarration>This funding renews a long-running and highly-successful CISE Research&lt;br/&gt;Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at DePauw University. The&lt;br/&gt;site exposes students to a range of topics in Computer Science, including&lt;br/&gt;pen-based computing, computer-supported cooperative work, assistive&lt;br/&gt;technology, natural language processing, functional programming&lt;br/&gt;languages, wireless sensor networks, programming pedagogy, parallel&lt;br/&gt;programming, and virtual reality. Students will work in small teams&lt;br/&gt;with a mentor and will experience conducting research as part of a team,&lt;br/&gt;disseminating research results, and participating in a community of&lt;br/&gt;scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will allow 24 students (over three years) to experience&lt;br/&gt;research in a variety of areas in Computer Science. The site focuses&lt;br/&gt;on recruiting students from undergraduate-only institutions, who do not&lt;br/&gt;have as ready access to research opportunities as students at research&lt;br/&gt;universities. The site?s primary objective is to encourage talented&lt;br/&gt;students enrolled at undergraduate institutions to pursue graduate&lt;br/&gt;studies and research careers in Computer Science.</AbstractNarration>
