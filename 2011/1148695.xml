    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the year-round Center for Undergraduate Research in Mathematics (CURM) which will promote academic year undergraduate research in mathematics and statistics based upon a unique model. CURM will support faculty members mentoring undergraduate students in research groups that consist of 2-5 students and 1 faculty mentor working together as a team on a research project at their own institution. CURM will accomplish this by administering mini-grants to approximately 11 faculty each year who will mentor approximately 35 undergraduate students conducting research in mathematics and statistics during the academic year at their home institutions across the U.S. Included will be workshops that will bring all of the participants together from around the U.S. to (1.) train the faculty mentors in mentoring skills, in helping their mentored students succeed in graduate school, and in setting up consistently funded undergraduate research groups at their own institution and (2.) allow students the opportunity to present their research to their peers, prepare for graduate school, and hone their technical communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CURM project will target two critical transition phases: (a) undergraduate students making a successful transition to graduate school; and (b) newer mathematics faculty members making a successful transition to becoming successful and contributing members of their institution. We will target female participants and participants from undergraduate institutions. For the first transition point, undergraduate students will be mentored so that they develop the skills that will help them in graduate school and in their research. For the second transition point, we will provide new faculty members with the necessary skills to successfully set up and maintain long-term research programs that also involve mentoring undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
