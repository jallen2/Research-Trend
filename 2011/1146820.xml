    <AbstractNarration>Both males and females are required for reproduction in most animal species. Producing individuals of both genders requires a gender-determining mechanism during embryonic development to allocate some individuals as males and others as females. In principle, any of a number of genes could be the master gender-determining gene. However, accumulating evidence in vertebrates suggests that one gene, Dmrt1, predominates in this role. This project aims to uncover the role of Dmrt1 as the master gender-determining gene in gecko lizards, a model vertebrate system that reflects the broad diversity of gender-determining mechanisms found in nature. The research will use cutting edge molecular genetic techniques to address the origins and evolution of gender-determining mechanisms in geckos and the potential role of Dmrt1 as the master gender-determining gene in the group. Broader impacts include training of a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduate students. In addition, the results will be distributed to a public audience via a redesigned web portal about gecko biology; articles in the reptile enthusiast literature that stimulate citizen science by encouraging gecko hobbyists to collect and publish egg incubation data; collaboration with the zoo community; and a museum exhibit about gecko evolution and reproduction, featuring live geckos.</AbstractNarration>
