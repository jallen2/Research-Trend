    <AbstractNarration>Center for Telecommunication Circuits and Systems (C1) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1127956 &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1127926 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Telecommunication Circuits and Systems (C1) located at the University of Hawaii site and the Arizona State University site, respectively. Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests NSF funding to develop a novel low-cost and highly integrated microwave based vital signs monitoring device, namely a "microwave stethoscope," that can continuously collect human vital sign data with minimal discomfort to the patient. The vital signs to be measured include the heart rate, breathing rate, stroke volume, and lung water content. The estimation of water distribution in the lungs is also proposed through the use of an array of such applicators with the proper development of array digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms. The development of such a microwave sensor together with the compact, low-cost, low power receiver circuitry and the associated DSP algorithms will allow the mobile use of the device and open broad areas of applications in healthcare patient monitoring, screening of school students, as well as variety of military applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will enable improving healthcare in remote and under privileged communities, and in supporting a variety of in-field and emergency military applications. The developed hardware platform can be an investigative tool for further illness diagnosis. This project will enable use of millimeter wave integrated circuits for high accuracy monitoring of human health, and provides a new diagnosis tool to a wide array of medical doctors including epidemiologists, pediatricians, and family physicians.</AbstractNarration>
