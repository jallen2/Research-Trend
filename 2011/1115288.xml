    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to develop a strong theoretical &lt;br/&gt;foundation on local properties of finite element solutions for advection-&lt;br/&gt;dominated optimal control problems. The advection-diffusion partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations (PDEs) are known to be difficult to approximate because &lt;br/&gt;their solutions often exhibit discontinuities, layers, and shocks. The &lt;br/&gt;structure of the solutions to optimal control problems is even more &lt;br/&gt;complicated because of the coupling in the optimality system of the governing &lt;br/&gt;advection-dominated PDE with an advection-dominated adjoint PDE. It is known &lt;br/&gt;that convergence behavior of finite element methods applied to single &lt;br/&gt;advection-dominated PDEs can be very different from the convergence behavior &lt;br/&gt;of finite element methods applied to advection-dominated optimal control &lt;br/&gt;problems. Understanding the global and local convergence behavior is crucial &lt;br/&gt;for reliable and efficient solution of advection-dominated optimal control &lt;br/&gt;problems, especially in the presence of control and state constraints, and &lt;br/&gt;objective functions that depend on pointwise state information. This project &lt;br/&gt;intends to deepen our understanding for various problems and to help develop &lt;br/&gt;reliable numerical methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics proved to be extremely useful in modeling many real life problems &lt;br/&gt;coming from environment, technology, climate, and etc. However, many &lt;br/&gt;mathematical models require special parameters that can not be measured &lt;br/&gt;directly. Examples can be shapes in modeling technological devises, physical &lt;br/&gt;coefficients in environmental processes, controls in navigation and etc. and &lt;br/&gt;need to be estimated. Mathematically, estimation of such paramters often &lt;br/&gt;leads to optimization problems with constraints in the form of system partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations (PDEs). Usually, such system of PDEs is well understood &lt;br/&gt;and there are many available numerical techniques to solve it. However, it &lt;br/&gt;does not immediately apply that the method that works well for the underlying &lt;br/&gt;system of PDEs will work for the constrained optimization problem. In our &lt;br/&gt;previous work, we showed such differences in the case of a simple model &lt;br/&gt;problem. In this proposal we intend to investigate more complicated model &lt;br/&gt;problems that cover a broader range of applications.</AbstractNarration>
