    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Rochester. The objective of this site is to offer undergraduate students nationwide the opportunity to take part in forefront physics research in eight subfields: particle and nuclear physics, quantum optics, condensed matter, biological, plasma, astrophysics, geo- and environmental physics, and physics education. Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. The program may include minicourses in machining, Linux/Unix, MATLAB and a GRE preparation course offered in conjunction with other summer undergraduate programs. REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities, social outings and may also take part in the department's summer outreach activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; in addition students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences. REU activities engage undergraduates in projects such as physical chemistry, cosmic ray and high-energy particle detection, and geo- and astrophysics data analysis using web-based databases.</AbstractNarration>
