    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop network protocols and optimization&lt;br/&gt;techniques to efficiently utilize the spectrum white spaces for cognitive radio networks.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach is based on a novel cognitive radio network (CRN) network&lt;br/&gt;architecture under which effective design methodologies can be developed to take better&lt;br/&gt;advantage of cognitive radio technologies in harvesting and managing unutilized&lt;br/&gt;spectrum for better service provisioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will first study the proposed CRN architecture to enable collective spectrum&lt;br/&gt;sensing and let the secondary service provider manage the harvested spectrum for better&lt;br/&gt;spectral efficiency while shifting the design complexity from the user side to the system&lt;br/&gt;side. They will then investigate how to split traffic over harvested spectral bands to&lt;br/&gt;balance the risk and reward, how to optimally utilize the spectral resource by jointly&lt;br/&gt;designing frequency allocation and routing while supporting traffic demands, and how to&lt;br/&gt;maximize the throughput by joint link scheduling and routing. The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;outcome will lay the solid foundation for practical implementation of CRNs, which could &lt;br/&gt;potentially revolutionizes the way how cognitive radios should be more effectively used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research outcome will significantly advance the state of the art in CRNs, opening a&lt;br/&gt;new avenue to designing smart living environments for public safety, disaster rescue,&lt;br/&gt;mobile healthcare and online social networks to improve peoples quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;Research findings will be disseminated through publications and talks, and in classroom&lt;br/&gt;teaching. This project will also actively recruit and train minority students for future&lt;br/&gt;workforce and mentor junior faculty.</AbstractNarration>
