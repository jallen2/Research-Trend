    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of the proposed project are to develop physically sound and mathematically rig-&lt;br/&gt;orous diffuse-interface models for tumor growth, to analyze the well-posedness of problems based on&lt;br/&gt;these models, to design efficient time-stepping schemes and finite-element discretization algorithms,&lt;br/&gt;to build the computer software implementing these algorithms, and to develop solution verification&lt;br/&gt;methods based on a posteriori error estimation. The focus of the research work will be on the devel-&lt;br/&gt;opment and analysis of mathematical models that describe at the continuum scale avascular growth&lt;br/&gt;of tumors, i.e. in the absence of nearby blood vessels, and aim at predicting the evolution of large tu-&lt;br/&gt;morous regions while ignoring the behavior of individual cells. Continuum models of tumor growth&lt;br/&gt;can be derived from first principles through the continuum theory of mixtures. Mixture theory pro-&lt;br/&gt;vides an elegant and general framework for modeling multicomponent media such, as living tissue,&lt;br/&gt;composed of several species of interacting constituents. A remarkable property of phenomenological&lt;br/&gt;models based on mixture theory is that, when considering the concentration gradients of various&lt;br/&gt;constituents into the Helmholtz free energy functionals, one obtains diffuse-interface models that&lt;br/&gt;introduce smooth transitional boundaries between the various constituents. The resulting equa-&lt;br/&gt;tions are systems of the Cahn-Hilliard type, namely complex systems of nonlinear time-dependent&lt;br/&gt;fourth-order partial-differential equations. Such diffuse-interface tumor-growth models have been&lt;br/&gt;proposed only recently in the literature and the mathematical analysis and development of efficient&lt;br/&gt;discretizations for such systems are only in the initial stage. The main objectives in this research&lt;br/&gt;project are thus to address several important open issues related to the development of spatio-&lt;br/&gt;temporal diffuse-interface phase field models for computer predictions of tumor growth, including:&lt;br/&gt;(1) development of formulations that satisfy thermodynamical properties of the system; (2) devel-&lt;br/&gt;opment of a rigorous mathematical framework for the analysis of tumor-growth models based on&lt;br/&gt;gradient ow theory; (3) development of new stable and high-order accurate time-stepping schemes&lt;br/&gt;by using semi-implicit splitting approaches; and (4) development of efficient goal-oriented error&lt;br/&gt;estimation algorithms for the control of spatial and temporal discretization errors for the highly&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear time-dependent coupled problem embodied by the proposed tumor-growth models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cancer is a disease of the genome, characterized by uncontrolled cellular growth and invasion,&lt;br/&gt;that afflicts every year millions of Americans from all age categories. The primary motivation&lt;br/&gt;of the research project is thus concerned with one of the grand challenges of our times, that&lt;br/&gt;is, to understand the mechanisms of cancer so that reliable treatments, or better, preventative&lt;br/&gt;measures, can be determined to relieve the impact this disease has on so many people. It has&lt;br/&gt;turned out to be a difficult endeavor, due to many reasons, but the most important ones could&lt;br/&gt;be that there are more than one hundred different types of cancer and the causes and effects of&lt;br/&gt;each type occur on a wide range of scales-specific mutations happen at the molecular scale while&lt;br/&gt;tumors may invade a significant portion of the human body. It is not too uncommon to believe&lt;br/&gt;that biologists or medical physicians are the main players in cancer research; however, more and&lt;br/&gt;more scientists from other disciplines, such as mathematics or physics, are getting involved in&lt;br/&gt;the investigation of possible causes of tumor development and behavior. It is in fact our hope&lt;br/&gt;that mathematical and computational tools could provide new insights that could help guide more&lt;br/&gt;fundamental research issues to be addressed by biologists and medical physicians. We believe that&lt;br/&gt;computer simulations represent powerful means for furthering discovery and acquiring scientific&lt;br/&gt;knowledge. These simulations will help in the future explore detailed mechanisms of tumor growth&lt;br/&gt;in natural environments that cannot be directly studied in patients.</AbstractNarration>
