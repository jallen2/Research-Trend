    <AbstractNarration>The project is to design and implement: 1) CNC machine control simulator systems to enhance the cognitive learning aspects of online laboratories; and 2) simulator interfaces for metrology and quality control systems to enhance the cognitive learning aspects of online labs. Project activities also include improving and re-developing seven current industrial training modules covering High Speed CNC machining, prototyping, machine tool calibration, precision metrology, offline and online quality control, remote monitoring and supervision of machining and robotic assembly processes, and quality assurance and computer aided design/machining (CAD/CAM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance knowledge and understanding of student learning in laboratory experience that combines actual and virtual components and is delivered both in person/on location and through the Internet. The model has the potential to transform the training process for the workforce in various sectors, regardless of their location, to meet the needs of the relevant industries. Existing knowledge about student learning serves as a base upon which the project activity is built, along with experiences in a pilot version of one of the proposed labs in which students reported a high level of verisimilitude in the lab exercises. The commitment to sustain the project after the end of NSF funding comes from both the institution and industry partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training model has the potential to significantly lower training costs in precision-manufacturing. The project will increase the number of students and graduates in mechanical and industrial technology programs to meet the industry's demand for a skilled workforce.</AbstractNarration>
