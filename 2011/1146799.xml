    <AbstractNarration>Logic circuits, hence the computational electronic systems that they enable, have to date been implemented primarily with CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) transistors. The improvement in CMOS technology for the past several decades has led to remarkable progress in electronic system capabilities and complexity. As we reach the physical limits of this progress, there is a need to explore radical new technologies and corresponding circuits that will enable similar progress in the future. This project explores the use of magnetic state of electrons, rather than the typical measure of total electron charge, to define the logic states that represent the signal information. Since magnetic state has previously been used only to construct memory or storage devices, its use for logic circuits requires this project to explore and co-optimize novel magnetic devices and new circuit technologies that incorporate them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through direct collaboration with industry, the aforementioned novel devices and circuits could enable new electronic products and markets in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, collaboration is planned with Entrepreneuring Youth (www.eyouthamerica.org), a nonprofit organization in Pittsburgh that designs middle school and high school programs that use entrepreneurial learning and business creation to engage young people in learning. The technical aspects of this work will be used as a platform to expand the coverage of magnetics in the middle schools, high schools and undergraduate college curriculums.</AbstractNarration>
