    <AbstractNarration>In order to meet the demand for workers in the nuclear technology field, Wallace Community College (WCC) in partnership with local secondary schools, vocational centers, universities, and Southern Nuclear Power Company offers a high quality nuclear technology program that incorporates education and training at the secondary school, vocational, and community college levels. This partnership generates new talent in the instrumentation and control subsections of nuclear technology. Southern Nuclear Company has pointed to this skill as a key labor shortfall area. Project participants are undergoing professional development that results in an improved quality of education and training received by students. The new and existing courses at WCC are taught primarily by existing faculty with additional instruction from subject area experts from Plant Farley. WCC and partners are educating faculty in order to maintain a nationwide supply of highly qualified nuclear technicians. The project enhances the skill sets of instructors in disciplines related to nuclear technology. Existing courses and new courses are presently taught by faculty members who have a limited knowledge of the nuclear power industry. These instructors are being provided with industry related training so that they understand how the skills they are teaching are applied to the nuclear technology field.</AbstractNarration>
