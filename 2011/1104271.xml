    <AbstractNarration>This project is expanding workforce preparation for water quality operators in the environmental technology industry through a partnership of Red Rocks Community College with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Regis University, Western State College, and the Colorado State University-Global Campus. It is producing a statewide training network that expands access to workforce preparation for water quality management technicians by: 1) developing and adapting curricula for online delivery that is supported by a mobile hands-on learning lab; 2) providing outreach and mentorship for the inclusion of women in the industry; and 3) establishing seamless career pathways through articulation agreements with 4-year institutions that lead to accelerated, dual and concurrent enrollment bachelors and masters degree programs. The project is engaging industry experts to define sustainability competencies for the twenty-first century water workforce, to develop and enhance curricula, and to refine instructional strategies. More specifically, the project is adapting water quality management foundational courses to include the industry-identified competencies; developing continuing education coursework to facilitate incumbent worker skills upgrades; adapting a water quality management degree program for online delivery that is being enhanced by the mobile training lab; and establishing a regional hands-on training network through partnerships with business and industry. As a result, the project is producing 1) updated course materials that prepare students to understand the importance of sustainability for the water industry; 2) enhanced entrance and persistence of women in the water quality management program; 3) increased enrollment in the water quality management degree program; 4) increased attainment of Class A and B water and wastewater licenses by incumbent workers; 5) the establishment of transfer agreements with colleges and universities; and 6) the establishment of a cadre of trained instructors to deliver online and regional hands-on training. Collectively, these efforts are developing pathways into advanced education required by an increasingly complex industry, and producing a more diverse pool of highly qualified water quality technicians.</AbstractNarration>
