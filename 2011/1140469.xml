    <AbstractNarration>This project launches a novel research-teaching integration program where undergraduate fellow-faculty mentor teams conduct basic research at a level suitable for publication in peer-reviewed journals and use the results to develop new lectures and/or laboratory modules. The modules are then presented by the undergraduate fellows in undergraduate courses taught at the University of Texas at El Paso and at the El Paso Community College (EPCC), as appropriate. Students enrolled in the courses evaluate how effectively their undergraduate peers design and deliver the modules, while their learning outcomes are evaluated by traditional means such as tests and/or lab reports. Evaluation results are analyzed and used to improve the program. Integrating mentored research, guided curriculum design, and peer-led teaching and learning is expected to have a synergistic effect, the impact of which extends beyond the training of sponsored students, scientific discoveries, and new teaching strategies. The project is expected to provide research data on how effectively STEM undergraduate learning, retention, graduation rates and career preparation are enhanced through training and skills improvement of undergraduate fellows. The new modules, along with research and evaluation results, are being disseminated locally and nationally at symposia and conferences.</AbstractNarration>
