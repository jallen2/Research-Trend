    <AbstractNarration>The project of this awarded proposal is a conference, entitled "Ergodic Theory and Related Fields Workshop". It will be held at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from March 17 to March 21, 2011. The workshop will focus on a fundamental theme in ergodic theory: connections between ergodic theory and number theory. Several of the topics covered are central and extremely active areas of current research in ergodic theory; limit theorems for the Gauss map, rigidity of group actions, the pointwise convergence of nonconventional ergodic averages and the pointwise convergence of ergodic averages along subsequences of integers). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds provided will support participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs and young faculty. Young researchers will be given ample opportunities to speak and to participate in the conference activities and will be exposed to the latest developments in the connections between number theory and ergodic theory.</AbstractNarration>
