    <AbstractNarration>The Cyber Defense Education and Training (C-DET) Scholarship Program offered by Norfolk State University (NSU) Information Assurance, Research, Education and Development Institute (IA-REDI) is a Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program which is supporting three cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students in Information Assurance (IA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highly trained NSU IA-REDI faculty with expertise in information assurance are serving as instructors and mentors for the SFS Scholars. C-DET Scholars are engaging in cutting edge research projects and have access to state of the art equipment and IA industry leaders. The goals of this project include: (a) Guiding students in obtaining meaningful summer internships and permanent placement in the Federal Government. (b) Providing mentoring and close monitoring to ensure their success in the program. (c) Involving students in research projects and requiring presentations on IA topics to faculty and peers in an active seminar series. (d) Providing scholarship recipients with opportunities to interact with IA experts from industry and academia via guest lectures and industry tours. (e) Engaging scholarship recipients in organizations such as the Information Assurance Club, and competitions such as the Mid-Atlantic Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) and the Digital Forensics Challenge (DC3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is having an immediate impact on the cybersecurity capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with security skills to federal agencies. NSU's Computer Science Department consists of approximately 300 undergraduate and graduate students of which 90% belong to various minority groups. The establishment of this scholarship program is having an immediate impact on increasing the number of trained IA professionals from under-represented groups entering the Federal Cyber Service program. The project is conducting IA awareness and education activities involving high school students through various departmental and university liaison programs.</AbstractNarration>
