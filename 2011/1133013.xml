    <AbstractNarration>This U.S. - Chile award will support a small workshop on alluvial fan research, accompanied with a field visit to the semiarid region of central Chile. The conditions under which climate variability in arid and semiarid regions affects sediment transfer and deposition from hillslopes to alluvial landforms are well documented in only a few regions in the world. In order to successfully expand knowledge on this multidisciplinary subject, research collaborations in paleoenvironmental reconstruction, paleoclimate, pedology and geomorphology are needed. This project will link complementary research expertise in Chile (Universidad del Norte, Universidad de La Serena, and Universidad de Chile) and the US (Desert Research Institute, DRI). Additionally, this new collaboration will link alluvial processes and landforms to Quaternary climate variability and result in the development of joint research projects. DRI will contribute expertise on soil and chronological analyses of alluvial landforms in arid regions around the world, while the Chilean researchers will contribute extensive experience on South America paleoclimate and geomorphology. The workshop will be organized by Dr. Jose Antinao from DRI in collaboration with Drs. Antonio Maldonado, Rodrigo Riquelme, and Gabriel Vargas from Universidad de la Serena, Universidad del Norte, and Universidad de Chile, respectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multidisciplinary nature of the proposed workshop and field visit will promote field-based interactions between researchers and students from both countries and will involve one early-career PI and one graduate student from the US. Furthermore, this project will allow for a broader testing of conceptual geomorphic models for alluvial fan evolution. Currently most of these models are derived from Northern Hemisphere sites. A more precise calibration of variables involved in these models will have a positive impact in our ability to predict effects of future global change in arid and semiarid alluvial landscapes. Improved forecasts of the combined hydrologic, ecological and geomorphic response of hillslopes, and associated alluvial systems, are of high societal relevance. They allow for efficient planning of resource allocation and mitigation of natural hazards, which benefits a large, vulnerable population across the globe. This workshop is supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering, Americas Program and the Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Earth Sciences, Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics Program.</AbstractNarration>
