    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the organization of a three-day international workshop on structural health monitoring at Stanford University. The workshop activities will integrate advanced sensing technology with diagnostics, prognostics, and knowledge of material/structural damage characteristics to assess the health of structures in service to prevent structural catastrophes, minimize downtime and sustain performance, and reduce maintenance cost. The workshop will review the current developments in this area, identify key and emerging research issues, and promote exchanges and crossfertilization across different disciplines such as sensors and sensor systems, networking, computing, data mining, integrated design, diagnostics, prognostics, signal processing, multifunctional materials, and applications such as civil infrastructures, ground/air/space transportation vehicles, and marine structures. The workshop will consists of keynote lectures by distinguished individuals from industry, university, and government, technical and poster presentations, and meeting of expert panels to discuss key issues and concerns to the industry and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide a multi-disciplinary forum for exchange of scientific information between researchers, practitioners and students. A special faculty-student panel discussion is organized to establish a direct interface between students and distinguished researchers/academicians around the world. The workshop will produce proceedings of the technical presentations made by different researchers and form a scientific committee to develop guidelines and recommendations for government agencies and industry to promote structural health monitoring research and its application on buildings and civil infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
