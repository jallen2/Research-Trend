    <AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;During embryonic development, the identity of cells in tissues and organs is determined by a series of asymmetric divisions. Cell asymmetry is controlled by two mechanisms: cell polarity and cytokinesis. Errors in these events often lead to changes in cell proliferation and growth. The plasma membrane and underlying cell cortex play an important role in cell polarity and cytokinesis, yet very little is known about how it is regulated and maintained during development. To address this issue, the project is focused on the protein dynamin, which has an essential role in both of these events. It is hypothesized that dynamin influences cell polarity and facilitates the temporal and spatial control of the cytokinesis machinery through its role in endocytosis and actin dynamics. This project will employ an interdisciplinary strategy to reveal the role of the dynamin using a combination of genetics, cell and molecular biology and high-resolution, in vivo microscopy techniques. The project will focus on the early divisions of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;The work outlined in this proposal will be used in numerous minority outreach opportunities and scientific art shows. The P.I., Dr. Ahna Skop has extensive experience with outreach to minority groups at the local, state and national levels. Through her consistent involvement in the SACNAS, AISES and MARC programs at New Mexico State University, she has contributed to a very positive trend in minority graduate student enrollment on the UW-Madison campus. The P.I.'s dedication to increasing and retaining minority, undergraduate and graduate students in the STEM fields is a priority, and part of her mission is to make science accessible to every race and group and welcome these students any chance she gets. In addition, the P.I. has continued to pursue the curation of various scientific art shows nationally and internationally, which inherently promote the beauty of science and provide public access to scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
