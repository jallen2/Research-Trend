    <AbstractNarration>The Academic Scholars Program is awarding 15 annual scholarships that average $7,000 per academic year to academically talented, but financially needy, students majoring in Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Outreach efforts focus on women and minorities underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Activities are designed and implemented to support the Academic Scholars Program as a whole, including efforts to expand and institutionalize this program. Scholarship recipients move through each phase of their educational programs as a cohort, but also receive personalized encouragement and support through an ongoing relationship with their Academic Scholars Mentor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The Academic Scholars program builds upon the framework developed for the prior S-STEM project (0631133) and incorporates the lessons learned during the successful management of that project as well as utilizing a comprehensive evaluation process to improve success. Successful program components include: &lt;br/&gt;(a) The utilization of Individual Education Plans for each scholarship recipient as well as an Academic Scholars Mentor who monitors academic progress. &lt;br/&gt;(b) The creation of a STEM student cohort through the College Success Center. &lt;br/&gt;(c) The participation of scholarship recipients in field experiences which offer application-oriented experiences. &lt;br/&gt;(d) Increased collaboration between faculty and students in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The Academic Scholars Program is critical in advancing the knowledge and understanding of science, engineering, technology and mathematics in an Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) campus comprised of highly diverse, economically disadvantaged, and academically talented students. This program is broadening opportunities and enabling participation for underrepresented groups of students to pursue degrees in STEM disciplines. The outcomes from the program objectives are being broadly disseminated in order that other colleges may replicate the program.</AbstractNarration>
