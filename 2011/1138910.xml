    <AbstractNarration>ACM Special Interest Group of Multimedia, ACM Multimedia has contributed significantly to the advance of all aspects of multimedia research, technologies and applications since 1993. Through the continuous efforts of the community, ACM Multimedia has become a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction, including presentation and discussion of research papers, participation in tutorials, demos, doctoral symposium, industrial grand challenge competitions, and art exhibitions. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and their current research with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry. ACM Multimedia 2011 (ACM MM 2011) is to be held in Scottsdale, Arizona, November 28 - December 1, 2011 and is expected to attract many US and international attendees from academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for ACM MM 2011 education related events, namely the Doctoral Symposium, Face-to-face Meeting with Leading Researchers, the Open Source Competition and partial travel expenses and registration for about 20 US-based students; in particular, female and minority students and students presenting in the doctoral symposium and participating open source software competition. A Female Student Mentoring Workshop will be supported by a separate funding from the ACM SIGMM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes the opportunity for students to learn about the cutting edge research and interact with experts in the top multimedia conference. The broad impact is to train and develop the future generation of leaders and workforce in this critical field, as well as enhancing the participation of women and minority students in multimedia research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACM Multimedia proceedings are published by ACM. The student award application procedure and results will be announced at the ACM MM 2011 conference website (http://www.acmmm11.org).</AbstractNarration>
