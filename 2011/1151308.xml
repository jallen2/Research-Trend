    <AbstractNarration>In scattering theory, due to the complexity of material properties and uncertainty in physical models and parameters, precise modeling and accurate computing present challenging and significant mathematical and computational questions. The PI proposes to develop mathematical models, examine mathematical issues, and design computational methods for new and important classes of direct and inverse problems that arise from the acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation in complex and random environments. The mathematical modeling techniques and computational methods developed in this project address several key scientific challenges in applied and computational mathematics, which include: (1) multi-scale modeling and computation of the wave propagation in a heterogeneous medium; (2) computational stochastic direct and inverse scattering problems; (3) numerical solution of Maxwell's equations and well-posedness of associated models; (4) global uniqueness, local stability, and numerical solution of the ill-posed inverse scattering problems. The educational plan is to foster greater awareness of the broad and important applications of mathematics so as to attract more students in pursuing a major, a minor, or a graduate degree in mathematics. The proposed education activities include: (1) undergraduate and graduate courses and curriculum development; (2) mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc research; (3) organizing summer schools, seminars, and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dramatic growth of computational capability and the development of fast algorithms have transformed the methodology for scientific investigation and industrial applications in the field of scattering theory. Reciprocally, the practical applications and scientific developments have driven the need for more sophisticated mathematical models and numerical algorithms to describe the scattering of complicated structures, and to accurately compute acoustic and electromagnetic fields and thus to predict the performance of a given structure, as well as to carry out optimal design of new structures. The proposed computational models and tools are highly promising for qualitative and quantitative study of the complex physical and mathematical problems in optics and electromagnetics, and provide an inexpensive and easily controllable virtual prototype of the structures in the design and fabrication of optical and electromagnetic devices. The research is multidisciplinary by nature and lies at the interface of mathematics, physics, engineering, and materials sciences. In addition, it has significant potential to advance the frontiers of applied and computational mathematics, and even to have impact on other branches of science.</AbstractNarration>
