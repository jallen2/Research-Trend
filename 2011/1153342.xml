    <AbstractNarration>College of Menominee Nation (CMN) seeks to increase the number of CMN&lt;br/&gt;STEM students participating in external research-based student internship opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;External research is defined as research outside of CMN and outside of the Menominee&lt;br/&gt;Reservation and other local communities. The project is expected to increase STEM student&lt;br/&gt;retention, graduation, and matriculation rates.&lt;br/&gt;The project uses three strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#1048696; Development and coordination of the project: Key activities include hiring a researchbased&lt;br/&gt;internship coordinator, reviewing feasibility of requiring research-based internships for&lt;br/&gt;STEM degree attainment, coordination of advisory board meetings, and leveraging of outside&lt;br/&gt;partners to establish consistent research-based internships.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#1048696; Efforts to institutionalize the project: Key activities under strategy two include researching,&lt;br/&gt;and organizing the research opportunities, creating a database of opportunities, developing&lt;br/&gt;and coordinating processes, developing and maintaining a research-based internship&lt;br/&gt;webpage, and leveraging funding to provide student support for such opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#1048696; Provision of critical student support activities aimed at increasing STEM student&lt;br/&gt;participation in external research-based internship opportunities: Activities include&lt;br/&gt;recruiting STEM students to participate in program, matching students to appropriate&lt;br/&gt;opportunities, assisting with applications, and preparation for requirements, and interviews,&lt;br/&gt;assisting students make connections, encouraging students through the process, advocating&lt;br/&gt;for student acceptance into internship programs, providing extensive follow-up and developing&lt;br/&gt;and coordinating a series of workshops related to research-based internships.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Tribal Colleges are key contributors to the body of knowledge on American&lt;br/&gt;Indians. To date many Tribal Colleges have integrated research opportunities into their STEM&lt;br/&gt;capacity; however the focus has been on providing these opportunities within the context of the&lt;br/&gt;tribal colleges system and community. Although these experiences are indeed valuable to&lt;br/&gt;gaining student interest and are providing numerical increases in retention and graduation rates,&lt;br/&gt;they exclude critical exposure opportunities for students outside of the institution and outside of&lt;br/&gt;the community. To date, CMN has documented increased retention and graduation rates of&lt;br/&gt;students participating in external research. However these are only a handful of students. It is&lt;br/&gt;critical that further study on the importance and impacts of external research-based internship&lt;br/&gt;opportunities within the tribal college system take place. Such data will focus on the impacts of&lt;br/&gt;external student research and how it achieves the ultimate outcomes of NSF?s investment in&lt;br/&gt;tribal colleges: ensuring students graduate, matriculate into four-year and graduate STEM&lt;br/&gt;programs, and enter the workforce system as diverse qualified individuals.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: CMN?s project will build upon the research of the several NSF TCUP grants&lt;br/&gt;it has completed, continuing the investigation of essential research in discovering and&lt;br/&gt;understanding how Tribal Colleges and the unique strategies they implement promote STEM&lt;br/&gt;education in minority students. As an institution that serves predominantly Native American&lt;br/&gt;students, CMN?s project further advances the research of American Indian undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;education in STEM courses and programs as well as contributes to the global body of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge in underrepresented minority STEM education. Short term impacts include increases&lt;br/&gt;in retention and graduation rates at CMN. Long-term project impacts include an increase of&lt;br/&gt;American Indians in four year and graduate STEM programs as well as an increase in American&lt;br/&gt;Indians in STEM employment fields.</AbstractNarration>
