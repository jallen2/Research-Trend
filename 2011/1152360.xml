    <AbstractNarration>Todd Emrick at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry in research on polymer-nanoparticle assembly. Key challenges in macromolecular and nanoscale chemistry include a pressing need to uncover robust routes towards hybrid nanoscale structures that effectively, and precisely, combine synthetic organic polymers with inorganic nanoparticulates. This project seeks to develop the surface chemical functionalization of semiconductor tetrapods, nanorods, and spherical nanoparticles, as well as carbon-based particles like fullerenes and graphene sheets, in facile routes to self-assembled systems and hybrid materials. This requires implementing three primary aspects of polymer/nanoscale chemistry, including: 1) effective nanoparticle grafting chemistry, whereby conventional syntheses of metal and semiconductor nanomaterials are enhanced through the development of novel ligand chemistry, giving functional particles with tailored solubility, reactivity, and processibility; 2) solution assembly of functionalized nanoparticles with polymers, such that well-organized hybrid materials can be realized through simple processing methods; and 3) characterization of the impact of the resultant hybrid materials towards understanding the relationship between nanocomposite morphology and electronic/photophysical properties. The project will lead to numerous advances in the chemistry of nanoparticle functionalization, such as long strings of nanoparticles/nanorods that self-assemble in solution and phase separate on surfaces using easily accessible microscopic techniques. Moreover, the platform materials emanating from this project will lead to a realization of novel self-assembled hybrid systems that are relevant for the next generation of devices that utilize charge carrying materials and nanoscale printing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to improve the performance of polymers (i.e., plastics) and tiny metal objects (nanoparticles) for critically important societal needs, including solar cells, memory devices, and printing of complex patterns. Synthetic chemistry is critically important to making advances in these areas. This project especially targets the fabrication of 'well-ordered' materials, whereby polymeric chain-ends are 'tagged' such that they become attracted to (have binding ends for) nanoparticles. The organization of polymers and nanoparticles using these methods will allow solar cell devices to function more efficiently, and complex patterns (of the types used to make microchips) to be developed more economically. The project will be carried out with a strong educational component, involving graduate (Ph.D. level) and undergraduate researchers, while engaging young students (grade school level) with demonstrations and easily comprehensible tutorials that convey the excitement of the science, and enable the students to grasp the concepts, importance, and impact of nanoscale chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
