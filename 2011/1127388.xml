    <AbstractNarration>Traffic generation plays an integral part of cyber-security defense testing in &lt;br/&gt;network testbeds. Generating just any traffic is easy, but generating realistic traffic &lt;br/&gt;is hard. The key reason for this is that "realistic" means different things to different &lt;br/&gt;people. The definition of realism depends on the use of the traffic in testing, but &lt;br/&gt;all existing traffic generators have a fixed definition of realism that users cannot &lt;br/&gt;change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will build a traffic generator whose definition of realism can be fully &lt;br/&gt;specified by a user. The generator will consist of three modules: (1) a module that mines values for &lt;br/&gt;user-specified dimensions from traffic logs, (2) a module that generates random &lt;br/&gt;traffic that fits the model mined in the previous step, (3) a module that replays &lt;br/&gt;traffic from a log so that it exactly matches the logged traffic along the user-&lt;br/&gt;specified dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The key novelty of this approach lies in the customizable &lt;br/&gt;definition of realism that the generator will support. By allowing users to specify &lt;br/&gt;their own reality dimensions this project's traffic generation tool will be generic &lt;br/&gt;enough to meet the evaluation needs of any cyber security researcher. Further, &lt;br/&gt;integration of the traffic generation from models and traffic replay in a single &lt;br/&gt;tool is novel; existing tools support only one of these generation approaches. &lt;br/&gt;Finally, the tool will support traffic generation at application, transport or &lt;br/&gt;network level while existing tools support it only at one select level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed work will advance cyber-security defense &lt;br/&gt;research by supporting rigorous and realistic evaluation of its products. It will do &lt;br/&gt;that by both fitting researchers' needs and by being extremely portable and &lt;br/&gt;easy to deploy and use. Because users will be able to customize the definition of &lt;br/&gt;realism as they desire, the evaluation will properly stress the cyber-security &lt;br/&gt;defenses and its results will be predictive of the defenses performance in real &lt;br/&gt;deployment. The traffic generator's capabilities to both generate traffic from &lt;br/&gt;learned models and to replay it from network logs enable a wide range of &lt;br/&gt;testing strategies and support thorough exploration of problem space. Better &lt;br/&gt;evaluation strategies will lead to better cyber-security defenses. The project will &lt;br/&gt;integrate our traffic generator with the DETER testbed for cyber security &lt;br/&gt;experimentation. All software will also be released as open-source under the &lt;br/&gt;GNU GPL v3 license.</AbstractNarration>
