    <AbstractNarration>This award will develop a new type of low-energy neutron detector array, which is to be used at the Resolut radioactive beam facility of Florida State University (FSU). The proposed detector systems use a combination of a p-Terphenyl crystal with a novel type of compact "Planacon" photo multiplier to achieve high sensitivity for low energy neutrons and pulse-shape discrimination to suppress gamma-ray and X-ray background. Four prototype-systems for these detectors have been assembled and tested at FSU. This proposal seeks to acquire all components required for a detector array of twelve detectors, which will be assembled and tested by undergraduate researchers at the University of North Florida (UNF). The complete system will be commissioned in experiments at the John D. Fox accelerator laboratory of Florida State University. The detector array will enable an experimental program to study proton-resonances in the astrophysical rapid proton capture process(rp-process), which will create further opportunities for involvement of UNF undergraduate students in research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of the novel low-energy neutron detector array into the Resolut radioactive beam facility of Florida State University will enable the efficient detection of the remaining neutron from a nuclear collision in which the proton in a deuteron is transferred to an incident heavier nucleus. Such reactions are used as surrogates for studying and calibrating nuclear reaction rates for the rapid proton captures by nuclei that constitute the rp-process which is considered to be a component of explosive stellar nucleosynthesis. This project will provide transformational learning opportunities for undergraduate researchers at UNF who will assemble and test the detector systems, participate in the subsequent commissioning experiments for the neutron detector array at the John D. Fox accelerator laboratory, and analyze data from the commissioning experiments. Following completion of this project, UNF faculty and undergraduates will continue to collaborate on experiments with the nuclear physics group at FSU and the neutron detector array will be available to all users of the Resolut facility.</AbstractNarration>
