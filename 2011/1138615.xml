    <AbstractNarration>This Proposal # 1138615 titles " Workshop on Navigating and Leading Change" is a continuation of the development of a community within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers that supports and mentors researchers from underrepresented groups. The previous workshop conducted through ASME focused on networking and teaching negotiation skills, in addition to facilitating the formation of networks during the workshop itself. &lt;br/&gt;The workshop is designed to provide graduate students, post-doc and faculty members with professional development activities and to give them the opportunity to make connections with an international network of supportive researchers in their field. This conference attracts up to 1100 attendees from all over the world. The proportion of majority-to-minority and male-to-female attendees at the conference reflects the overall low representation of women and minorities in the mechanical engineering profession. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will continue the efforts of the Broadening Participation committee of the ASME to provide professional development opportunities to members from underrepresented groups. The goal of the Broadening Participation committee is to develop, implement and oversee new and existing activities aimed at broadening the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the activities of Design Engineering Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The workshop will introduce the Lifecycle model of understanding self and change. The participants will leave with an appreciation of this systems' approach to understanding and affecting change, and applying what they learn in different situations of their career.</AbstractNarration>
