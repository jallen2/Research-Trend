    <AbstractNarration>1107176 &lt;br/&gt;Spano&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are: 1) to construct an innovative proteinbased&lt;br/&gt;nanometer-sized self-assembling delivery system ("adaptosome") containing&lt;br/&gt;metal particles that will be used for specific cell targeting and 2) to characterize and&lt;br/&gt;refine these structures by Raman spectroscopy. The Localized Surface Plasmon (LSP)&lt;br/&gt;and Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) properties of these metal-protein&lt;br/&gt;hybrid nanoparticles will be exploited for their inherent signal amplification and&lt;br/&gt;transduction properties. These properties have direct application for molecule and cell&lt;br/&gt;identification and for non-destructive sensing. The adaptosome will be a superior&lt;br/&gt;molecular probe capable of precise target cell identification in tissues. The adaptosome&lt;br/&gt;can be used for local inactivation and degradation of targeted molecules and cells. To&lt;br/&gt;achieve these goals a new protein shell based on in vitro self-assembling gene transfer&lt;br/&gt;agent (GTA) prohead system will be constructed and modified with the peptides&lt;br/&gt;designed to mediate specific attachment to, uptake into, and movement across cell&lt;br/&gt;membranes. Highly sensitive molecule identification will be accomplished by monitoring&lt;br/&gt;the vibrational signatures in the local tissue/cellular environment of the particles when&lt;br/&gt;bound to the target. Inactivation of target cells by visible and near IR light when it is&lt;br/&gt;needed will be possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental analyses of the formation and propagation of local electromagnetic&lt;br/&gt;fields in specific biological environments will allow for rational construction of protein shells&lt;br/&gt;and precise selection of nanoparticle size and structure. Spectroscopic testing of the&lt;br/&gt;constructed adaptosomes will be performed both in vitro and in situ to optimize the&lt;br/&gt;structure of the protein shell in the generation of an LSP and, more specifically, to&lt;br/&gt;elucidate the effect of the internal structural organization and pattern of the protein on the&lt;br/&gt;metal nanoparticles. Information gathered from modeling and spectroscopic analysis will&lt;br/&gt;substantially accelerate the proposed research by a priori elimination of non-working&lt;br/&gt;structures and will be used to refine the design principles during construction of the&lt;br/&gt;particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The members of this team bring to bear expertise in separate&lt;br/&gt;disciplines and will interact in a direct, cohesive way. This team has collaborated&lt;br/&gt;successfully for several years on the generation of bio-inspired devices for energy&lt;br/&gt;generation. The work described in this proposal will lead to the construction of an&lt;br/&gt;innovative biosensor and drug delivery system based on protein encapsulated metallic&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles. The product of the work itself will have its most direct application in the&lt;br/&gt;development of chemical and biological sensors and cancer therapy, through cellspecific&lt;br/&gt;targeting. It will also impact areas of modeling of bio-inorganic interfaces,&lt;br/&gt;mathematical optimization theory, and in the physical chemistry of protein-nanoparticle&lt;br/&gt;assembly and interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This proposal is focused on a major unsolved problem in the current&lt;br/&gt;field of chemical and biological defense and in medicine, namely how to target&lt;br/&gt;biosensors or therapeutic agents to tissues and specific cells. Construction of this cell&lt;br/&gt;target-specific probe capable of delivery of a therapeutic agent will open the door to&lt;br/&gt;practical application of innovative principles of chemical and biological sensing and will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate exploration of new avenues in patient-addressed personalized medicine. The&lt;br/&gt;strategy of the utilization of metallic nanoparticles and their inherent SERS diagnostics&lt;br/&gt;that accompanies them will lead to the development of a sub-cellular labeling system&lt;br/&gt;with greatly increased sensitivity and versatility. The proposed system will allow for&lt;br/&gt;simultaneous identification of a non-predefined unlimited number of molecules (including&lt;br/&gt;previously unknown targets) based on their Raman signature. The knowledge that will&lt;br/&gt;be gained from developing the ideas presented in this project will contribute broadly to&lt;br/&gt;several areas in the emerging fields of nanomedicine, protein-metal interactions,&lt;br/&gt;nanoplasmonics, and nanobiology.</AbstractNarration>
