    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes that haptic robots offer effective and&lt;br/&gt;attractive solutions to the common tasks of Bin-Picking and Kitting, which currently require human workers. A&lt;br/&gt;popular application area is programming an industrial robot to work with specific powertrain parts. The&lt;br/&gt;Problem: Bin-picking robots can only manipulate strong parts with simple geometries in structured or semistructured&lt;br/&gt;configurations; machine vision deals poorly with overlapping objects and unstable and unpredictable&lt;br/&gt;loads or grips. The Opportunity: Haptic systems can compliment machine vision systems using tactile sensory&lt;br/&gt;data to cope with overlapping objects and unstable grip conditions. The Solution: A robotic hand/arm&lt;br/&gt;equipped with unique biomimetic tactile sensors to make a platform for developing grip algorithms for parts&lt;br/&gt;picking and kitting. Innovations include develop algorithms for slip-detection and force-cone grip adjustment;&lt;br/&gt;developing adaptive algorithms using tactile feedback to improve grip pre-shaping; validating algorithms with&lt;br/&gt;physical powertrain parts; and challenging algorithms with real-world uncertainties that are difficult to detect&lt;br/&gt;using machine vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will result in robots that have more humanlike haptic&lt;br/&gt;capabilities. Currently robots lack tactile sensing and rely on specialized component feeders and gripping tools&lt;br/&gt;to handle individual objects with predetermined gripping features. These items add cost, occupy space, and&lt;br/&gt;consume time, especially when many different objects must be handled. This puts robots at a significant&lt;br/&gt;disadvantage to human workers who use their hands dexterously to handle an unlimited variety of objects.&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, robots are best suited to handle tasks that are highly repetitive or dangerous to humans. When&lt;br/&gt;robots handle hazardous materials or manufacturing tasks, they relieve humans of these burdens while often&lt;br/&gt;yielding increased productivity and cost-savings. At the end of Phase I we will have developed a proof of&lt;br/&gt;concept so that our Phase II research can integrate the system into an industrial environment. By addressing the&lt;br/&gt;picking of objects with errors in object pose, position and part-to-part interaction, haptic robots will transform&lt;br/&gt;this important part of the manufacturing process. Such technology will have widespread impact on many&lt;br/&gt;aspects of manufacturing and automation.</AbstractNarration>
