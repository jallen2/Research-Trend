    <AbstractNarration>This workshop project helps support the 2012 Finite Element Rodeo conference that takes place in March 2012 at Rice University. The workshop has attracted around one hundred participants mostly from the states of Texas and Louisiana. Registration fees for junior participants are waived. Topics covered in the workshop consist of recent advances in the theory and implementation of the general class of finite element methods, including mixed finite element methods, boundary element methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods and finite volume methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As scientists attempt to solve more and more complex problems, there is an increasing need for accurate and robust numerical methods. Uncertainty, multiple physics, multiple time and spatial scales are examples of challenges associated with complex problems. Participants of the Finite Element Rodeo address those issues by formulation, rigorous analysis and efficient implementation of state-of-the-art numerical methods. The informal nature of the workshop makes it well-suited for introducing new research ideas. Applications discussed in the workshop cover many engineering fields including energy, environment and biomedicine. Networking and collaboration developing is encouraged among participants. A high number of under-represented groups is to be seen in the workshop participants.</AbstractNarration>
