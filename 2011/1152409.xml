    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will optimize and pilot test the &lt;br/&gt;patent-pending Exogen system for the generation of biogas during wastewater &lt;br/&gt;treatment. Based on a newly discovered process called electromethanogenesis, ExogenTM &lt;br/&gt;uses applied voltages and bio-electrodes to increase wastewater treatment rates and &lt;br/&gt;methane fraction compared to competing fixed-film anaerobic digestion processes. Phase &lt;br/&gt;I R&amp;D demonstrated (1) 30% - 50% increase in chemical oxygen demand removal rate, &lt;br/&gt;(2) 30%-60% increase in biogas production, (3) 5 - 18% increase in methane &lt;br/&gt;concentrations with both artificial and real-world wastewater, resulting in a payback &lt;br/&gt;period of 1.7 - 3.7 years. Further benefits include reduction in start-up time and the &lt;br/&gt;potential for real-time automation via direct electrical feedback. During Phase II R&amp;D &lt;br/&gt;Cambrian Innovation will optimize the technology and build a scaled demonstration plant &lt;br/&gt;at a customer site &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to help alleviate the conflicting &lt;br/&gt;demands for water and energy in the United States and across the industrialized world by &lt;br/&gt;enhancing the process of generating energy from wastewater treatment. Anaerobic &lt;br/&gt;digestion can generate energy from wastewater. A recent AgSTAR report has highlighted &lt;br/&gt;the potential for this technology in the U.S., identifying over 8,000 livestock facilities &lt;br/&gt;and numerous industrial sites suitable for the technology. Cambrian's ExogenTM platform &lt;br/&gt;aims to decrease the costs and increase the benefit associated with deploying anaerobic &lt;br/&gt;digestion in key industry segments, resulting in faster diffusion. Eventually the &lt;br/&gt;technology could open up new industries for anaerobic digestion processes. Exogen &lt;br/&gt;further has the potential for carbon sequestration via the direct reduction of CO2 to CH4. &lt;br/&gt;As such, ExogenTM technology offers a broad range of applications with significant &lt;br/&gt;societal benefit.</AbstractNarration>
