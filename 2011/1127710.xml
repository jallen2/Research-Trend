    <AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;Atmospheric science uses data assimilation, a process by which information from disparate sources is combined to produce a representation of the state of the atmosphere at a particular time. These sources include traditional meteorological instruments and computer simulation models, which use observational data collected near the specified time. The data are synthesized in complex ways with one or more simulations of conditions near that time. The resulting representation is known as an analysis. Analyses are produced in this way on a daily basis, and they serve as initial conditions for weather forecasting models. Data assimilation is also performed retrospectively using archives of observational data to produce reanalysis datasets that span several decades. These reanalysis datasets have become a staple of weather and climate research; they are used to investigate atmospheric dynamics, to evaluate climate models, and to make quantitative estimates of recent climate change. Since the products of data assimilation are often used in the roles of traditional observational data, some concerns seem pertinent. Are some of these uses problematic? Or are the differences between traditional observational data and the products of data assimilation not very deep? What place should data assimilation have within contemporary philosophical research on scientific method? These are the overarching questions that motivate this project. The first part of the project will explore the extent to which data assimilation and its products can be reconciled with core concepts in the philosophy of science. Specific questions that are to be addressed in the project include the following. Can data assimilation systems (or perhaps the simulation models they incorporate) be considered observing instruments in their own right, as some scientists have suggested? Are analyses and reanalyses really so different from other data models, which are theory-laden in various ways? If highly accurate and reliable data assimilation systems could be produced, would they deliver measurements of atmospheric conditions in regions where no traditional observational data were collected? The second part of the project will evaluate current uses of data assimilation products (in the roles of traditional observational data) from a methodological point of view. Key questions to be addressed are the following. Does the use of reanalyses to evaluate climate models involve an unacceptable circularity, given that climate models share many assumptions with the simulation models used in reanalysis? More generally, on what grounds can inferences from data assimilation products to conclusions about the real atmosphere (such as those having to do with the causes of atmospheric phenomena or the rates of atmospheric warming) be justified, given that data assimilation products are produced in response to a lack of traditional observational data?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to contribute to both philosophy of science and atmospheric science. In philosophy of science, it will advance understanding of the ways in which computer simulation is changing scientific practice and complicating the theory of knowledge associated with it, currently a major area of interest. In doing so, it will also re-examine some core concepts of the discipline, such as measurement. For atmospheric science, the project will address fundamental methodological questions about data assimilation that have not received the attention they deserve, despite their direct relevance for practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;Results of the project will be disseminated widely in journal articles and in talks, targeting both philosophers and atmospheric scientists. More accessible presentations will also be developed for undergraduate students in meteorology and philosophy. In addition, some of the research has the potential to benefit society, by improving evaluation of the climate models whose climate change projections are an important input to current environmental policy discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Note: This project is jointly funded by STS and CLD (the Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics Program).</AbstractNarration>
