    <AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: &lt;br/&gt;The bacteria that inhabit the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, referred to as the microbiota, generally benefit the overall host physiology and well-being. Recent studies suggest that intestinal microbiota are also major contributors to a complex signaling network in the human gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, it is hypothesized that bacterial molecules produced by the intestinal microbiota will be recognized by intestinal cells as a result of their close spatial association within this ecological niche. At the core of signaling network are tryptophan metabolites that appear to contribute to both the intestinal and microbiota fitness. This project will test the hypothesis that tryptophan metabolites affect dentritic cells in a way that benefits the intestinal environment as well as the microbiota to create a beneficial gut mucosal ecology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: &lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the communication of host cells with signals produced by the intestinal microbiota, which is an important factor in human/microbiota symbiotic relationship. The educational and outreach component of this proposal focuses on two activities to increase the number of underrepresented students that pursue advanced degrees in biological sciences. First, the Principal Investigator serves as a role model for underrepresented students and has established a continuous pipeline of undergraduate students that receive research training in the PI's laboratory. Second, this project will develop an institutional program that creates opportunities for the Texas A&amp;M Hispanic Minority Serving Institution (HSI) in the Texas A&amp;M University System. These students are prepared research and training in graduate or medical school at the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center.</AbstractNarration>
