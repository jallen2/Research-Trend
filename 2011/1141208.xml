    <AbstractNarration>The project is developing and testing a model for improving the preparation of undergraduate pre-service teachers who will go on to teach earth science in grades K-8. Prior semester-length courses in physical geology and educational science methods are being combined into a year-long course taught by both Geology and Education faculty. The course integrates learning of earth-science content with the methodology of how to teach it, producing a next generation of K-8 science educators who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic. In conjunction with revised classes and laboratory experiences, pre-service teachers are developing shared digital portfolios of teaching resources. An additional effort is testing the impact of a preparatory, four-day intensive field experience on learning by pre-service teachers who enroll in the year-long course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through explicit integration of content and pedagogy, the project is directly addressing the lack of preparation in physical science and learning about the nature of science among many pre-service elementary and middle-school teachers. Beyond contributing to the future teacher workforce in the region, the project is also disseminating the model of a collaborative, integrated science/education course to a national audience through web resources and conference workshops.</AbstractNarration>
