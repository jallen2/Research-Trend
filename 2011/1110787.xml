    <AbstractNarration>Understanding how speciation happens is a long-standing and exciting challenge in biology. Zones of secondary contact, or areas where previously-isolated lineages meet and interact, are one way to test hypotheses and theories about speciation. This study investigates a unique system in the Australian rainforest, in which there are over twenty overlapping zones of secondary contact. This study considers four such contacts within a closely-related group of lizards to investigate patterns of introgression, or gene exchange, across the zone. In particular, this study examines how evolutionary forces, such as demographic processes and selection, influence introgression, and more generally, the evolution of barriers between species. To test these predictions, high-throughput sequencing will be used to develop genomic resources, and fine-scale sampling and genotyping of populations in the contact zone will be used to measure rates of introgression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will serve as an excellent vehicle to engage with students and to conduct outreach activities. Undergraduate students in both the United States and Australia will develop their own independent laboratory and field projects related to this project. Additionally, this research will be shared with underserved middle school and community college students through outreach programs. Finally, this research will generate new genomic and bioinformatic tools for use by the greater research community.</AbstractNarration>
