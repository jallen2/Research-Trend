    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Melissa Pespeni is "Revealing the genetic underpinnings of morphological diversity in horned dung beetles." The host institution for this research is Indiana University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Armin Moczek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horned dung beetles in the genus Onthophagus are the most speciose genus in the world, with some 2000 species described. These beetles originated in Africa and diversified with the diversification of mammals by feeding on the dung of specific mammal species. Most interestingly, species differ with radical variations in horn morphology, changing the size, shape and number of horns developing from their heads and thorax. Several genes that are known to be important in the development of other insects that lack these novel horn structures have been identified as critical for the development of diverse horn morphologies in dung beetles. Recently developed genomic and gene expression information make Onthophagus beetles a useful model for developmental biology in general and a valuable biological system for this study of the genetic underpinnings of morphological diversity and gene expression at various stages of development and in morphologically distinct yet closely related species. The scientific impacts include determining the genetic basis of evolutionary change that enables or constrains adaptive evolution and evolutionary responses on a changing planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include learning developmental genetic techniques and applying genome-wide studies in a comparative, evolutionary, and developmental framework. Broader impacts of this fellowship include assisting conservation efforts and inspiring interest in biology when shared in K-12 classrooms, with undergraduates, at conferences, and in popular and scientific publications.</AbstractNarration>
