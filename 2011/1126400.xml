    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is the development of innovative modeling, operation, and planning methods for increased efficiency, reliability, and renewability in "smart" electric power systems. Essential to this work is the integrated electric power system test bed, which provides researchers with hardware for physical implementation and testing. It emulates a three-phase system with digital communication, renewable energy, and energy storage capabilities. The following approaches to research will be employed: 1) application of measurement-based techniques to load modeling, 2) implementation of effective demand response, 3) application of fast state estimation and optimal power flow analyses to operation and planning, and 4) utilization of storage to increase penetration of renewable energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator has significant research experience in smart grid technology and renewable energy. His most recent works are accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid and Elsevier International Journal of Electric Power and Energy Systems. The proposed research builds upon his previous work; however, it also explores the use of physical experimentation to make even greater contributions to these fields. This work is unique, because it employs hardware present at few academic institutions in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The power system test bed will support multiple senior keystone projects per year as well as play significant role in the investigator?s "Power Systems and Renewability" course. Additionally, it will be utilized for high school student outreach programs in conjunction with the College's Center for Excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics which will benefit local lower and middle class youth.</AbstractNarration>
