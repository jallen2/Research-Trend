    <AbstractNarration>The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips and systems, for technical exchange on current areas of architectural challenge. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded conference by obtaining travel support for students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in the ISCA conference June 4-8, 2011 in San Jose, California as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC). &lt;br/&gt;Up to 30 U.S.-based students (averaging $500 each) to be supported by the award. The majority of the awards to be granted to Ph.D. students. Priority will be granted to students who have authored papers accepted for presentation at the conference or its joint workshops, in particular those students without existing travel support.</AbstractNarration>
