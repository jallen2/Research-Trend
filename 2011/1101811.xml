    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop photon-based quantum information technology for transmitting and processing information in ways not possible using classical-physics-based techniques. This project is developing a new technique for quantum frequency translation?a noiseless form of wavelength conversion operating at the single- or few-photon level, which is important for several reasons: 1) for interfacing between quantum memory operating at visible wavelengths and infrared photons for long-distance fiber transmission, 2) for interfacing between different quantum memories operating at distinct but nearby wavelengths, and 3) for shifting telecom-band photons into the visible where higher-efficiency single-photon detectors are available. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in developing four-wave mixing in highly nonlinear optical fibers as a means to implement dynamic Bragg scattering. Using this new capability there is a wide range of important processes to pursue experimentally, including: 1) entanglement swapping in the spectral-temporal domain; 2) two-color, two-photon interference, 3) spectral-temporal transformation of single-photon states, 4) spectral-temporal transformation (including frequency translation) of states other than single-photon states, 5) spectral-temporal mode filtering and multiplexing of single-photon states.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are in quantum information technology and developing the technical workforce, as well as educating the general university student population in communications science. Nonlinear optics offers excellent opportunities to integrate research with science education, by connecting the research materials and personnel with course teaching. The PI helped start a new Science Literacy Program at the University of Oregon, and developed a course called The Physics Behind the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
