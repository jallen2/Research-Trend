    <AbstractNarration>This funding will enable Clemson University to acquire a spectral confocal /multiphoton&lt;br/&gt;microscope equipped with a widefield spectral imaging system. The new system will be housed&lt;br/&gt;in the Jordan Hall Imaging Facility (JHIF), which is the advanced light microscopy core imaging&lt;br/&gt;facility at Clemson University. The primary goal of the JHIF is to acquire and maintain advanced&lt;br/&gt;light imaging equipment necessary for conducting leading edge research, thus, providing the&lt;br/&gt;Clemson research community access to the tools necessary to compete with other top research&lt;br/&gt;institutions. As a core facility, the JHIF is dedicated to the training of investigators at all levels&lt;br/&gt;from undergraduate and graduate students to postdoctoral researchers. In keeping with the MRI&lt;br/&gt;NSF vision, this shared equipment would improve the quality and expand the scope of research&lt;br/&gt;at Clemson. The multiphoton capabilities will be utilized by Clemson researchers who work with&lt;br/&gt;live cells and whole organisms, such as chick embryos, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans,&lt;br/&gt;as this technique provides high resolution image acquisition with less phototoxity and deeper&lt;br/&gt;resolution than conventional confocal microscopy. The widefield hyperspectral capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;this instrument will benefit Clemson researchers currently engaged in nanoparticle studies,&lt;br/&gt;allowing them to not only visualize uptake of nanoparticles by cells in real time, but to also&lt;br/&gt;identify chemical characteristics of these nanoparticles. The addition of these capabilities will&lt;br/&gt;significantly influence the quality of research in the fields of biological science, bioengineering,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Clemson Jordan Hall Imaging Facility is dedicated to the training of undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate researchers in advanced light microscopy techniques. In addition, the JHIF manager&lt;br/&gt;introduces high school teachers to advanced light microscopy through SCLife summer courses,&lt;br/&gt;giving them an opportunity to work with these techniques. To attract and assist underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;groups in the sciences, the JHIF offers a minigrant program for up to 10 hours of beam time on&lt;br/&gt;the instruments. The increased research scope that this microscope will bring to Clemson&lt;br/&gt;researchers could result in enormous benefits to society, including protecting the environment,&lt;br/&gt;food safety, new drug delivery systems, and safety from bioterrorism threats.</AbstractNarration>
