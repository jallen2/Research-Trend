    <AbstractNarration>Proteins are key biomolecules involved in virtually all processes within cells,&lt;br/&gt;e.g., metabolism, cell signaling, immune response, etc., and knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;protein function is vital to obtain a basic understanding of cellular activity.&lt;br/&gt;Due to recent advances in nucleotide sequencing technology, the number of&lt;br/&gt;available genomic sequences is doubling in size roughly every 12 months, an&lt;br/&gt;incredibly fast pace vastly exceeding Moore's law. Experimental technologies&lt;br/&gt;required to decipher protein function have not progressed nearly as fast. In&lt;br/&gt;fact, although there are roughly 10 million protein sequences in the&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive Uniprot database, only 0.2% have experimentally validated&lt;br/&gt;function annotations. This sequence-function gap is rapidly expanding, and the&lt;br/&gt;development of computational methods is of crucial importance to effectively&lt;br/&gt;utilize this deluge of sequence data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this work, we develop SIFTER, a large-scale, systems biology platform to&lt;br/&gt;accurately predict protein function from high-throughput data. Building upon a&lt;br/&gt;promising phylogenomic-based prototype, we incorporate interaction networks&lt;br/&gt;into our model to improve performance. Interaction data intrinsically couples&lt;br/&gt;the thousands to millions of proteins within such networks, and we use&lt;br/&gt;variational inference and parallelized implementations to address this&lt;br/&gt;challenging computational problem. We also explore techniques for function&lt;br/&gt;prediction based on low-rank matrix factorization, and along the way, introduce&lt;br/&gt;novel sampling-based approaches to speed up computation. Additionally, we&lt;br/&gt;develop algorithms to quantify uncertainty in SIFTER's predictions to&lt;br/&gt;help guide future experimental work. These novel algorithms are large-scale&lt;br/&gt;extensions to classical bootstrap sampling and are generally applicable to any&lt;br/&gt;problem involving massive data. Finally, we evaluate SIFTER in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with experimental biologists, allowing us to pinpoint relevant&lt;br/&gt;use cases and resulting in an effective method with widespread impact within&lt;br/&gt;the biomedical community.</AbstractNarration>
