    <AbstractNarration>1105061&lt;br/&gt;Chang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of chemical manufacturing processes is to transform raw materials into useful products. In the course of these operations, energy resources are consumed and the usefulness of materials resources is altered. As the world-wide demand for energy continues to rise and the economic and environmental impact of fossil fuel combustion continues to be felt, the search for suitable alternative energy sources has become more urgent than ever. Among the various renewable energy sources, the conversion of sunlight directly into electricity using the photovoltaic (PV) properties of certain materials is attractive. Current PV manufacturing practices suffer from poor energy efficiency and large carbon footprints due to poor material utilization, high processing temperatures and/or high solvent usage -- offsetting the hope and promise of PV technologies. The objective of this project is to explore the possibility of a zero energy impact chemical manufacturing process for the production of nanoscale solar energy materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in nanocrystals are having a dramatic impact on the development of next generation low-cost and/or high efficiency solar cells. For example, semiconductor nanocrystal inks are used to lower the fabrication cost of the absorber layers of the solar cells. In addition, some quantum confined nanocrystals display an electron-hole pair generation phenomena with greater than 100% quantum yield, called multiple exciton generation. These quantum dots could potentially be used to fabricate solar cells that exceed the Schockley-Queisser limit. This project aims to investigate the microreactor systems powered by renewable energy for the production of nanoscale solar energy materials. The needed thermal energy for driving the chemical reaction will be supplied via a parabolic trough solar concentrator. Two different reactor schemes will be investigated in this EAGER project. One is the direct use of solar radiation onto solar microchannel reactors and the other approach is to use an energy transfer medium to absorb the solar energy then use the medium as an energy input for the synthesis. The idea of using a solar microreactor for the production of nanoscale solar energy materials will be explored for the first time through this EAGER project to assess its feasibility and to identify the key challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PV manufacturing industry and green building construction industry are expected to grow significantly due to the increasing awareness of renewable energy and government incentives. The current low adoption of solar based energy generation can be attributed to inefficiency and high cost. An inherent cost to the current technology is the high consumption of energy in the solar energy materials production processes. The possibility of achieving zero-energy impact manufacturing processes in a cost-effective manner can make solar energy technologies greener and more affordable. The demonstrations of this solar micro-reaction technology will increase effectiveness and efficiency, reduce cost of nanoscale solar energy materials and in turn lead to wider adoption. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this project and mini projects for the existing K-12 outreach programs on the OSU campus will be developed for recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups (young women and ethnic minorities) into science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
