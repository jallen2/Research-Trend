    <AbstractNarration>1132301&lt;br/&gt;Cunningham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;We propose the development of a photonic crystal enhanced microscope (PCEM) as a&lt;br/&gt;powerful multimode imaging approach for quantification and visualization of the interactions&lt;br/&gt;between cells and surfaces. The PCEM is designed to utilize the properties of a photonic&lt;br/&gt;crystal (PC) biosensor surface that is designed to produce narrow bandwidth optical resonances&lt;br/&gt;for two distinct purposes. First, the resonant coupling condition of the PC is modified by cell&lt;br/&gt;attachment, and the PCEM is capable of producing images of the spatial distribution of cell&lt;br/&gt;attachment with sufficient resolution to quantify variations in the strength of attachment within&lt;br/&gt;individual cells. Second, the PC surface enables efficient coupling to laser illumination, resulting&lt;br/&gt;in the ability to enhance the output of fluorescent molecules in close proximity to the PC by two&lt;br/&gt;orders of magnitude, using a technique called "PC Enhanced Fluorescence." The PCEM will be&lt;br/&gt;an enabling tool for a broad range of life science research and pharmaceutical screening&lt;br/&gt;applications that require characterization of the interaction between extracellular matrix&lt;br/&gt;materials and cell membrane-expressed proteins in response to cell growth, pro-apoptotic&lt;br/&gt;stimuli, forced differentiation protocols, chemotaxis, ion channel activation, transmembrane&lt;br/&gt;protein activation, and proliferation. PCEM offers the ability to perform assays with a limited&lt;br/&gt;number of available cells for applications involving primary cells or stem cells. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;system builds upon the successful implementation and demonstration of the first PCEM system,&lt;br/&gt;which was designed and built for applications involving DNA microarrays and protein&lt;br/&gt;microarrays. The proposed instrument incorporates objective-coupled illumination from above&lt;br/&gt;and below the PC for simultaneous label-free imaging, bright field imaging, and enhanced&lt;br/&gt;fluorescence imaging with optics designed to optimize the sensitivity and resolution of each&lt;br/&gt;modality when the PC surface is immersed in cell media. The system also incorporates a CO2&lt;br/&gt;environmental chamber to facilitate continuous monitoring of cells for extended periods of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Biologists are developing a more sophisticated understanding of how cell membrane&lt;br/&gt;interactions with surfaces, chemical stimuli, and other cells are modulated, and the role of&lt;br/&gt;integrins, ion channels, G-coupled transmembrane proteins, and filapodia in fundamental&lt;br/&gt;processes such as migration, wound healing, differentiation, and apoptosis. Yet, there are few&lt;br/&gt;tools currently available that allow visualization and quantification of these processes. While the&lt;br/&gt;initial set of demonstrated applications for PCEM will include cancer cell cytotoxicity, T-cell&lt;br/&gt;induced apoptosis, stem cell differentiation, and cardiac cell stimulation, the system's&lt;br/&gt;capabilities extend to any cell type and any process that can be carried out upon a surface. The&lt;br/&gt;environment at Illinois, in which the PI is an investigator within the NSF-sponsored Center for&lt;br/&gt;Cellular Mechanics (CCMB) IGERT, and the NIH-sponsored Cancer Nanotechnology training&lt;br/&gt;grant, and the location of the system within the Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory's&lt;br/&gt;BioNanotechnology Laboratory assures that the system will be included in multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;training programs. Users of the system will be comprised of faculty, graduate students, and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students from Engineering, Pharmacology, Animal Sciences, Microbiology, and&lt;br/&gt;Immunology. The project will develop general-purpose methods for studying cell-surface&lt;br/&gt;interactions that can be used broadly in pharmaceutical screening and life science research -&lt;br/&gt;extending the applicability of photonic crystal biosensors. The PI has a successful track record&lt;br/&gt;of biosensor instrumentation invention, development, and commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal also describes an education plan that is closely linked with the program's&lt;br/&gt;technical goals with impact upon graduate student research, undergraduate research,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate classroom/laboratory learning, and teaching biosensing/photonics concepts to a&lt;br/&gt;University-based all-girls middle school. The PI has a strong track record for involving&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in his research, and for making the technology developed under NSF&lt;br/&gt;funding available in his ECE416 "Biosensors" course, both in the form of lecture topics and&lt;br/&gt;hands-on laboratory experience.</AbstractNarration>
