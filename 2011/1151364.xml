    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry supports the work of Professor Mary Watson of the University of Delaware to develop a metal-catalyzed approach to the enantioselective addition of carbon nucleophiles to oxocarbenium ion intermediates. This research focuses on developing a general and practical solution for the preparation of enantioenriched, alpha-substituted oxygen heterocycles from a wide range of readily available, racemic acetal starting materials. The methods being developed rely predominantly on commercially or readily available carbon nucleophiles and inexpensive, first-row transition metal catalysts to maximize their practicality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of this research program is to enable efficient access to chiral oxygen heterocycles that would have a positive and significant impact on discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and functional materials. Of equal importance to the PI are the mentorship, education and training of the next generation of scientists. This research provides education and research training to undergraduate and graduate student researchers. Further, this CAREER award supports the PI's efforts to increase the accessibility of organic chemistry to undergraduate students via peer-led team learning (PLTL) workshops in sophomore organic chemistry at the University of Delaware and to inspire Delaware high school students with the power of chemistry using a video she produced about Richard Heck's Nobel Prize-winning achievements and by performing demonstrations in Delaware high schools.</AbstractNarration>
