    <AbstractNarration>1114831 &lt;br/&gt;Tridane, Arizona State University &lt;br/&gt;Summary of Proposal: This project is for support for US participants, including professors and students - to a workshop on ?Mathematical Biology: Analysis and Control- Casablanca, Morocco June 20-24, 2011.? The Moroccan organizer is Dr. Noura Yousfi of the Hassan II-Mohammedia-Casablanca University. The focus of the workshop is on disease modeling for endemic and emerging diseases in Africa. Included in the plan are plenary lectures, poster sessions, lectures as well as tutorials for African students, and round tables. A major objective is to facilitate and encourage collaborations between researchers from African countries, the US and other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Disease modeling is necessary for understanding and developing control strategies for epidemic diseases. The workshop seeks to create future international collaborations, data sharing, and possible development of international models for educational training in the field of disease modeling. The workshop will expose US researchers to mathematical biology in Africa, promote interactions and collaborations, and train students and postdocs. There will be discussion sessions with African researchers on problems specific to Africa. The workshop's steering committee includes a significant representation from the host country as well as from Kenya, Botswana, Uganda and Tanzania. The topic on disease models and control fits well with Africa, where many problems related to disease emerge. The workshop would facilitate the development of collaborations between junior researchers in the US, with expertise in the modeling of disease, and researchers residing in Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The workshop will have a good impact on junior researcher and students in Morocco and nearby countries. It also benefits the participating US scholars and junior researchers as they will become familiar with some real disease problems occurring in Africa, which can increase the interaction of US researchers and North African colleagues, and make positive impact on promoting scientific research in Africa and also in US (for Africa related problems.) Three of plenary speakers are female, and three of them are minority. The organizers plan to post lectures online, and publish proceedings on a good journal in math biology. Many of the main research advances in this field have come from US, Canadian, and European universities, and that new collaborations between African and non-African researchers would enable data sharing and idea sharing between a broader international community. Mentoring of junior researchers and students by African and non-African senior researchers is also expected.</AbstractNarration>
