    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the research is to develop new computational techniques for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of structural components that will provide fast, reliable, and highly accurate quantitative evaluation of the current state of structural properties. Algorithms will combine efficient computational models of the structural response with optimization approaches to identify the structure's state of degradation with a given set sensor measurements. To obtain high level of efficiency and accuracy, novel model reduction techniques will be established that are tailored for NDE applications. In addition, the algorithms will define the optimal methods of exciting the structure and measuring the structural response to provide a high-resolution local description of the damage. The testing methods will be designed to maximize the sensitivity of the structural properties to the test parameters and will be applicable to a host of NDE applications from nuclear reactor to bridge structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results will enable engineers to more efficiently and accurately predict the current state of degradation and the remaining life of a structure, leading to more timely response to hazardous conditions and fewer false alarms and closures. The algorithms developed in the project will be freely disseminated to the community for wide-spread use and future developments. The research will provide advanced training to graduate and undergraduate students and establish a summer research program for undergraduates and pre-college students in collaboration with the office of diversity to engage students from traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
