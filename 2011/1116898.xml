    <AbstractNarration>Due to the industry-wide shift to multi-core processing, future&lt;br/&gt;applications will only run faster if they are written as parallel&lt;br/&gt;software (i.e. where the work for a single program is accomplished by&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously performing different parts of that work on different&lt;br/&gt;processors). Unfortunately history has taught us that writing&lt;br/&gt;parallel software is a very error-prone task for programmers. To&lt;br/&gt;address this challenge, this research project is creating a powerful&lt;br/&gt;new mechanism for identifying and hopefully fixing bugs in parallel&lt;br/&gt;software on large-scale production systems. Hopefully the resulting&lt;br/&gt;framework will not only support the parallel execution of existing&lt;br/&gt;monitoring tools, but it will also spawn the creation of new classes&lt;br/&gt;of powerful tools that can recognize subtle bugs in parallel software.&lt;br/&gt;Such tools can help programmers continue to reap the performance&lt;br/&gt;benefits of future microprocessors, thereby continuing to enable all&lt;br/&gt;of the benefits that increasingly-faster computation has had on the&lt;br/&gt;economy, science and technology, and our everyday lives in an&lt;br/&gt;Internet-connected world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the focus of this project is on sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;online program monitoring tools that model various aspects of program&lt;br/&gt;correctness at an instruction-by-instruction granularity. To strike a&lt;br/&gt;practical balance between performance, precision, and convenience for&lt;br/&gt;the tool developer, this research has developed a novel framework that&lt;br/&gt;introduces explicit "windows of uncertainty" combined with a new&lt;br/&gt;approach for avoiding a state space explosion in the analysis&lt;br/&gt;(inspired by Tarjan's interval analysis approach to dataflow analysis).</AbstractNarration>
