    <AbstractNarration>This is workshop travel award to facilitate the PI's and CoPI's participation in an international series of workshops and meetings to be held in Ryazan and Vologda, Russia in August 2011. Participation is by the invitation of Russian academicians who are interested in establishing an agenda for future collaborative research projects that focus on the scholarship of "Russian America." The applicant accurately states, "Despite the close historical ties between Siberia and Alaska, there has been little collaborative archaeological and [social] historical work to explore Russian heritage in these arctic/sub-arctic regions." Participation in this workshop is critical to strengthening the US and Russian academic ties necessary to succeed in establishing an international research agenda for deeper scientific research on the Russian American period, which is a formative period in the social and political development of Alaska.</AbstractNarration>
