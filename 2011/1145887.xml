    <AbstractNarration>Plant cells produce a complex structure called cell wall, composed mainly of polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins). Xylan is a major hemicellulose constituent in cell walls from grasses and trees. Although xylan is the third most abundant polymer on earth, its biosynthesis has proven to be more challenging to elucidate than expected. This project seeks to overcome this lack of understanding and is built upon our recent discovery that xylan synthesis in wheat involves a multi-enzyme complex (called xylan synthase complex, XSC). The objective of this project is to use a multi-faceted approach that combines proteomics, cell biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, and reverse genetics to (i) identify and determine the function of the proteins that are part of this XSC, and (ii) elucidate the mechanism of assembly of these proteins into a functional complex. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes from this work will lead to a basic understanding of hemicellulose biosynthesis in wheat as it relates to plant growth and seed development, and may also provide ways for engineering plants with improved cell wall properties to meet the needs of the food, wood, and biofuel industries. Finally, this project will provide valuable research and training opportunities for students and a postdoctoral fellow. There are several stand-alone components of the project that are likely to yield results in the time frame of an undergraduate project, and would include routine analyses used in a research laboratory. All students will be trained in cell, developmental, molecular, and computational biology. Ohio University is located in southeast Ohio, a predominantly rural area with the highest poverty rate in the state of Ohio. Its undergraduate population comes from the surrounding Appalachian region of Ohio and West Virginia. The PI believes strongly in the mission of research in science education and makes every effort to incorporate research activities and current literature into his teaching mission at the university.</AbstractNarration>
