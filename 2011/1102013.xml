    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to close the gap between rapid advances at the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) physical layer by the wireless communications research community and current limited progress on MIMO by the networking research community. The proposed approach is to develop simple and accurate models for multi-hop MIMO networks and, based on such new models, to advance fundamental understanding of such networks. The research tasks include: (1) the development of new simple and accurate models beneath the network layer; (2) the exploration of performance optimization for multi-hop MIMO networks; and (3) the design of distributed cross-layer algorithms that can approach optimal solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project serves a critical need in the research community by producing new models beneath the network layer that are both tractable and accurate. The findings of this project will remove the current barrier facing multi-hop MIMO network research and allow the research community to fully understand the potential of such networks. Based on these findings, new knowledge frontiers for multi-hop MIMO networks can be explored that were once considered difficult; and new insights and discoveries (possibly unexpected) are now possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education plan of this project is to develop new cross-disciplinary teaching materials for wireless networking, with the goal of closing the knowledge gap between networking and wireless communications. This project will involve undergraduates and under-represented students in wireless networking research, with the goal of building their future careers in networking related fields.</AbstractNarration>
