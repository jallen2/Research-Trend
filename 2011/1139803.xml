    <AbstractNarration>California State University (CSU) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation&lt;br/&gt;(CSU-LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program (cohort 9) is a collaborative effort between&lt;br/&gt;the National Science Foundation and California State University institutions to increase&lt;br/&gt;the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities matriculating to completion of&lt;br/&gt;the doctoral degree in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields (STEM)&lt;br/&gt;fields. The program at California State University, Northridge prepares students to meet&lt;br/&gt;the challenges of completing doctoral programs of study and for academic careers in&lt;br/&gt;higher education. In addition, the program develops leadership skills necessary for&lt;br/&gt;success in the STEM workforce nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating research and education, the BD fellows are nurtured over two years as a&lt;br/&gt;cohort community that benefits from a program of academic and personal&lt;br/&gt;development activities as well as social support to sustain their commitment and&lt;br/&gt;success to the terminal Ph.D. STEM degree. Program activities include linkages with&lt;br/&gt;Graduate Education in the Professoriate (AGEP) institutions and other graduate&lt;br/&gt;education programs to advance students in Ph.D. programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve students from underrepresented minority populations in STEM fields will&lt;br/&gt;participate in the program at California State University, Northridge during the&lt;br/&gt;2011-2013 academic years. Results from this support broadens the participation of&lt;br/&gt;African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Pacific-Islanders in the STEM&lt;br/&gt;pipeline globally. Results from rigorous evaluation of the project adds to the body of&lt;br/&gt;literature in the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students in&lt;br/&gt;STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project anticipates that at least 95% of the new participants will complete Master's&lt;br/&gt;degrees, and that at least 90% of these students will earn STEM doctorate degrees.&lt;br/&gt;This project not only targets a student population that might not otherwise pursue&lt;br/&gt;doctoral level training, but also makes a special effort to target STEM disciplines that&lt;br/&gt;have relatively low overall doctorate degree production and the lowest shares of URM&lt;br/&gt;students. In these disciplines (specifically, geological sciences, physics and astronomy,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, engineering, and computer science), small increases in the number of&lt;br/&gt;doctorates awarded to URM students will have a significant impact on discipline&lt;br/&gt;demographics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BD project activities include a variety of valued "best practices" for supporting and&lt;br/&gt;advancing LSAMP students. Specifically, the project provides the following:&lt;br/&gt;- rigorous Master?s-level course-work&lt;br/&gt;- a two-year research experience with the guidance of a faculty mentor;&lt;br/&gt;- professional development workshops and activities, including participation in scientific&lt;br/&gt;conferences;&lt;br/&gt;- monthly meetings to monitor student progress,&lt;br/&gt;- networking with other BD Fellows in doctoral programs, and&lt;br/&gt;- provide assistance with graduate school and fellowship applications.</AbstractNarration>
