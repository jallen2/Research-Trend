    <AbstractNarration>SUNY College at Oswego is graduating more students with STEM degrees by increasing the retention of matriculated students during their first two years of study. Their self-study on which the interventions are based, identified key reasons declared STEM majors were not retained between freshman and sophomore years or between sophomore and junior years. The three principal reasons are students switching to non-STEM majors, becoming academically disqualified, or leaving the university while still in good academic standing. Refinement of institutional data pinpointed problematic courses in Chemistry and Mathematics as particular key choke points contributing to the retention problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By implementing a five-point plan that draws on their own institutional data and informed by effective practices reported in the literature, SUNY Oswego is increasing their number of STEM graduates over a 5 year period by a net 20%. The first component being implemented is the expansion of a successful, but small, summer bridge Math Camp for incoming STEM majors, and adding Chemistry content to the camp. The second component is taking advantage of under-utilized time in Chemistry and Physics classes to add "Math in Context" problems and discussion. The third component is enhancing tutoring services both for walk-in students and for targeted courses by utilizing embedded tutors. The fourth component is systematizing peer mentoring by upperclassmen for freshman and sophomore STEM majors. The final component is providing undergraduate research experiences for students during their first years on campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspects of the multi-pronged program are capable of being implemented at other institutions of higher education since the investigators are optimizing resources that are already in place such as course laboratories and tutoring centers. The summer bridge Math and Chemistry Camp is especially effective at enabling at-risk students to start their first semester in a strong position to succeed. The Math in Context program is both mandatory and reaching a large number of students since it is implemented within large-enrollment courses taken by STEM majors that too-often are stumbling blocks to possible STEM graduates. The small undergraduate research component is targeting students that could most benefit from an early immersion experience in the discipline. The investigators are sharing their effective practices by organizing discussions and workshops for colleagues on campus and at nearby colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>
