    <AbstractNarration>1125957&lt;br/&gt;Shi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide a critical review of the current state of the art in nanoscale transport and provide directions for future activities. A broad range of application areas are targeted including thermoelectric, optoelectronic, photovoltaic and nano/micro fluidic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed workshop will examine the fundamentals of nanoscale transport including phonon, electron and photon interactions and examine how this understanding can be used to improve a wide array of nanoscale devices. The workshop will attract a number of key researchers in this field, including some who have not been active participants in this series of workshops. The PIs will provide a summative assessemnt of the state of the art, progress and challenges and future research directions that will be submitted for consideration for a journal publication and NSF report. The PIs are encouraged to look beyond simplistic modeling at the MD level in idealized geometries and consider how the advances made in the nanoscience field in the last two decades can now begin to be applied to nanodevices with increasing complexity and functionality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The workshop will bring together a diverse group of people in an international setting and will therefore foster broad dissemination of the ongoing work and active interchange of ideas. The requested support is significantly biased toward supporting junior faculty.</AbstractNarration>
