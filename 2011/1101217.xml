    <AbstractNarration>This award will support participation by U.S. students and junior researchers the conference CiE 2011 (Models of Computation in Context), to be held in June/July of 2011 in Sofia, Bulgaria. This meeting is organized by the research group in Mathematical Logic at Sofia university in conjunction with the Association for Computability in Europe, a community of more than 700 researchers, including about 100 members from the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual conference series promotes the development of computability-related science, ranging over mathematics, computer science, and applications in various natural and engineering sciences such as physics and biology. The conference scope also includes the study of philosophy and history of computing as it relates to questions of computability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computability has played a crucial role in mathematics and computer science, leading to the discovery, understanding and classification of decidable/undecidable problems and paving the way for the modern computer era. Recent new paradigms of computation, based on biological and physical models, address in a radically new way questions of efficiency and challenge assumptions about the so-called Turing barrier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CiE 2011 will bring context, multidisciplinary perspective and computability-theoretic focus to a wide spectrum of disciplines -- including computer science, mathematics and logic, physics and quantum theory, biology and informatics, linguistics and philosophy, neuroscience and learning theory.</AbstractNarration>
