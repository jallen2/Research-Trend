    <AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on developing well-suited materials for use in bindered anthracite briques that can replace conventional coke in foundry cupolas. The objectives of this NSF AIR project will be to: (1) Carry forward the market development of biomaterial-bindered anthracite briques as a replacement for coke in foundry cupolas, (2) Translate research-based results into full-scale market potential by conducting the research and development that resolves how industry can supply ultra-fine anthracite grains, mitigate potential brique biodegradation, and diminish air pollution, (3) Work with an anthracite supplier, two pulp miller, two cupola foundries, and others in industry, to demonstrate at full-scale this novel bindered anthracite opportunity. The needs and potential impact of having this replacement material, ultra-fine anthracite, for coke are clearly stated, where the environmental, financial, and industrial impacts are large. As stated in the proposal, this work will help advance the areas of sustainable manufacturing, high temperature bindering, ultrasonics, microbiology, coal processing, and wood (i.e., lignin) products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal could help the US coke industry in addressing the need for more manufacturing capability. The proposal puts forth alternative materials that require less energy to manufacture and release less CO2 and volatile organic carbon air emissions. Successful completion of this project will increase American business competitiveness by transforming otherwise wasted coal and biomaterials into value-added products, while sustainably making manufactured goods for the US population. The proposed research will also offer excellent opportunities for teaching, training, learning, and discovery relative to sustainable manufacturing. The PI also plans to bring a minority Ph.D candidate into this program to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and integrating diversity into learning.</AbstractNarration>
