    <AbstractNarration>With the "Pathways for Inspiring, Educating, and Recruiting West Texans in the Geosciences" (PIER) program, Angelo State University (ASU) is working to increase the participation of mostly Hispanic students in geoscience education and career pathways, through aligned programs of student recruitment and teacher professional development for grade 6-12 science teachers affiliated with the San Angelo Independent School District (SAISD). PIER has two specific goals. The first goal of introducing at least 500 students in grades 6-12 to careers in the geosciences, and providing a pathway for students to study geoscience, is being achieved through: creation of school-year geoscience outreach events; design and implementation of geoscience content modules for presentation in middle school and high school classrooms by ASU students, faculty, and informal educators; and, recruitment of students from West Texas to major in geoscience or minor in Earth Science at ASU and encourage their persistence to graduation. The second goal of educating and inspiring at least 40 teachers in geoscience content areas aligned with the grade-appropriate Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (state standards) is being achieved through: design, implementation, and evaluation of project-based working sessions offered through summer teacher institutes; and, sustaining professional development support throughout the academic year.</AbstractNarration>
