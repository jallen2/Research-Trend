    <AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Nano Science And Laboratory Experience (ScALE) at UMaine", at the University of Maine, under the direction of Dr. Rosemary L. Smith, aims to introduce the basic concepts, applications, and implications of nanoscale science and engineering to all first-year engineering students at the University of Maine (UMaine). The proposed approach is to add nanoscience and nanoscale engineering content to the required 'introduction to' engineering courses offered by each engineering department. This content will be designed, developed and delivered as a 'drop-in' module, in collaboration with the instructors for each department's course. This project further aims to enhance undergraduate education and training in nanoscale science and engineering by establishing a college-wide minor in Nanotechnology, developing an upper level course in nanoscience, and to broaden participation of 1st and 2nd year students from underrepresented groups in nanoscale research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include improved student recruitment, retention, and future workforce preparation achieved through the intentional integration of research and education at the undergraduate level, professional development of Maine's middle-school science teachers, the facilitation of new research and education collaborations among UMaine faculty with interests in nanoscale science and engineering, and the sharing of state-of-the-art instructional tools such as laboratory facilities and materials. Outreach activities will focus on increasing the interest of female students in engineering careers by developing mini-projects for high school students targeting nanotechnology applications to biomedicine and energy.</AbstractNarration>
