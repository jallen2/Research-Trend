    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is to purchase a high resolution 3D X-Ray microscopy system (Micro X-Ray CT). A wide variety of research will be enhanced by acquisition of this Micro X-Ray CT system including: a broad-based campus research collaboration in nanotechnology, an NSF-sponsored Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on friction stir processing, and an NSF-sponsored Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site. In addition, single investigator research will be enhanced by the Micro X-Ray CT acquisition. Specific research to be positively impacted by the equipment acquisition includes the following areas: Direct Write Printing of Flexible Electronic Devices; Paleoenvironmental Reconstructions and Nondestructive Analysis of Fossil Resources; Concrete Characterization; Advanced Membranes for Bioseparations and Biorenewables Processing; Personal Protective Equipment for Blast and Impact; Soil and Rock Core Evaluation; and Nanoenergetic Materials Research. The equipment will provide far-reaching impacts across disciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scientific research to be enabled, significant education and training opportunities will be invigorated with this instrument. In this regard, the requested instrument would be utilized in at least eight courses that typically enroll more than 250 students/year. In addition, SDSM&amp;T hosts a summer NSF REU site (Back to the Future!) which will utilize this equipment within the Site's research projects. The Micro X-Ray CT will be utilized in a wide variety of summer engineering camps for high school students. The SDSM&amp;T Museum of Geology serves as a formal fossil repository for a plethora of federal and state governmental agencies and regional tribal agencies. This Micro X-Ray CT facility will greatly enhance the analytical research performed on these fossils and provide new exhibits for the 24,000 visitors the Museum hosts yearly. Cyber-enabling will allow greater collaboration between SDSM&amp;T and the other South Dakota regental and tribal institutions of higher learning.</AbstractNarration>
