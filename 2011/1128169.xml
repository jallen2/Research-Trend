    <AbstractNarration>Objective and Approaches:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop and characterize a novel method to create low-cost microsystem platforms using commercially available hydrophobic papers (e.g., parchment paper, wax paper, palette paper). The approach is to use laser surface treatment of such papers to selectively convert hydrophobic regions into hydrophilic ones and use such conversion to embed smart materials and integrate electronics onto the paper. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposed research lies in scientific and engineering exploration of laser surface treatment of commercially available hydrophobic papers to create low-cost microsystem platforms. In particular: 1) investigation of the interaction of common surface treating lasers (diode, CO2, and Nd-YAG) with commercially available hydrophobic papers, 2) development of techniques to incorporate functional materials into the laser treated papers, and 3) incorporation of active and passive components onto paper platforms.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research are in many areas including low-cost health care products, consumer/wireless electronics, and micro-robotics. In the human resource development, under-represented and minority undergraduate students will be given the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the project and benefit from exposure to and training in microfabrication, MEMS, microfluidics, transducers, and microelectronics. An undergraduate course (Title: Green Electronics) with an emphasis on the environmental implications of modern microelectronics technology will also be developed to increase the awareness of the huge impact of microelectronics in environmental degradation and sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
