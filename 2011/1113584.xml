    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the August 6-11, 2011 workshop on Dynamics to be held on the Pingree Park Campus of Colorado State University. The purpose of this international conference is to bring together researchers at the interface of topological and measurable dynamics, two distinct but closely related areas in dynamical systems. The aim of the workshop is to make progress on the disseminate results and initiate new lines of inquiry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will provide an opportunity for advanced graduate students and young researchers to interact with more senior mathematicians, share ideas and present their results. The intimate and isolated nature of Pingree Park will provide opportunities for mentoring and advising as well as the fostering of new relationships and collaborations. All this will enhance the training of these young people and provide them will long term contacts and growth. Priority for funding will be given to graduate students, other young researchers and participants without other support as well as members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
