    <AbstractNarration>Algorithms used in computational mathematics are increasingly&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated and complex; and the modern civilization critically&lt;br/&gt;dependents on scientific software at all levels from design to&lt;br/&gt;equipment control. Yet, the programming languages and tools used to&lt;br/&gt;express algorithms as computer programs do not progress at a matching&lt;br/&gt;pace, leaving an expanding gap between provably correct published&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and their realizations in code. Failures in software&lt;br/&gt;systems can cost human lives and are responsible for billions of&lt;br/&gt;dollars lost annually. Furthermore, silent failures of simulation&lt;br/&gt;software can seriously undermine the credibility of a scientific&lt;br/&gt;model, entailing profound intellectual liabilities. This research&lt;br/&gt;project will investigate formal-methods-based principles and tools to&lt;br/&gt;make the practice of programming a more mathematical activity for&lt;br/&gt;ordinary programmers. The overriding aim is to make dependability a&lt;br/&gt;common basic property of critical software. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To that end, the PI will design a new programming system that supports&lt;br/&gt;research in axiomatic programming based on new logical linguistic&lt;br/&gt;constructs, invent new programming models and tools grounded in formal&lt;br/&gt;reasoning and methods. The PI will investigate the design of practical&lt;br/&gt;dependent type systems for mathematics software and their efficient&lt;br/&gt;compilation to support integrated automated deduction and computer&lt;br/&gt;algebra systems. The project has synergistic components that build&lt;br/&gt;bridges between symbolic and algebraic computation, compiler construction,&lt;br/&gt;proof theory, and education. Insights gained from this project will&lt;br/&gt;be integrated into new courses, supported by a book on the practical&lt;br/&gt;implementation of modern type systems and compilers. The PI expects&lt;br/&gt;to discover basic principles of axiomatic programming, tools, and&lt;br/&gt;techniques. The results are expected to influence the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;existing major mainstream programming languages (such as C++) in&lt;br/&gt;their support for structured generic programming and improvement of &lt;br/&gt;software reliability. As ever, the PI will involve students both at&lt;br/&gt;the undergraduate and graduate levels, in hands-on, fully integrated&lt;br/&gt;research-based classes.</AbstractNarration>
