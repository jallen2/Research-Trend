    <AbstractNarration>The project will accurately characterize aerosol particles from aircrafts using a new and improved aerosol-cloud sampler and integrating it with a newly developed fast mobility spectrometer and a scanning cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) instrument during the ICE-T (Ice in Clouds Experiment-Tropical) field campaign. The specific objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Accurate sampling of aerosol particles outside and inside clouds considering the possible presence of drizzle, ice, and precipitation using the Clarkson Interstitial Inlet (CII).&lt;br/&gt;2) Determine the size distribution of particles smaller than 300 nm in less than 20 seconds using the new fast aerosol mobility spectrometer developed at Clarkson.&lt;br/&gt;3) Determine the size-classified CCN fraction of the sampled aerosol using a combination of a fast DMA system and a fast CCN instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the need to improve our understanding of ice nucleation process in the atmosphere. Size distribution measurements of aerosol particles inside and outside of cloud systems will provide critical information about the particle size fractions that are participating in cloud formation. In addition, the mixing nature of the particles will be determined from size-classified CCN measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this study includes:&lt;br/&gt;1) The development and performance validation of a new interstitial aerosol sampler that will provide a critical ability to sample and analyze non-activated aerosol particles in cloud systems.&lt;br/&gt;2) Measurements of particle size distributions and size-classified CCN in warm and mixed-phase clouds, resulting in obtaining important data to test existing aerosol-cloud parameterizations and improving our understanding of formation of ice nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This work will result in (i) the development of a new aerosol-cloud sampler that can be used for aerosol-cloud system characterization from a wide-range of aircraft platforms, and (ii) validating the performance of a fast sizing particle instrument that will provide near real-time size-resolved measurements of atmospheric aerosol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a part of this project, two graduate students will be involved. Both graduate students will gain exposure to aircraft-based measurements and in analysis of scientific data. Also, by participating in a field campaign, the students will get an opportunity to interact with established atmospheric scientists, furthering their development as independent researchers.</AbstractNarration>
