    <AbstractNarration>Contact lines arises as the intersection of fluid interfaces with solid &lt;br/&gt;surfaces. For a long time, this area of study has been plagued with &lt;br/&gt;conflicting theories and uncertainties regarding how the problem should be &lt;br/&gt;modeled. The main difficulty stems from the fact that classical hydrodynamics &lt;br/&gt;(specifically, the Navier-Stokes equation with the no-slip boundary condition) &lt;br/&gt;predicts a non-integrable singularity for the viscous stress at the moving &lt;br/&gt;contact line. In this project, the moving contact line problem is to be &lt;br/&gt;systematically studied with the help of macroscopic thermodynamics, &lt;br/&gt;microscopic molecular dynamics, and numerical simulations. A ``first-&lt;br/&gt;principle'' contact line model is derived based on principles of &lt;br/&gt;thermodynamics and molecular dynamics simulations. Novel numerical methods &lt;br/&gt;will be developed for the contact line model, and will be applied to study &lt;br/&gt;problems of both practical and theoretical interests, including the contact &lt;br/&gt;line dynamics on heterogeneous surfaces. The asymptotic behavior of the &lt;br/&gt;contact line model as the slip length goes to zero will be investigated with &lt;br/&gt;the help of numerics and asymptotic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A contact line is the intersection of three phases, ofter two fluid phases and &lt;br/&gt;a solid phase. The two fluid phases can either be two immiscible fluids such &lt;br/&gt;as water and oil, or two phases of the same substance, such as the liquid and &lt;br/&gt;vapor phase of water. The solid phase is usually the container for the fluids. &lt;br/&gt;For this reason, the contact line is also the boundary of the interface &lt;br/&gt;between the two fluid phases, and is therefore an ubiquitous part of &lt;br/&gt;interfacial phenomena. Contact lines also arise in many applications such as &lt;br/&gt;coating, printing, oil production, and in many micro-fluidic devices. The main &lt;br/&gt;difficulty of the moving contact line problem stems from the fact that &lt;br/&gt;classical hydrodynamics predicts an infinite rate of energy dissipation which &lt;br/&gt;simply implies that contact lines cannot move. In this project, the PI will &lt;br/&gt;derive a first-principle contact line model based on thermodynamics principles &lt;br/&gt;and molecular dynamics simulations. Novel numerical methods will be developed &lt;br/&gt;and will be applied to study problems of practical interests, such as the &lt;br/&gt;contact line dynamics on heterogeneous surfaces.</AbstractNarration>
