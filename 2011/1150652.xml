    <AbstractNarration>The research objectives of this project are to (1) determine the mid-IR MIR (~5-100 µm) optical constants (real and imaginary indices of refraction; n and k) of 33 minerals and glasses of importance to planetary astronomical research, with a focus on monoclinic and triclinic minerals, and (2) to develop and test a state-of-the-art electrodynamic model that ultimately can use the derived optical constants to quantitatively determine the mineralogy of remotely-sensed objects. This model determines the scattering properties of clusters of spheres by exactly solving Maxwell's equations at each wave/particle interface. The broader impacts of this work include several educational components. The PI will mentor a postdoc, graduate student, and multiple undergraduates. The graduate course and teacher workshop materials developed by the PI will be made available to the broader educational community through the NSF-funded Science Education Resource Center (SERC) site at Carleton College. The teacher workshop planned by the PI will enhance the education of high school Earth Science students throughout Long Island and New York State. Long Island has multiple 'majority minority' school districts, so there is a strong likelihood of the workshop having a broad impact on minorities on Long Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities are important since most solar system objects have surfaces consisting of mixtures of coarse and fine particulates, which are difficult to quantitatively model. Understanding the nature of this material is a first order problem in understanding the compositions of these bodies. While work is progressing on these research objectives, the PI will also expand the graduate geosciences curriculum at Stony Brook University and develop materials to train K-12 teachers in remote sensing, mineralogy, and planetary science. The curricular objectives of this proposal are (1) development and implementation of an advanced undergraduate/graduate course in Applications of Spectroscopy to Planetary Science, (2) development of introductory lecture materials and laboratory exercises that demonstrate the use of spacecraft mission data to learn about planetary surfaces, and 3) development and implementation of a 1-day, continuing education workshop for high school earth science teachers focusing on the interactive roles of mineralogy, spectroscopy, and planetary science, utilizing the lecture and lab materials previously described.</AbstractNarration>
