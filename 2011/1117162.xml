    <AbstractNarration>Much of today's information infrastructure makes use of virtual&lt;br/&gt;machines (VMs). For example, consumer devices typically contain VMs&lt;br/&gt;for Java, JavaScript, and Flash. VMs are often well suited to roll out&lt;br/&gt;new capabilities to a broad range of target devices, which is why new&lt;br/&gt;VMs are being created all the time. Unfortunately, most VMs today are&lt;br/&gt;created from scratch, in spite of the fact that they are broadly&lt;br/&gt;similar. This is a considerable waste of programmer time and money.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to make creating VMs simpler, by creating&lt;br/&gt;a "toolbox" of components from which new VMs can be constructed&lt;br/&gt;easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical challenge is to create building blocks that can be put&lt;br/&gt;together to work as well as the custom-crafted VMs of today. In many&lt;br/&gt;cases, VM performance is critical. For example, on mobile devices, a&lt;br/&gt;slower VM might force us to run the processor at a higher speed,&lt;br/&gt;leading to faster battery depletion. This research promises that &lt;br/&gt;one may one day be able to create a competitively&lt;br/&gt;performing VM for Java, JavaScript and Flash in which some parts are&lt;br/&gt;shared, so that the total size is much smaller than three separate&lt;br/&gt;VMs. This is important for resource-constrained devices such as&lt;br/&gt;mobile phones. Re-using components rather than reinventing the wheel&lt;br/&gt;each time would reduce the entry cost for new languages. Sharing&lt;br/&gt;components would also lead to pooling of debugging resources, reducing&lt;br/&gt;errors and thereby leading to a safer and more stable computing&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
