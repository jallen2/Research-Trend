    <AbstractNarration>The 7th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (CoNEXT) will be held from December 6th to December 9th 2011 on the campus of the University of Tokyo in Japan. This award funds 10 US-based graduate students to attend this conference. Participation in conferences such as CoNEXT is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field. ACM CoNEXT is unique in its emphasis on interactions between networking researchers at an international level; and attending CoNEXT is an excellent opportunity for US graduate students to connect with a thriving international research community. A special student workshop will be organized in association with CoNEXT that will enable students to present and obtain feedback on their work in progress. The support from this award will enable students to attend the main conference and associated workshops at CoNEXT 2011. The travel grant chair is committed to encouraging the participation of women and under-represented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This award provides support for graduate students to attend CoNEXT 2011 and the associated workshops, which include the student workshop, the Workshop on Internet of Things and Service Platforms, and the Special Workshop on the Internet and Disasters. This rich program will expose students to new ideas, and allow them to interact with other researchers. In particular, the student workshop is geared to provide students an opportunity to present their work in progress, receive feedback on their work, and obtain valuable experience in writing and presenting technical papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. The proposed student participation will have a positive impact on the quality of their research. Women and other minorities will be encouraged to participate. A distinguishing feature of the CoNEXT conference is its truly international flavor which presents a tremendous opportunity to students to expand their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical perspective.</AbstractNarration>
