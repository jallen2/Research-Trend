    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing and field-testing instructional design concepts and educational software to teach diagnostic skills necessary to identify and solve problems in complex technical systems. Using concept mapping software, along with expert-system programs, the overall software package enables junior and senior-level technology and engineering students to benefit from personalized, iterative interactions that enable them to design and evaluate their analytical processes for the diagnosis of a problem, compare thesir processes to those of expert diagnosticians, and then refine their approaches. Advancing diagnostic skills training in the undergraduate technology and engineering curriculum is based on several theoretical anchor points: the first is the cognitive development theory associated with the higher-order thinking skills of analysis and problem-solving; the second is the application of hierarchical learning strategies in the acquisition of concrete, abstract and process concepts in technical systems; and the third is the proven practice of using iterative feedback, rubrics and expert examples in improving learning. These foundational theories and principles are being integrated into educational software developed and delivered by stand-alone or networked computers, thereby adding to the toolkit of STEM instructors. Overall, the strategy to increase the level of advanced technical diagnostic skills is providing industry, government and the military with a smarter workforce to improve our nation's overall competiveness. The outcomes of the project are also contributing to the general STEM education knowledge base.</AbstractNarration>
