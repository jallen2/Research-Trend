    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID supports post-seismic deployment of novel high density seismic arrays using&lt;br/&gt;instruments from the Earthscope Flexible Array provided by IRIS/PASSCAL to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;Mw 5.8 Virginia earthquake of August 23, 2011. This event had a NE-striking reverse faulting focal&lt;br/&gt;mechanism, a hypocentral depth of 6 km (USGS), and occurred in a previously recognized seismic&lt;br/&gt;region known as the ?Central Virginia Seismic Zone?. This event passes with ca. 15 km of a NW-SE&lt;br/&gt;oriented deep seismic reflection profile contracted in 1981 by the USGS, providing a rare opportunity&lt;br/&gt;to link seismicity to deep structure in the eastern U.S. The preliminary hypocentral estimate suggests&lt;br/&gt;that the earthquake occurred within a complex zone of east-dipping reflections that define an&lt;br/&gt;imbricated Paleozoic thrust sheet of the central Appalachian Piedmont that is underlain by Grenville&lt;br/&gt;basement at a depth of ca. 9 km.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By merging the technologies of earthquake location with high resolution structural imaging, this experiment seeks to demonstrate how aftershocks can be exploited by both passive and active seismic techniques to identify seismogenic structures at depth as well as energy propagation characteristics for a region where both types of information are either rare or non-existent. The recording experiment constitutes a prototype for imaging earthquake processes and associated structures with unprecedented resolution by exploiting a new generation recording technologies. If the data proves as rich as expected, this experiment may well establish a new protocol for future aftershocks studies.</AbstractNarration>
