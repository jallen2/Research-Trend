    <AbstractNarration>The project supports graduate student participation in the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2011). Specifically, the project supports travel to the conference for students who might not otherwise be able to attend the conference because of financial reasons. The recipients of student travel fellowships will have an opportunity to attend the conference, associated workshops and tutorials on emerging research topics, as well as a doctoral consortium that provides a venue for the students to have one-on-one discussions and receive mentoring from some of the leading researchers in data mining, machine learning, and related topics. The project offers natural integration of research and education and contributes to the training of a new generation of researchers in an area of growing importance and impact in not only Computer Science but also a variety of data-driven disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
