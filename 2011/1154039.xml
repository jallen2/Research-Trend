    <AbstractNarration>Robust modeling of both strength and orientation of anisotropic&lt;br/&gt;structure is a tantalizing tool for constraining the dynamic processes in the lithospheric and&lt;br/&gt;sub-lithospheric mantle beneath North America, directly meeting the Earthscope goals of understanding&lt;br/&gt;the active deformation of North America and tying it to deep Earth structure and&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. The long term goal of this research is to develop more detailed regional and global&lt;br/&gt;models of seismic anisotropy that can both illuminate the dynamic processes of the upper mantle,&lt;br/&gt;as well as allowing for direct comparison with geodynamically predicted models. The&lt;br/&gt;objective of this EAGER application, which is the next step towards this long-term goal, is to&lt;br/&gt;develop a new approach to image dynamic processes in the lithospheric and sub-lithospheric&lt;br/&gt;mantle beneath North America with a novel technique combining both body wave and surface&lt;br/&gt;wave observables that allows for finite-frequency vectorial tomography. The international collaboration&lt;br/&gt;proposed here is uniquely suited to bring these approaches the PI and the research&lt;br/&gt;group of S´ebastien Chevrot have been working on together and take advantage of the incredible&lt;br/&gt;dataset offered by the USArray transportable array to move towards obtaining an unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;model of anisotropic structure beneath North America. The project will develop these models&lt;br/&gt;by pursuing the following specific aims. 1) Perform synthetic testing of joint inversions using&lt;br/&gt;this new approach. The inversions will allow us to gain unprecedented information about both&lt;br/&gt;strength and orientation of anisotropy. 2) Assemble and process USArray shear splitting and&lt;br/&gt;surface wave data and merge and improve existing software between the two research groups.&lt;br/&gt;Dense data coverage of both splitting intensity and multi-taper fundamental mode phase delay&lt;br/&gt;will be possible, and since both approaches have been developed from a consistent elastic parameterization,&lt;br/&gt;merging the software and performing joint inversions of the data shows great&lt;br/&gt;potential for greatly improving the capabilities of anisotropic modeling.</AbstractNarration>
