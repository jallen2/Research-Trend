    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0805085&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Peter Albers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to investigate three sets of problems. First,&lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator's PhD thesis laid the foundations of a&lt;br/&gt;novel approach to functoriality for Floer homology, and the next&lt;br/&gt;steps in this direction are to remove some restrictive hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;and to confirm the compatibility of this theory with the&lt;br/&gt;pair-of-pants product on Floer homology. Second, Frauenfelder&lt;br/&gt;and the PI have recent established Floer homology for negative&lt;br/&gt;line bundles, that is, for a class of non-compactly supported&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian functions in non-compact symplectic manifolds, and&lt;br/&gt;this theory should be made more robust by removing symplectic&lt;br/&gt;asphericity hypotheses and should also be extended to a&lt;br/&gt;Morse-Bott situation. Third, the PI will apply the Fredholm&lt;br/&gt;theory in polyfolds developed by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder to&lt;br/&gt;explore newly emerging invariants from the theory of polyfolds&lt;br/&gt;with operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry is the study of spaces equipped with the&lt;br/&gt;basic structure that underlies Hamiltonian mechanics, for which&lt;br/&gt;preferred coordinates give both position and momentum of a moving&lt;br/&gt;object and in which conservation of energy is natural and&lt;br/&gt;inevitable. The Floer homology theory referred to in the first&lt;br/&gt;paragraph studies such manifolds through the critical point&lt;br/&gt;behaviors of certain auxiliary spaces; this kind of analysis of&lt;br/&gt;critical points goes back to work of Marston Morse circa the&lt;br/&gt;1930s, but its application in the modern context requires new&lt;br/&gt;tools such as the polyfold theory cited above.</AbstractNarration>
