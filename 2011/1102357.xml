    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a novel integrative framework for advancing state-of-the-art in biomimetic signal design, underwater acoustic communications, and underwater channel modeling and processing. The challenges brought upon by the highly-distortive nature of underwater sound propagation, such as extended multipath spread, frequency-dependent path loss, and Doppler scale and nonlinear phase changes, are addressed non-invasively by utilizing marine mammal sounds that match the propagation environment. The proposed approach is to develop signal models with time-varying signatures to represent characteristic mammal sounds, design a digital communications system with channel-matched biomimetic transmission signals, characterize the underwater channel and estimate nonlinearly-changing dynamic parameters, and perform information theoretic analysis and optimal channel code design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transformative research emerging from integrating the use of biomimetic signals with underwater environment matched processing techniques is expected to set up set the groundwork for revolutionary advances in underwater acoustic communications. These advances will directly impact development of new communications products with applications in scientific research, ocean geology, ecology, diving safety, and maritime archeology. The technology will also impact covert underwater acoustic communications for defense, environmental monitoring or oil exploration applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have broader impacts on scientific underwater research as it can affect future scientific discoveries and their consequential benefits to society. Furthermore, through the integration of research and education, curriculum innovations will be advanced, including an educational toolbox with web-based exercises and demonstrations offering research opportunities for undergraduate students through senior design and honors projects and providing an avenue for minority and outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
