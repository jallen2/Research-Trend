    <AbstractNarration>This project concentrates on the study of special Lagrangian &lt;br/&gt;equations, symmetric Hessian equations, Isaacs equations, complex &lt;br/&gt;Monge-Ampere equations, and their parabolic versions (e.g., Lagrangian &lt;br/&gt;mean curvature flows). The theory of regularity and solvability for fully &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear uniformly elliptic and parabolic equations (with the convexity &lt;br/&gt;condition in general dimensions and without the convexity hypothesis in &lt;br/&gt;dimension two) is well developed. The concrete equations just listed &lt;br/&gt;either do not satisfy the convexity condition or do not exhibit uniform &lt;br/&gt;ellipticity or parabolicity. Only preliminary attempts have been made in &lt;br/&gt;the general saddle cases. Substantial advances have been achieved for the &lt;br/&gt;symmetric Hessian equations and the complex Monge-Ampere equations, yet &lt;br/&gt;there is still no Schauder or Calderon-Zygmund theory for these equations; &lt;br/&gt;and surprisingly the regularity problem for the quadratic symmetric &lt;br/&gt;Hessian equations in general dimension still remains open. This project &lt;br/&gt;seeks to address these fundamental issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigations into the aforementioned equations will further our &lt;br/&gt;knowledge of two closely related mathematical fields, partial differential &lt;br/&gt;equations and differential geometry. Moreover, the project will also have &lt;br/&gt;impact on the areas where these equations arise. Special Lagrangian &lt;br/&gt;equations and complex Monge-Ampere equations provide the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;foundation for mirror symmetry in the string theory of modern physics, &lt;br/&gt;which is a unified way to describe our physical universe. Solutions to &lt;br/&gt;Isaacs equations lead to the optimal strategy for certain random &lt;br/&gt;processes, for example, in engineering and finance. Hessian equations are &lt;br/&gt;also related to nonlinear elasticity theory in mechanics, which studies &lt;br/&gt;the mechanisms whereby a material that is stretched returns to its &lt;br/&gt;original size and shape. Part of the research also involves participation &lt;br/&gt;of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
