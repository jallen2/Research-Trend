    <AbstractNarration>It has been widely cited that configuration errors enable 65% of cyber attacks and cause 62% of infrastructure downtime. This SafeConfig is a 2-day Symposium on Configuration Analytics and Automation that focuses on addresses challenges and future solution to develop assurable, measurable and usable security and network configurations (www.safeconfig.org). The main objective of this project is to encourage graduate student participation in SafeConfig 2011, which will bring together the research, industry and government communities to exchange experiences, discuss challenges and propose research directions. Early faculty researchers and students will have a unique opportunity to interact with senior researchers in the field from all three communities. They will greatly benefit from the collocation with NIST Security Automation Conference by learning about the state-of-the-art solutions, and connect to industry and government activities. Today's graduate students will play a central role in shaping the future of networking and security technologies. They are the future the administrators, developers, and researchers who will manage, implemented and create solutions to address our current and future challenges of developing secure and assurable network and system configuration systems. Attending specialized and focused event on this area is the most effective way to expose students to the current challenges and future development of this area. This project will facilitate the attendance of young researchers and students to attend SafeConfig 2011 and interact with top researchers from academic, industry and government.</AbstractNarration>
