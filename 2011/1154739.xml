    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates the role of gender in the choice of whether or not to run for political office. In the U.S. many fewer women run for political office than men. Despite the normative importance of this gender gap and the fact that these differences have garnered much attention from political scientists, we still know very little about what explains these differences or why they persist. Previous research has relied on observational studies, such as surveys of public officeholders, where self-reports and sample selection problems prevent clear inferences regarding gender differences. To overcome these problems, this study uses experimental methods to control for confounding factors that affect the relative propensities for women and men to enter politics. Preliminary evidence indicates that there are gender differences in choices to run for office, with women less likely to run than men with similar abilities, and that these differences are specific to the competitive and strategic context of campaigns and elections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to broader impacts, the results of this research could have important benefits to society and policymakers. Understanding gender differences in choices to enter politics will help design policies that draw on the abilities of all our citizens for the betterment of our nation.</AbstractNarration>
