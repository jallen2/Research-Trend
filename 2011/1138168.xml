    <AbstractNarration>This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award is for a detailed study that focuses specifically on characterizing the soil conditions at a select set of strong ground motion recording stations that are underlain by liquefiable soils in regards to the March 11, 2011 magnitude 9.0 Tohoku, Japan Earthquake, which ranks as one of the largest in recorded history. In the aftermath of the earthquake, an advance team from the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association traveled to Japan to coordinate perishable data collection and research efforts with our Japanese colleagues from the Japanese Geotechnical Society, the Center for Urban Earthquake Engineering, and the Port and Airport Research Institute. On this visit, Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) and Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) testing at key strong ground motion recording stations where liquefaction occurred were identified as priority research tasks that the US could contribute to joint US-Japan reconnaissance efforts. The GEER Advance Team visited 14 strong ground motion recording stations underlain by liquefiable soils in the Kanto Plain region, including several with both downhole and surface recordings. Peak ground accelerations at these stations ranged from 0.14 to 0.22 g, and surface evidence of liquefaction was observed at 7 of them. In addition, the Port and Airport Research Institute has indicated they have several strong ground motion recording stations further to the north, where shaking was stronger, that are underlain by liquefiable soils, including some with ground improvements. These key ground motion recordings represent a unique set of data that captures the dynamic response and liquefaction of soft soils during long-duration shaking produced by this M9.0 earthquake. As such, these data can be used to anchor liquefaction triggering curves and refine magnitude scaling factors, assess procedures for estimating ground surface deformations, and evaluate dynamic site response analysis models for liquefiable soils. However, proper characterization of these sites is an imperative step before subsequent analyses can be performed accurately. Subsurface information at these sites is currently limited to a single Standard Penetration Test (SPT) and downhole shear wave velocity (Vs) profile at each site. CPT soundings and many additional Vs profiles from SASW testing at six or more of the most significant strong ground motion recording stations will be obtained. CPT is often preferred over SPT in the US and much of the world for evaluating liquefaction triggering, but CPT is relatively uncommon in Japan for various reasons, and it is unlikely that this work will be performed by our Japanese colleagues. This work is an important and valuable contribution that will enhance the value of these case histories and tie them to US practice. The urgency of this project is due to: (1) the possibility of post-earthquake repair work that could modify ground conditions at key sites, and (2) the need for rapid distribution of CPT and SASW results, which will have maximum impact if obtained before the ground motion records are used for other research studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study are expected to contribute to a significant advancement in the procedures used to predict and model liquefaction effects across the US and elsewhere in the world. Significant research collaborations have existed between the US and Japan since the 1964 Niigata Earthquake. Both counties have benefitted from this partnership, and have used these experiences as a spring board to lead the rest of the world in seismic design and building standards. The CPT and SASW testing will be performed in close coordination with our Japanese colleagues in an effort to continue this tradition by facilitating cross-training of researchers and students on testing practices in our respective countries, providing an avenue for new and important international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
