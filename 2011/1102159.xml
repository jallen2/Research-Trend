    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop intelligent vector control technology, intelligent wind power extraction and management strategy, and advanced simulation and testing mechanisms by using Adaptive Dynamic Programming neural control mechanisms. This will improve the efficiency and reliability of wind energy conversion systems and enhance wind power integration into the electric utility system for the 20% wind penetration vision of the United States in 2030. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERITS &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this research include development of: 1) Adaptive Dynamic Programming vector control technology to overcome the deficiency of conventional vector control technology, 2) intelligent wind power extraction and management techniques to improve wind power production efficiency and reliability, 3) intelligent control integration strategy under practical system constraints, 4) advanced simulation and testing mechanisms, and 5) a curriculum in Intelligent Sustainable Energy Systems to enhance student capability in multidisciplinary fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are significant. The rapid development and increased complexities of sustainable energy systems make it increasingly urgent to develop intelligent and cyber-enabled technologies for research and education of sustainable energy system field. This research will enhance optimal and intelligent technology for future smart and sustainable energy systems and increase the participation of an EPSCOR state in advanced scientific research. The research should have direct or indirect impacts to the following mission areas of the United States: reduction in imported energy, reduction of energy-related emissions, improvements in energy efficiency, and a technological lead for the United States in advanced energy techniques.</AbstractNarration>
