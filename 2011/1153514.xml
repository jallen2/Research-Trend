    <AbstractNarration>Technical Description: The rapid development of photonic technologies for high-speed communication has created a strong demand for high-performance electro-optic materials and devices. Although organic electro-optic materials have emerged as strong candidates, their stability is compromised by decay of the acentric order of the chromophores. This project explores a new method to create and preserve the acentric order in organic electro-optic materials, with the goal of fabricating a device that achieves high electro-optic response and stability. The research carefully investigates poling behavior and related optical nonlinearity. New electro-optic devices are fabricated by sandwiching organic electro-optic materials between p- and n-type transparent semiconductor layers. A strong built-in field, originating from the difference between the Fermi levels of the semiconductor layers, performs contact electrode poling to create and maintain an acentric order in the organic electro-optic materials. The optical performance of the materials and devices is tested by using second harmonic generation and two-beam coupling experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: This project addresses a fundamental science issue on stability in organic electro-optic materials. Successful fabrication of stable materials and devices can generate new high-performance electro-optic components necessary for the continued development of advanced optical technologies. Stable electro-optic devices are in high demand for light modulation, information processing, and optical communication technologies. By initiating research in nonlinear optical materials and related technologies, this project helps encourage interdisciplinary research in materials science, optics, physics, chemistry, and electronics at South Dakota State University.</AbstractNarration>
