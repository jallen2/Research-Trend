    <AbstractNarration>Plants contain a diverse array of fungi that cause no apparent harm, and may even benefit the host. These&lt;br/&gt;"endophytes" are especially prevalent in tropical forests, but it is not known how many types exist, nor how&lt;br/&gt;their diversity is distributed within- and between host species. This project will quantify endophyte&lt;br/&gt;diversity in a lowland Amazonian tree species, and examine the relative importance of geographic distance&lt;br/&gt;and habitat in determining endophyte community membership. This will be achieved using cutting-edge&lt;br/&gt;DNA sequencing technology that allows direct examination of microbial communities, independent of&lt;br/&gt;conventional cultivation methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungi and other microbes have immense effects on ecological processes, often resulting from their&lt;br/&gt;interactions with larger organisms. In the case of endophytes, the ability of a plant to respond to its&lt;br/&gt;environment may be partly mediated by its fungal partners. Because chemistry is the currency of host-symbiont&lt;br/&gt;interactions, this project will reveal potential targets for drug discovery, as well as advance our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of fungal species richness and ecology. During the field component, undergraduates from a&lt;br/&gt;university in Amazonian Peru will receive training in ecology, plant identification, and fungal culture&lt;br/&gt;techniques. An undergraduate in the United States will receive training in basic molecular methods. Results&lt;br/&gt;will be published in English and Spanish, to facilitate further study by scientists from the host region and&lt;br/&gt;abroad.</AbstractNarration>
