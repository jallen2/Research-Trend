    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide funding to assist US-based graduate students to attend the 2011 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC). In addition to attending the conference events, students receiving assistance will serve as scribes for the conference technical sessions to write summaries for a later issue of ;login: magazine, will be required to attend the Student Birds-of-a-Feather session to interact with senior members of the research community specifically interested in meeting students in a casual and informal atmosphere, and will be strongly encouraged to present posters and works-in-progress as part of the selection process. Participation in USENIX ATC?11 is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading work in their research area. The USENIX conference creates a bridge between academic and corporate researchers, and offers a unique, vendor neutral forum for students to gain experience and relationships with an important peer group. It is expected this experience will be very important to their ongoing education, and future career. This project will enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference.</AbstractNarration>
