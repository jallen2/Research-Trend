    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for student attendance at a cutting edge Symposium on Mechanobiology and Mechanotransduction during the Biomedical Engineering Society Fall Meeting 2011. The objectives of this symposium are three-fold:&lt;br/&gt;(1) To highlight the most recent advances on molecular and mechanisms and the genetic basis for mechanobiology and mechanotransduction;&lt;br/&gt;(2) To provide a platform for researchers to establish new connections and exchange ideas;&lt;br/&gt;(3) To honor Dr. Shu Chien's contribution to the field and inspire and facilitate students, especially women and minority students, to perform research in this area.&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide six travel awards of $500 to graduate and undergraduate students, based on the submitted abstracts and financial needs, with at least three of the awards to women and minority students and two awards to undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
