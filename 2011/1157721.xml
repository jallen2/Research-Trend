    <AbstractNarration>Mathematics researchers from US institutions will participate in a three-month program on Geometry and Quantization of Moduli Spaces to be held at the Centre de Recerca Matemàtica (CRM) in Barcelona, Spain in the period March 26 - June 22 2012. This research program focuses on the geometry of algebraic moduli spaces associated to compact Riemann surfaces. The scope is wide, ranging from questions on the topology of moduli spaces to problems on their quantization, including also problems on dynamics, quantum cohomology and other areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central aims of the program on Geometry and Quantization of Moduli Spaces are to bring together experts in the different focus areas of the program, to advance these topics, and to introduce research students and post-doctoral fellows to the wealth of ideas and problems in them. The program includes an advanced course, two workshops, a final conference, as well as a regular seminar. The funds provided by this grant will allow selected participants to attend the special activities of the program or to spend an extended time in residence at the CRM. The funds will be used mostly for graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and other researchers with no current NSF support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A website for the program can be found at http://www.crm.cat/RPGEOMETRY .</AbstractNarration>
