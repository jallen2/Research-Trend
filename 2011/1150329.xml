    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop integrated, low cost systems able to capture and characterize light from 3-D scenes while minimizing or eliminating the need for off-chip computation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is in understanding the capabilities and limitations of imaging systems using diffractive angle-sensitive pixels to analyze the light field. This includes: 1) Developing models of how scene statistics are reflected in the output statistics of angle sensitive pixel arrays, and so developing algorithms to extract useful information about the scene, such as depth, 3-D directional motion, and object recognition. 2) Understanding how to optimize arrays of angle sensitive pixels to encode scenes at various focal depths, as well as how to best deploy signal selection, conditioning and processing circuits to take advantage of these arrays? signal properties when encoding real scenes. 3) Investigating new integrated diffractive structures that enhance ASP quantum efficiency and spatial resolution, and that filter the light field in new ways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research will include enhanced imaging systems with applications in security, automation, health care, and scientific research, from wildlife tracking to microscopy. This work will also impact the commercial sphere by providing new capabilities in consumer electronics, helping to boost economic growth. These impacts are increased because these systems use standard CMOS manufacturing, and so can be mass-produced at very low size and cost. This research provides an easily-understood example of low-level physics driving useful high-level function, providing compelling examples for recruiting and inspiring future engineers.</AbstractNarration>
