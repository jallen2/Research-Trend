    <AbstractNarration>Marine and Hydrokinetic Energy (MKE) generates power by harnessing the natural flow of water without using a dam, a diversionary structure, or an impoundment. It is defined as electrical energy from waves, tides, currents and temperature differentials in oceans, estuaries, and tidal areas, as well as from free flowing water in rivers, lakes, streams and man-made channels. Marine and hydrokinetic energy has the potential to provide almost 10% of the US electricity demands. However, the potential environmental effects of marine and hydrokinetic energy are far from well understood, both in general scientific, engineering, socio-economic, and ecological principles and in site-specific cases. The objective of this project is to bring together a group of experts via a workshop to: (1) lay down the major research challenges and opportunities at the interface of marine/hydrokinetic energy and the environment, and (2) to create synergies among principal investigators towards forming multi-disciplinary research groups that can better undertake end-to-end research in energy and the environment. Invitees will include researchers in academic institutions, National Research Laboratories, and Federal agencies to foster across-agency interactions. Topics to be covered in the workshop span the full spectrum of physical-engineering-economic aspects of MHK energy in oceans, estuaries and rivers including: impact of offshore MHK farms on ocean waves and seabed geomorphology, impact of energy devices on hydrodynamics, wave propagation and turbulence, impact on sediment transport and stream morphodynamics, and evaluation of ecosystem changes and trade-offs including alteration of stream biology and bio-geochemistry as well as impacts on fish movement and migration,. Engineering aspects of turbine size and cluster arrangement on the above aspects will also be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As marine and hydrokinetic energy technology develops at a fast pace and as the pressure for new licenses piles up, accelerated research in providing the scientific understanding of harnessing the natural power of water for renewable energy without harming the environment becomes a priority and thus this workshop is very timely. About 25 ? 30 scientists with expertise in fluid mechanics, wave propagation, geomorphology, sediment transport, hydrology, aquatic biology, nutrient transport, bio-geochemistry, and ocean engineering will be invited, seeking a balance between senior and junior investigators, gender and underrepresented groups. Also, an expert in communicating science to the public and science education will be invited to participate. Participants will be invited to give a presentation of their recent work as well as their perspectives on research opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Students and post-docs will be encouraged to attend and will be provided with travel funds. In addition to presentations, focus groups will be created to discuss specific topics and to contribute to a state-of -the-art summary on MHK energy and the environment research status and future needs.</AbstractNarration>
