    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to North Carolina State University (NCSU) that will provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2014. Students will be engaged in cutting edge research in integrative molecular plant systems (IMPS) with foci on sustainable foods, fuels, and model systems. NCSU has a strong core of plant biologists who are working in multiple areas of integrative plant biology, as well as faculty collaborators from multiple departments and disciplines that serve as research mentors in the program. The goal of the program is to inspire and empower undergraduate researchers to pursue productive scientific careers. Students in the program will participate in a 3-day "Biotechnology Bootcamp" during the first week of the program, where they will learn critical molecular biology laboratory skills, and then will pursue independent research projects for the remainder of the summer under the guidance of a faculty mentor. Students will have multiple public-speaking opportunities to present their research, including a poster presentation at the campus-wide undergraduate research symposium at the end of the program. Students will also participate in career-development activities, including research seminars and various workshops, such as the responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. The student recruitment strategy has an online component through the program website and the NSF website, as well as direct email to colleagues and programs at other institutions and site visits to local HBCUs. Students are selected based on academic record, research interest, letters of recommendation, and potential for outstanding research in molecular plant biology. Students from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://biotech.ncsu.edu/reu or by contacting the PI, Dr. Sue Carson (sue_carson@ncsu.edu or 919-513-0330).</AbstractNarration>
