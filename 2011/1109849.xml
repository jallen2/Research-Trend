    <AbstractNarration>The project will conduct a secondary analysis of large scale longitudinal survey data of students who have been followed into college to explore the types of applied engineering and computer science courses that youth take in high school, and the extent to which these courses help promote advancement toward careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The analysis will inform researchers and policy makers about the extent to which high school course taking in applied engineering influences math achievement, fields of college study, and jobs with STEM applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will analyze the study known as ELS:2002 which is a nationally representative study of 10th-graders in 2002 sponsored by NCES. A sample of approximately 14,000 students with full transcripts will be analyzed using five Math Achievement scores (10th grade) and first follow-up (12th grade). The study will provide a new descriptive overview of the STEM course taking in high school and an econometric test of the efficacy of applied math and science. They will apply multivariate, quasi-experimental regression techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will provide answers to both a theoretical and a practical question. For theory, the study will indicate the extent to which learning in non-academic courses during high school years actually create student knowledge in mathematics that will be applied later in their school and work life. For practice, the study will provide evidence for educators about the value of non-academic courses for later development. If the study finds that non-academic high school courses are as influential as academic training, then the fields of vocational education will be especially interested. If however this national study shows that only academic courses provide the requisite background in mathematics for any adult application, then the school policies might be encouraged to improve the access of all students to academic training.</AbstractNarration>
