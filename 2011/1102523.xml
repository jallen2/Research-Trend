    <AbstractNarration>Colorado State University (CSU), the lead institution, in collaboration with fourteen institutional&lt;br/&gt;partners constitutes the CO-AMP consortium. The Consortium is proposing a strategic and&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive effort to address the following goals in connection with underrepresented minorities,&lt;br/&gt;women of color, and persons with disabilities successfully completing baccalaureate degrees in Science,&lt;br/&gt;Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM):&lt;br/&gt;1) Continue to increase bachelor degree completion in STEM disciplines;&lt;br/&gt;2) Improve retention and transfer rates from 2-year to 4-year institutions;&lt;br/&gt;3) Enhance partnerships with Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) in Colorado;&lt;br/&gt;4) Strengthen graduate school preparation;&lt;br/&gt;5) Promote international research experiences to enhance global diversity and understanding.&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception, efforts of the CO-AMP Consortium have extended from the pre-freshmen&lt;br/&gt;level to enrollment in graduate school programs. The Consortium has been a major driving force at&lt;br/&gt;partner institutions to encourage and motivate students to excel and graduate with a bachelor?s. degree in&lt;br/&gt;STEM fields. The enrollment and visibility of diverse students has also increased, demonstrated by the&lt;br/&gt;recent 84% increase in LS CO-AMP enrollment. A significant level of support, in addition to that from&lt;br/&gt;the NSF, has been provided by central administrations, Departments and Colleges of the Consortium,&lt;br/&gt;and industry partners. Most importantly, the Consortium faculty and staff have provided individualized&lt;br/&gt;student support without which the activities would not have been as successful.&lt;br/&gt;Most, if not all, of the proposed initiatives in goals 1 through 5 have been and will continue to be&lt;br/&gt;institutionalized at partner institutions. Early integration of minority students into college life must start in&lt;br/&gt;the admissions office with early faculty advising and mentoring linked to the process. Proposed math skill&lt;br/&gt;building and science course assistance will be continued and further expanded. Student academic&lt;br/&gt;advancement will also be enhanced by participation in NAPIRE and other international research&lt;br/&gt;experiences, contributing to global diversity and understanding. In addition, further establishment of&lt;br/&gt;professional societies at 2-year and 4-year colleges is critical to increasing science identity and&lt;br/&gt;integration into the professional community. This collaboration of national resources, resulting from these&lt;br/&gt;diverse programs, is essential to assure benefits to underrepresented minorities, women of color, and&lt;br/&gt;person with disabilities; and will be sustained as an essential structure continuing after funding from the&lt;br/&gt;NSF is no longer available.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Innovative programs based on the Tinto Model and research results from the Higher Education&lt;br/&gt;Research Institute (HERI) will target improved academic and social integration of students into college life&lt;br/&gt;and promote students? self-identity as scientists. CO-AMP will integrate math assistance and curricula&lt;br/&gt;between 2-year and 4-year institutions. Pipelines between high school, 2-year/4-year colleges, and&lt;br/&gt;graduate school will be integrated by faculty mentoring into the admissions process, establishing&lt;br/&gt;professional societies on campuses, and building bridges through innovative summer workshops,&lt;br/&gt;research at 2-year and 4-year campuses, and international research experiences. Evaluation efforts will&lt;br/&gt;provide evidence-based methodologies for improving student retention. CO-AMP has a history of qualified staff, as well as the facilities, networks, and partnerships in place to focus on&lt;br/&gt;building a stronger infrastructure that will continue to build capacity and compatibility in the Consortium.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The programs and activities CO-AMP will undertake cover the core areas of recruitment and&lt;br/&gt;retention, including training of faculty, promotion of proven programs, support from industry involvement,&lt;br/&gt;as well as conducting research to determine best practice in preparing students for higher levels of math&lt;br/&gt;and science. CO-AMP is partnered with all of the Hispanic Serving Institutions in Colorado and Fort&lt;br/&gt;Lewis (one of only three Native American-Serving Non-Tribal Colleges in the US) making it optimally&lt;br/&gt;positioned to serve the greatest number of Hispanic and Native American students. Results of research&lt;br/&gt;conducted will be presented at conferences and published to further knowledge in this important area of&lt;br/&gt;diversity education. The results will reduce educational disparities and improve scientific knowledge in&lt;br/&gt;minority/tribal communities, as trained minority scientists act as role models and educators.</AbstractNarration>
