    <AbstractNarration>Involving undergraduate students in research is recognized as an experience that powerfully engages students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and launches students into STEM careers. This research project examines how participation in undergraduate research impacts students in terms of the significance of the experience for the participants and explores the relationship between student outcomes and the goals and activities of these types of experiences. Focusing on the fields of chemistry and physics, the largely qualitative study investigates commonly reported outcomes for students and their mentors to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors and common relationships between features of the research experience and student characteristics. Utilizing an iterative analytic approach, the investigators document and analyze the structure and implementation of the research experience in relation to student attributes and previous experiences with STEM. In addition, the multi-site study examines hypotheses about the impact of these experiences on engagement in STEM and how participation in a research experience leads to commitment to pursue a career in STEM. Findings from the study are to be published in science educational research journals and presented at meetings sponsored by professional societies.</AbstractNarration>
