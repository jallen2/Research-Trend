    <AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Building analytical, synthesis, and human network skills needed for&lt;br/&gt;macrosystem science: a next generation graduate student training model based on GLEON&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecology is on the cusp of new continental-scale science. Enabled by emerging science networks, there is now a tremendous promise for understanding the effects and consequences of global environmental change on ecological systems across regions and among continents. Data from environmental sensor networks, as well as ever-growing, publically available data from research and monitoring programs around the world will underpin this understanding. However, scientific advances require people who can make creative use of technology and data, and who can work together to promote transdisciplinary understanding. Tackling large scale science will require a generation of scientists trained to work in teams to effectively use/create the cyber infrastructure necessary to deliver relevant data, to explore, analyze and synthesize those data using a variety of techniques and tools, and to communicate their findings to the scientific community and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of a Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) Graduate Student Fellows Program (GGSFP) is proposed to build the essential skills necessary for a new generation of scientists to quickly assume productive roles in macrosystem syntheses, and network science organizations. GLEON is an international, grassroots network of scientists, information technology experts, and engineers who have a common goal of building a scalable, persistent network of lake ecology observatories (www.gleon.org). GLEON has over 300 members (95 students) from 34 countries and has multiple data repositories, including near-continuous high frequency data from lakes. This work will combine the extensive resources and experience of GLEON with expertise in pedagogy, organizational sociology, leadership training, and assessment to create an innovative training program. Two cohorts of fellows, along with their advisors, will participate in a series of 5 collaboratories that form its core. Asking and answering continental-scale questions will be the scientific goal. A final workshop with other major network education colleagues will help communicate successes and lessons learned to other Ecological Observatory Networks. Dozens of additional students will participate in shorter training sessions through GLEON all hands meetings. Central to this training program will be (1) development of technical, conceptual and analytical skills critical to carrying out macroscale biology and network science, (2) development of communication skills for collaboration, education and public outreach, (3) active participation in existing networks of people, data, and technologies, and perhaps most important (4) training and guidance by experts in how to build and sustain human networks through pedagogy, organizational structure, and leadership training. Ongoing assessments will be used to refine the program and to measure success and guide future programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The GLEON GGSFP will develop scientists' capabilities to build and maintain the human infrastructure that is necessary to understand complex environmental system function under global change. Students will emerge from the program with significant skills in working within and utilizing networks of people, infrastructure, data and equipment, and the ability to ask and answer complex, large scale questions. Dozens of students will be engaged through GLEON, and intensive, focused training for two cohorts of ten fellows will be provided. Student cohorts will be selected to reflect gender, cultural and disciplinary diversity balance, following the practices fostered, and lessons learned with the GLEON Graduate Student Association. Coincident with the development of students will be a training exemplar for the ecological community. The outcomes and impact of this program will be extended throughout the community via web-distribution of collaboratory training and through social networking tools. In addition, primary graduate student advisors will experience new training models and tools; fellows will develop a network of mentors in addition to those at their home institution; and fellows and primary advisors, together, will develop outreach materials and/or curricula. Advances in scientific understanding through peer reviewed publications, including those having to do with organizational management will also result. The program will become part of the infrastructure of GLEON, providing new expertise in pedagogy, organizational theory, and leadership training, resulting in continued production of a highly trained work force with the dimensionality required to realize the promise of network science.</AbstractNarration>
