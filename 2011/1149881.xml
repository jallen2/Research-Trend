    <AbstractNarration>This award will fund a three-day symposium in Washington, DC, October 24-26, 2011, bringing together leaders in important fields of mutual interest to Brazil and the United States. These fields include bioenergy, climate change, biodiversity and Amazon studies, plant genomics, urban and area studies, optics and photonics, vaccines and drug discovery, stem cells, and tropical diseases. The event celebrates the 50-year anniversary of the São Paulo Research Foundation (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP). Brazil is an emerging actor in science and technology as well as financial, agricultural, and energy markets. In addition to these advances, as a large democracy, Brazil is one the United States? critical partners in the world. A joint scientific meeting is fitting to commemorate FAPESP and, moreover, to solidify the future of the US ? Brazil partnership.</AbstractNarration>
