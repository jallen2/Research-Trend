    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will attempt to resolve inefficiencies in the processing of health insurance claims. A total of 8.3-18.1 billion transactions, including eligibility verification, claim submission, etc., are performed annually in healthcare with only 30-50% of them being electronic. These paper-based transactions in claims processing result in system-wide inefficiencies which lead to inaccurate claims assessment, delayed settlements, losses due to fraud, litigation, regulatory non-compliance. The proposed innovation brings to bear a newly-emerging set of health-care IT standards coupled with the ubiquitous cellular mobile platform to provide an integrated solution throughout the payer-consumer-provider healthcare value chain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to mitigate inefficiencies in collaboration with a health insurance company that is a thought leader in claims processing, by integrating innovative mobile technology and applying it in a manner that circumvents any significant reworking or replacement of existing claims processing systems. Health care costs are approximately 16% of GDP, and represent a meaningful drag on our nation?s economy. If this proposed approach is successfully deployed, it promises to address a significant barrier to the efficient delivery of healthcare with the United States.</AbstractNarration>
