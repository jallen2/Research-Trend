    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Site at the University of Texas at Dallas is focused on surface engineering with applications in nanotechnology, energy, electronics and sensing and is supported by the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation. Each year nine undergraduate students are recruited for a ten-week summer research experience, with recruitment focusing on women and under-represented groups, and students from institutions where research opportunities limited. The research projects have been designed by an interdisciplinary team of faculty from the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. Student research projects will include the development of Li ion batteries, titanium dioxide nanotubes for biochemical sensing, flexible electronics and organic hybrid solar cells, and the characterization and modeling of materials. In addition to participating in research, the REU fellows will also attend an introductory short-course in surface engineering, research seminars from faculty and outside experts, seminars on career planning and the ethics and business of science and engineering, as well as visits to local high tech industries and informal discussions with speakers. At the end of the program each fellow will present their research at a half-day symposium which will be open to all undergraduate researchers on the University of Texas at Dallas campus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Site at the University of Texas at Dallas will introduce undergraduates to research in surface engineering with applications in nanotechnology, energy, electronics and sensingand is supported by the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation. Each year nine undergraduate students will be selected for the program, with recruitment focusing on women and under-represented groups, and students from institutions where research opportunities limited. This goal is particularly significant in Texas, where under-representation of women and minorities in higher education is a severe problem. The proposed work will lead to new advances in areas of great economic and societal importance, including nanoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysts, batteries, fuel cells, thermoelectrics, energy-harvesting systems, heat transfer systems, and sensors. Preparing talented students to perform research in these and related areas is critical in maintaining the competitiveness of the United States.</AbstractNarration>
