    <AbstractNarration>The primary objective is to further the development of a vertical vision for research on the role of non-volatile memory technologies in data-intensive computing systems. It is essential that researchers at each level of the system stack be aware of the needs, challenges, and opportunities associated with the other levels. The workshop will give researchers in relevant fields the opportunity to gain a broader understanding of what is needed to move NVM-based storage technology forward, to learn from each other, and to establish relationships and collaborations that will provide the basis for further scientific and engineering advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This workshop will address fundamental problems in the science, engineering, and application of high-performance data storage systems based upon non-volatile memories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The exchange of knowledge and the generation of novel ideas that result from the workshop will have significant impact on the computing and data storage industries, both vitally important to the national economy. The educational component of the workshop will benefit student researchers, as well as more senior participants.</AbstractNarration>
