    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the National Science Foundation supports the work of Professor Seth B. Herzon in the area of complex alkaloid total synthesis. The proposal builds on prior research which provided efficient strategies to synthesize the hasubanan alkaloids, a large family of botanical natural products. In the proposed work, the application of these strategies toward the synthesis of more complex alkaloid natural products will be pursued. In parallel, the development of new synthetic methods, inspired by the synthetic studies, will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of efficient methods for the synthesis of hasubanan alkaloids will improve access to molecules with diverse biological effects. This research will provide training for students in sophisticated organic synthesis preparing them for a career in academia or pharmaceutical industry. The adaptation of new teaching methods for sophomore organic chemistry and a systematic, research-based approach to undergraduate education is another important component of this project. The goal is to increase the number of students (including students of underrepresented groups) pursuing chemistry and related fields of study by improving the way undergraduate organic chemistry is taught, and learned. A University-wide program to provide high school students with hands-on experience in chemistry is also planned.</AbstractNarration>
