    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Imaging, Communications and Finance: Stochastic Modeling of Real-world Problems" is scheduled to be held on June 24-25, 2011 at Columbia University in New York, NY. The purpose of the conference is to bring together scientists, from diverse research areas and career stages, in order to identify and discuss key emerging areas of interdisciplinary research where mathematical sciences promise to play an important role in the coming years. The diversity of the conference participants, which will include researchers from the fields of mathematics, statistics, radiology, engineering and finance, will help strengthen the connection between mathematical sciences and other science and engineering disciplines, as well as between established researchers and junior researchers in the start of their careers. This will have the effect of advancing knowledge both within and across different fields of research by sharing knowledge, identifying specific research problems of particular importance and helping to facilitate new collaborations between individuals and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics and probability play an increasingly important role in a variety of interdisciplinary research areas including neuroscience, genetics, physics, finance and engineering. The goal of this conference is to focus on a number of important and emerging interdisciplinary areas of research, such as imaging, telecommunications and finance. Though the individual topic areas are diverse, a unifying theme for the conference is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial, and statistical analysis of models for problems arising in the real world. The conference will highlight important contributions already made through the use of statistics and probability, including the development of new reconstruction algorithms for medical imaging; stochastic models in risk analysis and finance; and methods for analyzing complicated network data arising from social, energy, traffic, communication, and computer problems. In addition, the conference will attempt to identify emerging issues where statistics and probability promise to play an important role in the future and help facilitate collaborations between researchers in these areas and the mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
