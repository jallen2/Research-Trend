    <AbstractNarration>This is a one-year effort to refurbish and deliver a scientific grade optical instrument, Limb-imaging Ionospheric and Thermospheric EUV Spactrograph (LITES), which will be flown as a hosted payload onboard a commercial satellite as part of a US Air Force (USAF) program. LITES is a compact, high-sensitivity extreme and far ultraviolet spectral imager designed to measure key ion and neutral species in the ionosphere-thermosphere system. It will be constructed by modifying an existing, flight-proven high-sensitivity imaging spectrograph developed by the proposer. Specifically, the instrument will be upgraded by replacing the existing detector with a larger, more capable detector, providing an extended spectral range for the instrument as well as lower noise. To meet the current schedule for the payload, the upgraded instrument must be ready by mid 2012, which leaves less than 12 months for its construction and testing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide valuable opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to experience a real life space project in collaboration with the USAF and aerospace industry. The upgrade to the instrument will expand the scope of this USAF project from purely technology demonstration to a science investigation and the NSF participation in the project will help ensure that the science data is made freely available to the scientific community. Finally, the project will advance the technological development and demonstration of miniaturized instruments that may benefit the realization of future small satellite missions.</AbstractNarration>
