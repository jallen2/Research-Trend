    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project is to support participation by USA-based mathematicians and physicists, graduate students, and post-docs, in the conference on representation theory, quantization, and supergeometry to be held in Bialowieza, Poland, during the week of June 26 - July 2, 2011. The topics of the conference include representations of local current groups and other infinite-dimensional groups and Lie algebras, together with supergroups and Lie superalgebras, formality theorems for Hochschild cochains via transfer, construction of differential graded categories for compact symplectic manifolds using the microlocal theory of sheaves by Kashiwara-Schapira, "monstrous moonshine" and vertex operator algebras, quantization of three-dimensional quantum gravity based on the quantum universal Teichmueller space, odd symplectic geometry and the Batalin-Vilkovissky formalism, and relations between the chiral de Rham complex and generalized complex structures, vertex algebroids and supergeometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference brings together researchers who have made significant contributions to representation theory, quantization, and super-mathematics. The interaction between these three fields has been one of the major driving forces of the modern mathematical physics. The format of the conference, its location and facilities provide an intimate research environment for the interaction of established researchers with each other and with graduate students and post-docs, and give an opportunity to younger researchers to present their work to an international audience.&lt;br/&gt;Additional information can be found on the conference web page http://wgmp.uwb.edu.pl/</AbstractNarration>
