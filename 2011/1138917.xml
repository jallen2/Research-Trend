    <AbstractNarration>CBET - 1138917 &lt;br/&gt;Chamot &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, Public Law 108-153, requires triennial reviews of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). The director of the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO) which serves as the secretariat for the NNI has requested the next triennial review to be done by the National Academy of Sciences. This proposal is directed toward fulfilling the NNI review requirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the current study, the NNCO is particularly interested in examining the role of the NNI in&lt;br/&gt;maximizing opportunities to transfer selected technologies to the private sector (e.g., in electronics; structural materials; coatings); suggesting appropriate metrics for determining progress towards NNI goals; and review of NNI's management and coordination of nanotechnology research across both civilian and military federal agencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves review of a federal program for coordinating government efforts in supporting nanotechnology R&amp;D, as requested by the US Congress and the NNCO. It is not a study of nanotechnologies, per se. The study committee will examine the NNI management approach, the effectiveness of efforts to transfer selected technologies to the private sector, the goals of the program and how to assess progress towards those goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific tasks include:&lt;br/&gt;A. Examine the role of the NNI in maximizing opportunities to transfer selected technologies to the private sector, provide an assessment of how well the NNI is carrying out this role, and suggest new mechanisms to foster transfer of technologies and improvements to NNI operations in this area where warranted.&lt;br/&gt;B. Assess the suitability of current procedures and criteria for determining progress towards NNI goals, suggest definitions of success and associated metrics, and provide advice on those organizations (government or non-government) that could perform evaluations of progress.&lt;br/&gt;C. Review NNI?s management and coordination of nanotechnology research across both civilian and military federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this review would be of value to the Congress and participating federal agencies in planning future support for NNI projects. In addition, as a major goal of the program is to develop technologies that would be transferable to the industrial sector and thus contribute to US competitiveness, the report would also be of interest to various industrial concerns and their academic colleagues who would translate the fundamental research into industrial applications.</AbstractNarration>
