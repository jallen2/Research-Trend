    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate a new III-V nitride semiconductor alloy and bipolar transistor structure with the potential to enable ultra low power device operation in applications requiring both Radio Frequency (RF) and digital electronics. The problem to be solved is that for RF power amplifier increasing power efficiency has been a major issue for portable and high performance electronic devices. The research objectives is to demonstrate on a standard gallium arsenide (GaAs) transistor platform that the inclusion of our low band gap nitride semiconductor will significantly reduce the turn on voltage, thus increasing the battery life of the device. Our research will start from the development of a low bandgap material to the fabrication of transistor that will be compared to the specifications of cellular based RF amplifiers. This program will begin with device design and material synthesis and end with prototype demonstrations, with our commercial partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will have a huge impact on power consumption in the realm of high-performance personal communication electronics, as the requirement for greater functionality in cell phones rises. GaAs wafers dominate the market for amplifiers in wireless communication products. Transistors have advantages over existing standard GaAs-based devices with reduced power consumption could impact the entire electronics industry. As portable or wireless cellular devices continue to become ever more functional they will require significantly lower turn-on voltages so as to minimize power consumption while sustaining operation over longer periods of time. The overall structure of the project has been designed to provide enriching opportunities in the areas of teaching and training for both the graduate students and university researchers. The exchange ideas between industry and academia will ensure research candidates with an excellent technical background and a sophisticated understanding of the industrial environment.</AbstractNarration>
