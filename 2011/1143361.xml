    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use and adapt a photonic signal processor for extreme bandwidth spread spectrum wireless communications. The intellectual merit of the proposed project focuses on applying prior knowledge and the core photonic analog optical signal processing technology with new approaches and extensions of spread spectrum techniques to an important emerging commercial application, namely high bandwidth wireless communication at high frequencies. The widespread demand for wireless communication has created contention for RF spectrum, and has motivated extending communications to unlicensed bands and higher frequencies. The objectives of the project are to 1) perform transmitter analysis and encoding schemes, 2) to show spread spectrum communication functionality in laboratory hardware based demonstrations over the frequencies of 3.1-10.6 GHz, and 3) to study desired parameters and tradeoffs for the implementation and commercialization of communications links. The anticipated results of the research are demonstrations that show these capabilities, with increased knowledge of the requirements and tradeoffs of the proposed technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact / commercial potential of this project are in the field of wideband, wireless communications. From this technology development effort, there are significant market opportunities for the emerging 60-90 GHz E band wireless market. The enabling photonic signal processing technology has applicability for commercial, military and intelligence community in the form of full spectrum surveillance, spectrum analysis, direction finding, navigation, and imaging, along with the proposed communications approach proposed. Benefits of the proposed communication approach include transmissions at high data rates, asynchronous burst mode operation, providing secure, low probability of intercept transmissions and overcoming multipath issues.</AbstractNarration>
