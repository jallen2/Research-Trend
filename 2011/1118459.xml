    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1108459 PI: Wong, Joyce ORG: Boston University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: 2011 Biomaterials &amp; Tissue Engineering Gordon Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Biomaterials- and tissue engineering-based strategies and approaches are central for the successful performance of numerous biomedical devices. The theme of the 2011 Gordon Research Conference on Biomaterials &amp; Tissue Engineering is ?The Path from Basic Science and Engineering to Translational Medicine.? It focuses on applying basic science and engineering principles in diverse settings including developmental biology, materials science, and nanotechnology with the goal of solving important clinically relevant biomedical problems. The program will provide a cutting-edge scientific program and discussion forum that focuses on specific fundamental and applied science and engineering challenges that, when overcome, will facilitate the translation of biomaterials and tissue engineering technologies to clinical medicine. The program serves both to educate the biomaterials and tissue engineering communities in the highly relevant field of developmental biology and to stimulate discussion in current approaches from both materials science and engineering and biological perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: In the spirit of the Gordon Research Conferences, this conference seeks to bring together speakers and discussion leaders at the forefront of their field with other prominent investigators, junior attendees, and researchers from underrepresented groups. This diverse group of speakers, discussion leaders, and poster presenters who represent different fields of study (e.g. clinical investigators, basic scientists and engineers, and industrial researchers) can contribute to the advancement of the field of biomaterials and tissue engineering. Such interactions are critical for building research networks for researchers at all stages of their career and play a key role in developing future leaders in the field of biomaterials science and engineering. The discussion leaders and speakers were selected to represent the gender, ethnic, and cultural (i.e. researchers from non-US institutions ? 6 non-US countries represented) diversity in the biomaterials and tissue engineering fields. In accordance with Gordon Research Conference policies, there are no formal publications; however, the GRC format provides a stimulating environment to disseminate new ideas and to establish new and continue existing collaborations/interactions. This year?s program has 19 out of 41 discussion leaders and speakers who are women and/or from underrepresented minority groups; 6 are assistant professors. Selection of attendees from the pool of applicants will adhere to principles of affirmative action with respect to minority groups, women, and junior scientists in addition to the date of application and the scientific background of the applicant.</AbstractNarration>
