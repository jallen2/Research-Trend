    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing support for travel and registration for U.S. participants in a key global venue for research and training in the learning sciences via the Doctoral Consortium and Early Career Workshops at the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) 2011 conference in Hong Kong. Prior versions of these workshops have had a significant impact on the career and research of pre- and post-PhD scholars in the learning sciences from diverse domains such as computer science, information science, education, psychology, and cognitive science. The intellectual merit of this project rests in its selection of top-quality pre- and post-doctoral candidates whose research in computer-supported collaborative learning addresses the conference theme of connecting theory and practice in the learning sciences. Their participation in the conference provides opportunities to improve the dissertations of approximately twenty graduate students and the research agendas of approximately twenty early career, post-doctoral scholars. As such it is an important capacity-building project that leverages the expertise of the CSCL community and the outcomes of previous workshops held with the International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS). The broader impacts of this project include multiplying opportunities to develop international collaborations in the field of CSCL, and supporting the career development of some of the best and brightest researchers in multiple disciplines who work in the CSCL area.</AbstractNarration>
