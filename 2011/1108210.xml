    <AbstractNarration>The American Geological Institute is working to increase the number of highly successful geoscience faculty members from underrepresented communities, with a longer term goal of increasing the diversity of the student population engaged in geoscience education and career paths. This project is addressing the key issue of supporting faculty members who are able to serve effectively as role models and mentors to underrepresented minority students, while also maximizing their own professional success. The project is engaging underrepresented minority geoscience faculty at all institutions and all geoscience faculty at minority serving institutions (MSIs). Thirty (30) early career faculty and future faculty graduate students are participating in a 2.5 day workshop pilot focused on enhancing research productivity, instructional excellence, and service to the profession. The workshop pilot, which is based on a successful model implemented by the National Academy of Engineering, includes research and grant-writing advice, networking, career opportunities from professional societies, and teaching resources, as well as targeted interactions to evaluate the unique challenges faced by underrepresented minorities in the geoscience community. Participants are nominated by their departments or invited by the conveners to become leaders in the community working towards improving diversity in the geosciences. Follow-on interactions to measure the longitudinal impact of the workshop on participant success and to evaluate changes in their perception and/or experience regarding what were identified as unique issues facing underrepresented minority faculty are included. As a persistent resource following the workshop, the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) is incorporating video segments from the presentations and discussions into its "PI Guide" website, which serves as a virtual community for current and aspiring PIs to share resources and best practices in developing and managing an academic career. Workshop conveners will maintain support for the participants through follow-up meetings at two professional society annual meetings.</AbstractNarration>
