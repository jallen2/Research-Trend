    <AbstractNarration>In this award from the Special Projects Program, the Division of Chemistry will provide partial support for a Presidential Commission on Graduate Education in the Chemical Sciences, which was convened recently by the American Chemical Society (ACS). This Commission is examining issues that affect the recruitment, retention, and development of high-quality graduate students. Its goal is to consider innovative models in graduate education in the chemical sciences and make actionable recommendations for enhancing the quality of graduate research and education. The Commission will solicit input to inform its work through listening sessions at ACS National and Regional Meetings, along with targeted feedback from graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, early career faculty, underrepresented groups, industrial representatives, and other stakeholders. The report of the ACS Presidential Commission on Graduate Education in the Chemical Sciences will be distributed in hard copy to chemistry departments and will be freely available online through the ACS website.</AbstractNarration>
