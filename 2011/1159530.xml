    <AbstractNarration>1159530&lt;br/&gt;Dogariu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell motility is central to a number of biological and pathological processes including cancer cell invasion and metastasis, inflammation, angiogenesis, wound repair, and embryonic development. Cell movement occurs via the concerted activities of cell adhesion molecules, the actin cytoskeleton and an extensive network of signaling molecules. Currently, the chemical, mechanical and electrical stimulation have all been explored for guiding the motility of cells. However, these stimuli are not universal in guiding a variety of cells and, sometimes, they may even cause damage to certain cells. This program aims at developing a non-invasive method for regulating cells motility. The main goal is to find means for promoting cells migration along reconfigurable three-dimensional paths by using irradiation with specially prepared coherent optical radiation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This transformative concept will overcome major limitations of current approaches for directing and controlling cells motility. The broader impact of this research will be the development of fundamental knowledge about the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton and the possibility to actively influence it in response to the action of optical fields. This knowledge can steer further developments in controlling the cellular biomechanics for further applications in tissue engineering, drug development, and cellular biology studies. The results of this program will be broadly disseminated not only through publications but also by extensive collaborative efforts. Reaching across biology, biophysics, and biophotonics, the research is truly interdisciplinary and offers possibilities for an integrated training of students in engineering, optics, and biology and will also provide ample opportunities for undergraduate research involving students from a variety of backgrounds, including groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
