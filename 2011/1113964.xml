    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the effort to design and&lt;br/&gt;prototype a new high-performance but low-cost integrated robotic manipulator comprising of the tight&lt;br/&gt;integration of mechanical, electrical, and computational subsystems. A significant part of the effort is to&lt;br/&gt;address the computational challenges involved in developing a new generation of intelligent robotic&lt;br/&gt;manipulators. Real-time general vision processing and dexterous planning, for example, are not&lt;br/&gt;feasible using conventional embedded processors. The consequence is that advanced robotic&lt;br/&gt;applications are only possible in environments where the robotic arm can outsource computationally&lt;br/&gt;expensive processes to more powerful computers. Low-power, High-Performance Computing (HPC)&lt;br/&gt;clusters will be used to extend what is currently possible in autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic&lt;br/&gt;manipulator systems. Therefore a research effort is to develop a scalable high-level intelligence&lt;br/&gt;framework applied to robotic manipulators, and to implement robust and real-time algorithms that take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of highly parallel computing environments. Application computations will integrate&lt;br/&gt;seamlessly across wireless and wired networks of heterogeneous robotic and computer systems. The&lt;br/&gt;goal is a highly capable, computationally scalable, low-cost intelligent robotic arm platform for&lt;br/&gt;research and light industry, which can easily be adapted to a variety of complex applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to fill a market niche between the low-end&lt;br/&gt;robotic manipulators that have little commercial potential and the high-end robotic arms that are&lt;br/&gt;expensive and have high operating costs for setup and operation. High-performance computation&lt;br/&gt;integrated with advanced robotic manipulator systems are applicable for agile light industry and other&lt;br/&gt;desktop manipulator applications in unstructured environments. This will have a tremendous impact on&lt;br/&gt;the future of commercial robotics and make capable robotic systems affordable to small manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;businesses. Highly parallel computing power will greatly increase the range of applications and&lt;br/&gt;environments to which robots are suited. For example, an intelligent robotic manipulator can be used in&lt;br/&gt;agricultural applications or autonomously caring for plants in highly unstructured environments. The&lt;br/&gt;same manipulator could easily be adapted for use in a classroom setting; with a simple scripting&lt;br/&gt;interface students can experiment with advanced robotic control, allowing them to concentrate on&lt;br/&gt;discovering exciting new applications. This creates a broad market in academic and industrial settings,&lt;br/&gt;both for highly-capable, low-cost intelligent robotic manipulators for agile manufacturing and for lowpower&lt;br/&gt;HPC clusters applied to sensor network integration solutions in general.</AbstractNarration>
