    <AbstractNarration>This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) projects engages undergraduate students in an intensive six-week research program in Mexico, with the overarching goal of enhancing students' research skills and cultural literacy in an internationally emerging field of engineering. Under the mentorship of Drs. Neale Smith and Beatriz Murrieta Cortés of the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), six U.S. students per year will investigate radio-frequency identification (RFID) applications in health care, aerospace manufacturing environments, and inter-modal and warehousing logistics. Specific research themes include security and inventory control in hospital settings, real-time adjustments of the supply chain in aerospace manufacturing facilities, and tracking the delivery of products from supplier to customer in multistep transportation systems. Students will also be involved in pre-trip and on-site orientations, a research methods seminar focusing on the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS-R) approach, graduate student development seminars, and oral and written presentations. Spanish language instruction and cultural activities will also be an integral part of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international research collaboration brings together researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and ITESM, along with industry partners such as the Hospital San José, Bombardier, and Werner Global Logistics. UNL will recruit a diverse group of undergraduate students to participate, with strong representation of women and underrepresented minorities. Results from the experience will be shared by students and faculty at educational conferences, through annual reports, and the program website. This partnership will also allow the further testing of models and innovations that have significant practical implications for U.S. - Mexico trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).</AbstractNarration>
