    <AbstractNarration>In the AugSTEM program, Augsburg College is awarding 70 scholarships to a cross-disciplinary cohort of students. The program builds on past successes in attracting transfer and underrepresented students to Augsburg's small urban campus and successful retention strategies in introductory STEM sequences. Approximately 50% of the scholarship recipients began their postsecondary careers at area community colleges. Students are united by their common educational stage and a shared objective of graduating and pursuing a STEM career. Programming encourages students to finish their degrees with strong academic credentials and clarity of purpose. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives of the AugSTEM program are to:&lt;br/&gt; - Increase the number of transfer students who obtain a STEM degree by building partnerships and providing programming tailored to the needs and timelines of such students;&lt;br/&gt; - Provide financial support for 30 academically talented upper-division STEM students;&lt;br/&gt; - Retain junior and senior STEM students to graduation by extending earlier successes in first and second-year programming;&lt;br/&gt; - Enhance the readiness of STEM students for successful transitions to the scientific workplace; and &lt;br/&gt; - Develop sustained excellence in undergraduate STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AugSTEM program is increasing the College's efforts to create a diverse campus, especially serving underrepresented populations who might otherwise leave the STEM pipeline. The program is also pairing with S-STEM programs at partner community college to better serve the increasing population of undergraduates who begin their careers at two-year institutions. Ultimately, the AugSTEM program is increasing the number and diversity of STEM graduates entering the workforce, fostering interactions between Augsburg STEM faculty and community college colleagues, enhancing professional preparedness for students, and providing a foundation for future growth of a vibrant division of natural sciences and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
