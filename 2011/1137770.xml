    <AbstractNarration>Student travel support for DNA17&lt;br/&gt;Conference title: 17th International Conference on DNA Computing and&lt;br/&gt;Molecular Programming (DNA17)&lt;br/&gt;Location: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA&lt;br/&gt;Dates: September 19?23, 2011&lt;br/&gt;Website: http://dna17.caltech.edu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;This is an unsolicited proposal for 12,000 USD for student travel support for the 17th International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming (DNA17). The primary purpose of the proposal is to give travel assistance to students who are giving oral or poster presentations at the conference. The selection procedure for travel awards is described in detail below and is designed to give priority to women and underrepresented minorities, and to research quality. Approximately 20 successful student applicants, from US institutions (excluding Caltech), will be funded for travel and accommodation, with an expected average award of 600 USD per student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The annual International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming (DNAx) is the premier forum where scientists with diverse backgrounds come together with the common purpose of advancing the engineering and science of biology and chemistry from the point of view of computer science, physics, and mathematics. Continuing this tradition, the 17th International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming (DNA17), under the auspices of the International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation and Engineering (ISNSCE), will focus on the most recent experimental and theoretical results that promise the greatest impact. A steady stream of papers in the field appear in Nature and Science, as well as other top journals such as Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Chemistry, Nature Biotechnology, Angewandte Chemie, JACS, Physical Review Letters, Physical Review Letters, SIAM Journal on Computing ? and the authors of these papers regularly attend DNAx conferences to present their work in a preliminary form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;By funding travel to students we are actively encouraging and incentivizing a new generation of researchers to attend the conference. We are giving special priority to women and minority applicants whose papers or posters were accepted at the conference. Students who attend DNA17 will get exposure to early versions of work that will go on to be published in top venues and, furthermore, they will have the opportunity to interact with, and potentially collaborate with, researchers who are producing work of the highest quality.</AbstractNarration>
