    <AbstractNarration>The long-term goals of this project are to bring the technology of&lt;br/&gt;software contracts to widely-used programming languages and, through&lt;br/&gt;the use of manifest contracts, to provide software developers with a&lt;br/&gt;migration path from simply typed code to fully functional correctness.&lt;br/&gt;Since computational effects are notoriously hard to reason about and&lt;br/&gt;pervade even the simplest realistic programs, the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;should have significant impact on programmers' ability to develop&lt;br/&gt;software that is more reliable and more secure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contracts in software establish clear interfaces between program&lt;br/&gt;components. Like contracts in the legal realm, they delineate each&lt;br/&gt;party's expectations and obligations. Such contracts are becoming&lt;br/&gt;increasingly important for the regulation of modern software systems,&lt;br/&gt;providing an expressive framework for verification and error tracking.&lt;br/&gt;To be effective in a software environment, contracts must have formal&lt;br/&gt;semantics and must be supported by a monitoring system that precisely&lt;br/&gt;tracks the flow of values as they cross interfaces. To date, however,&lt;br/&gt;the formal study of contracts has mostly been limited to small&lt;br/&gt;idealized languages without computational effects, such as reading&lt;br/&gt;data from or writing data to a display or file, managing resources&lt;br/&gt;such as memory, and performing probabilistic or speculative&lt;br/&gt;computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to extend the semantic framework of software&lt;br/&gt;contracts to languages with various computational effects: the&lt;br/&gt;extension is qualitative in nature and will enable the use of&lt;br/&gt;contracts in new application domains. Specifically, the PIs propose&lt;br/&gt;to add support for computational effects to the two flavors of&lt;br/&gt;contracts studied to date: latent contracts, which are runtime checks&lt;br/&gt;not reflected in the type system, and manifest contracts, where a&lt;br/&gt;system of precise types records the most recent runtime check applied&lt;br/&gt;to each value. The extension of latent contracts will be done in the&lt;br/&gt;context of a monadic met language. The extension of manifest&lt;br/&gt;contracts will make use of a variant of Hoare Type Theory to precisely&lt;br/&gt;record computational effects. The PIs will also implement prototype&lt;br/&gt;systems and use them to present novel applications of software&lt;br/&gt;contracts.</AbstractNarration>
