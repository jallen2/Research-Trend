    <AbstractNarration>Understanding how quickly environmental reactions take place is the goal of EarthKin, a&lt;br/&gt;geochemical database focusing on the rates of geochemical reactions. EarthKin&lt;br/&gt;scientists from University of Maine, Penn State, Columbia, and Saint Francis University&lt;br/&gt;will compile existing reaction rates into a one-stop database that will allow access to&lt;br/&gt;researchers working on a diverse range of projects ranging from removing carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently storing it beneath the ground to cleaning&lt;br/&gt;up contaminated environmental sites. When completed EarthKin will be available to&lt;br/&gt;scientists free via the web at www.earthchem.org. Not only will we compile existing&lt;br/&gt;data, but we will also encourage new researchers to become involved by uploading their&lt;br/&gt;new results into the database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in geoinformatics (the subdiscipline of developing technological&lt;br/&gt;and computation tools to facilitate information dissemination in the geosciences) have&lt;br/&gt;drastically increased access that researchers have to geological information. Many&lt;br/&gt;recent endeavors have focused on online publishing of large data sets in order to make&lt;br/&gt;data available to the wider community. EarthKin is especially interesting in that it is one&lt;br/&gt;of the first attempts to include experimental data in a web-based data management&lt;br/&gt;platform. To do this, we will need to build new tools and data structures that will allow&lt;br/&gt;the existing EarthChem platform to incorporate a new type of data.</AbstractNarration>
