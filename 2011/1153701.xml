    <AbstractNarration>Through this project, the college is providing structured support for a cohort of financially needy students who demonstrate academic potential for completing a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) associate degree program. Approximately 60 to 80 eligible students are being awarded scholarships of up to $5,000 per year to enroll in programs leading to employment in a STEM field or transfer to a STEM baccalaureate program. Targeted programs include biotechnology, chemical technology, computer science/information technology, drafting, electronics and electrical technology, engineering, geospatial technology, industrial automation, manufacturing technology, mathematics, mechanical technology, nanofabrication technology, and natural science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to financial assistance, the project is providing activities to encourage retention through program completion that include (a) a mentoring program that gives scholarship recipients an opportunity to interact with professionals in STEM fields, (b) a series of lectures and discussion panels with STEM professionals, (c) workshops on academic and career topics, (d) field trips to industries and four-year colleges and universities, (e) intensive faculty advising, (f) a newly formed student organization (STEM Club), and (g) informal study groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project objectives are to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Increase the financial support available to address the unmet financial need of students enrolled in eligible associate degree STEM programs; &lt;br/&gt;(2) Retain at least 85% of S-STEM scholarship recipients from the spring semester to the fall semester of a two-year program; &lt;br/&gt;(3) Provide structured support for the S-STEM cohort so that at least 85% of the students will graduate with a STEM associate degree and/or transfer to a four-year institution; &lt;br/&gt;(4) Increase opportunities for S-STEM scholars to interact with, and receive mentoring from, STEM professionals; and &lt;br/&gt;(5) Create awareness of STEM career opportunities, particularly for students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: S-STEM scholars participate in project activities as a STEM learning community cohort, supported by the faculty members from the science, computer science and information technology, mathematics, and technology divisions. The activities bring together students from different STEM majors for interdisciplinary engagement, expanding their knowledge of the impact of other disciplines on their chosen field and creating awareness of career pathways open to them through advanced education. These students are being better prepared for the STEM workplace through interaction not only with faculty and other students but also with STEM professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The interdisciplinary learning experiences outside the classroom help form a foundation on which to build more extensive interdisciplinary connections within the curriculum. Relationships with the business community and four-year institutions are being strengthened, and the activities can be expanded for students outside the S-STEM project. Through dissemination of activities and results, this project is serving as a learning community model for other community colleges that offer a large selection of STEM programs for a diverse population and are attempting to bridge the various disciplines with interdisciplinary learning activities to better prepare students for continuing education and the workplace.</AbstractNarration>
