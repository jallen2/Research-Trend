    <AbstractNarration>This project is graduating bachelor-degreed science majors from rural backgrounds, or as first-generation college graduates, and is especially welcoming women participants who make up a large fraction of their student body. Viterbo University is awarding scholarships to two cohorts of 12 students each, to receive four years of support and is enrolling students who are pursuing degrees in biochemistry, chemistry, or mathematical physics. The CLASS (Community of Learners Achieving Science Success) scholars are students with a high school GPA of at least 3.3, an ACT score of 24 or above, and who have documented financial need. Using their experience in working with students underrepresented in the physical sciences, Viterbo is supporting the students academically so they overcome any deficiencies in preparation and is offering peer mentoring, undergraduate research opportunities, and social motivation to enhance the students' retention and success. Viterbo is enabling the CLASS scholars who elect to conduct undergraduate research to present or publish their findings in a peer-reviewed forum. The CLASS scholars are part of a Community of Learners that has interventions in college orientation and study skill development, as well as aggressive mathematics and science tutoring. The project is also offering job shadowing, introduction to diverse science careers, active peer mentoring, and opportunities for science-based service learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is extending findings from a prior S-STEM award and is being led by a well-qualified team experience in working with talented but under-prepared students. It continues to add to the knowledge base of how to enhance the opportunities for success in science education, particularly for first-generation students from rural backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is leading to increased participation of underrepresented students in the physical sciences. The project is on a clear trajectory to contribute to a more diversified pool of STEM graduate students or to a highly-qualified and diversified STEM workforce, both of which are addressing national needs.</AbstractNarration>
