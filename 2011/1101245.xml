    <AbstractNarration>This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Award focuses on the terrestrial and&lt;br/&gt;aquatic ecosystem services in New Hampshire and their interactions with short and long&lt;br/&gt;term changes in climate and land use. The project will investigate the&lt;br/&gt;interdependence of ecosystems, climate change, and impacts on society. The work is&lt;br/&gt;scientifically significant and regionally relevant as ecosystem services are central to the&lt;br/&gt;well-being of New Hampshire residents and to the region's economy. The project&lt;br/&gt;brings together research universities, 2- and 4-year colleges, small businesses, local&lt;br/&gt;government, and non-profit organizations to address key issues related to ecosystems&lt;br/&gt;research, education, and workforce development in the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This RII project will examine how climate variability and climate change affect and are&lt;br/&gt;affected by changes in land use, supply and demand balances of water resources, and&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of nutrients in New Hampshire's streams and rivers. The research program&lt;br/&gt;will build a statewide system of terrestrial and aquatic sensors as well as use aircraft&lt;br/&gt;remote sensing and satellite imagery. This infrastructure will provide information on&lt;br/&gt;forest structure, soil emission, water temperature, and nutrient levels with high spatial&lt;br/&gt;and temporal resolution than is currently possible. The new data will be used in&lt;br/&gt;climate, hydrological, and ecosystem models. The integration of observational and&lt;br/&gt;modeling work on forest and water ecosystems will lead the way to examine future&lt;br/&gt;scenarios of climate change and the potential impacts on ecosystem function. The&lt;br/&gt;project will survey public perceptions of climate change and land use and broadly&lt;br/&gt;disseminate the analyzed results to improve communication among the public, policy&lt;br/&gt;makers, and an interdisciplinary team of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project has a suite of activities that are well-integrated with research to promote&lt;br/&gt;education at all levels. The implementation of the research project will contribute to an&lt;br/&gt;improved understanding of the historical effects of climate, land use, and demographic&lt;br/&gt;changes. In addition, improved communication among researchers, policy makers, and&lt;br/&gt;the public is expected to enable informed decision-making by all stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;Workforce development initiatives under this project include incentives to transfer from&lt;br/&gt;2-year to 4-year schools, and summer institutes for K-12 teachers, 2-year college&lt;br/&gt;faculty, and 4-H volunteers to be trained in the use of terrestrial and aquatic sensors,&lt;br/&gt;data collection methods and participation in research. The project includes distance&lt;br/&gt;learning programs and plans for web-based dissemination of research results.</AbstractNarration>
