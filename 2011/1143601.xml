    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an increasingly interconnected world, study of the forces that shape state behavior and&lt;br/&gt;interactions is increasingly essential. Building on previous success of this program since 2004,&lt;br/&gt;the Democracy, Interdependence and World Politics Summer Research Program at Texas&lt;br/&gt;Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas will be held in the summers of 2012 and 2013. Within&lt;br/&gt;the overall project theme students devise and complete independent, mentored research&lt;br/&gt;projects on issues with significant academic and popular value. Each year, 7 students will work&lt;br/&gt;with faculty mentors to develop research projects, gather and analyze data and produce&lt;br/&gt;scholarly papers reporting their findings. Activities include research methods seminars, intensive&lt;br/&gt;project development workshops, presentations by guest scholars, community events, and&lt;br/&gt;research under the guidance of project mentors with established records of research and&lt;br/&gt;publication. Unlike most REU programs, the focus on international relations and independent,&lt;br/&gt;faculty-mentored student projects, and extensive research training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent geo-political events and the global spread of democracy make studying democracy?s&lt;br/&gt;consequences for world politics compelling. Key concerns include the ability of democracies to&lt;br/&gt;formulate and sustain successful foreign policies, the prospects and implications of&lt;br/&gt;democratization and democracy promotion, and the effect of democracy on violent conflict.&lt;br/&gt;Because this project promotes undergraduate research into these timely areas of study, it builds&lt;br/&gt;on growing areas of inquiry in world politics. High quality student research projects examine&lt;br/&gt;critical factors impacting state behavior and interactions, and are disseminated publicly through&lt;br/&gt;presentation at the annual International Studies Association meetings, with whom the program&lt;br/&gt;will partner to ensure dissemination and impact for the projects. Moreover, student participants&lt;br/&gt;are highly likely to go on to graduate study, for which they are substantially better prepared&lt;br/&gt;because of the intensive training of the summer program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique program expands national understanding of undergraduate education in Political&lt;br/&gt;Science, which has limited examples of undergraduate student-faculty collaborative research.&lt;br/&gt;Second, the program provides meaningful opportunities to students to engage in international&lt;br/&gt;studies research and contribute research projects to the discipline?s discourse. Third, consistent&lt;br/&gt;with NSF principles emphasizing the positive impact of mentored research on undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;education, the program develops and enhances research skills and prepares students for&lt;br/&gt;graduate study and other applications. Fourth, the program enables diverse students from&lt;br/&gt;different regions and institutions of the country to challenge and support each other in a cohort.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, by offering a competitive stipend, this project is accessible to students from middle and&lt;br/&gt;lower economic strata as a summer employment opportunity that enriches their education.</AbstractNarration>
