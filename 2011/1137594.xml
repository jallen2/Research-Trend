    <AbstractNarration>The 2-Pi-STEM (2-Pathways into STEM) Project is designed to create pathways to professional careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) through awareness activities, field experiences, teaching and learning through problem-based learning concept and the establishment of a college bridge program at Lawson State Community College (LSCC). The activities of the project will be supported by an enhanced STEM infrastructure at LSCC impacting the underrepresented populations in STEM careers especially in the Central Alabama region. The overarching goal of the 2-Pi-STEM Project is to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the STEM career paths focusing in the following goals: (1) Provide cross curricular mentoring and learning communities for STEM students to improve persistence and efficacy in STEM courses (2) Create a STEM pipeline by providing enrichment and academic enhancement programs for high school students (3) Implement a college bridge program for incoming freshman/sophomore and transfer students in concert with LSCC's Freshman Academy, a seminar class acclimating new students to college life. The project expects to increase preparation and success of a pool of African American students in Central Alabama in transitioning from high school, being retained in STEM at the community college, and transferring in STEM to a four-year college.</AbstractNarration>
