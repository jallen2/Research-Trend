    <AbstractNarration>During magnetic reconnection, the energy stored in magnetic fields is quickly tapped and converted into heat and kinetic energy, in a process analogous to a magnetic explosion. Reconnection is thought to power many astrophysical events including solar flares and Earth's auroras, as well as play an important role in laboratory fusion experiments. Although the basic workings of magnetic reconnection are well-understood, a long-standing puzzle has existed as to the precise process that provides the spark triggering the explosion. Advances in computer power have recently made it possible to model magnetic reconnection in three dimensions and allow this work to answer the question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By tapping the energy of magnetic fields, reconnection in the solar corona and solar wind drives space weather, the changing of environmental conditions in near-Earth space. Space weather, in turn, has profound influences on topics as diverse as passenger radiation exposure on polar flights, communications satellite lifetimes, and the stability of electrical power grids. Exploring the dynamics of reconnection and, in particular, understanding the processes that allow reconnection to occur thus has broad importance for society.</AbstractNarration>
