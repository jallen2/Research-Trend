    <AbstractNarration>The project creates, develops and implements a core curriculum required for an alternative energy technician program leading to an associate degree with transferable credits. In addition, the project prepares residents of Imperial Valley with the necessary technical education needed to enter the alternative energy job market. The entry level technicians acquire knowledge about various alternative energy operations that are used by local firms. In order to properly train alternative energy technicians, the project works directly with the local and regional energy providers to ensure that the curriculum provides students with skill sets that meets local occupational standards. Particular focus is placed on continuous improvement to ensure that the alternative energy technician program maintains a practical technological environment and meets best practices.</AbstractNarration>
