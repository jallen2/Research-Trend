    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The project is aimed at understanding phase transformations and the appearance of new phases of matter in condensed matter systems. Of particular interest to this project is the study of quantum criticality, a type of material behavior that indicates that a phase transformation is occurring at the absolute zero of temperature. The project also seeks to understand novel states of frustrated magnetic materials such as "spin liquids" and non-magnetic "hidden order" phases. The study of the effects of magnetic disordered in the behavior of newly synthesized metallic glasses is the third focal point of this project. The techniques used in the project to study these "strongly correlated" materials are mainly nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin rotation (muSR). Examples of materials that will be studied are: Yb3Pt4 (quantum criticality), Pr2Zr2O7 and Pr2Ir2O7 (frustrated magnetism), and bulk metallic glasses doped with Gd (disordered magnetic states). The project experiments will be carried out with the participation of CSULA students, both locally and at user facilities in Canada and the USA. A collaboration with CSULA Physics Department's University Preparatory Program (UPP) will be implemented to engage UPP students in summer research internships. Science field trips and general physics laboratory exercises for inner city high school students will be carried out in this collaboration to provide minority students with hands-on experiences. The project will facilitate the participation in research and science fairs of motivated students from neighboring Alhambra High School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The project is aimed at understanding phase transformations and the appearance of new phases of matter in novel solids and fluids. Interesting new states of matter derive from the collective behavior of strongly interacting atomic particles in the interior of a suitable material. The project studies the behavior of these materials at very low temperatures. The three main phenomena to study go by the names of "quantum criticality," "frustrated magnetism," and "magnetic disorder." The techniques used in the project to study these "strongly correlated" materials will be mainly nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon spin rotation (muSR). Understanding these phenomena is of fundamental importance for the development of new and improved materials for potential applications in the future. The project activities will be carried out with the participation of CSULA students, both locally and at user facilities in Canada and the USA. A collaboration with CSULA Physics Department's University Preparatory Program (UPP) will be implemented to engage UPP students in summer research internships. Science field trips for inner city high school students will be carried out in this collaboration to increase awareness of science and technology, while providing minority students with hands-on experiences. Motivated students from neighboring Alhambra High School will participate in research and the project will promote their involvement in science fairs at state and national levels.</AbstractNarration>
