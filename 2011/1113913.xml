    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop key components for a lowcost&lt;br/&gt;3D X-ray security checkpoint system based on Laminography, a method of taking multiple&lt;br/&gt;projections of an object and combining these to create three-dimensional (3D) slices of the object.&lt;br/&gt;Current checkpoint X-ray security systems have limitations because they provide only a transmission&lt;br/&gt;image of the object being screened, whereas a 3D image would provide much more relevant information.&lt;br/&gt;A reasonably priced Laminography system has not been implemented due to the unavailability of a&lt;br/&gt;reasonably-priced X-ray source with suitable performance.&lt;br/&gt;This proposed solution overcomes the limitations of current X-ray sources. By employing a dual-grid&lt;br/&gt;dual-cathode source, it is possible to produce a low-cost X-ray source that delivers the cost and&lt;br/&gt;performance required for a low-cost high performance 3D Laminography-based checkpoint system.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is based on the development of suitable X-ray&lt;br/&gt;component technology that can be used to upgrade the checkpoint security systems to 3D capabilities at&lt;br/&gt;reasonable prices. The impact is improved security at the checkpoints. The commercial potential comes&lt;br/&gt;from the potential to upgrade several thousand checkpoints with this capability.&lt;br/&gt;Although current aviation security checkpoints provide a strong line of defense, terrorists continue to&lt;br/&gt;analyze and exploit any weaknesses in these defenses. For this reason, it is critical to continually improve&lt;br/&gt;the security checkpoints and security screening equipment, in order to ensure that terrorists are not able to&lt;br/&gt;defeat these systems.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to improving the security at airport checkpoints, the new source can be used to upgrade any Xray&lt;br/&gt;based security system and to improve the performance of conventional Computed Tomography&lt;br/&gt;systems. The X-ray source will be unique and can be used in a broad range of fields that includes&lt;br/&gt;medical imaging, non-destructive testing, X-ray fluorescence, and so forth</AbstractNarration>
