    <AbstractNarration>Quantum computers hold the promise of transformative improvements to our ability to solve hard data processing problems by taking advantage of quantum mechanical phenomena including superposition states and entanglement. This project will continue experimental development of a quantum information processor based on qubits encoded in Rubidium atoms, and quantum logic gates that are mediated by interactions between highly excited atomic Rydberg states. The experimental approach uses laser cooled Rubidium atoms stored in optical traps. Ensemble qubits that use many atoms instead of one for storing quantum information have advantageous properties for transmitting quantum information. In this project ensemble qubits subject to Rydberg atom interactions will be studied and their use for single atom loading, fast quantum measurements, and efficient light-atom quantum interfaces will be demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work are twofold. First, this research will contribute to the development of a large scale quantum processor that exceeds the capabilities of conventional classical computers. The availability of such a device would have far reaching impact on numerical mathematics, information security, and problems in the simulation of quantum systems related to the development of new, technologically valuable materials. Second, the research program will contribute to the training of students and postdoctoral researchers for careers in science and engineering. People from diverse backgrounds will be educated and trained in modern experimental science, and will be equipped to bridge the boundary between physics and information science. Training will occur via curriculum enrichments, and through direct participation in the University based research program. We will also inform the local community about the importance of physics to information technology, and new developments in the area of quantum information science. Outreach to the public will be facilitated by public visiting days at the Physics department, laboratory tours, and faculty visits to local schools.</AbstractNarration>
