    <AbstractNarration>The project implements the Cisco Networking Academy specializing in virtualization and server consolidation. The project also develops a networking and information systems security workforce. The disciplinary focus is information technologies education and the project elevates the curriculum to meet current workforce needs and a transitioning local and global economy. The project is lead by Computer Information Technology (CIT) faculty. CIT is a two-year, associate's degree program preparing graduates for employment with organizations that use computers to process, manage, and communicate information. Implementation of the Academy and partnerships with K-12 schools for the first level Cisco courses and with regional community colleges for the second level Cisco course delivery are underway. Results are disseminated locally and regionally to enhance CIT program training strategies and aid economic development efforts with a trained workforce. The primary audience is two-year college students and secondary school students, while two-year college faculty complete professional development. The project initiates a new class of knowledge workers within the CIT field. CIT technicians, through this activity, understand securing, virtualizing, and consolidating networks while creating awareness for energy conservation measures. Underrepresented groups are encouraged to participate in the training program. Project evaluation is a measurement of learning outcomes and successful certifications in Cisco-related competencies.</AbstractNarration>
