    <AbstractNarration>Most contemporary analyses of group processes have been guided by social identity theory or self-categorization theory. Both of these theories have emphasized group identification as the measure of alignment with groups. Identification is doubtlessly an influential determinant of the tendency for group members to band together in derogating members of out-groups and applauding fellow in-group members. Nevertheless, identification reflects people's alignment with the category rather than with the individual members of the category. In contrast, identity fusion emphasizes familial sentiments toward the group connectedness and reciprocal strength sentiments that motivate fused persons to make profound sacrifices for individual "family" members. Recent research by Dr. William Swann and his collaborators has shown that when people become fused with a group, their personal and social identities theoretically combine synergistically to motivate pro-group behavior. The result is that identity fused persons are especially inclined to donate their personal funds to the group and take bold action on behalf of the group, including even endorsing fighting and dying for the group. The research supported with this award is designed to understand extreme devotion to a group ("hyper-fusion")and how it might be countered. In nine experimental laboratory studies, the researcher focuses on the antecedents of fusion, the circumstances when identity fusion may play a unique role and consider the possibility that hyper-fusion may sometimes compromise people's capacity to fulfill multiple roles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus on the antecedents of extreme behavior will enhance understanding of terrorism, which is obviously relevant to national security, international relations, and America's economic well-being. Moreover, both graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Texas (UT) will be involved in the conceptualization, design, and implementation of the research. Finally, women and minorities will be specifically recruited as assistants as a way of broadening the participation of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
