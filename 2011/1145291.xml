    <AbstractNarration>Because both information and connectivity are more available today than ever before thanks to digital technologies, questions can now be addressed by enlisting massive human demographics to supplement the limitations of computer computation. This is especially relevant in the case of visual analytics, where human intuition remains far superior to existing computer object recognition algorithms. While algorithms are limited by pre-labeling requirements, humans can perceive subtle variations and nuances to identify and classify unexpected objects. These tasks, however, are often too massive in scale for a single human to accomplish. Distributing this task over a massive network not only succeeds in categorizing data, but generates massive quantities of human quantifiers (training data) to potentially teach computer vision algorithms to mimic human perception in order to distinguish the normal from the abnormal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project will combine collective human visual perception with machine learning and object recognition, through a study of 1.25 million crowd-sourced inputs provided by over 6,000 volunteers labeling satellite imagery in a search for anomalies in northern Mongolia. These data, collected from June 2010 to the present via an online platform developed by the PI in collaboration with National Geographic Digital Media, afford an ideal "case study" environment to investigate the nature of crowd generated data and methods that distill the wide variability of human input into computational algorithms. The online participants, excited by the potential of discovering the tomb of Genghis Khan, examined massive amounts of ultra-high resolution multispectral satellite imagery to label loosely defined anomalies into various categories. Trends that emerged from the massive volume of labels represent a collective human perspective on what the images contain. A team led by the PI traveled to Mongolia to ground-truth areas of high user input convergence. The resulting ground-truthed anomalies provide a unique opportunity to both accurately measure the quality of human/automated analysis and to investigate the effect of supplementing noisy crowd-sourced data sets with small pools of absolute data in machine learning. In the current project the PI will develop a framework for applying and evaluating the following three research phases designed to study the nature of large scale human generated data for integration into supervised learning algorithms:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Consensus Clustering - Tag evaluation mechanisms based upon the volume and consistency of neighboring tags and the ability of the individuals creating those tags. Unsupervised methods for "merging" labels will also be applied for extended anomalies such as roads and rivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Feature Vector Extraction - Both the type of features (e.g., color, luminance, edges and gradients, scale, orientation, etc.) and the extent of the neighborhoods (e.g., local, wide and global) required to detect anomalies are unknown a priori. Thus, the aim is to determine sufficiently diverse features to capture all relevant cues within the image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Machine Learning - Dominant features representative of, and excluded from, pixel groups of given categories will be determined from the results of Phase 2 above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In this exploratory study the PI will lay the foundation for extracting new machine/human collaborative opportunities from the resource of the crowd. Understanding the bonds between human and computer intelligence will have a profound impact on many branches of science. Thus, concepts developed in this effort may ultimately prove transformative by affording migration of crowd-sourcing from a project-based tool for distributed analytics into a portal bridging collective human perception and machine learning.</AbstractNarration>
