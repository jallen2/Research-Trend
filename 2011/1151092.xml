    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, supports the proposed research and educational plans of Professor Timothy B. Clark of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of San Diego. The project aims to develop substrate-directed C-H borylation reactions, which result in selective formation of carbon-boron bonds. The proposed research plan focuses on the design and development of catalysts that selectively functionalize C-H bonds into C-B bonds. Ultimately, the catalysts will be modified to be used in the C-H borylation of non-aromatic substrates, providing valuable intermediates in organic synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The carbon-boron bond is versatile and can be used to access a number of functional groups that are common in biologically relevant compounds such as pharmaceuticals. This work will simplify access to a variety of derivatives and could be used to facilitate the discovery of new materials for diabetes testing. The bulk of the research performed will be carried out by undergraduate students, providing valuable experiences for students interested in pursuing careers in the area of catalysis or related fields. The proposed educational activity aims to introduce high school students to applications and careers in chemistry through providing an authentic research experience for high school teachers and subsequently engaging their students in various activities such as visiting USD Science building and field trip to local chemical R&amp;D facility. The involvement of high school teachers in an authentic research experience will also allow them to incorporate research concepts into their curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
