    <AbstractNarration>Support for student travel to 55th International Conference on Electron Ion&lt;br/&gt;and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication, Proposal 1137067&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, funded at $10,000, will help support the travel of 20 graduate students, from&lt;br/&gt;universities around the USA, to attend the 55 th International Conference on Electron, Ion&lt;br/&gt;and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication, 2011, to be held at the J. W. Marriott&lt;br/&gt;Resort, Las Vegas, Nevada, May 31 to June 3, 2011. In the fields of nanofabrication,&lt;br/&gt;electron and ion-beam lithographies, photon and imprint lithographies, particle-beam&lt;br/&gt;optics, and forefront applications of nanofabrication, this conference is preeminent. The&lt;br/&gt;requested travel aid will enable students to present their research to a high level&lt;br/&gt;international scientific community. They will observe how scientists and engineers&lt;br/&gt;exchange innovative ideas and other information at conferences, and they?ll hear firsthand&lt;br/&gt;presentations of up-to-date research results in nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning how a technical conference serves as a venue for conveying information to&lt;br/&gt;other is an important element of a student?s education. Also important is leaning how to&lt;br/&gt;present, in a cogent and understandable way, the results of one?s research. The requested&lt;br/&gt;support will help to accomplish these ends. At the conference, students will make&lt;br/&gt;important personal contacts and learn of employment opportunities. At a special breakfast&lt;br/&gt;for the funded students, the conference organizers will discuss optimal techniques for&lt;br/&gt;presenting scientific information and how the conference program is put together.</AbstractNarration>
