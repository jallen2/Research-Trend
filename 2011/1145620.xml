    <AbstractNarration>This proposal supports U.S.-based participants attending the "Young Geometric Group Theory" meeting to be held at the Banach Center in Bedlewo, Poland from January 9-13, 2012. There will be four senior speakers giving mini-courses on fundamental topics, as well as seven outstanding postdocs giving short talks on their work. The planned talks cover basic examples in geometric group theory such as Artin groups, CAT(0) groups, limit groups, and lattices in Lie groups; the mini-courses make connections with other fields of mathematics including representation theory, projective geometry, geometric measure theory, and logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is a fairly young and dynamic field studied by an international community of researchers. Most of the workshop attendees will be early-career mathematicians; the schedule is designed to maximize the interactions among young researchers, as well as to give them extended contact with leading experts in the field.
