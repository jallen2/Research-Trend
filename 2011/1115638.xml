    <AbstractNarration>Continuous optimization is a mathematical discipline with extensive&lt;br/&gt;applications in engineering design and business/logistical planning.&lt;br/&gt;Its currently most common solution techniques are difficult to adapt&lt;br/&gt;to newly evolving computer architectures comprising dozens to&lt;br/&gt;thousands of processing elements working in parallel. Combining&lt;br/&gt;several existing techniques with some recent results of the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator, this project explores a means of solving continuous&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems that should adapt more readily to parallel&lt;br/&gt;computer architectures than present standard solvers, allowing the&lt;br/&gt;architectures' full power to be brought to bear on large,&lt;br/&gt;time-consuming problems. Without such new solution approaches,&lt;br/&gt;solution of critical design and planning problems may not benefit from&lt;br/&gt;most of the advances in computing power anticipated for the next&lt;br/&gt;decade. The project will also involve cooperative work with the&lt;br/&gt;Brazilian research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical approach is to capitalize on recent advances in&lt;br/&gt;augmented Lagrangian and conjugate gradient algorithms to produce a&lt;br/&gt;new kind of modular parallel continuous constrained optimization&lt;br/&gt;solver. The solver consists of a classical augmented Lagrangian outer&lt;br/&gt;loop, with subproblems solved by the a state-of-the art&lt;br/&gt;box-constrained conjugate gradient method terminated by a recently&lt;br/&gt;developed relative error criterion. The research consists of three&lt;br/&gt;stages: the goal of stage one is to create an object-oriented, modular&lt;br/&gt;serial implementation, test it extensively, and address some&lt;br/&gt;theoretical issues. Stage two aims to evolve the stage-one substrate&lt;br/&gt;into a parallel solver for which the user explicitly specifies how to&lt;br/&gt;map the problem structure to multiple processing elements. Stage&lt;br/&gt;three's goal is to automate the structure detection and mapping&lt;br/&gt;process. Stages two and three will use stochastic programming&lt;br/&gt;problems as test cases.</AbstractNarration>
