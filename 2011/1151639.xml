    <AbstractNarration>1151639 (Pinto). This is an award primarily for participant support for the Fourth Annual Conference on Next Generation Infrastructures (NGInfra): Challenges and Research for the 21st Century. This conference is scheduled for November 16-18, 2011 in Hampton Roads, VA. The overall goal is to increase US participation in next generation infrastructure research and education, and to strengthen the nation?s position in the field, given the great importance of this vitally critical and developing topical area. The effectiveness and efficiency in addressing next generation critical infrastructure issues will be a primary challenge of this century. Pressured by increasing complexity, scarce resources, and emerging threats, the future of critical infrastructure development will continue to be a source of societal emphasis. The objectives of this conference are (1) to identify existing and future infrastructure challenges that must be addressed for societies to more fully realize their potential, (2) to provide a forum for highlighting advances in research and practice to address current and future infrastructure challenges, (3) to expose young or new researchers (especially underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities) to the state of the art in the field, and (4) to actively encourage students, especially under-represented minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and those in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), to pursue careers in engineering and applied sciences, and participate in the frontier of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
