    <AbstractNarration>The World Congress on Risk III is an international conference gathering risk analysts and practitioners from around the world in Sydney Australia from 18-20 July 2012. This is the third in a series of World Congresses that are systematic, important steps toward development of the field of risk analysis, related applications and a worldwide network of researchers, community stakeholders, and decision makers. The theme for the 2012 World Congress is "Risk and Development in a Changing World". Specific objectives of the 2012 Congress are to (1) stimulate dialogue and learning on risk issues of worldwide interest, (2) share insights about analytic methods and decision processes used in different regions of the world, (3) demonstrate and disseminate advances in risk assessment and management, and (4) build bridges between professional organizations and individuals worldwide to facilitate education and to transfer science-based risk management practices across key user networks. NSF support is for helping junior scholars from the United States and scholars from developing countries attend the Congress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Risk assessment and management is a field of research that provides science-based concepts, tools, and processes (derived from both research and practice) that decision makers, researchers, and community stakeholders can use in public and private decision making about risk. The use of sound risk analysis methods is crucial for intelligent choices about human health and livelihood, environmental systems, prosperity, sustainability, and survival. Developing countries face urgent challenges and are particularly in need of stronger capacity to employ good risk analysis methods. The theme for the third conference focuses attention on risks of importance to developing countries, in such domains as agriculture, food safety, technology, water pollution and supply, air pollution, energy and climate change, and disaster risk reduction.</AbstractNarration>
