    <AbstractNarration>Geometric retrieval is the problem of preprocessing multi-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;geometric data for rapid access. Efficient geometric search and&lt;br/&gt;retrieval are of fundamental importance in engineering and science, and&lt;br/&gt;have numerous applications in areas as diverse as knowledge discovery&lt;br/&gt;and data mining, pattern recognition and classification, machine&lt;br/&gt;learning, data compression, multimedia databases, document retrieval,&lt;br/&gt;and statistics. Given the high complexity of exact solutions to these&lt;br/&gt;problems, researchers have been led to consider these problems in the context&lt;br/&gt;of approximation, where small errors in distance are tolerated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over recent years, there have been many advances in our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the computational complexity of approximation algorithms for proximity&lt;br/&gt;searching. This has ranged from the development of a theory of the best&lt;br/&gt;space-time tradeoffs achievable for these problems to practical software&lt;br/&gt;systems. Nonetheless, there are still many important, challenging&lt;br/&gt;problems that remain. Research under this award will both deepen and broaden&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of the computational complexity of approximate&lt;br/&gt;proximity searching. In particular, PI will study new data&lt;br/&gt;structures for polytope membership queries, polytope-based approaches to&lt;br/&gt;approximate nearest neighbor searching, simplification and unification&lt;br/&gt;of proximity data structures, dynamic data structures for proximity&lt;br/&gt;searching, and software implementations of these algorithms and data&lt;br/&gt;structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the contributions of new algorithms and data structures,&lt;br/&gt;software systems and libraries will be developed as part of this&lt;br/&gt;research, which will be made freely available over the Web to help&lt;br/&gt;scientists and engineers in other disciplines solve their own&lt;br/&gt;application problems that involve nearest neighbor and range searching.&lt;br/&gt;The geometric retrieval algorithms, developed as a part of this&lt;br/&gt;research, will be incorporated into a graduate-level course in&lt;br/&gt;computational geometry. Course materials will be made available over the&lt;br/&gt;Web as a resource for researchers interested in learning about this&lt;br/&gt;area.</AbstractNarration>
