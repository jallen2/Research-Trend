    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER project proposes an initiative to review existing methods and to create a design framework for the development of new and innovative approaches for evaluation of teacher education programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The George Washington University School of Education and Human Development and the National Academy of Education will lead the effort and the project will result in the following products: (1) a synthesis of existing research and experiential approaches in evaluating teacher education program quality and effectiveness; (2) an exploration of new and innovative approaches to evaluation in teacher education; and (3) a roadmap of issues and recommendations for new approaches. Issues in teacher education are politically at the forefront of the education policy agenda at the present time and an EAGER is an appropriate vehicle for exploring alternatives to current evaluation practices. Specific products will include commissioned papers, a synthesis report, policy briefs and other materials for dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teacher education is at a crossroads with calls for increasing accountability and efforts to guage teachers' performance to student outcomes and to the institutions/programs where they were prepared. The synthesis and roadmap provided by this project will link traditional preparation programs with alternatives of various kinds and shed light on new ways to evaluate all different kinds of programs.</AbstractNarration>
