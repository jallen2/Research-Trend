    <AbstractNarration>In this SFS Capacity Building project, the Center for Information and Systems Assurance (CISA) at Kansas State University, which is a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research (CAE-R), is collaborating with the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC) and Manhattan Area Technical College (MATC) to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity/information assurance curriculum appropriate for the different student bodies at the three institutions. Kansas State University is a public land-grant university with a high level of research activity. CGSC's mission is to educate military officers to support the Army's operational requirements. MATC is a two-year public institution of higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four courses constitute the overall curriculum being developed: Introduction to Information Assurance and Cybersecurity, Emerging Threats in Cyberspace, Advanced Cyber-Offense and -Defense Technologies, and Cyber-Warfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected outcomes of the project are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* a comprehensive cybersecurity curriculum that addresses the challenge of educating and providing hands-on training to students of broad academic backgrounds;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* courses with innovative modules and lesson plans based on lab exercises, warfare, and cyber-threat scenarios that can seamlessly integrate security education content throughout different parts of existing information technology curricula;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* detailed instructional manuals to accompany each course module; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* enhancement of faculty expertise in cybersecurity at the partnering institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Course materials are being created, piloted, and evaluated at the three institutions, and are being made available to a wider audience via the Web. The investigators are also using connections with other regional colleges and leveraging other initiatives at Kansas State -- e.g., Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), GK-12 STEM Fellows, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), and Girls Researching Our World (GROW) -- to extend the reach of the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
