    <AbstractNarration>This project aims at a systematic approach that integrates multi-level IC design automation &lt;br/&gt;flow by leveraging the parallel computational power in current and upcoming multi-core/many-core &lt;br/&gt;processors. The main challenge in this approach is to provide responsive high-level design decisions &lt;br/&gt;while incurring the massive computational cost of lower-level design algorithms. Fortunately, recent &lt;br/&gt;trends in processor architectures provide a solution. Compared with traditional uniprocessor systems, &lt;br/&gt;emerging multi-core/many-core microprocessors have far more computational power but limited global &lt;br/&gt;memory access capabilities. Parallel computational power may make it possible to break &lt;br/&gt;the boundaries of the existing IC design hierarchy and to vertically integrate the IC optimization fow. &lt;br/&gt;The potential benefits of an integrated solution are significant - accurate high-level design decisions &lt;br/&gt;become possible as low-level design details are derived concurrently, and low-level designs can also &lt;br/&gt;greatly benefit from high-quality high-level decisions. Together, an efficient and high-quality design flow &lt;br/&gt;becomes feasible, making design closure faster, thus saving time and reducing costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work has the potential to overcome the key limitations of existing hierarchical IC CAD &lt;br/&gt;technologies and enable new IC design automation solutions, which in turn can benefit the IC and &lt;br/&gt;semiconductor industry. The PIs will work together with their industrial collaborators to develop and &lt;br/&gt;commercialize the proposed work. The project will have beneficial impact on education. &lt;br/&gt;The PIs intend to educate the next generation of software developers and practicing engineers &lt;br/&gt;in the design and innovation of IC design automation and parallel computing.</AbstractNarration>
