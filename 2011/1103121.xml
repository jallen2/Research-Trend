    <AbstractNarration>This workshop highlights recent developments and future directions in the field of nonlinear dynamics, with an emphasis on fluid processes. This is an interdisciplinary field that not only addresses significant issues of fundamental scientific importance, but also involves numerous applications to many technical problems facing society today. The workshop will bring together people with wide interests in nonlinear dynamics in a small, intimate setting that is conducive to one-on-one and small-group interactions. A major emphasis is to provide young investigators (undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows) with an opportunity to learn about the range of studies being done by leading experts in the field. Another reason for this workshop is to highlight the value of research at undergraduate institutions and research experiences for undergraduates. In fact, a few of the invited speakers are currently at predominately-undergraduate institutions, and several speakers at research institutions also work frequently with undergraduates. The NSF grant will provide stipends to help cover the expenses for students and postdocs who are attending the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
