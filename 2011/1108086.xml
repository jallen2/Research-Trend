    <AbstractNarration>GeoPATH is a collaboration between the Yale Peabody Museum's after school program EVOLUTIONS and Yale geoscience faculty together with the New Haven Public Schools, the LSAMP program at the University of Connecticut, the Department of Earth Sciences at Southern Connecticut State University, and the Department of Biology &amp; Environmental Science at the University of New Haven. The program has two major goals: (a) To promote interest in and knowledge of the geosciences, science more generally, and related careers; and (b) To create experiences that facilitate students' understanding of the importance of college preparation and their eventual transition to the college environment. GeoPATH provides career and college-focused opportunities in the geosciences for 50 New Haven high school students from traditionally underrepresented communities. Students spend approximately 90 hours over the course of an academic year at the Peabody Museum. The program provides students with exposure to the world of geoscience research, internships, the experience of developing a Museum exhibition that will be seen by thousands of visitors, field trips, opportunities for paid work interpreting geoscience exhibits, and mentoring by successful college students. Students receive academic credit for their participation. Detailed program evaluation include longitutional student tracking. GeoPATH robustly supports several objectives of the NSF GEO Education and Diversity Strategic Plan 2010 -- 2015. Anticipated outcomes for the students include increased understanding of and interest in the geosciences and geoscience careers, improved knowledge to facilitate college preparation, career awareness, and the development of transferable skills.</AbstractNarration>
