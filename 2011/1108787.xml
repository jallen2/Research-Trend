    <AbstractNarration>1108787&lt;br/&gt;Rizkalla&lt;br/&gt;The project is to support a US-Egypt workshop on research in recent technologies of electric and hybrid electric (HEV) vehicles. The US PI is Dr. Maher Rizkalla, Purdue School of Engineering and Technology, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). The foreign collaborator is Dr. Yasser Dessouky, Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport. The workshop will bring together researchers from USA and Egypt with a goal to develop collaborative projects in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). The expected outcomes of this workshop will include recommendations for future collaboration in HEV research between the two campuses (IUPUI and the Engineering Academy in Egypt).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The workshop will present cutting edge research in hybrid vehicle technology, nanotechnology, sensors, modeling, and power electronics. The agenda includes panel discussion to develop plans for scientific collaborations in this field between the two countries. The research to be discussed will include electric hybrid vehicles and renewable energy programs. Four speakers from USA (2 from IUPUI and 2 from University of Wisconsin at Madison) and 10 speakers from Egyptian Academy will participate in the workshop. The theme ?Future Vehicle Technologies? covers important issues such as modeling and simulation, challenging research issues and solving approaches, dynamic systems, stability analysis, and device employment for vehicle safety. Such topics will benefit electrical engineering and mechanical engineering faculty members and graduate students in these disciplines from both sides. The exchange of knowledge between the two campuses will have significant impact on the HEV research in Egypt as well as in USA. The integration of knowledge within these&lt;br/&gt;disciplines may lead to better understanding to the challenging issues within the HEV system. Utilization of smart sensors will enhance the reliability and safety of these vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The workshop will reinforce the education of students, and will also encourage collaboration among faculty members. The workshop provides important opportunity to encourage research in hybrid electric vehicle technology.</AbstractNarration>
