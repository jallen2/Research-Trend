    <AbstractNarration>For three decades it has been anticipated that earthquake ruptures along an interface separating&lt;br/&gt;materials with different elastic properties will have a favored propagation direction, that being the&lt;br/&gt;direction of motion of the more compliant material. However, observing this tendency on natural&lt;br/&gt;faults has been difficult, in large part because of the small number of significant earthquakes on&lt;br/&gt;faults with a well-characterized velocity contrast. The PI has used spectral ratios to directly estimate&lt;br/&gt;directivity in a catalog of over 3,000 small earthquakes along a 30-km section of the San Andreas&lt;br/&gt;fault with a large and well-characterized velocity contrast. The spectral ratios were fitted with a&lt;br/&gt;simple moving point source model in which each modeled earthquake has four parameters: two&lt;br/&gt;rupture lengths (one to the SE and one to the NW) and their propagation velocities. Nearly 900&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes, mostly those larger than 70 m, appear reasonably well resolved. The inversion results&lt;br/&gt;suggest that 40% of the well-resolved events are roughly bilateral, although more than 80%&lt;br/&gt;of the 144 events classified as strongly unilateral rupture to the SE, consistent with the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;prediction. For those rupture halves that were large enough for the propagation speed to be&lt;br/&gt;somewhat resolved, that speed was greater by roughly 10% for those halves propagating to the SE,&lt;br/&gt;qualitatively consistent with numerical and laboratory experiments. They find that events with&lt;br/&gt;nearby (in space and time) foreshocks tend to rupture away from those foreshocks, whether to the&lt;br/&gt;NW or to the SE, indicating that asymmetry of prior stressing history can exert a stronger influence&lt;br/&gt;on rupture directivity than the material contrast.&lt;br/&gt;A major goal of the proposed work is to greatly increase the size of their database in both&lt;br/&gt;space and time. This will allow them to explore how the correlation between foreshock&lt;br/&gt;location and mainshock directivity decays with increasing spatial and temporal distance between&lt;br/&gt;foreshock and mainshock, whether the apparent lack of correlation between mainshock directivity&lt;br/&gt;and aftershock asymmetry we have observed stands up to a larger data sample, and how these&lt;br/&gt;behaviors correlate with the local across-fault velocity contrast. The investigators will also undertake a systematic search for asymmetry in the location of sub-events in compound earthquakes, and begin&lt;br/&gt;numerical modeling of earthquake nucleation on a bimaterial interface, with the specific goals of&lt;br/&gt;understanding the aforementioned decay of the influence of foreshocks on mainshock directivity,&lt;br/&gt;and the influence of the bimaterial contrast on earthquake nucleation generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large faults that are capable of producing damaging earthquakes have also slipped large distances,&lt;br/&gt;and so they often juxtaposes rocks with different mechanical properties. It has long been&lt;br/&gt;predicted that earthquakes on such faults could have a preferred propagation direction. Establishing&lt;br/&gt;whether this is actually the case is relevant to hazards mitigation because there is much stronger&lt;br/&gt;ground shaking in the direction that the rupture propagates; it has even been proposed that building&lt;br/&gt;codes could be altered to reflect this. This gives the earthquakes we are examining an importance&lt;br/&gt;which surpasses their small size. Their usefulness lies in their large number, so that the results&lt;br/&gt;are statistically meaningful, and in their ability to teach us about connecting numerical models of&lt;br/&gt;earthquake rupture to real earthquakes generally.</AbstractNarration>
