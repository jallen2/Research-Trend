    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This collaborative research project at CUNY Queens College and University of Michigan aims to develop a new class of nonlinear optical materials that combine the advantages of organic, inorganic and metallic systems. Composite structures comprising hybridized excitons that have the desirable nonlinear optical properties of large oscillator strength (organic like), low saturation power (inorganic like), and quasiparticles (exciton-plasmon polaritons) that form through the strong interaction between inorganic excitons and plasmons of metal nanoparticles are investigated. The research project is expected to realize these hybridized materials systems through (i) dipole-dipole interaction of the Frenkel and Wannier-Mott excitons at the organic-inorganic interface and (ii) strong coupling between inorganic excitons and plasmons of metal nanoparticles using layered nanocomposite geometry. Nonlinear optical properties and morphology of the materials are investigated using a variety of spectroscopic and structural characterization techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. A successful outcome of this research project will make substantial contributions to the field of nonlinear optics by exploring a new class of engineered nonlinear optical materials. Besides potential applications such as efficient all-optical switching elements, imaging, spectroscopy and second harmonic generation, these materials can potentially contribute to the interdisciplinary field of quantum informatics. The collaborative project also trains, creates research opportunities, and helps instill interest in science and engineering for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities.</AbstractNarration>
