    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Workshop on Applications of Nanotechnology in the Water Sector: Emerging Opportunities and Challenges for Water Treatment and Reuse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Pedro Alvarez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rice University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: CBET-1100755&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IWA Specialist group on "Nano and Water" will host a 3-day international workshop on ?Applications of Nanotechnology in the Water Sector?, to contribute towards sustainable water management and global water security. This workshop will be partially sponsored by the Swiss host institutions ETH and EAWAG. The workshop will address issues of research &amp; education arising from the interface of nanotechnology and water engineering in a meaningful and focused dialogue, and provide valuable mentorship and international networking opportunities to emerging leaders and young researchers in this rapidly growing field through an integrated experience. The funding requested from NSF would be used to subsidize travel by US researchers especially junior faculty and postdocs, who would greatly benefit from this unique opportunity to share knowledge and technologies in this emerging field and identify research priorities. Topics to discuss include: (1) Nanosorbents; (2) Nanocatalysts, bio and redox -active NP; (3) Dendritic polymers / Biopolymers; (4) Multifunctional membranes (including nanostructured membranes); (5) Sensors / Monitoring systems; and (6) Safety Issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will result from the active engagement of the workshop?s participants. This engagement will undoubtedly enhance and strengthen the opportunities for and interest in international, interdisciplinary as well as academic-industrial collaboration on environmental applications of nanomaterials. In addition, the workshop will provide a solid foundation for the academic community?s future: (a) involvement in supporting and furthering CBET?s vision, mission, and goals; and (b) collaboration in research and education programs, projects, and activities at greater and closer levels. Thus, this workshop will not only help participants to craft better proposals and compete more effectively, but it will also contribute to the overall development of young faculty members.</AbstractNarration>
