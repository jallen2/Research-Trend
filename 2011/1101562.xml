    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support to defray expenses of participants to attend a conference on analysis and its applications during May 16-20, 2011 at Princeton University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This major conference will include lectures by world leaders in Harmonic Analysis, Several Complex Variables, Partial Differential Equations, and Geometric Analysis. The conference will also emphasize the interaction of Analysis with Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Theoretical Computer Science. All of these areas were significantly impacted by the research and teaching of Elias Stein, and the conference is being organized in honor of his influence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will allow participants, as well as others in the mathematical community, to learn about recent progress on a broad range of subjects in Analysis. The organizers will invite graduate students, young postdocs, women and minority researchers to participate actively in the conference. In addition to the plenary lectures, the conference will include a panel discussion on teaching Mathematics, collaboration in Mathematics, and the writing of Mathematics books.</AbstractNarration>
