    <AbstractNarration>(99) The Center for Sustainability Science and Engineering Education (SSEE), which is a consortium of universities comprised of Carnegie Mellon, University of Texas at Austin, and Arizona State University, is: (1) conducting workshops for engineering faculty across the U.S. that are disseminating SSEE materials and enhancing the educational process in this discipline; (2) developing a web site of peer-reviewed educational material on this topic that can grow over time as more materials are developed world-wide; and (3) assessing the educational materials, workshops, and use of the web site to enable continual improvement. All branches of engineering are both contributing educational materials and using the materials in courses. Furthermore, a variety of schools, such as research universities, community colleges, teaching institutions, and schools with individuals of diverse backgrounds are benefiting from the infrastructure developed in this project.</AbstractNarration>
