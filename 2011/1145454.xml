    <AbstractNarration>This workshop evaluates the possible opportunities for new and innovative social scientific research presented by the increasing interplay between social science scholars and law school faculty. Law schools have hired an increasing number of PhDs in the social sciences; law professors are increasingly more interested in empirical social science research methods; and there has been a strengthening of research and educational ties between law schools and other academic departments and units. The workshop evaluates these trends and considers ways in which this interplay may be organizationally and programmatically consolidated in order to ensure continuation of high quality research by socio-legal scholars in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will lay the foundations for enhanced collaboration among law and social science programs and centers/institutes with respect to research projects, as well as graduate training and mentoring.</AbstractNarration>
