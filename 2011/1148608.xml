    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to explore the value of professional education at the graduate level in mathematics by examining a new trend that responds to workforce needs by preparing students with substantial knowledge of mathematics as well as a broad set of professional skills to respond to the needs of employers. These rapidly growing new programs called Science Masters or Professional Science Masters programs provide a new paradigm in the field of mathematics and warrant closer examination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will involve a variety of participants: program directors, faculty, and students from current and developing programs, and industry and government employers. Representatives from professional societies and the Professional Science Masters Association are also involved in the development of the workshop. The workshop will explore in a methodical way the career opportunities created by the programs for mathematicians and statisticians, how these programs respond to local and regional workforce needs, and the current and future impact they will have on higher education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcome data from recent graduates and descriptions of ongoing projects will help shape the discussions about the efficacy of these programs, future directions, and possible further evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
