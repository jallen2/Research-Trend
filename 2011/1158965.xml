    <AbstractNarration>PI: Antal, Michael J.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Hawaii&lt;br/&gt;CBET-1158965&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER proposal deals with biomass carbonization, the characteristics of the biocarbons produced, and the combustion of bicarbons in small scale combustors. This effort is a collaboration between Prof. Antal at University Of Hawaii (UH) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NUST). At UH, the biomass will be converted to bicarbon at different pressures and temperatures, and will be characterized at NUST using SEM, TGA and XRD (common tools for material and structure analysis). Using bench top combustor at NUST the combustion of bicarbon and it's characteristics will be examined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UH students will gain an unique experience with their time split between UH and NUST, working in two different countries and two different group of advisors. Their research experiences in the two countries will be unique and complementary, with production of the bicarbon at UH and characterization and combustion of the bicarbon at NUST. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research stems from the fact that the structure, properties and burning behavior of bicarbon as a function of its initial processing parameters such as pressure and temperature are poorly understood. The proposed study will undertake a systematic study of the dependence of characteristics and combustion of bicarbon as a function of the pressure and temperature used to produce the bicarbon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bicarbons or charcoal can be used as an environmentally benign substitute for coal as a reducing agent in the manufacture of silicon and ferro-silicon. They can also be used instead of coal for power generation, space heating and combined heat and power applications without the deleterious emissions characteristics of pulverized coal plants. Potential benefit to enhance agricultural plant growth is also cited. Since bicarbon is produced from biomass they can be considered to be carbon neutral. Thus, success and understanding of bicarbons can have significant benefits from sustainability and environmental viewpoints.</AbstractNarration>
