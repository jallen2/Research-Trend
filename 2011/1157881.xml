    <AbstractNarration>A proposal is made to enable the I-Corps team to properly test the value proposition of using high power laser processing to create superhydrophobic surfaces for anti-icing and also for anti-reflection coatings. This superhydrophobic material, initially named "TexCone" for textured cones, has been created through NSF I/UCRC Center supported research. The micro/nano surface textures on metals and semiconductor surfaces have also been replicated on low cost polymeric surfaces and these also show superhydrophobic characteristics as well as anti-reflection properties which would be of significant value to the solar power industry due to enhanced light trapping. Under this program, the team will develop a process to replicate samples of at least 5 cm x 5 cm for evaluation by industrial members and in doing so will establish the price point for mass -production of TexCone. Also, initial durability data under realistic environmental conditions will be generated, allowing the proper evaluation of commercial potential. A business plan specific to laser etching and micro-textured replicated coatings based on scientific data and market analysis will be developed under the I-Corps workshop which defines sales channels, partners for testing and investment as well as a budget for defining resource requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of the technology is significant as anti-icing technology would create value for commercial and military airplanes, blades for wind energy generation, large refrigeration systems used in biomedical applications and many other industries. In the US aviation industry alone, it has been estimated that over 25 mn gallons of anti-icing chemicals are used annually at a purchase cost of $8 - $12 which does not include environmental impact. Success with anti-icing applications would encourage investment and innovation in laser textured materials and its replicated microstructures such as TexCone. The project will also enable the team to introduce the potential benefits of TexCone to many industrial companies. The technology will also promote significant enhancements in the competitiveness of solar power. There are potentially many other industrial areas that will benefit from a formalized review and investigation of complex laser etchings. The NSF I-Corps workshop will provide a structured approach for the team to investigate the vast potential of microscopic TexCones.</AbstractNarration>
