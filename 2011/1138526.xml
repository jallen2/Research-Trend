    <AbstractNarration>The University of Colorado proposes Computational Thinking for Teaching Computing (CT4TC) to develop a Computational Thinking (CT) empowered 21st century workforce by extending and validating the the research base of an iDREAMS strategy project. The iDREAMS project developed the Scalable Game Design curriculum that has been embedded in existing courses and used to introduce students to computational thinking through game and STEM simulation design. CT4TC will explore the influence of mediation as a pedagogical and scaffolding approach employed by teachers to implement Scalable Game Design curriculum, and assess subsequent impact on student motivation, performance and ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will have two expected outcomes. First, CT4TC will verify a theory of broadening participation in computing. The project staff will explore the influence of mediation as pedagogical and scaffolding approaches employed by teachers as they implement Scalable Game Design curricula, and assess subsequent impact on student motivation, performance and ownership. Gender and ethnicity-specific effects of scaffolding approaches employed by teachers will be systematically researched and validated. Second, CT4TC will deliver CT education with measurable learning outcomes. Measurable learning outcomes are essential to an iterative design approach based on providing feedback to professional development models. The Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis, developed by the iDREAMS project, employs a unique Latent Semantic Analysis inspired mechanism of computationally analyzing games and STEM simulations submitted by students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will bring CT education to K-12 students in tech hub, urban, remote rural, and Native American communities. The focus of this investigation will be at the middle school level in computer education and STEM (mostly Science and Math) courses.</AbstractNarration>
