    <AbstractNarration>A new virtual speaker series, led by Dr. Donald Figer from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), will be dedicated to the advancement of detectors for a broad range of applications, including astrophysics, biomedical imaging, Earth system science, solar energy, and quantum information. The objectives of this series are to enable future national capabilities by disseminating knowledge, increasing interdisciplinary opportunities, enhancing interactions between academia, industry, and government, and providing student and professional training opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multi-institutional committee of technology and discipline experts will select speakers based upon their ability to deliver material that supports the objectives of the series, especially the ability to connect experts from a broad range of fields. The talks will be delivered to audiences around the country through a streaming audio/video facility, and they will also be recorded and archived for later public use. The talks will be given twice per month, with RIT hosting one, and the speaker?s home institution hosting the other. All archived talks will be accessible through a simple browser interface. Funding for this activity is being provided by NSF?s Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>
