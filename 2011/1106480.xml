    <AbstractNarration>Imperatives for environmental and societal sustainability are challenging designers to consider factors that had been previously given little attention. The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Spring Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Design, held March 21-23, 2011 at Stanford University, focuses on the challenges of sustainable design and the role that artificial intelligence (AI) plays in understanding and achieving sustainability. The presumption is that the increased complexity of design necessitated by a desire for very long-term planet sustainability, to include cradle-to-cradle design, requires application of and advances in AI. NSF funds are supporting travel, subsistence and registration of symposium participants. The symposium and follow-up discussion will elaborate current and future research directions at the intersection of AI, design, and sustainability. We anticipate that the AAAI Symposium proceedings and the nascent AI and Sustainable Design community will be of interest outside of AI and computing. Sustainable design is a topic of importance to society; bringing this topic to the attention of AI researchers has the potential for advances in sustainable design that go beyond current computational and design approaches.</AbstractNarration>
