    <AbstractNarration>The University of Georgia, lead institution for the Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Peach State LSAMP) will continue successful practices in recruitment and retention to increase the representation of historically underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and technology (STEM) fields. The 2011-2016 program will consist of a partnership with the following institutions: Fort Valley State University, Savannah State University, Southern&lt;br/&gt;Polytechnic State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Perimeter College and Kennesaw State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through close coordination with state-funded and other externally funded programs, such as the University System of Georgia STEM Initiative and NSF's Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergradute Program, the alliance contributed to significant achievements in broadening underrepresented minority STEM participation, providing targeted support to 1,135 PSLSAMP students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program provides a stronger focus on key recruitment and retention strategies and a strengthened evaluation process, as well as a broadened research collaboration network. The substantially broadened state-wide presence along with stronger and more rigorous focus constitutes a program that will provide committed institutional support; strong administrative and faculty support; and targeted academic enrichment, proactive mentoring, and meaningful research opportunities for students. Building on the foundation developed in the last five years, the intended goals for the project are as follows: &lt;br/&gt;1. Significantly increase minority STEM enrollment and baccalaureate degree completion; &lt;br/&gt;2. Increase the percentage of LSAMP students who participate in STEM research or an external&lt;br/&gt;internship as an undergraduate student;&lt;br/&gt;3. Increase the percentage of LSAMP scholars who transfer to a 4-year institution after completing&lt;br/&gt;partner two-year program;&lt;br/&gt;4. Increase the number of students who pursue STEM graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best practices implemented in this project will have transferable values for STEM&lt;br/&gt;activities in other institutions in the nation. It will also create an environment in which the outcomes&lt;br/&gt;achieved will be sustainable after the project comes to an end. This project will not only contribute to&lt;br/&gt;increasing the number of URM students in STEM disciplines but also to increase the awareness for and to&lt;br/&gt;foster the development of state-wide measures for accelerating diversity in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
