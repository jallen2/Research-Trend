    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1104734&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Motohico Mulase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is aimed at identifying the geometric structure of the&lt;br/&gt;Eynard-Orantin recursion formula that was originally discovered in&lt;br/&gt;random matrix theory and statistical physics. A particular emphasis of&lt;br/&gt;the project is placed on developing a point of view of the Laplace&lt;br/&gt;transform as the mirror map. The goal of the project is to solve the&lt;br/&gt;Remodeling Conjecture in algebraic geometry due to string theory&lt;br/&gt;physicists Marino and Bouchard-Klemm-Marino-Pasquetti. The Remodeling&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture presents a concrete and universal recursion formula, based&lt;br/&gt;on the complex analysis of a Riemann surface, that computes both&lt;br/&gt;closed and open Gromov-Witten invariants of an arbitrary toric&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau 3-fold. Bouchard and Marino proposed a conjecture on&lt;br/&gt;Hurwitz numbers as a limit case of the Remodeling Cojecture. They&lt;br/&gt;defined a sequence of generating functions of simple Hurwitz numbers,&lt;br/&gt;and conjectured that these quantities satisfy the Eynard-Orantin&lt;br/&gt;recursion formula. The Bouchard-Marino conjecture was solved by the PI&lt;br/&gt;and his collaborators in 2009-10. The current understanding that has&lt;br/&gt;emerged since the publication of the PI's papers is the&lt;br/&gt;following. The Gromov-Witten theory of a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold is a&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial counting problem on the A-model side of a topological&lt;br/&gt;string theory. The generating function of the solution to this&lt;br/&gt;counting problem satisfies a combinatorial equation, called the cut-&lt;br/&gt;and-join equation by Zhou. Now take the Laplace transform of this&lt;br/&gt;function. The result is a symmetric meromorphic function defined on&lt;br/&gt;the product of a Riemann surface. This Riemann surface is identified&lt;br/&gt;as the mirror curve of the toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold. The Laplace&lt;br/&gt;transform of the combinatorial equation becomes (conjecturally) the&lt;br/&gt;Eynard-Orantin recursion on the B-model side. The PI's&lt;br/&gt;contribution to this general picture is the identification of the role&lt;br/&gt;of the Laplace transform as the mirror map. This type of the Laplace&lt;br/&gt;transform was further investigated in the PI's recent papers, and&lt;br/&gt;has been utilized by other researchers in solving many related&lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pure mathematical research is about a sharp excitement of&lt;br/&gt;discovery. This excitement energizes young students in science&lt;br/&gt;and engineering. The PI has been collaborating with both&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students, engaging them into the heart&lt;br/&gt;of the research excitement. Instead of peeking into research&lt;br/&gt;experience, these students have participated in the real&lt;br/&gt;excitement of mathematical discovery. These lasting impacts have&lt;br/&gt;inspired the students to become research mathematicians, and they&lt;br/&gt;are continuing to produce new results. The relation between&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, combinatorics, random&lt;br/&gt;matrix theory, topology, integrable systems, and string theory in&lt;br/&gt;the Gromov-Witten theory was apparent in the early 1990s. After a&lt;br/&gt;long time of extremely fruitful developments in each individual&lt;br/&gt;area, we are back to a new level of interaction once&lt;br/&gt;again. Instead of pushing an existing problem or conjecture, the&lt;br/&gt;proposed project is aimed at understanding a new point of&lt;br/&gt;view. It is expected to bring a further cross-fertilization of&lt;br/&gt;these quite different ideas/areas in mathematical sciences. The&lt;br/&gt;PI has organized several workshops specifically aimed at this&lt;br/&gt;subject in the last two and a half years, which were attended by&lt;br/&gt;many young researchers. He will continue to do so for further&lt;br/&gt;dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
