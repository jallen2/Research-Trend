    <AbstractNarration>This Small BusinessI nnovationR esearch( SBIR) Phase1 project addressesth e developmento f a&lt;br/&gt;bacterial culture to degrade PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in contaminated soils and&lt;br/&gt;sediments. PCBs are persistent, toxic contaminants which accumulate in the fatty tissues of&lt;br/&gt;animals,c ontaminatingf ish and humans.P CB-degradingb acteriah ave beend ifficult to produce.&lt;br/&gt;In2009, a readily-grownb acterials peciesw as shownb y BioremediationC onsultingI nc (BCI) to&lt;br/&gt;degrade the most harmful and carcinogenic type of PCBs. This finding allows the development&lt;br/&gt;of an anaerobic PCB-degrading culture for cost-etfective inoculation into PCB-contaminated&lt;br/&gt;sediments. The proposed research will document the ability of BCI's culture to extensively&lt;br/&gt;dechlorinate three types of commercial PCB mixtures, and will develop methods of rapid&lt;br/&gt;culturing.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commerciailm pactso f this researcha ret he developmento f a bacteriai noculantt hat&lt;br/&gt;will degrade PCBs in soil and sediment. PCBs are toxic chemicals used historically as heatresistant&lt;br/&gt;fluids in many industrial applications, including transformers in the electric utility&lt;br/&gt;industry. Several hundred million pounds were manufactured and disposed, resulting in&lt;br/&gt;contamination of soils and river sediments. The recent finding at BCI, that a strain of&lt;br/&gt;dechlorinating bacteria is capable of dechlorinating PCBs. provides an opportunity for BCI to&lt;br/&gt;develop a commercial culture for inoculating contaminated sites with PCB-degrading bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;The marketing of this product will be complementedb y our already-successfusl aleso f other&lt;br/&gt;dechlorinating cultures used in treatment of contamination by diverse chlorinated compounds.&lt;br/&gt;Major stakeholdersin the utility industries,a nd remediationc ontractors,h ave expressedin terest&lt;br/&gt;in partnering with BCI and/or obtaining culture.</AbstractNarration>
