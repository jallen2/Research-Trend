    <AbstractNarration>Tunable Plasmonic Devices Enabled by Holographically-Formed Polymer Dispersed&lt;br/&gt;Liquid Crystals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The goal of this project is to address the challenge for the design and fabrication of&lt;br/&gt;tunable plasmonic devices through the electrical tuning of refractive index in holographicallyformed&lt;br/&gt;polymer dispersed liquid-crystals (H-PDLCs). Both tunable plasmonic nano-antennas&lt;br/&gt;and reconfigurable surface plasmon polariton (SPP) devices will be investigated using&lt;br/&gt;transformation optics and cellular liquid crystals. The resulting tunable plasmonic devices will&lt;br/&gt;feature fast tuning speed and flexible function for practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed tunable plasmonic devices rely on the H-PDLCs, which&lt;br/&gt;feature electrical tuning capability and can be fabricated by the nano-fabrication technique. This&lt;br/&gt;is in contrast to the conventional plasmonic devices that are usually non-tunable, which has&lt;br/&gt;limited their applications in optical systems. Moreover, the proposed uniform and gradient index&lt;br/&gt;H-PDLCs provide us with large flexibility in designing different tuning structures. Combining&lt;br/&gt;these structures with device design techniques will lead to many new tunable plasmonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The successful design and fabrication of proposed H-PDLC based tunable&lt;br/&gt;plasmonic devices will have a large impact on future optical systems for uses in both civilian and&lt;br/&gt;military sectors. Especially, they will find applications in the areas of sensing, imaging, energy&lt;br/&gt;harvesting, and communication systems. Other areas of impact include the following: (1)&lt;br/&gt;enhancement of optical devices research and education experiences for student researchers; (2)&lt;br/&gt;increased participation of high school students, and underrepresented groups in science and&lt;br/&gt;technology; (3) rapid dissemination of research results through workshops, seminars, and&lt;br/&gt;publications.</AbstractNarration>
