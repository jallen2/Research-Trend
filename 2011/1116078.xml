    <AbstractNarration>The project is focused on developing coordination policies for large-scale multi-agent systems operating in uncertain environments through the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Existing MARL techniques do not scale well. This research addresses the scaling issue by using coordination technology to "coordinate" the individual agent learning so as to speed up convergence and lead to learned policies that better reflect overall system objectives. This novel idea is being implemented using an emergent supervisory organization with low overhead that exploits non-local information to dynamically coordinate and shape the learning processes of individual agents while still allowing agents to react autonomously to local feedback. A key question is how to automate the development of the supervisory control process (including supervisory information generation and organization formation). One approach to automation is using a formal model of interactions among agents that also includes a model of global system objectives and policy space of agents to derive the information necessary for appropriate supervisory control. Another approach is the formulation of the supervision problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem. The results of this work provide a necessary component for the development of a wide variety of next-generation adaptive applications, such as smart power grids, cloud computing, and large-scale sensor networks. The broader impact stems from the wide applicability of the resulting learning technology for distributed control, undergraduate and graduate educational activities at UMass, dissemination efforts that make the experimental domain and algorithms publically available, and the development of international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
