    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to examine the ultrafast nonlinear interactions in slow-light photonic crystals, based on recent advancements and towards chip-scale optical signal processing. Experimental observation, along with device nanofabrication, theory and numerical modeling, will be examined in this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is composed of three interrelated Research Thrusts. In Thrust I temporal solitons and ultrafast pulses will be examined in slow-light photonic crystals, in addition to the characterization of the ultrafast pulses. In Thrust II, the program will extend the single electromagnetic wave nonlinear - dispersive interactions to the nonlinear coupling between two electromagnetic waves. In Thrust III, the program will examine four-wave mixing, including optical signal processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the enhanced ultrafast nonlinearities in slow-light photonic crystals for ultrashort pulse generation and frequency conversion, in next-generation chip-scale optical signal processing and communication modules. The Educational outreach and programs will benefit minority and underrepresented groups, K-12 students, high-school teachers, graduate and undergraduate students. The educational tasks involve the outreach to under-served education programs in Harlem and Lower Bronx by working with the GK12 programs and the Double Discovery Center summer program, to develop optical nanoscience and technology teaching modules. The program will also work with the high-school science and physics teachers in Harlem to develop an elective teaching module, involving both theoretical and experimental components, and a ?hands-on? module, to reinforce the advances at intersection of optical physics with nanoscience and technology.</AbstractNarration>
