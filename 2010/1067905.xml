    <AbstractNarration>The IceCube Observatory has recently completed construction at the South Pole. The IceCube detector has deployed 86 strings and is now in full operations. This award provides funds for the Maryland Neutrino group to continue pursuing the physics goals of the IceCube detector. The observation of high-energy neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources will open a new window on the sky, which will provide new information on the acceleration mechanisms at work in these objects and insight into the nature and source of cosmic radiation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific physics topics addressed by the Maryland group are: 1) Search for muon neutrinos coincident with gamma-ray bursts; 2) Search for exotic particles such as monopoles; 3) Search for exotic physics such as quantum gravity and violation of Lorentz invariance; and 4) Study of atmospheric muon neutrinos. This group is also working on an array known as the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) with the first three antenna stations having been funded. This award will support the data analysis activities of the scientists involved in this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: IceCube and ARA are strongly connected with each other and with other experiments in Particle Astrophysics as they are part of a multi-energy multi-messenger survey of the high-energy sky. These experiments have appeal to both physics students and the general public. The group will continue bringing particle astrophysics to high schools and the public through their QuarkNet chapter, as well as through science fair judging and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>
