    <AbstractNarration>Superconducting qubits are manufactured solid-state artificial atoms. Their potential for lithographic scalability, compatibility with microwave control, and operability at nanosecond time scales make superconducting qubits a promising candidate for quantum information science and technology applications. To realize their full potential, present limitations to superconducting qubit coherence and lifetimes must be understood and mitigated, and that is the focus of this work. The control of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance systems is remarkably advanced, and one draws on this knowledge to characterize and mitigate noise sources in superconducting qubits. In doing so, one not only brings superconducting qubits closer to application, but addresses fundamental scientific questions regarding the nature of quantum coherence and the degree to which humankind can build, control, and ultimately exploit macroscopic quantum systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information science is driving an information processing revolution, enabling technologies and capabilities that simply cannot be achieved through conventional means. A unique educational feature of this work is the access and participation by students in academic, corporate and government research environments in the U.S., Japan, and Canada. Through this coordinated research effort, including student internships at these facilities, this work will further build the scientific foundations of quantum information science while also advancing a research culture that fosters future scientists with a global perspective, capable of developing and leading interdisciplinary teams across institutional and international boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
