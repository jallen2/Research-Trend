    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: The circulation and supply of nutrients from deep and intermediate waters to the surface ocean plays a key role in controlling global biological productivity. Silicon is an essential nutrient for diatoms: photosynthetic algae that are responsible for nearly half of the export of organic carbon to the seafloor. Reconstructing past changes in the distribution of dissolved silicon in the oceans is therefore needed for testing hypotheses that link biological drawdown of carbon and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;The skeletons (spicules) of deep-sea sponges are composed of amorphous silica (or opal). We have previously demonstrated that sponge-spicule silicon isotope compositions reflect the concentration of dissolved silicon in which they grew and can, therefore, be used to reconstruct past seawater silicic acid&lt;br/&gt;concentrations. Combined with the isotopic and trace element composition of surface dwelling diatoms, which are largely controlled by surface water productivity, the coupling of surface and deep silicon cycles in the past can be constrained. In this proposal we aim to reconstruct the distribution and biogeochemical cycling of silicon in the Atlantic Ocean during the last ice age and the subsequent the deglaciation. Deglacial warming was&lt;br/&gt;punctuated by periods of rapid climate change accompanied with shifts in ocean biological productivity and physical circulation and atmospheric pCO2. To investigate the role of silicon in the ocean during this dynamic period, we will extract and analyze biogenic opal from existing well-dated sediment cores from the western Atlantic. The isotopic and trace metal composition of these skeletal remains will be used to reconstruct deep, intermediate and surface dissolved silicon concentrations and surface productivity. Our results will be interpreted in conjunction with existing proxy data, and in the framework of box-modeling the silica cycle. The direct output of this proposal will include: 1) record of the silicon isotope composition of sponge spicules in intermediate and deep waters of both the South and North Atlantic basins since the last glacial maximum; 2) silicon isotope compositions and trace metal compositions of diatoms from the North Atlantic; 3) box-models of silicon cycling in the Atlantic, to aid interpretation of the experimental results. The data from this project will form the first comprehensive study of deep-water silicon cycling in the mid-latitudes and the North Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: An understanding of the link between nutrient supply and the biological drawdown of carbon is important and timely given the public concern with climate change and interest in geoengineering and ocean. We propose to carry out novel research to advance our understanding of the role in biological productivity of one of the major nutrients in seawater, silicon. Although our work will focus on past changes over the last twenty thousand years, it may provide useful insights into the linkages between silicon cycling and related carbon drawdown relevant when considering the impact of future changes in Atlantic Ocean circulation. The project will fund the research of postdoctoral investigator Katharine Hendry, and will be instrumental in the development of her scientific career. Mentoring will be provided to Dr Hendry through personal interaction with WHOI Scientists, and through activities co-coordinated at Departmental and Institution&lt;br/&gt;wide levels. For example, the department has a mentoring committee that meets biannually to provide formal and informal feedback to their postdoctoral researchers. Both PIs foresee participation in many outreach activities, including media calls, interviews, inclusion of undergraduate students and&lt;br/&gt;demonstrations of our research. All data will be archived electronically and made available to the community through WHOI. Education and public outreach activities will continue to be an integral part of all our ongoing studies and we believe that our past records attest to our commitment to continue these&lt;br/&gt;activities.</AbstractNarration>
