    <AbstractNarration>With the recent Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the behavior of oil plumes in the natural environment has come become a central question. Experiments performed in the University of North Carolina (UNC) Fluids Laboratory have shown that buoyant plumes can be trapped underwater at regions of strong density stratification. This project will explore the mechanisms leading to underwater trapping of multi-phase plumes like those forming in the ongoing Gulf spill. Specifically, the project will focus on fluid dynamics experiments in the density-stratified flow facility in the UNC Fluids Lab to better quantify the combined roles of turbulent mixing, strong ambient stratifications, plume buoyancy, and use of surfactants (dispersants) in creating under water trapped plumes. Theoretical closure models will be developed to interpret the experiments and guide field studies. Further research will include direct numerical simulations to explore plume behavior under the effects of high temperature, high pressure, internal waves, and shear associated with this current spill. The intellectual merit of this theoretical and experimental research includes developing a benchmarked model for actual oil plume distribution, residence time, and surface versus sub-surface oil fractions. Broader impacts of the research will involve disseminating results with other groups directly working on the Gulf Oil Spill, including those collecting data on the subsurface plume distribution. Additionally, the PIs will make results available to the petroleum industry and regulatory agencies such as EPA to assist in the understanding of current and future spills. The research project will also involve the education of two undergraduate researchers and create new outreach opportunities for high school students to participate in the UNC Fluids Lab.</AbstractNarration>
