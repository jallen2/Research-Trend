    <AbstractNarration>The University of Cincinnati, in collaboration with Cincinnati Public Schools and the nonprofit community partner STRIVE as well as the GE Foundation and the Cincinnati Federation of Teachers, is developing a Noyce Teaching Fellows/Master Teaching Fellows (TF/MTF) project. During the planning process, the partnership is additionally including a local community college and an Historically Black College. A full Noyce TF/MTF proposal is being developed in which all of the higher education partners will collaborate to recruit STEM undergraduate majors and STEM professional career-changers to enroll in a Noyce Teaching Fellowship master's degree and licensure program at the University of Cincinnati. As part of the planning process, early recruitment efforts through the undergraduate STEM education pathway are being strengthened to include exploratory teaching experiences and career counseling. Mentoring and induction components of an existing Noyce Scholars program at the University of Cincinnati are being enhanced to include Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, which includes teaching apprenticeships modeled after Grand Rounds Conferences. The partners are planning a project in which Teaching Fellows would be placed in groups of three at schools, and their course work and clinical experiences would occur under the guidance of Master Teachers. The project team is assessing the needs of the Cincinnati Public Schools to determine current system characteristics, desired systems, and gaps, as part of the planning to develop a Master Teaching Fellow program that would best support current needs in the Cincinnati Public Schools. The collaborative partners are focused on forming a STEM education system from the perspective of pedagogy and community practice, with implications for policy and broader participation that would include the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana tri-state region and beyond. The evaluation component of the planning project is assessing progress in the planning as well as developing the evaluation plan for the full TF/MTF proposal.</AbstractNarration>
