    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project with a goal of understanding the transition between metallic and insulating phases in materials where the electrons are strongly correlated with each other. The research will explore the metallic phase of vanadium dioxide thin films after the material has undergone a light-induced insulator-to-metal transition. The project will elucidate the unusual electro-optical properties of vanadium dioxide. The understanding developed as a result of the experiments may open new opportunities to actively control and tailor the properties of novel optical devices (e.g. switches) and sensors. The project will enable strong cross-fertilization and synergy between distinct disciplines such as optics, condensed matter and materials science. In addition, the proposed program will offer a rich spectrum of interdisciplinary educational opportunities for students. Components of the research project will be used to enrich the teaching curriculum as well as in the development of exciting outreach activities for the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research focusing on the metal-insulator phase transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2) thin films and multi-layered structures. The goal is to obtain a better understanding of the nature of this transition [electronic (Mott) vs structural (Peierls)] by studying the nucleation and evolution of the metallic phase in the films after undergoing a light-induced insulator-to-metal transition. Modifications to the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons in either metallic VO2 or the adjacent conducting material (gold, silver, rutheniun dioxide, etc.) during the relaxation process will be investigated. The improved understanding of this phase transition and associated changes in the VO2 electro-optical properties will then be used to in an attempt to dynamically control surface plasmon or polariton propagation in multilayered structures. The ability to have such control may lead to novel applications. The project will involve a rich spectrum of interdisciplinary educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. In addition demonstrations will be developed for use in the classroom and as outreach activities to the broader community.</AbstractNarration>
