    <AbstractNarration>The transition from vegetative development to the production of flowers is critical to plant fitness. Flowering time, and the extent of branching along the flowering axis will impact fruit and seed production, including production in agriculturally important plant species. Recent work has demonstrated that a family of transcription factor proteins (called SQUAMOSA-PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE, or SPL) regulates the development of diverse ecologically and economically important traits including the developmental transition to flowering, determining the extent of branching along the flowering axis, and fruit ripening. Interestingly, due to historical duplication events, multiple SPL gene copies are found in the genome of many flowering plant species, and there is evidence that these SPL copies have evolved specialized functions. This project will use genetic approaches to determine how duplicated SPL genes function in three divergent plant species to affect the development of critical plant traits including transition to flowering and branching architecture. In addition, this project will investigate how SPL proteins regulate, or are regulated by, other proteins known to affect flowering time and branching along the flowering axis. Placed in an evolutionary context the results will provide critical insight into how duplicated genes can partition and optimize function, or evolve novel function. These functional changes can lead to trait diversification as well as diversification and specialization within the complex developmental genetic pathways that determine fitness. This project will provide training to a postdoctoral researcher and undergraduate students, including students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Training will advance the scientific expertise of the postdoctoral researcher and students at the interface of developmental genetics and evolution, aiding these individuals in moving forward to successful research and teaching careers. This project will facilitate outreach to regional 6-12th grade teachers, helping to bring inquiry-based scientific learning to the classroom.</AbstractNarration>
