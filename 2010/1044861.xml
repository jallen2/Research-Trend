    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses a recognized need of the 21st century technological society: broadening participation and excellence in computing education. Computing in the Arts (CITA) is an innovative, interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts degree program, which integrates computer science and information technology with traditional art theory and practice. The curriculum introduces computing around a theme of creative expression, which has been found to increase participation by women and minorities. CITA is based on sound pedagogy, involving tested curricula and structured synthesis experiences. It has the potential to enrich computing education for undergraduate students across disciplines. Learning materials, teaching strategies and faculty expertise are being developed to promote computational thinking in the arts disciplines. Student learning objectives and the efficacy of CITA to increase participation in computing will be assessed. The project will promote implementation of the curriculum and effective strategies through widespread dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
