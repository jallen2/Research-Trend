    <AbstractNarration>Nociception refers to the ability to detect pain or injury-inducing stimuli, and is critical for an animal?s survival. How painful stimuli are transmitted to the brain can be changed by the brain itself. For example, damaged regions of a body become more sensitive to subsequent stimulation as a way to protect the body from further damage. Alternatively, gently rubbing a painful area of the body can temporarily reduce pain. The goal of this project is to understand the physiological processes that modulate the ways in which painful stimuli are transmitted to the brain, focusing on the effects of endocannabinoids, a class of neurotransmitters known to attenuate pain. In addition, the capacity for certain patterns of neural activity to stimulate the release of endocannabinoid transmitters will be examined. This project will include behavioral experiments, molecular genetic procedures and electrophysiological recordings of synaptic transmission by pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors). It is expected that (1) endocannabinoid transmitters will be found to decrease nociceptive synaptic signaling, which will lead to a decrease in pain-elicited behaviors and (2) that activation of non-pain, touch-sensitive neurons will stimulate the release of endocannabinoid transmitters resulting in a decrease in the effects of painful stimuli. The experiments in this project are critical to developing an understanding of a fundamental process in neurobiology, how the brain detects pain and how pain signaling can be altered by modulatory processes within the brain itself. This proposal also provides unique training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in behavioral, molecular genetics and electrophysiological recording techniques. Furthermore, this project will take place in a state (South Dakota) that is under-represented in terms of federally funded scientific research and at an institution (University of South Dakota) that serves a number of rural and/or first generation college students.</AbstractNarration>
