    <AbstractNarration>Institution: University of Toledo&lt;br/&gt;Title: 3D Multi-scale Simulation of Thin Film Photovoltaics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to develop the first three-dimensional, multi-scale numerical simulator for thin-film photovoltaics (PV). The simulator will have the capability to design and predict the performance of thin film PV cells and then interconnect these cells into modules and arrays, taking into account all non-uniformities at each length scale, including material non-uniformities and the microscale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The disordered nature of non-crystalline semiconductors in thin-film PV devices leads to many performance issues, including lack of uniform performance between nominally identical devices, accelerated degradation, and large deviations from ideal diode behavior. However, efforts to describe the underlying mechanisms have largely been based on crystalline physics because of their relative simplicity and the availability of advanced software products developed to simulate crystalline device behavior. In this proposed research, the physics of coupled electronic and heat transport in laterally non-uniform and non-crystalline (amorphous and/or polycrystalline) thin film structures with electrodes of finite resistivity will modeled, which will allow for a more accurate description of device non-uniformities at the microscale. Specifically, this theoretical approach will have two parts: 1) development of an integrated description of the physics of charge and heat transport in non-crystalline PV; 2) solution of partial differential equations with numerical techniques, including the finite element and Monte Carlo methods. A new algorithm for stochastic modeling with parameters chosen in the form of statistical distributions, spatially correlated through the appropriate Monte Carlo routine, will be developed to account for non-uniform domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed project has the potential bring non-crystalline physics underlying thin-film PV devices into the mainstream solar PV community by compiling the acquired knowledge in a user-friendly, freely available PV simulation software package that will serve as a useful tool for researchers, educators, students, and the thin-film PV industry. For educational activities in courses, this simulator provides an interactive environment where students will be able to create and observe the effects of variations in operating parameters, material non-uniformities, and connection of cells or modules in a circuit. For the thin-film PV industry, this simulator will be the first of its kind, and has the potential to accelerate industrial innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed education activities focus on participation of undergraduates in the proposed research, including students from under-represented groups. These activities will be coordinated through the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Toledo, which offers research experience for undergraduates (REU) program and summer camp program for high school students.</AbstractNarration>
