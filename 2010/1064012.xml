    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The 2011 Archaea: Ecology, Metabolism and Molecular Biology Gordon Research Conference will be held July 31 to August 5, 2011 at Waterville Valley Resort in Waterville Valley, New Hampshire. The first GRC on Archaea was held in 1996 and has continued every three years. The Archaea Gordon Research Conference (GRC) constitutes the most prestigious and comprehensive conference on the Archaea and is the only regularly scheduled conference focused on all aspects of archaeal biology. The objectives of the conference are to communicate and discuss ideas at the frontiers of science and technology in archaeal research. This year's meeting will expand on a number of emerging topics highlighting new paradigms in archaeal physiology and regulation of metabolism. The eight main platform sessions are: (1) Ecology &amp; Diversity, (2) Systems Biology and Genomics, (3) Transcription and Small RNAs, (4) Translation and Post-Transcriptional Modification, (5) Physiology and Regulation of Metabolism, (6) Protein Structure and Function, (7) Replication, Repair and Recombination, and (8) Evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The 2011 Archaea: Ecology, Metabolism and Molecular Biology Gordon Research Conference will provide students and postdoctoral fellows an opportunity to present and discuss their research in the poster sessions. In addition, a special effort will be expended to attract students from underrepresented groups. The conference co-chairs have also secured a female keynote speaker and a discussion leader who is an underrepresented minority.</AbstractNarration>
