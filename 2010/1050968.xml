    <AbstractNarration>Rajiv Gandhi &lt;br/&gt;OISE- 1050968 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S.-India International Collaborative Research and Training for Computer Science Students &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international collaborative research and training award to Computer Science Professor Rajiv Gandhi will provide a unique research and educational experience in Mumbai, India for four promising computer science students from Rutgers University-Camden. The students along with the PI will work on Approximation Algorithms for NP-hard problems (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time) with mentors Suneeta Sane, Professor and Head, Computer Technology Department, Veermate Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) and faculty at the School of Technology and Computer Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. The problems that the group intends to work on arise in ad hoc and storage area networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Intellectual Merit- Scheduling problems play a central role in the design of communication networks. Many of these problems are NP-hard and hence efficient algorithms that produce near-optimal solutions are of intrinsic importance. Such algorithms can have significant impact on the performance of the networks in terms of scalability and the usage of valuable resources such as bandwidth (and power, in case of ad hoc networks). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts- The PI joined the faculty at Rutgers University Camden, a liberal arts institution, in order to focus on undergraduate education. The core component of the proposed project is to provide an international research and education experience to students at Rutgers University Camden. All students participating in this project are expected to pursue graduate studies. As two of the international collaborators are women, this is likely to have the additional positive impact on the long-term goals of the participating female students in this project.</AbstractNarration>
