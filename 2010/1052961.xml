    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a workshop on the future of observatories in the social sciences, to be held during December 2010 in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The workshop will convene a group of experts to discuss how a network of social observatories might contribute to the advancement of science and how such a network might best be designed to meet this objective. The workshop will consider the potential value of a network of social science observatories, either attached to existing physical science observatories or sited independently, for advancing scientific research; criteria for siting such observatories; data that could be collected through the observatories; and data storage and data access issues. Materials to be prepared for the workshop include a background paper on existing physical and environmental science observatories and a critical review of existing sources of data for social science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been considerable past work to develop networks of physical and ecological observatories. Among those involved with these efforts, there is a growing sense that social and economic data are needed to augment the physical observations presently being collected. In addition, it has been argued that a network of social observatories could provide the infrastructure necessary to support important new interdisciplinary research within the social sciences. By providing the beginnings of a blueprint for the establishment of a network of social observatories, this workshop can be expected to have an initial impact on human-environment research and a longer-term impact on interdisciplinary research in the social sciences. Plans for dissemination to the broader community include a journal article to be prepared at the conclusion of the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
