    <AbstractNarration>Casazza&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008183&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator works on several fundamental questions&lt;br/&gt;concerning applications of Hilbert space frames. Much of the&lt;br/&gt;work concerns "fusion frames," which provide a natural framework&lt;br/&gt;for performing hierarchical data processing. Recent advances in&lt;br/&gt;hardware technology have enabled the economic production and&lt;br/&gt;deployment of a large number of low-cost components, which in&lt;br/&gt;combination enable reliable and efficient operation. Across many&lt;br/&gt;disciplines there is a fundamental shift from centralized&lt;br/&gt;information processing to distributed or network-wide information&lt;br/&gt;processing. Data communication is shifting from point-to-point&lt;br/&gt;communication to packet transport over wide area networks where&lt;br/&gt;network management is distributed and the reliability of individual&lt;br/&gt;links is less critical. Radar imaging is moving away from single&lt;br/&gt;platforms to multiple platforms that cooperate to achieve better&lt;br/&gt;performance. Wireless sensor networks are emerging as a new&lt;br/&gt;technology that potentially enables cost-effective and reliable&lt;br/&gt;surveillance. All these applications involve a large number of data&lt;br/&gt;streams, which need to be integrated at a central processor. Fusion&lt;br/&gt;frames are a recent development designed precisely for these&lt;br/&gt;applications. The investigator develops concrete constructions of&lt;br/&gt;fusion frames and the algorithms needed for their implementation. &lt;br/&gt;Working directly with engineers guarantees that advances here have&lt;br/&gt;Immediate implementation. The techniques are also applied to&lt;br/&gt;produce Grassmannian frames for quantum physics -- especially&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information theory, quantum state tomography, and quantum&lt;br/&gt;cryptography. Finally, frame theory has shown that the 1959&lt;br/&gt;Kadison-Singer Problem is equivalent to fundamental unsolved problems&lt;br/&gt;in a dozen areas of research in pure mathematics, applied mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;and engineering. This project develops the needed frames for resolving&lt;br/&gt;what is now one of the most significant open problems in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We have now entered a new era where the Defense Department,&lt;br/&gt;Homeland Security, and industry must process amounts of data that&lt;br/&gt;overwhelm even current computer capacities. Especially for&lt;br/&gt;defense, it is critical to be able to process these data in real&lt;br/&gt;time, which is becoming more and more difficult. The problems&lt;br/&gt;caused by this "information overload" are escalating rapidly&lt;br/&gt;every year and need to be addressed immediately and quickly. &lt;br/&gt;Therefore, it is of vital national interest to automate as much&lt;br/&gt;of the information fusion process as possible. But at this time,&lt;br/&gt;in the area of information fusion the fundamental mathematics&lt;br/&gt;necessary for such an automated system is far behind the current&lt;br/&gt;needs. The investigator and his students develop the mathematics&lt;br/&gt;necessary for tackling these critical needs. This includes&lt;br/&gt;methods for storing and processing information in parallel --&lt;br/&gt;i.e. dividing it into multiple subsystems for simpler processing&lt;br/&gt;and then "fusing" the results to get the desired outcomes. It&lt;br/&gt;also includes developing distributed sensing networks that can&lt;br/&gt;keep an area under surveillance while taking into account severe&lt;br/&gt;physical limitations of the systems such as low communication&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth, limited signal processing power, limited battery life,&lt;br/&gt;or the topography of the surveillance area. Such an automated&lt;br/&gt;system must be able to combine a large number of sources of quite&lt;br/&gt;disparate information while leaving almost no room for error. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his students address these needs as well as&lt;br/&gt;try to anticipate the next level of difficulties that will arise.</AbstractNarration>
