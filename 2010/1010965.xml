    <AbstractNarration>Recent molecular studies in plants have uncovered the surprising and intimate interconnections between immune signaling, hormonal actions and development. For instance, analyses of plant genomes have revealed well over a thousand genes that appear to encode receptors - proteins whose function is surveillance of the intra and extracellular environment via binding to other molecules. Preliminary studies suggest that many of these putative receptors may be common to immune responses, hormonal signaling and development in plants. However, most of the candidate receptors are currently "orphan receptors" whose biological functions remain unknown. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an attempt to reveal these functions and to explore the overlap between what have been disparate fields of plant biology, the 2010 Keystone Symposia meeting on Receptors and Signaling in Plant Development and Biotic Interactions will gather scientists working on plant development, hormonal signaling and immune responses in order to stimulate novel interactions among these research communities. The major goal of this meeting is to advance understanding of plant receptor signaling and the molecular regulatory networks that are just downstream of the receptors themselves. This meeting is unique because scientists working on biotic interactions and plant development have never had such an opportunity for cross-talk. This meeting will enhance infrastructure by fostering networking and initiation of collaborations. The investigators anticipate the following educational benefits: acquaint trainees and investigators new to field with the state-of-the-art; critical scientific feedback; and career development for trainees and new investigators, including opportunities both to see successful scientists presenting cutting-edge science and to network with prospective mentors and others who might contribute to their scientific and professional development.</AbstractNarration>
