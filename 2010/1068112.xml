    <AbstractNarration>Even the cold of outer space is hot in comparison to ultracold atoms and molecules. By using a combination of red-detuned, circularly polarized laser light and magnetic fields - the magneto-optical trap (MOT) - room-temperature atoms can be cooled to just above absolute zero (~100 microK) and trapped in a volume a few millimeter in diameter. These ultracold gases allow precision studies of atomic energy levels, leading to deeper insight into quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the world of the very small. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Dr. Kleinert's lab at Willamette University, ultracold gases of rubidium and calcium are trapped together and combined to form molecular dimers, RbCa, a molecule that has never before been formed or studied. These novel molecules are attractive systems to study due to their non-vanishing electric and magnetic dipole moments. By carefully tailoring the internal quantum state of the molecules and utilizing the permanent dipole moments through interactions with external electric and magnetic fields, these molecules find applications in quantum information processing, studies of fundamental symmetries and high-precision spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is used to train undergraduates considering careers in research, to enrich the research environment of the physics department and Willamette University as a whole, and to further enhance integration of teaching and research on campus. Specifically, Kleinert is including undergraduate researchers in all aspects of her project, from initial experimental assembly, testing, data collection, and analysis to dissemination through publications and conference presentations. This exposure to all aspects of a state-of-the art research project together with close faculty mentoring and peer-teaching prepares students well and inspires them to continue higher education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to work on campus, Kleinert also actively participates in outreach programs to foster scientific curiosity in young children and interested adults alike. The NSF award allows her to include students from under-represented groups in her research project through collaboration with the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, and to invite experts to campus to give research talks and to act as mentors and role models.</AbstractNarration>
