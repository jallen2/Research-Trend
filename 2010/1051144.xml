    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID proposal organized by the Consortium for Policy Research (CPRE) at Teachers College, complements the development of a new Framework to guide the next generation of Common Core Science Standards. The Framework calls for standards that are organized around learning progressions (LPs) that address "big" ideas in science that go across grades. Through a series of workshops, CPRE will develop four hypothetical LPs that will serve as a critical tool to states, districts and instructional developers as they plan for using the new standards. The work will be conducted by STEM education learning researchers with participation by state science supervisors. A well-qualified advisory board will review the quality and utility of the hypothetical LPs. The project will be widely disseminated through the CPRE network to all 50 states.</AbstractNarration>
