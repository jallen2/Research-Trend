    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Workshops on Numerical Methods in Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics have been held roughly biennially, alternating between North America and Europe since 1979. This proposal is for partial support of the sixteenth workshop in this series. The funds will primarily be used for travel support for young researchers, researchers from under-represented groups in science, as well as researchers who have not previously been part of the community. This support will broaden participation in the Non-Newtonian flows community and maintain its intellectual vitality by bringing in new members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The primary motivation for the original workshop in 1979 was the recognition in the community that the mathematical models that had been developed to describe flowing complex fluids (specifically polymer solutions and melts) were much more difficult to solve computationally than were more traditional flow problems with Newtonian or generalized Newtonian fluids. Modeling of such fluids is important for applications ranging from polymer processing to blood flow in biomedical devices. Topics covered in recent workshops include numerical methods for solution of the differential or integrodifferential equations arising from continuum models of flowing complex fluids as well as also mathematical analysis of models of flowing complex fluids and the phenomenological and statistical mechanical framework for describing them. Additionally, an important aspect of the workshops in recent years has been mesoscopic and multiscale simulation methods. Finally, we emphasize that the workshop addresses not just numerical methods but also the physical phenomena and engineering processes whose prediction and understanding motivate those methods. Despite the name of the workshop, presentations of experimental work are essential, as motivation and validation for the newest generations of methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This series of workshops is truly international attendees from 12 nations around the world are already registered for the present workshop. The informal format, and in particular the fact that attendees all eat meals together promotes close interaction between them. The travel grants provided through this grant will promote participation from young people and members of underrepresented groups in science. The selection process for the grants will also give weight to applicants whose primary research field has not been non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, with the aim of achieving intellectual growth in the field by cross-fertilization of ideas brought by researchers from outside the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of the advances reported in the workshop will be achieved via a special issue of Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics and manuscripts that will contain peer-reviewed articles based on research presented at the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
