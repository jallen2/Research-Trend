    <AbstractNarration>1066817 (Hester) This research focuses on the restoration of small-scale water (hyporheic) exchange between streams and their underlying sediments (i.e., the highly reactive ?river?s liver?), which has been heavily impacted by various human land uses. The overarching goal is to determine how the potential for ?hyporheic restoration? varies along an urbanization gradient in particular because considerable stream restoration efforts already occur in urban areas. To accomplish this, hyporheic-relevant conditions within 10 stream reaches will be examined relative to urbanization in their contributing watersheds. The specific research objectives are to: (1) quantify watershed-level urbanization metrics for each watershed via existing digital sources: (2) measure reach-scale controls on hyporhic exchange (or surrogates) at each stream via field campaign and existing digital sources; (3) identify relationships between each reach-scale control on hyporheic exchange and urbanization using statistical analyses; (4) quantify hyporheic impairment relative to designated reference conditions; and (5) conduct feasibility assessment of stream restoration and riparian/watershed restoration and riparian/watershed restoration to mitigate hyporheic impairment along an urbanization gradient. The PI will integrate the research into a new water sustainability component of a Water Resources Engineering class, including involving students in analysis and presentation of results, as well as tours of restoration sites. Similarly, the co-PI will develop learning modules for a Green Engineering course. The PI will work with the School of Engineering?s Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity to recruit underrepresented undergraduates to participate in the project both through semester research experiences conducting data analysis during the academic year and as summer field research assistants.</AbstractNarration>
