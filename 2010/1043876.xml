    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing, field testing and assessing the effectiveness of a set of 8 interactive, online case studies that help college-level students learn and integrate their understanding of modern concepts in evolutionary biology. The studies provide richness to the understanding of evolutionary processes by integrating biological concepts across multiple scales, varying from nucleotides to populations. The case studies emphasize the molecular and biochemical bases of evolutionary processes, in conjunction with the traditionally taught concepts of population genetic variation and natural selection. Among the case studies under development are: 1) Hox genes and body plan evolution in arthropods; 2) color vision in primates; 3) body size in dogs; 4) myosin, morphology and human evolution; and 5) corticosteroid receptors in mammals. These resources for learning evolutionary concepts are being field tested and assessed in introductory and advanced biology courses. Assessments used to measure their effectiveness in helping students fill the "holes" in their understanding of evolution, and to integrate the "bits and pieces" of evolution they previously learned, are being tested for validity and reliability by triangulating with interviews and analyses of students' writing. In addition, the cases address common problems with student ideas that 1) evolution is goal directed; and 2) species are separate, stable and unchanging. Dissemination of developed resources and assessments is occurring by online distribution via the Understanding Evolution website at UC Berkeley (UE), the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), and the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science (NCCSTS), along with LON-CAPA and other means of online distribution, and via presentations and workshops at conferences and at other schools.</AbstractNarration>
