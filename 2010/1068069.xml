    <AbstractNarration>The research goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanics and magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory alloys at the nanoscale, and to explore the potential and limitations of magnetic shape-memory alloys in small-scale devices. Four objectives include: (i) Mechanics and magneto-mechanics of nano-columns; (ii) Structure, phase transformation, and mechanics of thin films; (iii) Fabrication and magneto-mechanics of nanodiscs and nanowires; (iv) Interaction of magnetic domains and crystallographic twins on the nano-scale. The combined study of nanofabrication, processing and thermo-magneto-nanomechanical characterization will link microstructural features to unique properties spawned by their reduced size. Nanofabrication and processing techniques will include physical vapor deposition of films on various substrates, electron-beam lithography, focused-ion-beam machining and thermo-magneto-mechanical training. The microstructure and magnetic domain structure will be characterized with various scanning probe techniques and transmission electron microscopy techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current device, logical and memory technology is based on binary mono-functional elements and volatile device states. The multi-state, multifunctional and non-volatile magnetic shape-memory alloy nanostructures bear a high potential to open new pathways for small-scale devices and memory applications. Students employed through this project will engage in an international effort, which includes visits at partner institutions in Austria and Spain. Following a successful tradition at Boise State University, several undergraduate students will be included in research efforts. They will present results at international conferences and author peer-reviewed journal articles. Outreach activities are targeted towards grade schools to attract children to careers in science and technology and include regular visits of grade school classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
