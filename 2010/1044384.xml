    <AbstractNarration>Temple University's Center for Reimagining Children's Learning and Education, the University of Delaware, and Johns Hopkins University are collaborating with the Children's Museum of Manhattan and several other children's museums, science centers, and researchers around the U.S. to conduct a two-day workshop to review and expand the research base on the role of play in children's learning of STEM. The workshop is associated with a larger, multi-faceted initiative called the Ultimate Block Party (UBP), whose mission is to make a case for and conduct activities on the science of learning and the importance of play in children's lives and their development of 21st century skills. Associated with the workshop, UBP activities in 2010 include a major event on October 3 in Central Park, New York City, whose purpose is to provide families with engaging activities that emphasize how the science of learning supports the critical role of playful learning in children's education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop participants will include both researchers and practitioners who will share knowledge about children's learning in informal settings and strategize on how to maximize the kind of scientific learning that takes place in free-choice learning environments. A particular emphasis will be on sparking curiosity about STEM by children from all socio-economic and ethnic groups. On the second day, participants will also contribute to the event in Central Park by observing and commenting on the event, its impact on attendees, and possible improvements for future events in New York and around the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The process includes an evaluation of the workshop and the production of a workshop report. Dissemination will be both to academic research and informal science education communities.</AbstractNarration>
