    <AbstractNarration>A series of three workshops is being held in 2010 to address challenges specific to projects in Texas that are supported by the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program (STEP). Workshop I has a primary focus on informing participants of the goal of each of the fifteen STEP projects funded in the state of Texas, and providing introductions and social networking opportunities for project personnel. A part of the workshop is devoted to using evidence-based decision making to inform projects, and a panel of senior PIs provides a question and answer session to field questions from new projects and to offer lessons learned. Workshop II focuses on a theme of best practices in retention for minority students, first generation students, women, and community college students. Presenters use their project data and tie their findings/recommendations to current literature. Workshop III focuses on mathematics as a critical factor in STEM student success and learning of other concepts. Topics include math preparedness, math placement, and promoting deep learning, especially for transfer and minority students. At least 28 participants are expected to attend each workshop. The product of each workshop will be a document of "Key Findings" that summarizes key conclusions and next steps, with an emphasis on information that will be useful to the project teams at the workshops and to the broader national set of STEP projects.</AbstractNarration>
