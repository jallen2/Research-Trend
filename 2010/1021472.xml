    <AbstractNarration>All living organisms are composed of cells that are separated from their environment by a thin membrane. Although this membrane forms an important protective barrier, it also comprises a significant barrier to essential cellular components. To overcome this problem, cell membranes contain a broad assortment of proteins that are each specialized to transport specific cargo. These membrane proteins are dynamic molecular machines that undergo conformational change (change in shape and structure) to pick up and release cargo on either side of the membrane. A major challenge to understanding how membrane proteins work is to define these conformational changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CLC proteins are a class of membrane proteins that specifically transport chloride and protons (two small and oppositely-charged ions) in opposite directions. The goal of this project is to understand how the CLC proteins accomplish this feat: specifically, to define the conformational changes by which the protein pick up and drops off each substrate ion with such exquisite specificity. This will be accomplished by positioning small (19F) probes throughout the CLC protein and detecting their motion using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). By combining this information with the static molecular-resolution structure that is known from X-ray crystallography, a dynamic model of CLC protein function will be created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The experiments described in this research project will involve training a graduate student and a postdoctoral scientist in biochemical and biophysical methods and analysis that will provide excellent preparation for a career in academia or in the biotechnology sector. This research will also involve the training of undergraduate summer students (with continued inclusion of women and minorities), which will serve a twofold purpose of (1) providing research experiences to young, potential future scientists and (2) providing mentoring experience to the graduate student and post-doc who are leading the experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI of this project will continue to recruit and mentor women and minorities, to participate in the Biophysical Society's Committee for Professional Opportunities for Women, and to develop mentoring programs for students at Stanford. In addition, she will broaden her role to include outreach to the local schools.</AbstractNarration>
