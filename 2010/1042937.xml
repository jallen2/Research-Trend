    <AbstractNarration>This US-Mexico award will support an international planning and research workshop on interactive and ubiquitous computing, involving approximately thirty-five scientists and students from the United States. Organized by Dr. Gillian Hayes of the University of California-Irvine and Dr. Monica Tentori of the University of Baja California, together with Dr. Jesus Favela of CICESE, the Center for Scientific Research and Education of Ensenada, Mexico, the workshop is intended to promote an inter-cultural exchange and research cross-fertilization in the fields of human computer interactions (HCI) and ubiquitous computing (Ubicomp), the latter dealing with the creation of environments comprised of sensors, actuators, displays, and computational elements, embedded seamlessly in everyday objects, and connected through a continuous network. In recent years, researchers have been focusing research efforts to solve significant human problems using tools and techniques from HCI and Ubicomp. The intersection of both fields addresses a wide variety of topics from healthcare to sustainability to cross-cultural collaboration and requires truly multidisciplinary teams including people from academia, industry and community organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will feature in-depth discussions with a small group of senior-level researchers, including specialists from several areas of computer science, social science, and information science that make use of interactive and ubiquitous computing. In addition, it will offer one-on-one mentoring and poster presentations. Workshop outcomes will include recommendations for future directions of research, funding, policy, and education.</AbstractNarration>
