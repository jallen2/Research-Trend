    <AbstractNarration>1057438&lt;br/&gt;Hoo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is in response to the NSF's RAPID call for quick response research to the oil spill in the Gulf. The PIs have been involved in proprietary research on natural based plastics made from sorghum. It was shown that a powder made from certain sorghum varieties can be used effectively as an absorbent to remove organic based materials (e.g., car oils). The core of the proposed research is to combine the absorption properties of this natural based material with existing technology to shape it into a porous sponge-like material to be used to remove crude oil spilled in a seawater environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed work is to develop an economically-viable, natural-based absorbent to clean up oil spills. The objective of proposed RAPID study is to identify and quantify the key parameters of the proposed natural based absorbent such that quick implementation can be realized to the current Gulf oil spill. The method to achieve the objective is to apply basic bench scale design of experiments that compare different parameters (loadings, size and structure, etc.) in a simulated system of crude oil and seawater. The experimental data will be used to assess the economic commercial viability of the method. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary tests of the sorghum-based material in the shape of a foamy (sponge-like) absorbent have shown that it can absorb simulated crude oil as much as 12 to 20 times its own weight. By optimizing certain key parameters, the PIs can enhance this natural based absorbent potential to provide rapid and cost effective oil absorption levels. The material can be made at the site of the spill, thus eliminating storage and transportation cost associated with light weight substances. Moreover, there is the potential to recover a relative large portion (up to 80%) of the absorbed oil from the absorbent (not included in this study). Preliminary calculations show that the value of the recovered oil may be higher than the cost of the absorbent and the recovery operation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without a doubt, an oil spill of the current magnitude threatens not only the human, animal and plant but also can cause irreparable damage to the environment. If the key parameters that affect the absorbent potential of the proposed natural-based, cost-effective solution can be identified and optimized, the resulting technique can be applied in other environments, for example, marshlands. This is because the absorbent material can be engineered in different sizes and physical structures (planar, cylindrical, etc.) and processing may provide for certain attractive properties for the application conditions. Both PIs have a track record of working with graduate and undergraduate students in their research programs. They also are active in the student chapter of several engineering professional societies and participate in high school programs that recruit underrepresented students to TTU. The outcomes of this study will be transmitted to the public in various forms including: peer-reviewed publication, to BP officials, DOE, and other appropriate forums.</AbstractNarration>
