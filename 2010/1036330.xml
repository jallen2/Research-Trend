    <AbstractNarration>A combination of student understanding of the nature of science, an epistemology of science, the student's culture and general worldview has been shown to influence a student's success in science. The underlying scientific epistemological view (SEV) of the student may be a significant factor in student views about science as well as student's level of success in science. The proposed research will investigate the scientific epistemological views (SEVs) of STEM majors at HBCUs and other universities to determine to what extent student SEV is a factor in undergraduate students' experiences and subsequently retention in a STEM major to graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will look for potential correlation between student's view of science as a desired major and student's SEV. In addition the study will investigate differences between student ethnic group classification and SEV in order to provide information about the diversity of epistemic thought in science classrooms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research methodology for this project consists of a quantitative and qualitative cohort study using a survey instrument referred to as the SEV-S to provide data regarding student's scientific epistemological views. A pilot study has been completed using this instrument and design methodology at Tennessee State University and statistically significant differences in epistemologies of science were found between STEM majors/non-STEM majors, male/female students, and students of different ethnicities.</AbstractNarration>
