    <AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Samuel Obeng and Dr. Stuart Davis, Mr. Christopher Green will investigate three components of prosodic phonology, namely syllable structure, metrical structure, and tone, in Bamana (Bambara), a Mande language of West Africa, and its related varieties. The primary focus will be the Colloquial (non-standard) variety of Bamana spoken in Bamako, the capital of Mali, by a young cohort of individuals. Colloquial Bamana, first described in Christopher Green's earlier work, has been shown to differ in significant ways from other "Classic" varieties of the language, most noticeably in its inventory of complex syllable types. The emergence of such syllable types appears to be restricted by other prosodic structures of the language, such as syllable margin phonotactics and metrical structure. One goal of this research project is to better understand the mechanisms underlying these prohibitions and the implications that their presence has for trajectories of linguistic change in this and other related Mande languages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colloquial Bamana data will be gathered via direct elicitation in interviews with native speaker consultants in Bamako. Additional mixed methodological approaches specifically geared toward the collection of non-standard language varieties will also be employed. This project have a lasting effect on Bamana learners by providing detailed information about the characteristics of this previously undescribed language variety that may assist in the development of literacy and educational materials in Mali and elsewhere. Data collected on this language variety will also contribute to the field of linguistics by offering a systematic phonological description of an emergent Bamana variety that will establish a baseline for future comparative and descriptive work of other dialects and related Mande languages. Additional data illustrating processes of syllable complexification in Bamana may provide support for emerging theories about syllabic and prosodic phonology, while challenging the tenets of other theories. The results of this research should inform long-standing debates about various components of Bamana tonology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this award is being provided by the Linguistics Program in the Division of Behavioral &amp; Cognitive Sciences, and by the Africa, Near East, and South Asia Program in the Office of International Science &amp; Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
