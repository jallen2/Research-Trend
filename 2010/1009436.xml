    <AbstractNarration>As the study of pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) stars has developed, one overriding question has emerged: do they pulsate in high-degree modes where the number of nodal lines is greater than three? Models need to include such modes to account for the observed number of pulsations, but they are less likely to be observed because of geometric cancelation across the stellar surface. This has constrained the usefulness of the models for inferring the interior conditions of sdB stars. There is currently no answer to this controversial question about high-degree modes, but techniques such as multicolor photometry and time-series spectroscopy can be applied to provide that answer. To address these issues, this project will 1) obtain high-speed multicolor observations of at least six pulsating sdB stars; 2) obtain time-series spectroscopic data of at least two stars; 3) generate perturbed atmospheric models to interpret the observations; and 4) generate evolutionary models to match constrained modes and test the physics within sdB stars. Multicolor photometry is especially sensitive to high-degree modes, yet can be obtained from modest-sized telescopes. This work will critically test the current generation of models by determining if the predicted high-degree modes exist, and will produce models incorporating the latest theories to match the observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing the accuracy of sdB models will increase understanding of the cores inside most horizontal branch stars, and mass constraints will test evolution scenarios. The research involves undergraduate students, who will obtain, reduce, and analyze data and disseminate the results at conferences and in papers.</AbstractNarration>
