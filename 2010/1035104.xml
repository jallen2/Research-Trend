    <AbstractNarration>The University of Arizona Science Center, in collaboration with the School of Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, is constructing a set of interactive exhibit displays and complementary programs that increase public literacy in the Earth sciences. The Sky Islands are the archipelago of mountain ranges in a sea of desert basins. The project engages visitors, both general audiences and school groups, in hands-on, inquiry-based and contributory activities that increase their understanding of the distinctive atmospheric, geologic and environmental conditions that make up the Sky Island region. "Sky Islands" illustrates the Earth science processes that contribute to the biodiversity of the Sky Island region, and demonstrates how human interactions affect the system. The programs and displays bring University of Arizona researchers and the general public together, providing an opportunity to translate research findings to a lay audience and bring practical meaning and relevance to local residents as well as tourists. The incorporation of undergraduate students into the development and delivery of the exhibits and programs provides students with a real-world experience not often available in a university setting. This is a new approach to building science center exhibits and displays. The University of Arizona Science Center is also developing a set of innovative, reliable, open source exhibit templates that allow for inexpensive and immediately updateable modes of interaction and content to keep exhibits relevant and increase their lifespan. The exhibits also use recognition technologies to identify users, communicate among exhibit components, and personalize the exhibit experience. These exhibit templates bring a more cost-effective approach to exhibit-building to the science center and museum communities.</AbstractNarration>
