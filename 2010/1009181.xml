    <AbstractNarration>Calderer&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009181&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This GOALI project supports a collaboration between&lt;br/&gt;investigators at the University of Minnesota and at Medtronic,&lt;br/&gt;Inc. To improve the design of implantable medical devices, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and her colleagues develop fundamental understanding&lt;br/&gt;of, and modeling tools for, polymer and solvent interactions that&lt;br/&gt;result in swelling of the polymer. Many implantable devices&lt;br/&gt;consist of plastic and metal components that are affixed to each&lt;br/&gt;other by adhesives. When such a device is placed in the human&lt;br/&gt;body, the plastic parts, made from polymer, interact with the&lt;br/&gt;surrounding fluid and swell, while the metal parts are not&lt;br/&gt;affected by the fluid. The consequent swelling mismatch causes a&lt;br/&gt;high stress at the interface, which can lead to deformation of&lt;br/&gt;the components and, if interfacial shear stresses exceed critical&lt;br/&gt;values guaranteed by the adhesive manufacturer, to interface&lt;br/&gt;delamination. Deformation and delamination can cause devices to&lt;br/&gt;fail. The ability to model the behavior of the components is&lt;br/&gt;critical in the design of implantable medical devices, such as&lt;br/&gt;defibrillators, pacemakers, and neurological devices. This&lt;br/&gt;project addresses the questions:&lt;br/&gt; (1) How does polymer swelling proceed without polymer chain&lt;br/&gt;relaxation? (Only elasticity is accounted for, and viscous&lt;br/&gt;effects are neglected.) &lt;br/&gt; (2) How does swelling proceed when polymer chains relax within&lt;br/&gt;the same time frame?&lt;br/&gt; (3) How does swelling proceed if there is mechanical strain&lt;br/&gt;applied to the sample?&lt;br/&gt; (4) How does swelling proceed if two samples made of the same&lt;br/&gt;polymer but with different initial swelling are bonded together?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many polymers can absorb an amount of water equivalent to&lt;br/&gt;about 1 percent of their own weights; hydrogel can absorb water&lt;br/&gt;many times its own volume. Swelling of polymers occurs in many&lt;br/&gt;applications, particularly in implantable biomedical devices,&lt;br/&gt;made of metal and plastic polymer components, that typically are&lt;br/&gt;buried in wet tissue. Polymers can relax mechanical loading and&lt;br/&gt;deformation over time due to viscoelastic properties. &lt;br/&gt;Swelling-induced stress or size changes can relax as well. The&lt;br/&gt;actual stress and geometric changes in polymers are determined by&lt;br/&gt;the combined relaxation and swelling process. Each of these&lt;br/&gt;processes is related to water diffusion, polymer chain motion,&lt;br/&gt;and water-polymer interactions. Estimation of these processes&lt;br/&gt;and interactions is critical for understanding swelling-induced&lt;br/&gt;deformation, delamination, and stability, key factors in the&lt;br/&gt;design and quality control of medical devices. Building on an&lt;br/&gt;existing collaboration between Medtronic Inc and the University&lt;br/&gt;of Minnesota, the investigator and her colleagues develop&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models, analysis, and computational and&lt;br/&gt;visualization tools to improve fundamental understanding of&lt;br/&gt;polymer and solvent interactions; the tools can be used to&lt;br/&gt;identify unsuitable polymers and so reduce the number of&lt;br/&gt;laboratory experiments performed by polymer scientists at&lt;br/&gt;Medtronic by more than half. Students and postdocs are part of&lt;br/&gt;the project, which also includes seminars, workshops, and&lt;br/&gt;outreach activities sponsored jointly with Medtronic.</AbstractNarration>
