    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit of the proposed activity: &lt;br/&gt;Signal amplification remains a major engineering challenge in the field of bioelectronics and microelectronics. With the wide spread use of mobile devices it is universally realized that amplifier performance remains inhibited in many circumstances in which the incoming signal strength is weak making performance unacceptable. A number of engineering solutions have been offered and each of them has their own limitations. The objective of this proposal is to explore a novel approach for fabrication and device evaluation of a signal amplifier operable at acoustic frequencies (20 Hz - 20 kHz) such as in human hearing-aid devices. The PIs propose to adopt a non-conservative approach to attain the objective by using the integrated structures consisting of films of non-classical semiconductor materials (such as modified iron-titanate) on buffered silicon substrates. Studies of their current-voltage characteristics under the influence of an external electric field provided by a gate oxide will lead to the development of reliable and novel microelectronic signal boosters. The approach described herein offers a novel and completely non-conservative approach for fabricating and evaluating a signal amplifier having many applications including in bio-electronics. The proposed solution, methodology, and materials selection pose challenges that could culminate in fulfillment of intellectual curiosity and technical success. Should this approach become successful it will be a paradigm-shifting contribution to the very nature of microelectronic technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the proposed activity: &lt;br/&gt;This research will have broader impact on the education of engineering students, directly impact the field of microelectronics and radiation-hard electronics and might open a new product line for dual-use electronics market. The PIs will make special efforts to recruit female and Hispanic students, both graduate and undergraduate, in this research and thereby will open to them an opportunity for life-long learning in a highly technical field. In support of training the students for the research outlined here, the PIs will offer a special topic course on Electroceramics in Fall Semester 2010. Wide dissemination of the obtained results by publishing and presenting lectures at national and international conferences will be another example of its broader impact. A multiyear research program is envisioned at this stage if this exploratory research proves encouraging.</AbstractNarration>
