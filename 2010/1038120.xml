    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a U.S.-Japan workshop and follow up research visits on the theme of ?Connections??i.e. building and deepening research networks on cutting edge research topics among female researchers at the mid-career level. The workshop, to be held in summer 2010 at Japan?s National Women?s Education Center (NWEC), informally builds on a February 2009 U.S.-Japan Round Table on Women in Science and Engineering at Hokkaido University. This award builds on the earlier exchange among female researchers with an explicit focus on research network development. Dr. Mitiko Go, Executive Director of the Research Organization for Information and Systems, and Ms. Maki Kubo, Vice President of NWEC, serve as Japanese organizers of the Connections program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will bring together roughly 30 women scientists?15 each from the U.S. and Japan?whose achievements already show the promise that their work will have major impacts on their fields of study. Participants will be researchers who have expertise in emerging areas and who are interested in ways to broaden their approach through new collaborations and by learning new concepts, approaches and technologies. Participation in the meeting will be by invitation ? and selection will be based on the likelihood of attendance leading to valuable long term connections. Consistent with the ?Connections? theme, U.S. participants will be strongly encouraged to spend up to four days in Japan after the workshop for research visits related to new or existing research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program aims to promote new research collaborations and new research directions by giving a small, select group the opportunity to meet and explore ways that new tools and technological advances allow different ways of looking at the big questions of science and engineering. Another goal is to help the participants develop as leaders in their fields by improving their professional networks and providing them with the opportunity to meet established women in leadership roles.</AbstractNarration>
