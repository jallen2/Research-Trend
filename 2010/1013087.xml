    <AbstractNarration>This workshop brings together EPSCoR leaders and other educators for three days in Little Rock, AR, to share information about successful educational models, explore potential collaborations for new educational outreach programs, and learn about emerging opportunities for supporting new educational outreach occurring across the US, to increase collaborations among NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) educational efforts, and to explore ways to develop a well-prepared, STEM-enabled workforce. The workshop is driven by three primary objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To share information among NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions on both key elements and common characteristics of successful educational models;&lt;br/&gt;2. To explore areas for potential collaboration, replication, or modification for new education outreach programs in ESPCoR jurisdictions;&lt;br/&gt;3. To learn about emerging opportunities across NSF directorates for supporting new educational models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will explore strategies for engaging students from underrepresented populations, increasing the curriculum content and resources for teachers in STEM education, and engaging more US students in STEM careers. This workshop will also examine the common characteristics of successful educational outreach programs and identify the unique special characteristics that make them suited to the particular region, talent pool, or special needs of the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Projects have a high level of education, diversity, and external engagement activities. Each EPSCoR jurisdiction is working to implement diversity, outreach, STEM education activities and engage their respective jurisdictional communities in science education. This workshop represents an opportunity for EPSCoR jurisdictions to outreach to other EPSCoR jurisdictions and share and educate them on what they have learned and accomplished by sharing best practices. Participants will learn how to more effectively educate students in STEM and positively impact the quality of the science education of the students in their institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The PI and leadership team are committed to maintaining online resources for education and outreach activities. The organizers have also committed to follow-ups that will track the workshop impact and outcomes to ensure broader impact. Special emphasis is proposed to go into inclusion of both presenters and projects that are excellent examples of programs that broaden representation of gender, ethnicity, disability and multi-geographic regions.</AbstractNarration>
