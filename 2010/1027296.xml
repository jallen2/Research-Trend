    <AbstractNarration>The postdoctoral candidate in this case expects to soon earn her PhD from Montana State University. In collaboration with senior scientists at the University of California at Berkeley, this postdoc will use methodologies from her ongoing PhD thesis to study small solar flares that are associated with major coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using the new Minimum Current Corona (MCC) model. She will use sequences of solar magnetograms showing the photospheric magnetic field evolution of a wide variety of flare and CME events to build three-dimensional topological coronal field models that will be analyzed with the MCC model. The postdoc's goal is to test the ability of the MCC model to accurately and quantitatively predict the energy and helicity of a wide variety of eruptive solar events. She has chosen to work with the team at Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory because of their experience and significant contributions to research on interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer notes that a quantitative physical understanding of the relationship between solar eruptions and ICMEs will improve space weather forecasts. This effort will therefore ultimately lead to advance warning of adverse space weather impacts and to better protection for satellite communications, navigation, and long-distance power distribution systems. This postdoctoral fellowship will broaden the representation of females in solar physics and enhance collaborations between the research groups at UC Berkeley and Montana State University.</AbstractNarration>
