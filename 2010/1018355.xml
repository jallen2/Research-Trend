    <AbstractNarration>Desktop computers run many different applications, the&lt;br/&gt;compromise of any one of which can compromise the entire desktop given&lt;br/&gt;the lack of isolation among applications. Recovering a compromised&lt;br/&gt;desktop remains a time consuming task, which typically requires wiping&lt;br/&gt;everything and reinstalling the system from scratch. These &lt;br/&gt;security issues pose fundamental challenges as desktop computers are&lt;br/&gt;relied on for everything from financial transactions to&lt;br/&gt;medical records. To address these problems, we are creating novel&lt;br/&gt;virtual layered file system (VLFS) technologies to improve system &lt;br/&gt;security. Unlike a traditional file system which is a monolithic &lt;br/&gt;entity, a VLFS dynamically composes together a set of software layers&lt;br/&gt;into a single file system view for a desktop. Changes to one layer&lt;br/&gt;are isolated and decoupled from changes to another. The VLFS dynamic&lt;br/&gt;composition feature enables powerful and easy-to-use security&lt;br/&gt;functionality. We are using VLFSes to build an architecture to enable&lt;br/&gt;security patches to be deployed effectively when managing large&lt;br/&gt;numbers of heterogeneously configured machines, and to speed system&lt;br/&gt;recovery from security exploits. We are also using VLFSes to develop&lt;br/&gt;a transparent desktop application fault containment architecture that&lt;br/&gt;is effective at limiting the damage from exploits to enable quick&lt;br/&gt;recovery while being as easy to use as a traditional desktop system.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this proposal will provide a foundation for future&lt;br/&gt;computer innovations to provide improved system security for users'&lt;br/&gt;systems. Because we are working with industry-standard operating&lt;br/&gt;systems and binary application and patch distributions, our results&lt;br/&gt;will be directly applicable to the commercial world.</AbstractNarration>
