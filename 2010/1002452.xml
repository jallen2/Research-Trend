    <AbstractNarration>On 29 September 2009 an earthquake located some 120 miles southwest of Tutuila Island in the Tonga Trench generated a tsunami. In less than 15 minutes, tsunami waves up to 30 feet high slammed into Samoa. More than thirty people on Tutuila lost their lives and there was widespread destruction of homes, businesses, and infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tsunami waves also scoured shorelines and streams, exposing archaeological remains. With National Science Foundation support though the RAPID competition, Dr. David Addison of the American Samoa Community College's Samoan Studies Institute and a team of graduate and undergraduate students will document archaeological sites exposed by the tsunami. The team will also incorporate community members as part of the Samoan Studies Institute's community outreach and education program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there has been active archaeological work in American Samoa for three decades, the location and distribution of coastal and low-lying sites is poorly understood. One reason for this is that these sites are often covered by later material, or beach dunes. Recording these sites now while they are visible will allow future researchers to investigate them more fully, thereby providing a better understanding of Samoan culture history and processes. Data from these sites can also contribute to understanding dynamics in the prehistory of the region as well as addressing broader methodological issues in archaeology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the direction of PI Addison, the graduate students will lead teams composed of American Samoa Community College archaeology and Samoan Studies students and community members. Teams will walk Tutuila's coastline and nearshore streams and record and sample exposed archaeological sites. Local publicity during the project will increase community awareness of Samoa's rich archaeological heritage thereby enhancing Territorial site-preservation efforts and local enthusiasm for archaeology. Project results will be quickly published as Google Earth layers for worldwide access by researchers as well as Samoans both locally and in diaspora. Print results will be published by the Samoan Studies Institute and in academic journal papers.</AbstractNarration>
