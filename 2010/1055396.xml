    <AbstractNarration>Trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in surface and groundwater present human and ecological health concerns at parts-per-trillion concentrations. Recent water surveys have revealed that TOrC contamination is widespread, and this threat to potable water is expected to grow through increased demands on finite water supplies in arid regions. Since remediation of contaminated waters is challenging and expensive, the goal of this research is to gain a fundamental understanding of how microbial stress can impact the natural degradation of TOrCs. Results from this study should have application to treatment in managed natural systems. Objectives of this research plan are to A) determine the correlation between enzyme expression, microbial stress, and TOrC degradation using nitrosamines as a model compound, B) explore the relevance of these findings toward indigenous microbial assemblages in soil barriers and C) investigate the broader role of microbial stress in biodegradation of other TOrCs. Objectives will be addressed through a suite of interdisciplinary experiments that will be scaled from fundamental pure strain studies to more heterogeneous and biodiverse soil systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impacts, research efforts will be coupled with an educational plan designed to increase the engagement and diversity of students in environmental science and engineering. The objectives of the educational plan are to improve learning outcomes of undergraduate environmental engineering students through ?client? interactions with a local nonprofit watershed group and to deliver modules that engage at-risk middle school students with K-12 teachers and scientific researchers in projects relating to environmental water quality. A nontraditional, field-based undergraduate course that focuses on the assessment and remediation of abandoned mining operations will enable students to become involved in solutions to regional environmental problems and see the implementation of their findings. Similarly, interactive K-12 teacher-driven modules will engage at-risk youth with collegiate researchers while integrating regional water quality themes into curricular requirements. Student tracking and a multi-faceted assessment of educational activities that involve students, instructors, external educators, and nonprofit organizations will be conducted. Advancing our fundamental understanding of the biodegradation of TOrCs benefits society by furthering the development of a new generation of managed natural treatment technologies. This work may lead to novel processes for the enhancement of natural biodegradation of extremely low concentrations of organic pollutants.</AbstractNarration>
