    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research program is to develop solution methods for&lt;br/&gt;solving magneto-hydrodynamics flows in three-dimensional domains comprising conducting&lt;br/&gt;and nonconducting regions and variable/discontinuous magnetic&lt;br/&gt;permeability. The method to be developed will be robust enough to&lt;br/&gt;handle High Reynolds flows and high Prandtl numbers. Lagrange finite elements &lt;br/&gt;will be used and novel mathematical formulations will be developed&lt;br/&gt;to make Lagrange finite elements to converge&lt;br/&gt;in non-smooth domains and with non-smooth interfaces. &lt;br/&gt;The code to be developed will be fully parallel.&lt;br/&gt;The applications targeted&lt;br/&gt;are the geodynamo, sea-water/oil separation and liquid metal flows.&lt;br/&gt;The solution strategy to be developed will be&lt;br/&gt;flexible enough so as to be easily modifiable to simulate plasma flows&lt;br/&gt;in Tokamak geometries and thus to contribute to the ongoing global&lt;br/&gt;international effort on magnetic confinement of plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the research program is to propose and analyze new&lt;br/&gt;numerical strategies for simulating three-dimensional fluid flows&lt;br/&gt;interacting with electromagnetic fields in heterogeneous media at high&lt;br/&gt;speed. One phenomenon of interest is the so-called fluid dynamo&lt;br/&gt;effect. The dynamo phenomenon arises in astrophysics. It is&lt;br/&gt;responsible for the magnetic fields that are observed around stars and&lt;br/&gt;planets with liquid cores. This phenomenon arises also in experimental&lt;br/&gt;setups aiming at reproducing the dynamo effect. The fluid may be&lt;br/&gt;plasma in stars and in tokamaks, molten iron in planets, or liquid&lt;br/&gt;gallium or sodium in experimental setups. The dynamo effect may have&lt;br/&gt;undesired consequence on heat extraction processes from fast breeder&lt;br/&gt;reactors. This research will also prepare the ground for further&lt;br/&gt;developments on plasma flows in Tokamak geometries. This research&lt;br/&gt;project will involve large scale parallel computing and will lead to new&lt;br/&gt;numerical strategies to simulate high speed flows interacting with&lt;br/&gt;magnetic fields.</AbstractNarration>
