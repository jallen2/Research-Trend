    <AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors are undergoing a three year-long major upgrade. The new Advanced LIGO will significantly improve the sensitivity of the initial LIGO experiment and increase scientists' chances of directly observing the ``ripples in space-time'' first predicted by Albert Einstein almost a century ago. Advanced LIGO is expected to open a new exciting window on the Universe, heralding the beginning of gravitational-wave astronomy as a revolutionary, new observational field. This award provides support for the LIGO group at the University of Mississippi. Mississippi researchers will contribute to the Advanced LIGO endeavor in the areas of detector characterization, data analysis and public outreach. Detector characterization and data analysis activities will focus on research and development of new tools and methods for use in Advanced LIGO gravitational-wave searches. New innovative outreach programs related to gravitational-wave astronomy and fundamental science will inspire the wonder and beauty of science among the general public in Mississippi and nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities funded through this award will significantly contribute to the main goals of Advanced LIGO: i) make the first detection of gravitational waves and ii) move into a phase where gravitational-wave signals will be used for routine astronomical observations and for testing the fundamental nature of gravitation. This project will increase training and mentoring opportunities for Mississippi students and young researchers, as well as expand public outreach opportunities in the region. In addition to bringing the excitement of science to the general public, the outreach activities will promote diversity and engagement of students from traditionally underrepresented populations through a program of visits of women and minority speakers to Mississippi's educational institutions.</AbstractNarration>
