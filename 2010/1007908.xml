    <AbstractNarration>Vainchtein&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1007908&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project focuses on development and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;physically-motivated models of materials undergoing martensitic&lt;br/&gt;phase transition, a diffusionless deformation of a crystal&lt;br/&gt;lattice from the high-symmetry parent austenite phase to the&lt;br/&gt;low-symmetry martensite phase, which can exist in several&lt;br/&gt;symmetry-related twin variants. Under mechanical or thermal&lt;br/&gt;loading, these materials form finely layered twinning&lt;br/&gt;microstructures. The unique properties of martensites, such as&lt;br/&gt;their ability to accommodate large deformations and the marked&lt;br/&gt;hysteresis they exhibit under cyclic loading, are determined by&lt;br/&gt;the kinetics of phase and twin boundaries. Understanding how&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of the interfaces depends on their orientation,&lt;br/&gt;microstructural configuration, and properties of the crystal&lt;br/&gt;lattice involves challenging open problems in modeling of&lt;br/&gt;martensites. The project seeks to advance the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;these phenomena from the perspective of mesoscopic lattice&lt;br/&gt;models. Building on her prior work, the investigator focuses on&lt;br/&gt;several prototypical discrete models with the goal of capturing&lt;br/&gt;the essential features of interface kinetics and microstructure&lt;br/&gt;evolution and an emphasis on higher-dimensional phenomena and&lt;br/&gt;rate effects. The main ingredients of the models are nonconvex&lt;br/&gt;interactions between nearest neighbors allowing for the existence&lt;br/&gt;of two stable homogeneous states and the long-range interactions. &lt;br/&gt;Among the outcomes of this project are prediction of nucleated&lt;br/&gt;microstructural patterns and derivation of interfacial kinetic&lt;br/&gt;laws that can be used to solve problems involving temporal and&lt;br/&gt;spatial inhomogeneities. The results are compared to&lt;br/&gt;experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By focusing on the interface kinetics, this project helps&lt;br/&gt;determine how the dissipative properties of martensites and&lt;br/&gt;related active materials depend on the material structure and the&lt;br/&gt;loading conditions. This is important in emerging civil,&lt;br/&gt;aerospace and industrial applications that require significant&lt;br/&gt;passive damping, such as damage and vibration control in&lt;br/&gt;composite structures and attenuation of earthquake- and&lt;br/&gt;wind-induced vibrations in buildings and bridges. Results of&lt;br/&gt;this project may also help design new materials with desired&lt;br/&gt;properties. Mathematical methods developed during the project&lt;br/&gt;can be used to solve similar problems encountered in dislocation&lt;br/&gt;theory, fracture mechanics, DNA modeling, image recognition, and&lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis. The broader impacts of this program are also&lt;br/&gt;achieved through training of graduate and undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;in an interdisciplinary research program, as well as educational&lt;br/&gt;and high-school outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
