    <AbstractNarration>The geochronologic record of detrital minerals in ancient and modern sediments is used to study Earth history and tectonometamorphic processes. In many cases, detrital minerals in sediments represent the only preserved record of long since eroded mountains and continental fragments. However, the available detrital mineral geochronologic archive has important limitations including, importantly, the ability for these minerals to directly constrain tectonic (i.e. mountain building and subduction) processes. This project pioneers the use of detrital garnet Samarium-Neodymium (Sm-Nd) geochronology as a brand new window into Earth?s tectonic past. Garnets grow in response to prograde metamorphism and record the formative portions of mountain building events (typically related to continental collision) that can be completely missed in the currently dateable detrital mineral archive. Furthermore, by analyzing the well-understood chemistry of a garnet grain, it is possible to place its age into a specific pressure-temperature range and tectonic context wherein it grew (e.g. subduction zone, regional, or contact metamorphism). The goal of this project is to explore, define, and push the limits on sample size and precision attainable by streamlining existing analytical and sample preparation methods developed over the past several years for application to single grain detrital garnet age dating. The method will be tested using samples collected from New England as well as well-studied detrital mineral suites from three diverse field settings, each with its own set of potential future research applications: 1. Archean sediments such as the Jack Hills conglomerate; 2. Paleozoic orogenic sandstones eroding the classic Barrovian type-locality in Scotland; 3. modern stream sediments draining the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By developing and utilizing an archive of ancient detrital garnet ages (and their mineral chemistry) there is the potential to tap the very oldest direct record of tectonometamorphic processes on the planet, explore global age clusters of mountain building events to test inferences about the pace of global continental growth drawn from other detrital mineral age populations, and address regional scale questions involving the onset, progression, and episodicity of prograde metamorphism throughout a mountain building event.</AbstractNarration>
