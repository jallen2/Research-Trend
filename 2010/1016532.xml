    <AbstractNarration>Reliability is extremely important for some software and hardware &lt;br/&gt;applications. One approach is to use a programming language with a &lt;br/&gt;mechanized logic---a so-called theorem-prover---to prove theorems that &lt;br/&gt;establish some critical behavioral characteristics. Among theorem-provers, &lt;br/&gt;ACL2 has found use with several industrial suppliers of high assurance &lt;br/&gt;software and hardware. ACL2 does not support component-oriented software &lt;br/&gt;development, however, making it difficult to use with large and complex &lt;br/&gt;projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project has three goals: to add a pragmatic module system to &lt;br/&gt;ACL2; to equip it with a hygienic macro system; and to investigate a type &lt;br/&gt;system that accommodates ACL2's programming idioms. The project team &lt;br/&gt;employs a cyclic, three-step exploration method. The first step is to &lt;br/&gt;adapt constructs from existing, similar languages to ACL2, especially a &lt;br/&gt;logical meaning consistent with the theorem prover of ACL2. The second &lt;br/&gt;step is to explore the pragmatics of the design with a wide range of &lt;br/&gt;examples. The third step is to add implementations to a pedagogic, &lt;br/&gt;interactive development environment for ACL2 and to evaluate their &lt;br/&gt;usefulness in software engineering courses. The results of this last step &lt;br/&gt;are used to re-start the cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will contribute to the dissemination of theorem provers in &lt;br/&gt;classrooms and industry. The research team expects to expose college &lt;br/&gt;students to the use of theorem proving in the design and development of &lt;br/&gt;complex systems with dozens, and possibly hundreds, of reliable &lt;br/&gt;components. The team also hopes to improve the ability of industrial ACL2 &lt;br/&gt;programmers to tackle complex component-oriented systems.</AbstractNarration>
