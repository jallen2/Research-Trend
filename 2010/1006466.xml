    <AbstractNarration>Intra-campus Connectivity to Promote Environmental and Biological Research, Education and Outreach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EPS-1006466&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;Project Director: Karl V. Steiner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The State of Delaware is focusing on development of a "green economy", environmental sustainability and growth in human health and the life sciences business areas to re-establish economic vitality for the state. Over the last decade, Delaware has been focusing efforts on strengthening its traditional economic base of agriculture, chemicals, automotive manufacturing and financial services by developing more advanced knowledge-based technologies. A concerted effort over this period has built a credible life sciences sector in Delaware. There is also a growing awareness in Delaware, a low lying coastal state, of the adverse, pervasive impact of Global Climate Change, primarily through sea level rise and increased storm severity and frequency to the state. Delaware EPSCoR, through the Research Infrastructure Improvement programs (RII Track-I and Track-II and now RII C2), is strongly focused on the state's need to develop a sustainable environment, develop capabilities in life sciences and educate the state's diverse population in critical STEM career areas. Delaware EPSCoR has built a strong, integrated partnership among the state's leading institutions of higher education: the University of Delaware (UD), Delaware State University (DSU), Wesley College and Delaware Technical &amp; Community College (DTCC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The five-year goal of the RII Track-1 (EPS-0814251) discovery-based research program, which is directly impacted by this RII C2 proposal, is to build a globally competitive capability in environmental research, education and outreach. This capability, which requires a strong broadband cyberinfrastructure, will strengthen the state's capability to compete for and win large, multi-investigator grants and contribute to the development of a productive pipeline of future scientists and technologists as a base for knowledge-based prosperity in the state. The research is focused on understanding the important processes that occur in the Earth's Critical Zone, the heterogeneous, near-surface environment that sustains life on this planet. A major theme of this program, which integrates the capabilities of the partner institutions, is to determine and deploy cyber-enabled technology needed to sense environmental events and processes. This will provide important monitoring and predictive capabilities to enhance air and water quality, minimize ecosystem events like fish kills and algal blooms, and ultimately assist in adapting to global climate change at the local level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal is to add to the knowledge base of environmental and biological science and move Delaware towards a sustainable environment. The improved cyberconnectivity and broader use of data-intensive scientific knowledge facilitates the creation of a broad, statewide community of stakeholders, encompassing government, academia, private sector and the public. Major socio-economic problems (e.g. global climate change) will have an enriched scientific base from which to develop the ensuing policy decisions. The development of a demographically and geographically diverse educational pipeline of well-trained scientists and technologists will contribute significantly to the competitiveness and prosperity of the state. A new cyber-assisted education outreach partnership with the Delaware Nature Society enhances delivery of environmental education to a large urban population in Wilmington, Delaware's largest urban center with a high percentage of underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
