    <AbstractNarration>In recent years there is a very intensive research activity in areas of Mathematics related to the so called Grothendieck's anabelian program, where some of the outstanding open problems are the section conjecture and its implications in arithmetic geometry, the description of the Galois structure of number fields via the arithmetic action on (geometric) fundamental groups, and the profinite Teichmueller theory and its relation to Arithmetic and Number Theory. Naturally, one of the major effort in this area of mathematics is to understand the bigger picture of Grothendieck's anabelian program in the context of Algebra and Number Theory. The half year long NAG Programme at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge, UK, in July-December 2009, was dedicated to this circle of questions and turned out to be a very successful activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the present conference funding Proposal, the PI facilitates the participation of American scientists (grad students and junior/senior researchers) to a two part mathematical research activity in Kyoto, Japan, during October 20-30, 2010, which could be viewed as a continuation of the NAG Programme. The wide majority of the participants to the Kyoto activity come from Europe and Japan. The first part of the activity is of introductory nature and will host several talks and special activities for graduate students and young researchers, thus enhancing training and technological understanding, whereas the second part of the activity will do both: First, present of wide picture of the state of the art of Grothendieck's anabelian program through a series of survey talks by world leading experts in respective related areas of research. Second, give junior and senior scientists the opportunity to present their newest findings and ideas in this area of research. Thus the activity will contribute to creating a broad basis for international cooperation, training, and scientific exchange at all levels. The outcomes of the activity will be disseminated to the mathematical community via the Internet and a proceedings volume to be published by the Mathematical Society of Japan.</AbstractNarration>
