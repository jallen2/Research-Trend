    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to test the following two hypotheses: 1) the combined action of laser and waterjet will result in development of tensile stresses perpendicular to cutting path and propagation of cracks along cutting path during the two-dimensional cutting and 2) if the material removal mechanism were changed from thermal melt and evaporation (laser cutting) or material erosion (electrical discharge machining) to material separation through crack propagation, then smaller kerf; parallel walls; higher cutting speed and substantial energy savings can be attained in the machining of two-dimensional profiles of polycrystalline diamonds and polycrystalline cubic boron nitride over conventional machining processes. The project's approach is to test the hypotheses relies on fundamental fracture mechanics modeling and experiments to investigate controlled fracture of superhard materials due to thermal and chemical effects of laser heating and waterjet quenching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of the research activities will lead to a novel machining method for brittle materials along with a detailed understanding of the fundamental underpinnings behind this new process. This novel hybrid manufacturing process will have potential to offer high performance tools and dies for metal cutting and wire drawing industries respectively. Automotive, woodworking and other industries that use synthetic diamond tools would greatly benefit from this research. Education and outreach outcome will include training of graduate students in advanced manufacturing research, assimilation of the research outcomes into new course modules, the involvement of undergraduates from underrepresented groups in the research team and the dissemination of the research results through journal publications, conferences and industry visits and workshops.</AbstractNarration>
