    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Andre Kutateladze of the University of Denver, for the development of new one-pot photo-protolytic oxametathesis reactions. The goal of this work is to use this type of photochemical reaction for what is known as "diversity-oriented synthesis," or DOS. The versatility and generality of this methodology will allow Dr. Kutateladze's group to access heretofore inaccessible carbon skeletons, giving rise to new organic molecules that can be rapidly screened for therapeutic activity. The work will also involve an innovative new method for rapid structure determination by NMR spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include the multidisciplinary training opportunities for students, from organic synthesis to photochemistry and photophysics. Potential applications for the synthesized molecules in biology and medicine include new drug discovery at more rapid pace. Undergraduate participation in this research will be year-round, and Dr. Kutateladze is making a significant effort to attract students from underrepresented groups to his laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
