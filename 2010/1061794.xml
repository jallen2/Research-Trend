    <AbstractNarration>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution proposes to take advantage of an off-the-shelf, commonly used Multicorer system developed by Ocean Instruments, Inc. (Model MC800) that is presently operated by at least six UNOLS operating institutions. This system would be integrated with WHOI-MISO deep-sea cameras, strobes, data transmission electronics, and basic water sampling and CTD capabilities to provide a more capable and comprehensive Multicorer capability for routine use on UNOLS vessels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
