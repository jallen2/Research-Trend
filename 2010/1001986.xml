    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop methods to characterize and control edge scattering in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The approach is (i) to optimize patterning of narrow-width GNRs, (ii) characterize size-effect in narrow-width GNRs, and (iii) reduce edge scattering by using a combination of surface and edge chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Graphene has been found to have a variety of interesting and superior properties suitable for post-CMOS nanoelectronics. Long mean free paths and very high mobility have been demonstrated in large-area graphene. With dimensional scaling, edge scattering in GNRs leads to a significant degradation in carrier transport, it was recently demonstrated by the proposing principal investigators that edge scattering sets in at widths of around 60 nm. Extending the superior properties of graphene to GNRs is important for a number of nanoelectronics applications since it allows for fast switching, quantum coherent devices, and high device density. The techniques proposed in this work will hasten the implementation of graphene for various charge-based as well as alternative state variable switches and interconnects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Education will be an important component of the proposed work the PIs regularly involve undergraduates and minorities in their research as part of summer internship programs. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this research will get trained on advanced fabrication and characterization techniques. The PIs' also involve a number of teachers as part of research experience for teachers (RET) programs. The PIs' labs are a regular part of tours to middle- and high-school children.</AbstractNarration>
