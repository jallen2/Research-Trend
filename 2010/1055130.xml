    <AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to advance the idea of "bifocal modeling" to promote understanding of how and why things work. In bifocal modeling, learners build a model of a device or phenomenon in the real world and attach sensors to it, and they build a virtual model (on the computer) of the same device or phenomenon using one of several modeling platforms. They run both models, and explore and investigate the function and behavior of the device or phenomenon using both models. The approach is designed to help learners construct explanatory mental models of phenomena and devices they encounter. The need to reconcile the differences between the models focuses learners on details they might not have noticed if working with just one model. As they engage in bifocal modeling activities, learners encounter issues concerning the purpose and veracity of models, human error, sensors, and science practice. Thus, in addition to facilitating learning of the science behind the phenomenon they are exploring, learners have opportunities to learn about the roles of models in science and how to design, construct, and use models scientifically. Engaging for a sustained period of time is necessary for such learning, and the approach has learners engage in bifocal modeling in the context of exploring phenomena and devices that they have grown curious about in the context of science or technology activities. The approach has potential to be used in school or out of school, and it might be used to cover targeted science or to supplement classroom activities. The project has phases that include investigating the efficacy and feasibility of bifocal modeling in a variety of circumstances, identifying the ways it might be productively used in school and to supplement school, understanding how learning happens when learning in the context of bifocal modeling, iteratively designing curriculum modules based on findings (and testing them), and iteratively refining the software and hardware that goes with those curriculum models so as to come to better understand of how to use them to promote learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work has potential to help young people (and perhaps others) learn the science behind phenomena of interest and become better scientific reasoners. Citizens who understand the roles of models in science and who can design, construct, and/or use them to reason scientifically will be able to take part in the discussions of our democracy and be ready to prepare for scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>
