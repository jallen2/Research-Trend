    <AbstractNarration>Developmental biology has a central place in the life sciences. By focusing on the study of whole organisms using a wide variety of approaches and technologies, the field has contributed significantly to our understanding of the common processes that regulate the development of life on our planet. Over the last decade, developmental biologists have made significant, Nobel-prize winning, discoveries in aging and in the control of cell death (Nobel 2002). They have worked out the mechanisms by which small RNAs turn genes on or off (Nobel 2006 and Lasker award in 2008) and have driven the development of new techniques; for example gene replacement in mammals (Nobel 2007) and the ability to see proteins in living cells (Nobel 2008). The 2010 Santa Cruz Developmental Biology (SCDB) meeting provides a forum for developmental biologists working at a variety of levels and using a wide range of experimental subjects to come together under the theme of 'Diverse strategies in Development'. Here, researchers can learn about the newest major breakthroughs and how these can further accelerate their progress in fields under the umbrella of developmental biology. Over 150 developmental biologists are expected to attend the SCDB meeting at University of California, Santa Cruz from June 30th--July 3rd, 2010 to discuss recent progress, to exchange ideas and to educate both the current leaders in the field and upcoming researchers and students. Due to the high visibility and quality of the invited speakers participating in this endeavor and the small size of the meeting, the SCDB provides unprecedented opportunities for interactions between established and young scientists. The conference program is well balanced to promote participation of women and members of groups traditionally underrepresented in science.</AbstractNarration>
