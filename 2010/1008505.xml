    <AbstractNarration>Organic chemists rely heavily on physical models of molecules, so it not surprising that models are also commonly employed to help teach organic chemistry. It has been assumed that when undergraduate students work with these models, ability to construct an internal representation of the molecular structures is enhanced. But few studies have examined this directly and empirically. In addition, virtual models (3-D computer visualizations) have replaced concrete models as powerful computers become available, inviting comparison between learning with real and virtual models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara and the University of Maryland will conduct a series studies to examine how undergraduate organic chemistry students use models to advance their understanding of molecular structures that require visualizations in three dimensions. This study investigates the benefits of students' use of concrete or virtual models, asking:&lt;br/&gt;- Does model use improve students? ability to translate between different&lt;br/&gt; representations of molecular representations?&lt;br/&gt;- What aspects of models are most effective for representation translation?&lt;br/&gt;- Does instruction in model use alter the frequency and quality of model use?&lt;br/&gt;- Do models support students of low spatial ability more or less effectively than students of high spatial ability?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study uses experimental methods to systematically explore the uses of both concrete and virtual models in promoting meaningful learning in organic chemistry in a series of studies set in the controlled environment of the psychology lab. An important dependent variable for this study measures students' ability to translate between alternative diagrammatic representations of molecules. This is an essential skill that all students of organic chemistry must master. Measures include accuracy of the representations that students produce in representational translation and students' interactions (including gestures) with the concrete and virtual models during task performance. The study also tests its emergent theory of model use in university classroom settings by comparing the performance of undergraduates who are trained to use models with those who have had no such training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is important because it systematically studies model use in organic chemistry. If students learn to use models more effectively, then they may find more success in undergraduate organic chemistry, a gatekeeper course for advanced STEM professions. The ability to visualize molecules may be especially challenging for students with low spatial abilities, and the deliberate training in model use may allow more students to not only pass organic chemistry, but stimulate their ability to use models in eventual STEM professions. This study should result in a better understanding of the effectiveness and appropriateness of concrete and virtual models for enhancing student learning in chemistry and new instructional activities for use in chemistry classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
