    <AbstractNarration>Increases in the number of cores in multicore processors have lead to&lt;br/&gt;increases in the architectural and environmental diversity present in&lt;br/&gt;computer systems: the number, complexity, and mix of available cores&lt;br/&gt;vary greatly and the resources allocated to an application differ from&lt;br/&gt;run-to-run and within runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diversity has a significant impact on application performance;&lt;br/&gt;applications must adapt to differences in their architecture and&lt;br/&gt;environment to achieve good performance. However, developing adaptive&lt;br/&gt;applications greatly increases the difficulty of writing efficient&lt;br/&gt;parallel programs while increasing the level of skill required to&lt;br/&gt;write a parallel application, and may therefore limit programmers'&lt;br/&gt;ability to write parallel applications and take full advantage of&lt;br/&gt;multicore processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops and disseminates new compilation techniques and&lt;br/&gt;runtime adaptation strategies in which a compiler analyzes the&lt;br/&gt;concurrency and locality features of an application, selects a runtime&lt;br/&gt;adaptation strategy based on these features, and adds adaptation to&lt;br/&gt;the application. Key contributions address the challenges of&lt;br/&gt;discovering and representing concurrency and locality and selecting&lt;br/&gt;adaptation strategies based upon application characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new compilation techniques and adaptation strategies will free&lt;br/&gt;programmers from the need to concern themselves with architectural and&lt;br/&gt;environmental diversity when writing parallel applications. This&lt;br/&gt;freedom will then enable a wide variety of applications to benefit&lt;br/&gt;from multicore processors, thus ensuring that multicore processor&lt;br/&gt;systems will be able to live up to users' increased performance&lt;br/&gt;expectations.</AbstractNarration>
