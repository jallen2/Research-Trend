    <AbstractNarration>AST-1009544/1008330/1009113&lt;br/&gt;Pitman/Hofmeister/Speck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the nature and formation of cosmic dust is crucial to our understanding of the Universe. The absorption, scattering, and re-emission of light by cosmic dust has a profound effect on the interpretation of observed spectral signatures and radiative transfer processes in a variety of astronomical objects. Dust is crucial to star formation processes, and understanding the dust at high redshift is vital to cosmological models and dark energy studies. To account properly for energy budgets in astrophysical environments requires an understanding of the physical properties of the dust, gained from several types of laboratory data: (1) absorbance spectra, which can be compared to observational spectra, and (2) reflectivity spectra, which may be used to derive (3) optical functions. However, quality laboratory data are not available for many of the compounds believed to exist in space, particularly at ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) wavelengths. This project will provide all three forms of UV-vis laboratory data for a suite of solid-state materials found in meteorites and in the condensation sequence. The major goals are: (1) Determine the spectral behavior of selected silicates, sulfides, oxides, glasses, and other materials that may be present in space; (2) Determine optical functions for these materials; and (3) Apply these data to outstanding questions in astronomy, and make all of the data available to the astronomical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will broaden the participation of under-represented groups and enhance the infrastructure for research and education. The synergistic, cross-disciplinary study involves scientists in astrophysics, mineral physics, and planetary science, using laboratory, observational, and theoretical modeling techniques. Laboratory fundamental research for astrophysics is at a critical stage and this work will train new U.S. researchers and students in this area, matching personnel with underutilized but available equipment. The female lead researchers are all strong role models for women in science, and have strong histories of public outreach and active mentorship of undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
