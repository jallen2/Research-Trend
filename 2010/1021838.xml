    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference on Molecular Genetics of Bacteria and Phages will be held August 24-28, 2010 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. This meeting is a central forum for the presentation of new results in bacterial molecular genetics. Approximately 250 participants will attend, representing laboratories throughout the world, and most attendees will present either short talks or posters. The breadth of the conference makes it an important focus for the exchange of information in this era of scientific specialization. Topics covered will include Molecular Evolution, Systems Biology &amp; Genomics, Development, Cell Signaling &amp; Cell-Cell Interactions, Mechanism &amp; Regulation of Transcription, Bacterial Metabolism &amp; Physiology, DNA Replication, Recombination &amp; Transposition, Translation &amp; Post-transcriptional Regulation, Bacteriophage Biology, Bacterial Cell Surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The meeting will provide an outstanding opportunity for participation by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and for those from underrepresented groups. For many, this is the first large meeting at which they have an opportunity to speak, and the highly interactive nature of the meeting allows these young scientists to meet and talk to the senior scientists they know from the literature. Thus, it plays a vital role in building scientific networks.</AbstractNarration>
