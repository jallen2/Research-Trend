    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will assess ocean acidification in the western Arctic Ocean, using ship time that is currently scheduled for annual mooring turnarounds in the Beaufort Sea. On these cruises, in September of 2011-2013, the investigators will collect samples for measurement of carbonate system parameters, inorganic nutrients, dissolved oxygen, oxygen isotopes, and oxygen/argon ratios, as well as continuous underway measurements of dissolved oxygen, oxygen/argon ratios, and pCO2. These data will be used to gain insights and perspectives into the extent of ocean acidification in the western Arctic Ocean; the key physical, chemical, and biological processes influencing the saturation states of aragonite and calcite; and potential impacts to pelagic and benthic communities. Water column observations will be synthesized with data from the associated NSF AON (Arctic Observing Network)-funded mooring, including temperature, salinity, nitrate, oxygen, pCO2, and pH, as well as carbon and hydrographic data collected on other cruises in the region. During each field season the PI will travel to several native villages to discuss the potential impacts of ocean acidification at town meetings and in classrooms. The work will contribute to carbon cycle studies coordinated under a variety of science plans and implementation structures that aim to establish accurate estimates of carbon budgets and fluxes and the underlying mechanisms that regulate them. A postdoctoral scientist will participate directly in this work, and results will be incorporated in one undergraduate level course and two graduate level courses taught by the lead investigator.</AbstractNarration>
