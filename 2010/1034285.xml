    <AbstractNarration>Kansas State University is awarded a grant to construct a 1,860 square-foot ranch-style house on the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS). KPBS is a 3,487 ha preserve managed by the Division of Biology at Kansas State University and dedicated to a three-fold mission of long-term ecological research, science education, and grassland conservation. The total number of publications attributed to KPBS is now over 1,300. KPBS is a premier site for grassland research and attracts a variety of researchers, University classes, artists, writers, and visitors from the general public every year. The house will contain a living room, five bedrooms, three private baths, fully-equipped kitchen, and laundry facilities and will increase the lodging capacity on KPBS by 62%. The facility will enable the station to support additional visiting scientists, accommodate the increasing numbers of larger inter-site research groups working on-site, and provide a wider range of low cost on-site lodging options for longer-term visitors. Researchers at KPBS have been leaders in various regional, national, and international research groups including NEON, LTER and STREON. The new addition will similarly enhance KPBS? ability to conduct outreach activities for K-12 and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KPBS benefits science and society by creating new knowledge, including policy-relevant research while providing opportunity and training for students. The extensive research efforts on KPBS are linked with numerous educational and training activities for students and developing scientists, from K-12 students to undergraduate/graduate students and post-doctoral scientists. In addition, KPBS reaches approximately 4,300 of the general public annually through its organized educational and outreach programs. The addition of this new facility will allow KPBS to continue to develop as a national and international resource for research and outreach on grassland ecology.</AbstractNarration>
