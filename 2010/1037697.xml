    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will combine case-based learning with problem-based learning using computer simulations in the field of construction engineering. The combination of these two pedagogies will be used to teach complex construction engineering systems in a "multidimensional virtual environment" in which students can visualize complex phenomena. The combination of these educational techniques may advance our knowledge of how to improve students' abilities in complex problems solving. The ability to visualize and solve complex problems is a key skill in many modern industrial settings and for engineering practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to demonstrate means of integrating complex problem solving with more traditional engineering curricula. The project plans call for broad dissemination of the computer-based visualization tool and associated engineering problems and case studies. The participating institutions draw heavily from Hispanic and rural populations, both of whom are under-represented in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
