    <AbstractNarration>Recognizing that nanoparticle generation may pose a risk to humans and environment, this grant will allow for the real-time measurement of airborne nanoparticles released from a manufacturing process to the workplace and environment. Additionally, the award will allow the team to use experiments and numerical modeling understand the transport characteristics of airborne nanoparticles. A new instrument developed by the team, the universal nanoparticle analyzer, will be used for online measurement of particle morphology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will be obtained on the effects of the particle morphology on nanoparticle fate and transport, which play an important role in estimation of the atmospheric lifetimes, determination of environmental fate and eventual bioavailability of nanoparticles. The method for morphology measurement developed here will find broad use for emission monitoring and risk assessment. Results will be disseminated by the PI in graduate courses and through NSF programs for public education of nanotechnology and its impact on society. ETH Zurich will be an international partner for this project.</AbstractNarration>
