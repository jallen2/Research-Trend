    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a Doctoral Colloquium (DC) at the 12th ACM International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp 2010) to be held September 26 - 29, 2010 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing is the premier outlet for novel research contributions that advance the state of the art in the design, development, deployment, evaluation and understanding of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) systems. The conference is a competitive and interdisciplinary venue of publishing and presenting research that spans and integrates pervasive, wireless, embedded, wearable and/or mobile technologies to bridge the gaps between the digital and physical worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual interaction with experts and peers will broaden the students? perspective about the future directions of research in a range of topics connected to Ubiquitous Computing. It will also enable the students to network with each other and with the experts. Finally, the focused attention and unique exposure given to the students will in and by itself draw and attract more students to work in the Ubiquitous Computing area. This should hopefully increase the number of graduates in this area, which should drive innovation and generate highly trained workforce working in field of Ubiquitous Computing.</AbstractNarration>
