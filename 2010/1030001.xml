    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium specifically addresses development of advanced and innovative characterization methods based on magnetic resonance that can (1) quantitatively address heterogeneity in multiple variables important to complex polymers and their composites, or stated differently, dynamic heterogeneity; (2) identify properties of individual components in mixed systems or on surfaces; (3) distinguish morphological differences, even in amorphous or network systems; (4) quantitatively reveal multiple length and time scales over a wide dynamic range for all components in complex macromolecular systems; and (5) apply these advances to practical and commercial polymer systems. Magnetic resonance continues to advance as a productive field that is capable of addressing all of the key points described above. Symposium organizers are Tetsuo Asakura, Alan English, H.N. Cheng, Fumitaka Horii, Peter Macdonald, Andrew Whittaker, Jeffery L. White, and Hans W. Spiess. Together, this body represents experts from academia and industry around the world. The symposium "Innovative NMR Strategies for Complex Macromolecular Systems" is organized with the belief that NMR-based methods will continue to become even more important to the macromolecular science community based on key advantages of non-destructive, real-time application to a burgeoning array of complex and hybrid structures and architectures, including but not limited to nanocomposites, biomacromolecular systems, active devices, and commercial materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pacifichem, which is an international conference organized by the American Chemical Society, Canadian Society for Chemistry, Chemical Society of Japan, New Zealand Institute of Chemistry, Royal Australian Chemical Institute, Korean Chemical Society, and the Chinese Chemical Society, presents an excellent opportunity to gather the world's experts in this special symposium. The conference convenes once every five years. In this symposium have been assembled leading experts in the field from around the world, representing a diverse mix of academic, industrial, and government lab contributions. In addition, the symposium targets education and development of graduate students, post-doctoral associates, and young faculty. To this end, the Organizers have scheduled tutorial lectures as the first session of the symposium and more general lectures to start each day that are intended, in part, to be pedagogical. The NSF award will partially offset the expenses associated with underwriting graduate students, post-doctoral associates, and newer faculty attendance.</AbstractNarration>
