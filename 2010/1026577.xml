    <AbstractNarration>Recently, Dr. Pinaud's research group demonstrated that the female hormone estrogen controls how auditory signals are processed and interpreted by auditory neurons in the brain. These are exciting findings because they indicate that estrogen insufficiency may impact hearing function and manipulations directed at estrogen levels may ameliorate or recover hearing dysfunction triggered by hormonal deficits. Although these novel findings are promising, it is necessary to uncover the mechanisms by which estrogen impacts the functionality of auditory neurons and the functional relevance of this hormonal modulation. This project will address these gaps by using a combination of molecular biology, electrophysiology and high-throughput proteomics approaches to understand: 1) how estrogen controls the activation of auditory neurons by acoustic signals; 2) how estrogen shapes selectivity of neuronal responses to auditory signals; 3) the gene expression programs controlled by estrogen in auditory neurons. This work should significantly impact our understanding of how estrogen controls auditory processing and affects long-term gene expression activated by auditory signals in the brain. Consequently, these efforts are a critical first step in the path to exploring how hormonal manipulations may be used to shape how efficiently vertebrates extract acoustic cues for the environment. This project will also generate resources for the scientific community. Specifically, part of the results of this project will be posted on Dr. Pinaud's website (www.pinaudlab.org) during the progression of this project. In addition to the scientific impact of this project, two educational programs will provide 1) students of under-represented minorities with opportunities to participate in these studies, and 2) workshops to children at the Elementary School level, as well as their parents, on concepts in neuroscience and the importance of basic scientific research. The project will also include an exchange program with the Brazil to bring students of under-represented minorities to conduct research in this US laboratory. This program does not constitute a one-way exchange, but rather is an opportunity for young scientists from both cultures to participate in learning experiences that differ significantly from their own programs and backgrounds. This exchange could lay the foundation for future international collaborations that could significantly impact this research area.</AbstractNarration>
