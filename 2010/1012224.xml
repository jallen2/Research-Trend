    <AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Ephraim Woods, III and his students at Colgate University will employ molecular probe methods and photo-ionization spectroscopy to characterize the surface environment of model sea spray aerosol particles. In particular, the research will focus on mixtures of sodium chloride with calcium and magnesium salts, which have been shown to be especially important to the surface chemistry, as well as investigating a variety of surfactant coatings as a model of the organic content of seawater. The work will also explore how the composition and morphology of these model particles affects their uptake of gas-phase polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAH's). The overarching goal of the experiments is to apply their methodologies to increasingly complex environments that better approximate real tropospheric aerosol particles, gaining insight into the factors that control the morphology and heterogeneous chemistry of these particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the implications of the research for atmospheric and environmental sciences, a significant broader impact of the proposed research is the training and development of undergraduates. Colgate University is a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI), and the PI's research group is composed entirely of undergraduates. Students appear as coauthors on all of the PI's publications arising from work at Colgate, and they present their work in seminars and national meetings. Professor Woods will participate in broad educational programs including public seminars sponsored by the Odyssey Center for Talented Youth, high school seminars sponsored by Colgate University, and a general education course for Colgate students entitled "Science, the News Media, and You."</AbstractNarration>
