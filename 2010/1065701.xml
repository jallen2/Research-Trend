    <AbstractNarration>This project is to support US participant traveling to an interdisciplinary conference, "Physics-Mathematics Summer Institute (PhyMSI)", which is devoted to double affine Hecke algebras, the Langlands program, affine flag varieties, conformal field theory, super Yang-Mills theory and the AdS-CFT correspondence. It will be held in June-July 2011 (Cargese, Luminy). The conference consists of two major components: The Langlands program and double affine Heckealgebras component contains the topics (a) Affine and double affine Hecke algebras and relations to integrable models, (b) Geometric Langlands program and the theory of affine flag varieties, and (c) Finite characteristic and the p-adic Langlands program. The emphasis is on the geometric aspects of Langlands Program and Double Affine Hecke Algebras. The super Yang Mills theory and Ads conformal field theory component are core directions of modern theoretical physics containing the main topics (a) Super Yang-Mills theory, including applications to the Langlands program, (b) AdS-CFT correspondence and integrability, (c) Conformal and superconformal field theory in diverse dimensions, and (d) New relations with algebra and geometry. The main objective of the conference is to gather leading and young researchers together and to provide an opportunity for: (a) understanding the perspectives in these highly interdisciplinary directions; (b) accelerating the progress and finding new lines of development and cooperation; (c) greater involvement of the scientists from the other fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas of Langlands program, affine flag varieties, affine Hecke algebras, double affine Hecke algebras, super Yang Mills theory and Conformal field theory are among the most active areas of current research in mathematics and physics. They are so deeply interconnected that experts in one of these fields need to constantly monitor progress in the others. This conference program will provide an opportunity for researchers working in different research areas to gather together and discuss new ideas and further interconnections among these topics. Large portion of the support will be for junior US researcher to participant in this conference and ensure that future researchers will continue be involved in the research fields and their new developments.</AbstractNarration>
