    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the cross-section of fiber reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) laminates used for the repair of oil and gas pipelines. The effects of the addition of CNTs will be improved creep-fatigue strength and life at operational temperatures. Previous research indicates that fatigue failure within composite materials initiates at the fiber?matrix resin interface due to limitations in the physical properties of the resin and its inability to chemically bond with the fiber. Incorporating functionalized CNTs within the interfacial bondline region provides a chemical reinforcement to delay this initiation of failure, resulting in improved tensile strength and stiffness, and most significantly, an increase in fatigue life. The Phase I research will test and optimize a method for CNT incorporation, and will perform mechanical, electrical, and thermal characterization of the resultant material. It is also anticipated that the resulting material may also exhibit enhanced thermal and electrical conductivity, leading to secondary benefits for pipeline applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the development of a cost-effective, easy-to-install, in-situ composite product for pipeline repair, with an operational design life of over 50 years. The anticipated result of this project will lead to a new and transformative composite material technology for the use in pipeline repair and for other civil infrastructure applications. The significance of the development of high-strength and durable fiber reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) wraps based on nanomaterials, for applications in repair and rehabilitation of oil and gas piping and other civil infrastructure systems is fourfold. First, the new product will result in direct sales revenues of the resulting material, creating manufacturing jobs in the US. Secondly, efficient and economical methods to repair oil and gas piping systems will have a significant broader benefit for the world?s energy infrastructure. Thirdly, costs related to demolition of old pipelines and new pipeline construction will be reduced. Finally, the expansion of scientific knowledge expected during the development of this emerging nanotechnology will drive further research and innovation in this key area of technology.</AbstractNarration>
