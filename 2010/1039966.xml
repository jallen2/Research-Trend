    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a Real Time PCR thermocycler system. This piece of equipment essentially consists of a conventional thermal cycler used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a fluorescence detection system. A common application for this system is called Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) because fluorescence can be monitored as samples undergo PCR amplification. The experiments that will use the RT-PCR system include the conventional Molecular Cell Biology assays that rely on PCR amplification of nucleic acids, as well as relatively novel applications in protein biochemistry and supramolecular synthetic chemistry that are not PCR-based. The RT-PCR system will be used to better understand cell division in yeast by quantifying gene expression levels; explore gene expression patterns of different insulin-like proteins involved in insect feeding; experimentally document the effect of X-irradiation on archaeological samples; develop an assay to be used to identify novel nuclear hormone receptor ligands, and facilitate screening of a range of novel chemicals designed to serve as fluorescent molecular sensors. All of the projects described in this proposal will be conducted with the assistance of undergraduate students. Results from the studies conducted with the new thermocycler will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
