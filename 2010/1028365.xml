    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to improve the performance of wind turbine blades for renewable energy generation by mitigating the blade vibrations, hence reducing the airborne noise and increasing the blade?s fatigue life.&lt;br/&gt;The approach is to integrate with the blade a distributed network of piezo-composite patches to mitigate low-frequency vibrations (&lt; 100Hz) through active piezoelectric actuation and high-frequency vibrations (&gt;100 Hz) through passive shunt damping. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Vibrations in wind turbines result in both airborne noise affecting surrounding areas, and increased lifecycle cost of the turbine from structural fatigue. The project will complement existing "global" control of wind turbine blades by reducing vibrations at a more "local" scale using a distributed network of piezo-composite patches. Piezo-composite patches, compared to monolithic piezoelectric disks, offer increased durability, conformability to curved surfaces, and better compatibility with the composite blade material. The network will also provide a multi-scale vibration suppression capability that is unprecedented in wind turbines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Wind currently accounts for 42% of the installed renewable power in the U.S. One of the Grand Challenges of the Department of Energy is to have 20% of the U.S. energy generated by wind by 2030. The proposed piezo-composite network will reduce airborne noise levels to surrounding areas and will increase the operating regime and the structural life of the blades. The project will also include the modification of an existing course at UCSD, international research cooperation, and outreach efforts to low-income 6-12 grade students.</AbstractNarration>
