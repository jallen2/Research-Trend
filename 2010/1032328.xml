    <AbstractNarration>1032328&lt;br/&gt;Conroy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Wastewater contains pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, personal care products, and emerging contaminants originating from human waste and other activities. Endocrine disruptors encompass a wide array of chemicals, including human hormones, phytoestrogens, and flame retardants, among others. Once these chemicals enter wastewater treatment facilities, their fates vary depending on the treatment techniques present. Standard wastewater treatment has not been designed to treat such contaminants, as human and synthetic hormones are only partially degraded during secondary (biological) treatment. The bacteria present in wastewater treatment are exposed to all classes of emerging contaminants, including antibiotics. Antibiotic resistant bacteria populations are becoming more common in wastewater treatment. Recently, hormones have been shown to be substrates for major classes of antibiotic pumps, leading to hormone resistance. Here, it is hypothesized that hormones are inefficiently degraded by bacteria because they are exported out of the cell by antibiotic resistance proteins before encountering oxidizing proteins. The suspected proteins involved in hormone oxidation are oxygenases, which insert a hydroxyl moiety onto a carbon chain. &lt;br/&gt;This BRIGE award will investigate whether the lack of degradation of endocrine disrupting compounds in secondary biological treatment is due to hormone resistance. The proposed work encompasses three main tasks: (1) Various endocrine disrupting compounds, both estrogenic and androgenic, will be tested as substrates for the major Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) antibiotic pump AcrAB-TolC in e. coli; (2) Numerous classes of monooxygenase and dioxygenase genes will be cloned into e. coli; and (3) endocrine disrupting compound degradation will be tested in e. coli strains expressing and lacking oxygenase genes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: If the outlined activities are successful, bacteria populations may be engineered to efficiently degrade hormone and other endocrine disruptors. Pure culture batch reactors will be constructed, studied, and re-designed to incorporate other bacteria populations required for adequate wastewater treatment. These results have significant implications for the reduction of endocrine disrupting compounds released into the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The anticipated results will explain why endocrine disrupting compounds survive wastewater treatment. To determine if this hypothesis is valid, bacteria populations and hormone concentrations will be evaluated at local wastewater treatment facilities. Sample collection will occur in the metropolitan Salt Lake City area, rural treatment works, and from tribal lands. Working in an environmental capacity with Tribal entities requires special permission from their respective leaders. A research protocol will be developed on behalf of the University of Utah which will outline the steps required to pursue such research. Sampling on tribal lands will incorporate educational and research opportunities for interested community members, including high-school students.</AbstractNarration>
