    <AbstractNarration>The tropical rainforest canopy hosts ~30% of the rainforest plant species, epiphytes (plants that live attached to other plants). Epiphytes capture precipitation and nutrient deposition, store water, accumulate biomass, stabilize canopy temperature and reduce water loss. These activities fundamentally influence the exchange of nutrients, energy and water between the atmosphere and the geosphere. This hyperdiverse community is one that has evolved under severe nutrient limitation: the only nutrient sources are canopy soil, precipitation and throughfall, all of which tend to be depauperate compared to forest floor soil pools. Epiphytes are one of the first points of interception for precipitation and atmospheric deposition in tropical forests, and are likely to receive the brunt of predicted increases in nutrient deposition via anthropogenic sources including agricultural practices, land-use change, biomass burning and energy production. A key question is: how will increased nutrient availability delivered to epiphytes influence their ecology, and how will it feedback into both canopy and whole forest ecosystem processes? The objectives of this proposed research are to develop a mechanistic understanding of canopy nutrient cycling and its effect on epiphyte community composition. The approach for the above objectives is a field experiment with three nutrient addition treatments. These additions are of limiting nutrients in the canopy habitat, nitrogen and phosphorus, nutrients which are predicted to increase ~50% in tropical regions. Measurements of canopy soil processes and epiphyte community composition will be made pre-treatment and after nutrient addition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrestrial biodiversity is concentrated in tropical regions and these regions are predicted to see a 50% increase in nitrogen deposition by 2020. These increases threaten diversity and fundamental ecosystem processes and could have significant effects on the stability and sustainability of many ecosystems. Insight into how these regions may respond to increases in nutrient inputs will be vital for adapting to and mitigating the changes that may come to diverse tropical ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening participation in the sciences is a priority for the PI and for Colgate University. There are many actions and efforts the PI will make with the support of the University to recruit and retain students from underrepresented groups in science. Such students will go on challenging and rewarding trips that will entrench them in the rigors of field research and enrich their lives with diverse cultural experiences. Students will also have the opportunity to follow their collected samples through the analysis stage in the laboratory at Colgate University. Continuous connection to and investment in a project along with mentoring is one of the ways in which the PI will foster sustained interest in Biology.</AbstractNarration>
