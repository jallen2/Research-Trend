    <AbstractNarration>Over the past decade, Internet usage has grown by more than 3.5 times,&lt;br/&gt;to about 1.6 billion users; about 300 million of these are broadband&lt;br/&gt;subscribers. Unfortunately, despite this growing penetration and users'&lt;br/&gt;increasing reliance on broadband networks for critical or&lt;br/&gt;performance-sensitive applications, neither the research community nor&lt;br/&gt;industry knows much about the performance of access links, or how users&lt;br/&gt;configure and use networks inside the home. The lack of visibility into&lt;br/&gt;today's home networks makes it nearly impossible to understand the&lt;br/&gt;problems that users experience in these networks, let alone how to fix&lt;br/&gt;them. A critical first step towards improving our understanding of home&lt;br/&gt;networks is gathering data from homes. Towards this end, we are&lt;br/&gt;developing a home network measurement infrastructure consisting of (1)&lt;br/&gt;customized routers deployed in homes and (2) a central data collection&lt;br/&gt;server. We are deploying both the measurement infrastructure across&lt;br/&gt;hundreds of homes and collecting a corpus of active and passive&lt;br/&gt;measurements that will shed more light into home network performance and&lt;br/&gt;use. Given the proliferation of network devices in the home and the&lt;br/&gt;general public's growing attention to the performance of access&lt;br/&gt;networks, we expect that the infrastructure that we deploy and the data&lt;br/&gt;that we gather from this infrastructure will play in important role in&lt;br/&gt;improving our collective understanding of how home networks are used and&lt;br/&gt;how well they perform. We will disseminate our results through&lt;br/&gt;conference and journal publications, as well as talks with and&lt;br/&gt;presentations to researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
