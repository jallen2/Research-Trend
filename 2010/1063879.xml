    <AbstractNarration>0968003 Georgia Tech; Andy Bommarius &lt;br/&gt;0968972 University of Kansas; Eric Munson &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Formulation" (CPMF) with a focus on addressing current challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, and developing solutions towards more selective and robust manufacturing processes, more stable formulations, and better characterized and consistent products. The lead institution of the proposed Center is Georgia Tech with a site location at the University of Kansas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CPMF proposes to explore areas important to pharmaceutical manufacturing and improved formulations for pharmaceuticals. The Center plans to develop methods and technologies that will produce better pharmaceuticals, make them last longer, be more effective, and safer. By combining the efforts of Georgia Tech, Duquesne University and the University of Kansas, the PIs have proposed a number of potentially important projects that could significantly advance the applied knowledge necessary to make better pharmaceuticals. CPMF will allow pharmaceutical companies a lower cost approach to advancing risky research in a cooperative manner such that important manufacturing needs and innovations can be pursued with shared risk and mutual gain. CPMF has assembled a very strong group of researchers who are well-qualified to perform the research outlined in the proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will promote the rapid development of safe and efficacious drugs and drug formulations, and will identify potential problems with proposed drug formulations, with the potential of improving or even saving human lives. The Center plans to involve graduate students and post-doctoral associates in performing and presenting their research, thereby creating an opportunity for them to interact with counterparts from pharmaceutical and medical areas. Plans for dissemination of results are well thought out and audiences are appropriate. The proposed Center also plans to put emphasis on recruiting under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
