    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to support 20 graduate students, post-doctorates and non-tenured junior faculty from underrepresented groups and institutions that are traditionally short of funding for such support to attend the 4th Pacific International Conference on Applications of Lasers &amp; Optics (PICALO 2010) to be held in Wuhan, China from March 23 to 25, 2010. PICALO is a biennial conference organized by Laser Institute of America (LIA) focusing on the growth and application of lasers and optics in the Pacific region. The goal of PICALO is to promote the collaboration between academic and industrial communities. The technical topics and research areas to be covered by PICALO 2010 are in line with the areas supported by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity provided by this funding will blend research and educational activities for the graduate students, post-doctorates and non-tenured faculty who attend. By participating in the conference, the graduate students, post-doctorates and non-tenured faculty will be exposed to state-of-the-art research topics and will interact with global academic and industrial leaders.</AbstractNarration>
