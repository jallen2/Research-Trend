    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: OISE-0908947&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Metin Akay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: US-Turkey Advanced Study Institute on Biomedical Engineering Grand Challenges, Anatalya, Turkey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is organizing an advanced study institute to highlight the use of artificial intelligence in understanding brain function. The National Academy of Engineering announced the 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Included among these 14 challenges were Reverse?Engineer the Brain, Engineer better Medicines, and Advance Health Informatics. Reverse-Engineering the Brain is an emerging discipline that promotes understanding of how the brain works. Advanced computer intelligence should enable automated diagnosis and prescriptions for treatment. To highlight these emerging disciplines, the First Advanced Study Institute on Biomedical Engineering will be devoted to Grand Challenges-Reverse Engineering the Brain and related research. It will be held Istanbul, Turkey and will introduce the attendees with biology backgrounds to the latest developments in the neural engineering. It will also be helpful to students in computer science and mathematics who are interested in doing research in neuroscience and neural engineering, as the advanced study institute will provide insights into the fundamental challenges in neuroscience and biology. In terms of the broader impacts, further development of these topics may lead to the development of methods that allow doctors to forecast the benefits and side effects of potential treatments or cures. The Advanced Study Institute is an opportunity for students to meet with leaders in the field. This study institute will further stimulate interdisciplinary research and collaborations among engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, neuroscientists and medical researchers. In addition the study institute will aid in the understanding of complex neural systems and signals and in identifying the new directions of neuroscience and neural engineering. Options will be discussed for collaboration among researchers and students internationally. This award is co-funded by Office of International Science and Engineering and the Biomedical Engineering Program.</AbstractNarration>
