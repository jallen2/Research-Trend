    <AbstractNarration>A lethal fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has caused widespread population declines and apparent extinctions of amphibian species in many areas of the world. Fortunately, numerous species of bacteria are known to produce antifungal compounds and some of these species live on the skin of amphibians. This research will investigate the role of beneficial bacteria on the skin in protecting amphibians from this lethal fungal disease. This project will develop nonlethal methods to sample antifungal compounds on amphibians that are produced by their bacterial communities, and relate these antifungal compounds to disease outcome in individuals and in populations of amphibians. This work may solve a major puzzle in amphibian ecology; why are some species unaffected by the pathogen while others are greatly negatively affected? This research advances our general understanding of the role of microbial communities on protection from disease. In particular, this research program will explore whether the specific composition of bacterial species on the skin affects how well they protect the amphibian. This project is highly interdisciplinary, including ecological sampling and experimentation, laboratory culturing of bacteria and fungi, identification of antifungal compounds with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and identification of microorganisms and microbial communities with DNA sequencing techniques. The risky aspects of new methods development, combined with the potentially transformative nature of the results, makes this appropriate as an EAGER project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amphibians are a critical part of many ecosystems, yet many amphibian populations have declined or gone extinct due to fungal infection and others are at risk. This research will provide important information that will help in ongoing and crucial conservation efforts of frog and salamander populations. Results from this project may suggest a means to inoculate populations at risk from pathogenic fungi using beneficial antifungal bacteria. In addition, this research effort will provide training in interdisciplinary research for several undergraduates, thus preparing them for graduate and professional schools.</AbstractNarration>
