    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville aims at developing novel immunologically responsive biomaterials to prevent inflammation due to tissue implants. Specific aims of the project are: 1) surface modification to achieve non-fouling; 2) release of anti-inflammatory agents; and 3) surface immobilization of anti-inflammatory factors or growth factors. These immunologically responsive therapeutic biomaterials are expected to help in the wound healing process and prevent the rejection of implants. The fate of biomaterials implanted in the human body largely depends on the types of reactions these biomaterials elicit. The ideal outcome for implants is a seamless integration with the local host tissue without inflammation and rejection. However, in general, the implants create an injury, followed by inflammation, foreign body reaction, and possible rejection of the implants by the body. This proposal is to decrease these inflammatory responses by introducing drugs and growth factors incorporated in the implanted biomaterials. The Broader Impact of the project is in the development of outreach programs to make K-12 students and high school teachers aware of multidisciplinary studies in biomaterials, and the involvement of the PI's graduate students in these activities. The PI also plans to increase the participation of underrepresented minority students in STEM subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to develop novel biocompatible materials for potential applications in suppress immunological responses by tissue implants. In addition, surface of these biomaterials would be modified to include growth and anti-inflammatory factors that promote wound healing at the tissue implant site. The educational component of the project is in the development of new graduate and undergraduate courses in biomaterials. Community outreach activities involved Materials Summer Camp for high school students providing them with hands on experience in materials research in the PI's lab. This summer camp at the campus is cofounded by Oak Ridge National Lab, Y-12 National Security Complex and Oak Ridge Chapter of ASM. The PI and her graduate students will be involved in mentoring high school teachers and these techers will participate in research activities in the PI's lab during the summer months.</AbstractNarration>
