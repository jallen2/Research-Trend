    <AbstractNarration>The Partnership in Securing Cyberspace through Education and Service project produces students who, by the time they become government employees, have been educated by professors who are internationally recognized specialists in computer security and information assurance (CSIA) and by guest lecturers who are on the leading edge of technical and policy development of CSIA in government systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are guided through a curriculum that provides a thorough understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Government in cybersecurity, an overview of its technical aspects, and familiarity with current management tools and cyber legislation currently proposed and under discussion. The project prepares George Washington?s CyberCorps students to succeed by developing their technical, analytical, managerial, presentation, and writing skills with regard to CSIA issues. It provides a baseline of common knowledge of relevant federal policies and mandates and an informed picture of federal government roles, responsibilities, and processes. &lt;br/&gt;Students can choose from dozens of courses in seven departments covering various aspects of computer security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project add great value to our students? storehouse of knowledge, information they immediately use in their federal careers. The project also identify bright students from traditionally underrepresented groups and actively encourage them to expand their horizons and to prepare for government jobs in CSIA. Of special interest is its program where students with bachelor?s degrees from the very diverse University of Hawaii study for a graduate degree in Washington before going to work for the government.</AbstractNarration>
