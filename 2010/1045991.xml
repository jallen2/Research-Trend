    <AbstractNarration>Predicting the consequences of rapid climate change for biodiversity loss and ecosystem function is an urgent scientific challenge. This project will experimentally quantify mechanisms of species and ecosystem sensitivity to warming and increased variation in precipitation, using small streams in the Colorado Rockies and the Ecuadoran Andes as study systems. Theory predicts tropical stream species (aquatic insects and frogs) will be more physiologically sensitive to warming or greater variability in stream discharge than temperate species, and sensitivity should increase for species living in high elevations (alpine zones) versus lowland streams (foothills). High elevation species are also hypothesized to be at greater risk to reduced dissolved oxygen, which will accompany stream warming. These predictions will be tested by experimental manipulation of flow in alpine streams and measurement of the physiological tolerance of species to warming and reduced oxygen. The project will also discover new species using advanced genetic techniques, and assess the ability of species to move between streams as climate changes. This study will provide a novel, integrative model for predicting species and stream ecosystem responses to climate shifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will advance fundamental knowledge of tropical stream diversity required to understand vulnerability of these systems to rapid climate change, providing important information for resource managers. The project will provide training for several undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs. International collaborations will be strengthened through exchanges between international and US students, including students from underrepresented groups. This project combines both useful information for environmental policy and training of the next generation of the biodiversity workforce.</AbstractNarration>
