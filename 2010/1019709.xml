    <AbstractNarration>In ultrahigh-pressure terranes, buoyancy is a commonly evoked model for driving the exhumation of subducted material from mantle depths to the mid-crust, where neutral buoyancy is obtained. This model is adequate for ultrahigh-pressure terranes that do not contain significant evidence for the former presence of melt; however, in melt-rich ultrahigh-pressure terranes, such as in Papua New Guinea, a new model needs to be evaluated in which the rapid exhumation of ultrahigh rocks is driven by the buoyancy generated during two-stage partial melting of continental material, first at ultrahigh-pressure conditions and then during decompression and return of the ultrahigh-pressure body to Earth?s surface. In this project, high-precision zircon dating of variably deformed samples of rock collected in Papua New Guinea that represent former melt and are in a variety of different textural relationships to the ultrahigh-pressure rocks is being carried out. Trace elements are measured from zircon and garnet to determine if the zircon grew in the presence of garnet and/or plagioclase, tying the zircon date to the pressure-temperature conditions, and thus to determine whether the melt was present at ultrahigh-pressure conditions or later during ascent of the ultrahigh-pressure rocks back to the surface. Mapping of the different rock units in the field will determine the volume of each melt generation, and the combined mapping and analytical data is being used to quantify the buoyancy of the melt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-density rocks from the continental crust can be subducted to 100-150 kilometers into the Earth's mantle where they are recyrstallized in high pressure or ultrahigh pressure mineral assemblages. These high pressure/ultrahigh pressure rocks are exhumed and found at the Earth's surface. The mechanisms by which these high density rocks are exhumed are poorly understood. In particular it is not clear how they rise through the low density crust. This project explores a novel model in which ultrahigh pressure rocks partially melt, which reduces their density, decreases their bulk viscosity and allows them to rise into to the crust.</AbstractNarration>
