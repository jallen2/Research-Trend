    <AbstractNarration>Zeger&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009954&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project develops foundations for the recently booming&lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics field of network coding. Network coding&lt;br/&gt;offers the promise of improved performance over traditional&lt;br/&gt;network routing techniques used in practical engineering&lt;br/&gt;applications. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental theory of&lt;br/&gt;communication in networks that allow coding in addition to&lt;br/&gt;routing. Applications include improved throughput in packet&lt;br/&gt;networks and power savings in wireless ad hoc networks. The work&lt;br/&gt;exploits the diverse mathematical, engineering, and computer&lt;br/&gt;science background from the investigator's previous work and&lt;br/&gt;involves mathematical analysis, algorithm design, and computer&lt;br/&gt;simulation. The main topic areas investigated are: the role of&lt;br/&gt;alphabet size and error correcting codes in network coding,&lt;br/&gt;techniques for computing or bounding network capacities,&lt;br/&gt;determining the scalar or vector solvability of networks,&lt;br/&gt;theoretically achievable rates under a limitation of the number&lt;br/&gt;of network nodes that can perform coding, and bi-directional&lt;br/&gt;networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project has applications to practical engineering&lt;br/&gt;problems involving packet switched networks, such as sensor&lt;br/&gt;networks, military battlefield networks, and local area networks. &lt;br/&gt;The most prominent example is the Internet, which is used on a&lt;br/&gt;daily basis by billions of people for sending email, downloading&lt;br/&gt;images and video, transferring data, and many other applications. &lt;br/&gt;This project studies the theoretical foundations of how&lt;br/&gt;information can be sent across such networks using mathematical&lt;br/&gt;combinations of data rather than just routing of data. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project studies the fundamental limits of data&lt;br/&gt;transmission, the best methods to transmit such data, and&lt;br/&gt;variations on the types of networks used. The project includes&lt;br/&gt;graduate student participation as well as some undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;high school student contributions, with emphasis on the&lt;br/&gt;interconnection between mathematics, engineering, and computer&lt;br/&gt;science.</AbstractNarration>
