    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the research of Professor William D. Jones of the University of Rochester on the cleavage and formation of carbon-sulfur (C-S) and carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bonds in heterocycle compounds by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The studies with sulfur have applications in deep hydrodesulfurization (deep HDS) reactions while the studies with nitrogen focus on the use of electrophilic C-H bond activation in molecules containing directing groups for heterocycle synthesis. Specifically, the researchers obtain kinetic and thermodynamic information on the cleavage of strong and/or hindered C-X bonds (X = S or N), provide information about the mechanisms for C-X bond cleavage and formation, work to understand the mechanism of the bond cleavage reactions using density functional theory (DFT), and develop new catalytic systems for the manipulation of C-S and C-N bonds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is focused on the development of new synthetic routes to make nitrogen-containing heterocycles, which are fundamental building blocks in many biologically-important compounds. The transition metal-based catalysts may also have an impact on new routes towards intermediates of pharmaceutical importance. In learning how to selectively break carbon-sulfur versus carbon-hydrogen or carbon-carbon bonds, Professor Jones and his graduate and undergraduate students contribute to meeting new EPA standards for low sulfur emissions from fuels. Master's level graduate students from Hampton University are encouraged to participate in this research project and can be accepted directly into the Ph.D. Program at the University of Rochester. McNair Scholars and NSF REU students also contribute to the research efforts.</AbstractNarration>
