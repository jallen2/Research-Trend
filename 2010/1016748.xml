    <AbstractNarration>Network coding brings the promise of increased wireless network capacity by decreasing the overall number of&lt;br/&gt;transmissions. In practice however, many challenges remain in realizing the gains from network coding. In particular&lt;br/&gt;the interactions between network coding and transmission rate control have not been carefully studied to date.&lt;br/&gt;While transmission at higher rates favor a capacity increase, they can diminish overhearing possibilities, a key requirement&lt;br/&gt;of network coding.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal considers the problem of transmission rate control and network coding in a holistic&lt;br/&gt;way. A framework that examines the interdependencies between the use of network coding and multiple transmission&lt;br/&gt;rates with respect to various functions spanning the link and routing layers, is developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following tasks are being undertaken: (i) Design a network-coding aware transmission rate control module&lt;br/&gt;that allows nodes to transmit at the high bit rates while at the same time facilitating network coding.&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Design a set of functions at the link and routing layers that provide the best trade-offs between applying&lt;br/&gt;network coding and controlling interference and network congestion&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Implement and extensively evaluate a unified framework combining all of our functional modules on wireless testbeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is tightly knit with new education programs by establishing wireless teaching&lt;br/&gt;laboratories and introduce cross-disciplinary courses that bridge the physical and higher layers.</AbstractNarration>
