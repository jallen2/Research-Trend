    <AbstractNarration>In this research the fusion of data from different sources will be used to describe an existing site. The fused data will be incorporated into a lightweight interactive design system that facilitates conceptual design. A method for making the transition from the output of the conceptual design phase to a full 3D model suitable for a CAD system used for construction documentation will also be developed. The work will introduce new methods for gathering and fusing data at an appropriate level of detail for design, rather than following a more traditional approach of creating detailed models and simplifying them for use in an interactive system. The proposed work can have a direct impact on the creative design process by offering a novel approach for creating and editing 3D form. This work is interdisciplinary and brings together research from computer graphics and architecture, computer vision, cognitive science, psychology and design and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
