    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER project investigates Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT) from the perspective of coherent understanding. The PI will explore not only how much knowledge teachers possess but also how they organize that knowledge, and how that organization shapes their practice. This proposed project builds on scholarly work about the development of expertise from the learning sciences and the work about the mathematics knowledge teachers need and how that knowledge develops from mathematics education. The PI's research approach was innovative and will use a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate how much knowledge teachers possess and how they organize that knowledge for teaching.</AbstractNarration>
