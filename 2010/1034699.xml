    <AbstractNarration>Michigan Technological University (MTU) proposes to join the existing Center for Bioenergy Research and Development that is currently comprised of the South Dakota School of Mines (lead), North Carolina State University (NCSU), the University of Hawaii, Kansas State University (KSU) and the State University of New York at Stony Brook (SBU). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal request from Michigan Tech seeks funding to join the multi-university IUCRC for Bioenergy Research and Development (CBeRD). Research in CBeRD is highly interactive and multi-institutional. Universities participating in the center have identified six research foci: Feedstock agronomy and supply, feedstock breeding and genomics, bioprocessing microbes and enzymes, biomass processing, new platform technologies, and modeling and process lifecycle analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the proposed planning grant workshop, the specific research foci of Michigan Tech's contribution to CBERD in the above areas will be crystallized. Michigan Tech has researchers contributing to create a multidisciplinary approach spanning the entire transportation biofuels value chain with a focus on forest resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBERD is positioned to make transformative discoveries that enable the ligocellulosic and oil and fats based bio-industries to meet the challenge of declining petroleum supply. The proposed site will serve as an educational environment to fill the workforce pipeleine with engineers and scientists needed, will extend the reach of CBERD, and will continue to strive to not only bring minorities into this growing industry, but will help create an innovative base in economically deprived areas. The proposed site will also work on improving gender equality.</AbstractNarration>
