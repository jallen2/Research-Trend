    <AbstractNarration>Space Science Institute (SSI) is conducting an International Polar Year project in partnership with the Marine Advanced Technology Center (NSF-funded MATE, Monterey, CA) and the Challenger Learning Center of Colorado (CLCC) to produce and disseminate an online simulation of scientific explorations by the latest generation of Antarctic underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROV). The explorations are based on the ROV work of Dr. Stacey Kim of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and of Dr. Robert Pappalardo and Dr. Arthur Lane at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Products include the simulation, supporting materials and guides, a web site, and a CD Master. Targeted audiences include: (a) middle-school to college-aged students who participate in national annual underwater ROV competitions, (b) Challenger Learning Centers in Colorado and around the country, and (c) the "science attentive" public who will access the simulation via links to SSI and other web sites. Simulations will follow a game structure and feature Antarctic polar science. Estimated annual usage levels are: for MATE, 2000; for Challenger Centers, 300,000; for the general public, 100,000. The project is positioned to continue well beyond the official end of the International Polar Year</AbstractNarration>
