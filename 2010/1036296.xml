    <AbstractNarration>The 5th International Conference on Legume Genetics and Genomics (ICLGG) will be held on July 2-8, 2010 in Asilomar (CA). This meeting provides a venue for presenting the most recent advances in legume genomics, genetics and biology and traditionally attracts a diverse group of molecular biologists, breeders, physiologists and pathologists. As such, the meeting provides an excellent opportunity for students and young investigators to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers. The funding provided by NSF will broaden participation by defraying the costs of participation for women and those from underrepresented groups in the U.S. scientific community and those from developing countries.</AbstractNarration>
