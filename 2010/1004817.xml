    <AbstractNarration>An award was made to St. Olaf College to provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, for the summers of 2010-2012. The program will offer an array of research projects connected by the common theme of exploring the mechanistic basis of environmental change. By examining pathways of nutrient cycling and gene flow in rare and protected ecosystems, this research can answer a range of vital questions that will significantly expand our knowledge of natural processes. Students will work directly with faculty and will select from research programs that utilize stable isotope and/or other innovative tools for environmental analysis to ask a broad, yet interrelated, set of questions. Students are expected to contribute meaningfully to hypothesis development, methodological design, data analysis and interpretation, and ultimately, dissemination of results. In addition to laboratory and field experiences, students will participate in professional development activities that will prepare them for careers in the life sciences. By sharing their experiences and results with Tribal Colleges, the students involved in this program will further effect the appreciation of their work in environments that historically have had limited exposure to research in this field. Contact with students will continue after the summer program to assist students in producing final products for public dissemination and to monitor their progress after completion of the program. In addition, all students will be required to satisfactorily complete a module from the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) related to ethics and research. Applicants should have completed one environmentally related course (either in Biology, Chemistry, or Environmental Studies) and should be interested in pursuing a scientific career. Students from groups underrepresented in environmental science and students from Tribal Colleges are especially encouraged to apply. Additional information is available by contacting Dr. Steve Freedberg at (507)786-3102 or freedber@stolaf.edu, or visiting http://www.stolaf.edu/REU.</AbstractNarration>
