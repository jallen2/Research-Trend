    <AbstractNarration>Healey&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1007830&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator and his colleagues study several&lt;br/&gt;second-gradient problems of nonlinear elasticity, with&lt;br/&gt;applications to multi-phase structures and solids -- especially&lt;br/&gt;lipid bilayer vesicles, shape-memory alloys and thin structures. &lt;br/&gt;A common thread running through these problems is the following&lt;br/&gt;mathematical structure: a non-convex potential energy in the&lt;br/&gt;first-gradient term and an additive second-gradient&lt;br/&gt;regularization, often characterized by a small positive&lt;br/&gt;parameter. The main goals of this work are: (1) to provide&lt;br/&gt;classes of rational models -- particularly in the case of&lt;br/&gt;two-phase lipid bilayer vesicles -- for understanding the often&lt;br/&gt;exotic behavior of such structures under loadings; (2) to&lt;br/&gt;systematically find their equilibria corresponding to local&lt;br/&gt;minima of the total potential energy (meta-stable solutions); (3)&lt;br/&gt;to obtain the existence of global energy minima as weak&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium solutions of those models and study their structure&lt;br/&gt;in the asymptotic limit as the small parameter approaches zero. &lt;br/&gt;Goals (2) and (3) are inextricably linked to (1). We employ&lt;br/&gt;rational continuum models, characterized by general constitutive&lt;br/&gt;functions, and study thresholds of bifurcation and the structure&lt;br/&gt;of global energy minimizers to compare with experiment. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed work is highly interdisciplinary, requiring tools and&lt;br/&gt;perspectives from several fields, e.g., nonlinear analysis and&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, bifurcation theory, calculus of&lt;br/&gt;variations, nonlinear continuum mechanics, computational methods,&lt;br/&gt;symmetry ideas, biophysics, and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project focuses on fundamental modeling and predictive&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis for the quantitative characterization of&lt;br/&gt;shape and deformation patterns of certain micron-scale structures&lt;br/&gt;under applied loading, namely, lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles,&lt;br/&gt;shape-memory alloys, and thin films. Each of these has direct&lt;br/&gt;and important connections to basic science and technology -- in&lt;br/&gt;particular, to problems associated with bio-molecular structures&lt;br/&gt;and advanced materials. For example, lipid-bilayer membranes are&lt;br/&gt;ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems; understanding and predicting&lt;br/&gt;their mechanical behavior is crucial for understanding cell&lt;br/&gt;function. The project focuses on understanding the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;pure, man-made membranes or liposomes under changes in osmotic&lt;br/&gt;pressure, temperature, or composition. The future promise of&lt;br/&gt;liposome vesicles (closed membranes) as vehicles for drug&lt;br/&gt;delivery demands a fundamental understanding of their multi-phase&lt;br/&gt;mechanical behavior under loading. Likewise for phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions in shape-memory alloys and wrinkling of thin films --&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental understanding and mathematical prediction of their&lt;br/&gt;behavior are important for characterizing the mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties of novel materials and for potential sensing and&lt;br/&gt;actuation at the micron scale.</AbstractNarration>
