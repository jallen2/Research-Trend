    <AbstractNarration>PI: Yinlun Huang&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1048263 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Wayne State University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Second International Congress of Sustainability Science and Engineering: Where Science and Engineering Meet the Needs of Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depletion of nonrenewable resources, forests, and stratospheric ozone, pollution of air, water, and soil, global warming, scarcity of water for drinking and agriculture, excessive population growth, etc., are among the major challenges to global society. Naturally, how to ensure engineering sustainability becomes a focal point in balancing economic, environmental and social developments today. Industrial efforts have been increasingly significant on developing green materials and products, designing sustainable systems, improving energy and material use efficiency, ensuring business sustainability, etc. In parallel, a large number of academic researchers in different disciplines of engineering, natural and social sciences have been conducting various types of research on sustainability, aiming at developing sound theories, comprehensive assessment and systematic analysis and design methodologies, powerful decision support tools, etc.&lt;br/&gt;To address much broader issues of sustainability science and engineering, facilitate discussions on scientific and technological development, and share research and practice experiences in industrial sustainability, a group of scientists, educators, and engineers, and governmental officers is organizing The Second International Congress on Sustainability Science and Engineering: Where Science and Engineered Technologies Meet the Needs of Society. The congress will be held in Tucson, Arizona, January 9-13, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This second congress is designed to provide a platform for researchers in engineering, physical and ecological sciences, economics, and social sciences and industrial practitioners from different continents of the world to exchange emerging ideas about ways and means of protecting the environment and its resources so that humans can achieve sustained economic growth and societal benefits throughout generations. While broad topics in sustainability are to be covered, this congress will focus on the sustainability issues particularly important to the western U.S., such as water, renewable (solar) energy, high-tech manufacturing, land use/ecosystems, etc. The congress should help bridge the gap between research and development, strengthening the linkage between industries and academia, and explore opportunities for international collaboration in the proposed technical areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This congress will attract many industrial leaders and top academic researchers from all over the world for participation. This project is for supporting the US academic researchers, educators and students to attend the conference. This will help them learn the cutting-age research in the field of sustainability, share their experience with the world-class leaders and other colleagues, and identify international collaboration opportunities in sustainable engineering research and education. Junior faculty members, undergraduate and graduate students, especially those minorities underrepresented in science and engineering, will be encouraged to participate in the congress. This congress will lead to a publication of a volume in sustainability science and engineering. It is envisioned that this event will be the prelude for active international collaboration on sustainable engineering.</AbstractNarration>
