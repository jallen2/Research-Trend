    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide travel fellowships to support US students to &lt;br/&gt;attend the 2nd workshop on Large-scale Data Mining: Theory and Applications &lt;br/&gt;(LDMTA) in conjunction with KDD 2010 on July 25, 2010 in Washington DC. The &lt;br/&gt;LDMTA workshop will cover topics on scalable machine learning and data mining &lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and their applications, such as medical informatics, &lt;br/&gt;telecommunications, social network analysis, and e-commerce. PIs aim at &lt;br/&gt;investigating the scalability and efficiency of existing machine learning and &lt;br/&gt;data mining algorithms with respect to both theoretical and experimental &lt;br/&gt;perspectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the recent data explosion in many applications, governments and &lt;br/&gt;companies can easily collect data spanning terabytes, petabytes or more. &lt;br/&gt;Several traditional data mining algorithms need to be replaced, or drastically &lt;br/&gt;re-designed, to handle such volumes through parallel architecture such as &lt;br/&gt;MapReduce/Hadoop. The focus of the workshop is exactly to bridge the gap &lt;br/&gt;between theory and practice of data mining, focusing on the fundamental &lt;br/&gt;research on large-scale data mining theory and applications. The goal of this &lt;br/&gt;workshop is to assemble the leaders in data mining research and industry to &lt;br/&gt;present their views on the need and challenges for large-scale data mining and&lt;br/&gt;also attract graduate students to study on large-scale data mining.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed student support will attract the US students to participate in &lt;br/&gt;this workshop and present their works on topics related to large-scale data &lt;br/&gt;mining, to encourage them to focus on the extremely promising research &lt;br/&gt;direction of large-scale data mining as their thesis research. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;PIs will try to broaden the involvement of female and minority students by&lt;br/&gt;prioritizing the award to them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information about this project see the project website at &lt;br/&gt;http://arnetminer.org/LDMTA2010</AbstractNarration>
