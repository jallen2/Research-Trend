    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial funding to support a scientific symposium on Uncertainty Quantification applied to Predictive Engineering and Sciences to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, August 1-5, 2011. It aims at fostering research collaboration between North and South American groups in the field. The format of the meeting is designed to stimulate scientific discussions targeting emerging uncertainty quantification areas and problems of fundamental and technological relevance. Industrial specialists will participate to expose their perspectives on related subjects. The symposium consists of two short courses on stochastic and statistical aspects of uncertainty quantification, about thirty five invited presentations and sufficient free time to allow interactions and collaborations between the participants. The short courses will allow participating graduate students and young researchers to understand fundamental mathematical and statistical aspects of uncertainty quantification. It will provide exposure and allow discussions on major engineering topics where uncertainty plays a key role in analysis and design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will foster collaborative efforts between distinguished participants from the USA and South America. It will introduce young scientists and graduate students to an area of significant importance to predictive science. The scientific presentations of the participants are to be published in a peer reviewed journal. This meeting will lead to a lasting integration and collaboration of researchers around joint work-programs and in the strengthening of scientific and technological basis of the USA and Brazil. A comprehensive web site allows the meeting resources to be widely available, such as short course notes, presentations and invited papers - see URL: &lt;br/&gt;http://mpdc.mae.cornell.edu/Conferences/RioUQ2011</AbstractNarration>
