    <AbstractNarration>1055934 (Jain) The research objective of this CAREER proposal is to deliver a comprehensive decision tool to analyze hydrologic changes and quantify impacts on humans and ecosystems and test and assess the adequacy of policy in the face of changing climate and uncertain forecasts. The project would use downscaled GCM output to drive a land surface/watershed model capable of predicting policy relevant metrics such as flow duration curves and indicators of hydrologic alteration which would then be used to determine adaptive water use policy that would help to meet targets under current and future climate conditions. The research methodology to be applied, in collaboration with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and a broad range of water-related stakeholder groups, uses a systems modeling approach complemented by a research-stakeholder collaborative. This award's educational component complements the research activities, seeking to redress perceived gaps in the present Environmental Science and Engineering curriculum relative to sustainability of water infrastructure. The data, models, methodologies, and case studies emanating from research will be integrated with teaching and outreach activities throughout the K-20 educational system and in informal education settings by: (a) development of programmable media-based watershed models for the Penobscot River Watershed?integrating K-12 science, geography and culture into active storytelling and sharing, (b) collaborative work with University of Maine?s Wabanaki Center to develop a sustained engagement on watershed sustainability education with students and teachers from the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy Indian schools, and (c) creating and revising undergraduate and graduate level courses focusing on interdisciplinary watershed sustainability topics. The integrated research and educational plan represents a first step towards a long-term commitment to develop the capacity for innovative environmental solutions guided by principles of sustainability. Long-term benefits include not only the scientific and technical knowledge necessary to identify and develop effective environmental solutions but also generation of citizens equipped to grasp the challenges and respond to the imperative of environmental sustainability in a changing climate. Ascertaining flexibility, probability of surprises, and determining courses of action (flexibility in policy) demand deep engagement of the researcher-agency-stakeholder collective. Participation of Maine?s Passamaquoddy and Penobscot middle-school students extends a unique opportunity to this traditionally underrepresented group to aspire to higher levels of learning and education. The partnership with the University?s Wabanaki Center will help ensure long-term engagement and assimilation of new knowledge regarding effective models of STEM outreach throughout the state and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
