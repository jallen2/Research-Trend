    <AbstractNarration>This project is cultivating a capable, more diverse workforce in fields that require advanced mathematics coursework, including mathematics, engineering, nanotechnology, and computer science. It is executing a concentrated effort on recruiting and increasing the number of underrepresented students who pursue careers in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the project are to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) provide scholarships to academically talented, underserved and/or financially disadvantaged students, including women, minorities and disabled students, majoring in mathematics intensive disciplines; &lt;br/&gt;(2) increase the number of students declaring majors in STEM fields by 10%; &lt;br/&gt;(3) enhance and increase student support services from enrollment through degree completion and transfer to four-year institutions of higher education;&lt;br/&gt;(4) provide participants with intensive support services to enable 80% of project participants to complete advanced mathematics courses (Pre-Calculus and Calculus I, II &amp; III) with grades of B or better; and &lt;br/&gt;(5) provide transfer assistance to 100% of participants who complete program requirements and who desire to pursue STEM studies at a four-year institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Through a range of participatory activities, the target population is developing competencies and skills that allow them to successfully engage in studies in mathematics, engineering, nanotechnology or technology disciplines. The project is coordinate existing resources and providing comprehensive support services such as academic, career and transfer advising; individual and group mentoring support by STEM faculty; tutorial labs; and transfer to four-year institutions of higher education. The project is providing students more time for academic preparation, implementing effective mentoring and support scenarios, and encouraging innovative and challenging work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is recruiting academically talented, financially needy students, with the aim of enabling students to complete associate degrees, and/or transfer to baccalaureate degree granting institutions offering studies in STEM fields. It is designed to augment the number of underrepresented students pursuing careers in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
