    <AbstractNarration>Smart camera networks (SCNs) merge computer vision, distributed&lt;br/&gt;processing, and sensor network disciplines to solve problems in&lt;br/&gt;multi-camera applications by providing valuable information through&lt;br/&gt;distributed sensing and collaborative in-network processing.&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration in sensor networks is necessary not only to compensate&lt;br/&gt;for the processing, sensing, energy, and bandwidth limitations of each&lt;br/&gt;sensor node but also to improve the accuracy and robustness of the&lt;br/&gt;network. Collaborative processing in SCNs is more challenging than in&lt;br/&gt;conventional scalar sensor networks (SSNs) because of three unique&lt;br/&gt;features of cameras, including the extremely higher data rate, the&lt;br/&gt;directional sensing characteristics with limited field of view (FOV),&lt;br/&gt;and the existence of visual occlusion. An integrated research is&lt;br/&gt;carried out to tackle the unique challenges presented by SCNs where&lt;br/&gt;collaboration is the key. Three aspects of collaborative processing&lt;br/&gt;are investigated, 1) coverage estimation in the presence of visual&lt;br/&gt;occlusions to provide adequate redundancy in sensing coverage, and to&lt;br/&gt;enable collaboration where the statistics of visual coverage blends&lt;br/&gt;the statistics of camera nodes and targets, 2) clustering to&lt;br/&gt;schedule an efficient sleep-wakeup pattern among neighbor nodes formed&lt;br/&gt;by image comparison-based semantic neighbor selection algorithm for&lt;br/&gt;more efficient collaboration, and 3) distributed optimization, for&lt;br/&gt;in-network data processing that concerns how to effectively obtain&lt;br/&gt;robust and accurate integration results from multiple distributed&lt;br/&gt;sensors for challenging vision tasks like target detection,&lt;br/&gt;localization, and tracking in crowds.</AbstractNarration>
