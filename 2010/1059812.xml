    <AbstractNarration>The integration of cyberinfrastructure resources from the campus perspective is critical to the support for the ever-increasing level of cross-disciplinary and cross-organizational aspects of scientific research. To assist in this goal, the Campus Bridging Task Force has been organizing a series of workshops focused on key areas that are critical to a successful campus cyberinfrastructure implementation. Previous workshops have been held in April and August, 2010 and have focused on Networking and Data-centric issues and Software and Services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senior campus leaders are a critical component in the development and successful implementation of campus cyberinfrastructure and the task force has planned a workshop that will be focused on this area. The meeting will provide a forum and opportunity for senior university administrators to offer their perspectives as to what issues must be solved to build a coherent campus cyberinfrastructure at their institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop participants will also have an opportunity to provide feedback, input, and suggestions on the draft document and recommendations of the Campus Bridging Taskforce of the NSF Advisory Committee on Cyberinfrastructure. This information will be valuable to developers, deployers, other campus administrators, and to the NSF itself in helping the organization plan future NSF programs that will merge with campus cyberinfrastructure and to provide the best cyberinfrastructure support to scientific and engineering researchers.</AbstractNarration>
