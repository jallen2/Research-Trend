    <AbstractNarration>This three year Injury Science REU Site program will engage students in fundamental research on the causes and consequences of injury in the young and translational research to apply this scientific foundation into evidence-based prevention products, programs, policy, and interventions. Training will draw upon the multi-disciplinary expertise of a NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center and an internationally recognized research organization, the Center for Injury Research and Prevention, housed within two pre-eminent education and research organizations, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. REU students will not only gain sound research experience but also will learn about other fields of study, the value of interdisciplinary work, and the practical application of research results to real world prevention methods. Trainees will be recruited individually and then grouped into working pairs that will conduct research with a faculty mentor. Formal workshops, meetings, and field trips will provide specific training and broaden their research experience while working in pairs, living together, and participating in informal social events will provide students with a sense of community and create a strong cohort experience. Students will learn how to present research and will receive formal training on ethics, technical writing, and proposal preparation. Students will have a unique opportunity to apply for a grant for student-initiated research that the trainee will continue at their home institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site will attract and train a cadre of talented young researchers to help to ensure the growth, innovation, and continuity of the field. The comprehensive training will prepare diverse, internationally-competitive, and globally-engaged leaders in science and engineering. Their research findings will inform interventions to reduce injuries and deaths in youth.</AbstractNarration>
