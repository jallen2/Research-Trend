    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this EAGER grant is to seek seed funding for the proof-of-concept demonstration through theoretical modeling, fabrication, testing and measurement of a novel dynamically switchable Electro-Magnetic (EM) slow-wave structure that is expected to find wide applications in spectroscopy, THz electronics, bio-sensing and bio-analyzing of hazardous materials. Specifically, for the first time, it will be demonstrated that birefringent anisotropic dielectric media embedded inside a corrugated regular periodic metallic structure, can be utilized to slow down and disperse EM waves in an innovative way that will also allow the new device to electro-optically control the EM wave propagation into ON and OFF (about 20 dB lower than ON state strength) states. Unlike conventional optical circuitry that requires a large amount of chip real estate, the proposed slow-wave device can be easily integrated on VLSI chips because of their smaller geometries and process compatibility with CMOS technology.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits:&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop, for the first time, dynamically-controlled slow-wave Electromagnetic (EM) structures that can be easily integrated in VLSI chips because of their miniaturized geometries and process compatibility with CMOS technology. The theoretical study on various types of electro-optic materials as an anisotropic dielectric medium will reveal how varying refractive indices at different applied voltages will be able to disperse EM waves in distinguished modes so that with careful dispersion engineering, EM wave propagation can be turned on and turned off like a switch. This feature is essential in the design of three-terminal slow-wave EM devices both in the form of controllable waveguides and logic switches.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;Besides the fact that the proposed device is likely to find wide applications in spectroscopy, THz electronics, bio-sensing and bio-analyzing of hazardous materials, the educational objectives of this research project will impart interdisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students. Having an African American doctoral student in PI's research team already will help promote diversity and will encourage female and minority students to join the doctoral degree program in electrical and computer engineering. The PI has in the past spent considerable effort to write mathematical software for K-12 students and now intends to expose students to various types of innovative devices that will be fabricated in this project, which is expected to stimulate school students interest in Science and Engineering. The PI has an active collaboration with many US based companies such as Raytheon and HRL, as well as international research partners in Japan, Korea and China who had in the past published papers with the PI and exchanged research personnel. To promote research among undergraduate students, the PI annually holds Summer Interns program where undergrads from Michigan and overseas countries join the PI' laboratories to get exposed to research.</AbstractNarration>
