    <AbstractNarration>The widespread deployment of wireless communication systems creates unprecedented opportunities to impact our daily lives. Regardless of whether wireless infrastructures are used just for communication or as the basis for actual responses, large-scale wireless data provide increasing opportunities for detecting environmental changes caused by moving objects. Indeed, it is expected to develop the ability to make use of existing wireless infrastructure and sensing data to track moving objects which do not carry radio devices and may not even being aware of being tracked. However, these wireless data are dynamic and have complex data characteristics, such as multi-scale, multi-source and multi-modal. As these data become large and more detailed, new challenges are emerging for intrusion learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop effective and scalable multi-modal passive intrusion learning techniques that have the capability to detect and track device-free moving objects in pervasive wireless environments through adaptive learning in a collaborative way. In contrast to traditional techniques, which require pre-deployment of specialized hardware, and thus not easily deployed for unscheduled tasks and may not be scalable, this project leads to new insights into intrusion learning by mining on wireless environmental data, as well as leading to new approaches to device-free wireless localization, which can be used to assist a broad array of applications (e.g., identification of people trapped in a fire building during emergency evacuation). Project results are expected to open a new venue for integrating learning capabilities into emerging pervasive wireless fields. The educational component seeks to equip students with the necessary background and practical skills needed to contribute to information technology and have a practical impact on a large set of cross-section domains.</AbstractNarration>
