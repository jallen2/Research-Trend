    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop experimental data, analytical models, and design models for the performance of composite shear connectors at elevated temperatures representative of severe fires in buildings. Composite beams play a key role in the performance of steel buildings in fire, and composite shear connectors, in turn, play a critical role in the performance of composite beams. The ability to predict composite beam performance at elevated temperature requires knowledge of shear connector capacity and load-slip response at elevated temperature. There is, however, virtually no data on the elevated temperature behavior of shear connectors, particularly for the important case of formed metal deck slabs, which is the by far the most common case encountered in steel building construction practice in the US. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will include both experimental and computational studies on the elevated temperature response of composite shear connectors. The focus of the project will be an extensive series of well-instrumented and carefully controlled experiments on shear connectors embedded within concrete slabs. Tests will be conducted at temperatures ranging from 20 deg. to 1000 deg C. The experiments will be supplemented by computational simulations and by the development of analytical and design models for shear connector response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will fill an important gap in the current knowledge base on the performance of structural building components exposed to fire and will contribute towards enabling performance-based engineered fire protection of building structures in the US, with an ultimate goal of providing safer and more cost-effective buildings. This project will also contribute towards training of structural engineering students and of fire fighters on structural fire safety.</AbstractNarration>
