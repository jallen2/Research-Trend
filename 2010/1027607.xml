    <AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support Drs. John Arthur, Kathryn Weedman and Matthew Curtis will conduct archaeological and ethnographic research to determine the factors which led to the development of a caste system among the Gamo peoples of Ethiopia. Following on prior work in the region, they will examine the development of a form of social organization which is characteristic of major areas of Africa and South Asia. Because of the remoteness of the area in which the Gamo live, many traditional features of social organization have been minimally impacted and it is possible both to examine a functioning caste system and trace its development over time. The Gamo organize themselves into endogamous caste strata - individuals marry only partners within their own caste - according to occupation and patrilineal descent, and each caste group is associated with different levels of prestige, purity/pollution, and power. Thus, the Gamo offer a unique setting to study the indicators of caste in a present-day African society and to examine theories for the origin of caste, as well as address larger issues relevant to both anthropology and archaeology, such as craft specialization, identity, and the development of complex societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will excavate historic sites and combine archaeological evidence with knowledge of caste indicators from ethnoarchaeological studies. The data thus collected will allow the role of multiple potential factors such as conquest, internal development, environmental change and conflict to be evaluated as possible explanations for the origin and development of caste. The project will permit expansion of ethnoarchaeology, life history, and oral tradition research as well as the excavation of an archaeological settlement and cave site. The ethnoarchaeological research will combine studies of material culture and use of space and life histories to assess how transformations in status, economy, and religion have affected public, ritual, and household spaces, material culture, and caste identity. Excavations will provide comprehensive spatial and temporal contexts to identify households, ritual areas, and environmental indicators that may be associated with specific caste groups and their formation. In tandem with the archaeological work the investigators will conduct studies concentrating on diet, environment, and geomorphology to assess settlement changes, reconstruct past landscapes, document land clearance and deforestation, and investigate variation of caste diets. Combining ethnoarchaeological, historical, archaeological, and environmental research will provide a more complete understanding of the regional changes over time and allow evaluation of potential models for the development of the caste system in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include and provide training for both US and Ethiopian students and strengthen scientific ties between the two countries.</AbstractNarration>
