    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the Post Doctoral training and research of Dr. Drew Gerkey. Dr. Gerkey will be based at the University of Washington where he will undergo training in network analysis working closely with his sponsors Dr. Donna Leonetti and Dr. Eric Smith. Dr. Gerkey's Post Doctoral research will include field sites in Alaska and in Kamchatka, Russia where he will be working with salmon fishing communities to examine the how the formation of networks of interdependence and support contribute to our understanding of how cooperative interactions between individuals have cumulative effects at the community level. As part of the Post Doctoral Fellowship, Dr. Gerkey will be developing and teaching undergraduate courses and training arctic community members in new media technology so that they can document their lives themselves.</AbstractNarration>
