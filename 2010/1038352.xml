    <AbstractNarration>The Association for Women in Science (AWIS) proposes to organize and host the 2010 workshop for the ADVANCE Principal Investigators (PI). This project will feature a 2-day workshop in early November of 2010 that will not only serve as an opportunity to disseminate cutting research and findings gleaned from ADVANCE projects, but also serve to expand outreach efforts of ADVANCE to a broader audience that will include representatives from liberal arts and women's colleges and universities as well as other diversity stakeholders in the STEM disciplines. Specifically, the project will focus on identifying topics for discussion, identifying and soliciting keynote speakers and developing a dissemination plan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The goals of this organization are well aligned with the mission of the ADVANCE Program. As such, it is ideally suited to host an ADVANCE PI meeting. The proposed project will bring together ADVANCE PIs of institutional transformation, institution transformation catalyst and PAID awards for a workshop that will not only foster networking and dissemination of new knowledge in the social science and organizational change disciplines, but also attract a wider audience to the ADVANCE community. Specifically, this meeting will target individuals from small liberal arts institutions and from women?s colleges. Historically, the ADVANCE Program has not had a significant impact on this cadre of institutions of higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this project lie in its capacity to disseminate information on innovations discovered by all ADVANCE projects as well as the insight gleaned from research to an expanded target audience that includes women faculty from liberal arts institutions and women?s colleges.</AbstractNarration>
