    <AbstractNarration>This is an on-going REU Site at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Department of Psychology: Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP). The faculty of the Department of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are highly qualified and motivated to conduct this project, as evidenced by the results from six prior years of PREP; in addition, both the department and university provide environments and resources that are excellently suited for and supportive of this REU site. The site already has a great reputation and attracts a large number of applicants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.&lt;br/&gt;The Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP) provides intensive mentoring and experience in scientific research and in professional development to undergraduates from historically underrepresented populations -- racial and ethnic minorities, low-income, and first generation college students -- who have expressed and demonstrated an interest in a career in scientific psychology. Pedagogically, PREP has been designed within the framework of social constructivist models of learning. The students participate in a broad range of activities in teams, and as a consequence, they internalize the outcomes/benefits produced by working together. It features a balance of mentored laboratory research and a curriculum of scientific instruction, professional development, and networking opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.&lt;br/&gt;The explicit motivation of this program is to address the well-documented achievement gap whereby members of the targeted populations (1) apply to PhD programs in psychology and (2) successfully complete their doctoral training in proportions far lower than their representation in the overall population. PREP's combination of intensive research experience and training in professional development and networking is designed to equip its participating students with the skills that are necessary for a successful career in academic psychology. Thus, it expects to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in many branches of the psychological sciences.</AbstractNarration>
