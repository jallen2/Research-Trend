    <AbstractNarration>This is a workshop to bring together Non-Governmental Organizations(NGO)with NSF Program Directors and key scientists to create a dialog between scientists and NGOs surrounding issues of long-term sustainability under conditions of global environmental change. The workshop will include few key NGOs that are interested in real world solutions to issues of long-term human well-being under conditions of global environmental change, program directors who are interested in working with NGOs on science initiatives, and scientists who are interested in collaborating with NGOs on developing programs. In addition, the discussion will focus on how the scientific community can collaborate with NGOs to better understand and ultimately ensure the long-term sustainability of the environment and human well-being. Since a key definition of sustainability science is a field of ?use inspired? research that is focused on the scientific understanding of strongly interacting human and environmental systems, and NGOs are supporting scientific efforts in this arena, this workshop will bring these three groups together to discuss areas of common interests and concerns and potential processes for future collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
