    <AbstractNarration>Fluid dynamics has historically been a driving force in applied mathematics and scientific computing.&lt;br/&gt;In biological settings, a level of complexity is added to traditional fluid dynamics since&lt;br/&gt;typically biological flows are unsteady, involve active and elastic interfaces, fluid-structure interactions&lt;br/&gt;and transport of chemical signals. This Research and Training project, led by faculty in the&lt;br/&gt;Departments of Mathematics and Biomedical Engineering at Tulane University, recognizes the need&lt;br/&gt;for students trained at the interface of mathematics and the biomedical sciences. Three graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, six undergraduate students and two postdoctoral fellows will be supported each year. A&lt;br/&gt;broad spectrum of research projects will be emphasized that span mathematical analysis, development&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations, modeling of complex&lt;br/&gt;biological systems, three-dimensional simulations on high-performance computers, and a two-way&lt;br/&gt;coordination of modeling with experiments. Training activities will include a curriculum with core&lt;br/&gt;courses from both the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Biomedical Engineering,&lt;br/&gt;regular group meetings, a monthly Biofluids All-Hands meeting, a wet-lab and internship program&lt;br/&gt;for graduate students and postdocs, professional development seminars, an annual Carnival Focus&lt;br/&gt;Days (CFD) workshop and high-performance computing training activities. Moreover, undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students will be fully-integrated into research teams through academic year involvement and&lt;br/&gt;intensive summer research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics has had a huge impact on the engineering, biological and physical sciences through its development&lt;br/&gt;of theoretical analyses and numerical methods. Biological fluid dynamics, in addition&lt;br/&gt;to its direct applications in physiology and oceanography, provides a rich educational and training&lt;br/&gt;platform for students in the mathematical sciences. Undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;students will work in teams, with representation from both Mathematics and Biomedical&lt;br/&gt;Engineering, and with an emphasis on the interplay between theory, computation and experiment.&lt;br/&gt;Research projects will be motivated by applications, including microorganism motility, pulmonary&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, biosensors and cellular biomechanics. All graduate and postdoctoral students will participate&lt;br/&gt;in an internship, either at Tulane University or at a partner institution, where they can&lt;br/&gt;work side-by-side with experimentalists, develop a comprehensive understanding of various aspects&lt;br/&gt;of the research project, and participate in the life of a working fluids lab. The co-PIs, all co-founders&lt;br/&gt;of Tulane's Center for Computational Science, have demonstrated commitment to this model of&lt;br/&gt;training. They are, themselves, diverse, and have been actively involved in increasing the number&lt;br/&gt;of US women and minorities in scientific research. This training program will attract diverse&lt;br/&gt;American nationals into the mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
