    <AbstractNarration>Professor George W. Flynn of Columbia University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct a series of related studies on graphene to reveal the nanoscale structure and dynamic properties of molecules at interfaces. More specifically, the PI proposes to: (1) investigate the structural and electronic properties of graphene; (2) determine the charge doping characteristics of halogens and metal atoms adsorbed on graphene sheets; (3) study the potential effectiveness of graphene as a membrane filter with controlled porosity; and (4) probe the atomic level structure and properties of hexagonal boron nitride and its potential interactions with graphene and graphite. The studies are primarily conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching objective of these studies is the elucidation of the driving forces that control interfacial properties and self organization of molecules on graphene. The results will impact the next generation nanoscale optical and electronic devices. The project involves direct participation by undergraduate female students. The educational activities also include the development of education material on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology for Columbia University Summer and Saturday science enhancement experiences for high school students.</AbstractNarration>
