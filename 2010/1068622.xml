    <AbstractNarration>This award will support the inaugural meeting of the Southeast Neuroscience Consortium&lt;br/&gt;(SENC). This organization was created by the merger of the Southeast Nerve Net (SENN)&lt;br/&gt;(founded in 1983) and the Georgia South Carolina Neuroscience Consortium (GA/SC-NC) Since&lt;br/&gt;its inception, the focus of SENN meetings has been comparative neuroscience while that of the&lt;br/&gt;GASCNC has been systems neuroscience. Thus, meetings of the SENC will encompass the&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of modern neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of meetings of the SENC will be to provide a forum for students and&lt;br/&gt;early postdocs to give talks in a supportive environment where they get exposure to a large&lt;br/&gt;audience and, at the same time, allow neuroscientists from across the South East to come&lt;br/&gt;together. The majority if not all oral sessions will be set aside for students, thereby providing&lt;br/&gt;them a rare opportunity to fine tune their speaking skills before encountering the more&lt;br/&gt;impersonal audiences they would likely encounter at large national (i.e. Society for&lt;br/&gt;Neuroscience) or international meetings. To facilitate student participation, a significant portion&lt;br/&gt;of the award will be assigned to cover the travel costs of student participants. A major effort will&lt;br/&gt;be made to attract students from two year colleges, where neuroscience is typically poorly&lt;br/&gt;represented, and Historically Black Colleges and other minority institutions.&lt;br/&gt;All told, we expect this meeting will enhance student training, enhance collabora</AbstractNarration>
