    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Gaudi will help usher in the next phase of exoplanet science by constructing statistically robust samples of exoplanet demographics spanning a broad range of planet and host-star properties, which can then be used to test predictive theories of planet formation. His strategy to accomplish this will be to employ several detection methods, leverage existing surveys by quantifying their detection efficiencies, develop strategies for increasing the sample sizes of next-generation surveys, and synthesize results from different methods. Specifically, he will (1) use current microlensing surveys to constrain the demographics of planets beyond the snow line, and develop analysis software enabling such constraints to be derived from next-generation surveys, (2) assess the prospects for determining the demographics of giant planets in the short-to-intermediate period range using high-multiplexed radial velocity surveys, (3) construct simulations of all-sky space surveys for transiting exoplanets, and use these to optimize survey strategies and so maximize their yield, and (4) synthesize results from all methods to paint a broad picture of exoplanet demographics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complement these research goals, Dr. Gaudi will engage in a number of outreach and educational activities designed to interest and educate gifted students in careers in science, and provide an academic outlet for two relatively overlooked, disadvantaged, and stigmatized minority groups. Specifically, he will (1) create and teach several week-long courses in exoplanet detection to students at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA), a public high school for gifted students, and mentor students from these courses who are interested in careers in astronomy, and (2) give public talks on exoplanets and organize star parties for kids associated with the Kaleidoscope Youth Center in Columbus (a safe haven for LGBTQ youth), and kids at Camp Sunrise (a summer camp for children affected by HIV/AIDS).</AbstractNarration>
