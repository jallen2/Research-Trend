    <AbstractNarration>This project is to utilize a combination of space- and ground-based data to characterize the relationship between lightning current and transient luminous events (TLEs), which are the visual manifestation of upward energy coupling between the troposphere and upper atmosphere. Specifically, this project will conduct detailed, event-level analysis of TLE observations using high time resolution optical and electromagnetic measurements in order to assess the effects of internal TLE structure and dynamics on mesospheric state parameters. In addition, satellite optical data will be used in conjunction with a network of ground-based electromagnetic measurements to obtain a global mapping of tropospheric sources of TLEs and associated responses in the mesosphere. The goal of this effort is to provide a foundation for evaluating possible local, regional, and global effects of TLEs in the upper atmosphere and to provide better specification of the background electromagnetic environment where they initiate and propagate. This work will support the education and research training of a graduate student as well as involve research participation by undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
