    <AbstractNarration>The opening of the exhibition, Yuungnaqpiallerput (The Way We Genuinely Live): Masterworks of Yup'ik Science and Survival at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in April, 2010, offers unprecedented opportunity for public education, museum collection documentation, and community engagement in science, anthropology, language revitalization, and cultural heritage. The exhibit presents remarkable 19th and early 20th century tools, containers, weapons, watercraft and clothing whose design reveals intimate understanding of the scientific principles and processes that helped Yup'ik people survive for thousands of years along Alaska's Bering Sea coast, one of the most rigorous environments on earth. The Washington venue brings hundreds of Yup'ik objects from museums around the world to the Smithsonian, where Edward W. Nelson pioneered Yup'ik studies through his 1877-81 Alaskan fieldwork and his classic publication, The Eskimos About Bering Strait (Nelson 1899).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project utilizes workshop sessions to combine information obtained from Yup'ik elders, data from Nelson's recently discovered Alaskan diaries, and Smithsonian curatorial and conservation expertise. Participants will utilize reference collections and analytical facilities to shed light on aspects of Yup'ik science such as the selection of raw materials for strength, resilience, hardness, insulation, wind or water permeability, lightness and mechanical properties, as well as aesthetics and spiritual compatibility. In collaboration with conservators, curators and scientists, Yup'ik consultants will develop protocols for object documentation and long-term preservation and care that are both scientifically sound and culturally appropriate for the storage and educational use of museum collections. In addition to developing new research methods and standards, the project educates visitors about the importance of museum collections and Native knowledge by presenting gallery demonstrations, film programs, and children's activities.</AbstractNarration>
