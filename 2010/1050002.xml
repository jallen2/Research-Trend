    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) will use measurements of the cosmogenic isotopes of beryllium and carbon over the last 10,000 years, together with cosmic ray and other data gained from satellites since 1963, to examine the implications of the long minimum of solar activity that occurred between 2006 and 2009. Cosmogenic isotope data are among the few quantitative measurements available for studying solar processes in the deep past. With the assistance of his collaborators, the PI will characterize the long-term and short-term features of space weather and investigate the long-term variability of the total solar irradiance (TSI) of the Sun over the last 10,000 year interval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will increase our understanding of cosmic ray physics, solar physics, space weather, and terrestrial climate change. A major outcome will be a strengthened collaboration among the cosmic ray, solar physics, and cosmogenic isotope research communities. The ~10,000 year cosmogenic record to be used here will provide substantial insight into solar magnetic processes, and by inference, the magnetic processes that occur on other stars. This research will also contribute to a better understanding of the geological and biological changes that occurred in the Holocene post-glacial era.</AbstractNarration>
