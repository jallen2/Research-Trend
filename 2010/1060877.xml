    <AbstractNarration>Determining the rates of marine sediment accumulation is critical in reconstructing past changes in productivity and carbon burial, but the ability to reconstruct such flux flux rates over long geologic timescales is been limited by radioactive decay (e.g., 230Thxs) and by variability in the proxy production rate or source (e.g., 4He). This collaborative project, involving researchers from the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the California Institute of Technology, develops the use of extraterrestrial particles in marine sediments as flux proxies, potentially extending scientists? ability to reconstruct changing accumulation rates from tens of thousands of years to hundreds of millions of years. By combining two independent, stable tracers of particulate extraterrestrial matter in marine sediments-- helium (He) and osmium (Os) isotopes-- the researchers will be able to distinguish between changing extraterrestrial flux to Earth and terrestrial focusing of extraterrestrial particles during transport to the seafloor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method will be applied over a time window of 10 to 4 million years before present, a time period known to encompass an episode of greatly increased extraterrestrial flux to the Earth resulting from collisions in the asteroid belt. The researchers will compare records from a number of different sediment cores from the Pacific Basin, with accumulation rates varying by a factor of more than twenty, to determine whether or not particulate extraterrestrial He is preferentially focused to high sedimentation rate sites relative to Os. Lastly, the researchers will test whether a reliable age model can be developed for Pacific red clays, which would greatly improve the potential of these sediments as paleoceanographic archives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, funding supports education and training of a postdoctoral researcher and an undergraduate student and fosters international collaborations. The research will also develop a potentially important new tool that would unlock new potential for studying how important environmental parameters, including productivity and terrestrial aridity, change over long time periods.</AbstractNarration>
