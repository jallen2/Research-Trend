    <AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to extend a previously funded experiment of a seismic refraction study on Shatsky Rise from 2 to 3 dimensions by incorporating all of the available shots from the seismic refraction and MCS reflection surveys to image the interior volume of Shatsky Rise at TAMU Massif by 3D traveltime tomography. With this new information, the PI hopes to be able to better distinguish the presence of internal 3D structures. Shatsky Rise is considered to be a high-priority oceanic LIP target because it was formed at a time of frequent magnetic polarity reversals just prior to the long Cretaceous Normal period during which many later Pacific oceanic plateaus formed; studying Shatsky Rise thus allows us to better constrain its emplacement history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Broader impacts include the completion of the originally proposed 3D work (that was put at risk due to the death of a co-PI at LDEO), which will make it more useful to the geosciences community. The added task of the web-based interaction capability to be made available at large is also a good complement to the program and will also extend the usefulness of the results to the wider community. The award will support a female co-PI.</AbstractNarration>
