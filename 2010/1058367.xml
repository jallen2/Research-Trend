    <AbstractNarration>This is a Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction project for the construction of a 254-foot research vessel to work in the waters off the coast of Alaska including the Chukchi, Beaufort and Bering Seas. The University of Alaska, Fairbanks? (UAF) original proposal was in response to the National Science Foundation Program Solicitation NSF 07-515 for the management, acquisition and operation of an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV), now known as the R/V SIKULIAQ. The construction of an ARRV was given the highest priority in the report National Academic Research Fleet, A Long Range Plan for Renewal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original proposal was reviewed by ten mail reviewers and ten panelists. A major recommendation from the panel was a phased acquisition strategy to mitigate risk. A four phase approach has been implemented that requires certain milestones to be completed prior to funding the next phase. UAF is using Earned Value Management (EVM) and a Project Execution Plan (PEP) as approved and monitored by NSF. NSF conducts annual panel reviews to evaluate project implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides the funds for Phase IV, Transition to Operations which includes a period of final outfitting, science and ice trials, and delivery to the vessel?s home port in Seward, Alaska. The final construction design is currently being developed with the selected shipyard. Fabrication will begin in October 2010, with delivery to UAF currently scheduled for January 2013. The SIKULIAQ is expected to begin science operations in early 2014 as a member of the US academic research vessel fleet (www.unols.org) once Phase IV is completed.</AbstractNarration>
