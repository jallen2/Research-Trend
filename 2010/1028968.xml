    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary: The ERC for Re-inventing America's Urban Water Infrastructure; Richard G. Luthy,&lt;br/&gt;PI, Stanford Univ., Lead; Univ. of California, Berkeley; Colorado School of Mines; New Mexico State Univ.&lt;br/&gt;Foreign Partners: Nanyang Technological Univ., Singapore; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science&lt;br/&gt;and Technology, Dubendorf, Switzerland; Univ. of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.&lt;br/&gt;Vision and Goals. Cities are facing a mounting water crisis from climate change, population expansion,&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem demands and deteriorating infrastructure that threatens economic development, social&lt;br/&gt;welfare, and environmental sustainability. Without relatively large investments this crisis will only deepen&lt;br/&gt;through the 21st century. Accordingly, the goal of the proposed ERC is to advance new strategies for&lt;br/&gt;water/wastewater treatment and distribution that will eliminate the need for imported water, recover&lt;br/&gt;resources from wastewater, and generate rather than consume energy in the operation of urban water&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure while simultaneously enhancing urban aquatic ecosystems. While many existing&lt;br/&gt;approaches could be used to transition urban water infrastructure to this more sustainable state, their&lt;br/&gt;implementation currently is limited by uncertainties about their long-term performance, life cycle costs,&lt;br/&gt;institutional impediments and public concerns about unfamiliar technologies. In some cases, the&lt;br/&gt;technologies needed to realize our vision do not yet exist and technological breakthroughs are needed.&lt;br/&gt;To meet these challenges, our strategic planning process identified key research projects within three&lt;br/&gt;thrust areas:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Engineered Water Systems: Decrease reliance on inefficient centralized treatment systems by&lt;br/&gt;employing distributed treatment systems that embrace water conservation, local use of alternative&lt;br/&gt;supplies, energy management, nutrient recovery, and that integrate with existing infrastructure;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Managed Natural Systems: Integrate managed natural systems into water infrastructure to fully&lt;br/&gt;realize the potential benefits that natural systems can provide with respect to water storage and&lt;br/&gt;improvement of water quality, while simultaneously rehabilitating urban hydrology and aquatic habitat;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Systems Integration and Institutions: Support the reinvention and restoration of urban water&lt;br/&gt;systems through the development of decision-making tools that account for economic, environmental&lt;br/&gt;and social factors and development of approaches that can circumvent impediments to change posed&lt;br/&gt;by regulations, laws, jurisdictional fragmentation, financing and public perception.&lt;br/&gt;The ERC will conduct short-term research to facilitate adoption of existing technologies that have the&lt;br/&gt;potential to improve system performance and long-term research on technologies that can fundamentally&lt;br/&gt;transform urban water infrastructure. Regardless of timing, all of the research will be targeted at&lt;br/&gt;understanding how new technologies and management strategies affect the performance of complex&lt;br/&gt;urban water infrastructure systems.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The proposed ERC joins four leading universities in the West and three international&lt;br/&gt;universities at the forefront of urban water infrastructure research. Although increased demands on water&lt;br/&gt;supplies occur throughout the country, these demands are acute in the arid West, where the ERC partner&lt;br/&gt;universities have special capabilities and access to unique test beds. Furthermore, each campus has&lt;br/&gt;strategic collaborations with members of the professional community and international research partners&lt;br/&gt;that will help us to translate our research into tangible results. Through a combination of innovative&lt;br/&gt;research, systems analysis and meaningful collaborations with stakeholders, we will ensure a more rapid&lt;br/&gt;reinvention of urban water infrastructure in a manner that is sustainable, safe and cost-effective.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Technology transfer of the ERC?s research will occur through close involvement of end&lt;br/&gt;users. Public and private water service providers, government representatives, equipment manufacturers,&lt;br/&gt;and technologists will actively participate in the ERC to ensure the research is influential in decisions&lt;br/&gt;about urban water infrastructure operation and renewal. To support the development of innovative new&lt;br/&gt;technologies, we will establish a center within the ERC to provide cutting-edge evaluations of devices&lt;br/&gt;developed by small companies with the aim of improving products and fostering development of start-ups.&lt;br/&gt;The ERC's outreach will build a pipeline of diverse, well-prepared students who eventually pursue&lt;br/&gt;and complete water-related degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level?becoming leaders and&lt;br/&gt;supporting significant change in the Nation?s water infrastructure in a manner that is guided by scientific&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and whose efforts are supported by an informed public. Each component of the education and&lt;br/&gt;outreach plan feeds directly into the attainment of this vision beginning at the elementary level and&lt;br/&gt;continuing through graduate education. To ensure the involvement of under-represented minorities, the&lt;br/&gt;ERC is partnered with American Indian Tribal Colleges and Universities, and K-8 and high schools that&lt;br/&gt;target districts that serve primarily Latino, Pacific Islander and African American populations</AbstractNarration>
