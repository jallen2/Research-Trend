    <AbstractNarration>Existing data and models present a confusing picture of how the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), an integral part of the tropical climate system, responds under different boundary conditions. This research tests the hypothesis that the Pacific Marine ITCZ shifts to the south, and perhaps even below the equator, during glacial times. Using an innovative approach (measuring oxygen isotope ratios measured on planktonic foraminifera that calcify at the base of the photic zone) the researchers reconstruct changes in the position of the thermocline ridge that separates the North Equatorial Current from the North Equatorial Countercurrent. This ridge is currently situated just north of the modern ITCZ. The focus is on the last 150,000 years of Earth history. Funding supports education and training of a graduate student as well as involvement of undergraduates and high school students in research.</AbstractNarration>
