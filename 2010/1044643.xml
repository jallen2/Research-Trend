    <AbstractNarration>In order to transform neuroscience teaching and learning, the Molecular Genetics in Neurophysiology Laboratories Type I TUES project develops, implements, and evaluates six comprehensive, inquiry-based teaching modules in which students perform electrophysiology and locomotor behavior assays on wild type and mutant Drosophila melanogaster. The intent is to create and evaluate new teaching modules that more closely mirror modern neuroscience research laboratories. The project integrates the study of mutant and transgenic animals with classical neurophysiological training programs. Classical teaching approaches typically focus on WHAT neurons do, rather than HOW neurons do what they do. This project addresses the need for teaching materials that address this HOW. The mutants selected display specific effects that illustrate the function of key neuronal components such as ion channels, vesicle fusion proteins and cell adhesion molecules. Students moreover perform extracellular recordings on the Drosophila eye to learn about sensory physiology, and intracellular recordings on the larval neuromuscular junction to learn about synaptic transmission and electrical properties of excitable cells. These experiments will be accompanied by assessment of behavioral deficiencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will monitor and evaluate the success of the integrative teaching approach used through examination of student satisfaction and learning throughout the progress of the course. These data will be used to modify the content and presentation. The long term impact of this course will be evaluated, with a special focus on those groups of students that have historically lagged behind in STEM disciplines. Specific tools for objective assessment of student achievement in this course will be developed and should prove to be broadly useful to neurophysiology course evaluation. Commitments to dissemination include: workshops for students and faculty at area colleges which will allow for the design of widely applicable teaching techniques; establishment of a free website containing teaching tutorials and video footage of critical steps and techniques; use of the website for collaborations in developing molecular genetic teaching tools for neurophysiology; presentation of laboratory modules at annual meetings of the Society for Neuroscience; and publication in journals such as the Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education and CBE Life Sciences Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, this project is responsive to a growing need for exemplary learning materials for the increasingly popular neuroscience major.</AbstractNarration>
