    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program at the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) entitled "NUE: Using Peer-to-Peer Support to build NEMS and Consider SEE Implications of Nanotechnology", under the direction of Dr. Sumita Pennathur, is to prepare a new generation of well-rounded and educated engineers who are skilled in using cutting-edge nanofabrication tools and processes to build nanoscale systems (such as NEMS) and nanoscale devices. To do this a set of three new courses and a modification to an existing course will be developed. Two of the courses will increase a UCSB undergraduate's ability to build nanoscale devices and systems (NEMS), and the third, a new course will focus on their communication skills. Also proposed to be implemented is a high school education program that pairs high school students with undergraduate mentors who are enrolled in the NEMS class to enhance the communication skills of UCSB engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UCSB program will accelerate advances in nanotechnology via educational pathways across a broad range of sciences. Intensive, hands-on training in nanofabrication techniques building NEMS and through research experiences will prepare engineers for this exciting field.</AbstractNarration>
