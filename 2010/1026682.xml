    <AbstractNarration>Set in Delhi and Dheradun, India, this multi-sited research examines the socio-cultural implications of pharmaceutical advertising associated with women's health. These advertisements began in 2007, and are considered representations of scientific and technological innovation. The project aims at understanding how differently positioned women (and men) relate to these advertisements and to the new pharmaceutical technology they represent. This ethnographic work provides a textured articulation of not "what women in India think" as a monolithic group, but rather how a wide range of experiences and subjectivities contribute to various contemporary understandings of techno-scientific information. It contributes to science and technology studies scholarship on the public understanding of science and global pharmaceutical practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is animated by an awareness that women may occupy multiple roles (they may be doctors, pharmacists or consumers, for example) and that direct-to-consumer advertisements may, in complex ways, be simultaneously empowering, confusing, informative, and deceptive. Through focus groups, interviews, and participant observation with women, physicians, and pharmacists this research explores the socio-cultural implications of mediated biomedical knowledge. Additionally, the project is designed to historically locate these advertisements within a larger nation-building project and address not only how these advertisements appease local publics' desires (both for commodities and as social manifestations of modernity) but also how they ameliorate physicians' and global audiences' anxieties about an over-populated nation.</AbstractNarration>
