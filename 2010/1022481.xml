    <AbstractNarration>Recent advances have made it possible to investigate the entire population of a class of biomolecules in a cell simultaneously. Genomics, the study of all of the genes in an organism was the first such technology. Now, transcriptomics (mRNA), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), lipidomics (lipids), and a host of other "omics" techniques are changing the way biologists view and study cells. Data from these techniques are catalyzing fundamental changes in the understanding of biology. One such change is the view of organisms as systems composed of dynamic networks. These networks are highly interwoven and span molecular classes. For this reason, it is not possible to understand a biological system by only studying one class of molecules. The goal of systems biology is to integrate data on cellular networks into mathematical models with predictive power. While models that can predict biological responses have begun to emerge, they are still very limited. This is not a failing on the part of "omics" science, but the reality that we do not understand the connection between networks at the molecular level. The goal of this research is to realize an understanding of the network environment within a cell from genes, through proteins, to metabolites. This project is focusing on the archaeal extremophile Sulfolobus solfataricus which has become a model organism for the study of microbial adaptation to extreme environments. Features that this organism an attractive model are a small genome, cellular machinery that are a mix of bacterial and eukaryotic, and the current lack of general knowledge about archaea. The research goals of this project are intended to significantly contribute to a network analysis spanning genes to metabolites, that can delineate the boundaries of functional modules and nodes for the vertical transfer of information from genes through proteins to small molecules and back. Aim 1, analysis of the S. solfataricus response to viral infection, oxidative stress, and heavy metal using RNA sequencing, proteomics (2D-DIGE and multidimensional LCMS), and metabolomics. Aim 2, construction of a biomolecule network based on co-dependencies of genes, proteins, and metabolites. This builds from data generated in Aim 1, previous work from our group, published data, and a relational analysis of components. Realization of these two aims will be a significant step toward development of predictive models of microbial organisms and will advance our understanding of life in extreme environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research is defining fundamental new information on microbial life under extreme conditions that can have important dividends for applied areas such the development of thermally stable enzymes. The project efforts also include continuing delivery of a successful learning module consisting of a short movie, graphics, discussion and hands-on model-building as an introduction to the basics of virology and the geometrical principles behind icosahedral structures. Participants have an opportunity to build virus models using plastic geometrical shapes and paper templates to explore the structure of viruses. Target groups for this presentation include elementary, junior high, and high school students (in Belgrade and Bozeman, MT). It will also be part of the Montana State University (MSU) Master of Science in Science Education (MSSE) program and Science Saturdays at MSU. In addition, high school biology students in rural areas of Montana will be introduced to systems biology and college level research through hands on training at MSU in the PI's laboratory. This project is a joint effort between the PI and a high school biology teacher from a neighboring town. The overarching goals of the outreach program are 1) that science (and scientists) can be fun, and 2) that learning about the world through experimentation can be exciting. Lastly, the undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctorals in the PI and Co-PIs labs will receive direct scientific training and will take part in the outreach program.</AbstractNarration>
