    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the U.S. participation in the Fourth Open Science Conference to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in August 2010, during the XXXI Meeting of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR; www.scar.org). The main conference's theme is "Antarctic Witness to the Past, Guide to the Future", and this is an international and interdisciplinary meeting that brings together students and polar investigators of all ages from around the world with interests in Antarctic science and research. The conference is an excellent opportunity to view and discuss the most recent research results as papers on all aspects of polar studies will be presented. The provided funds will allow approximately 25 U.S. young faculty, researchers, postdoctoral appointees, and students to attend one of the most important international polar science conferences. During the meeting, the attendees will have the unique opportunity to hear the latest research results, network with international colleagues with similar interests, and nurture and enhance existing partnerships. Attendees will meet scientists from other countries and form new partnerships and collaborations that would not have otherwise occurred. In particular, applicants from under-represented groups, young scientists, and students will be encouraged to attend the conference enhancing their careers by meeting and collaborating with international colleagues. The broader impact will be facilitation of U.S. scientists' participation in international Antarctic science opportunities such as the SCAR scientific research programs. Following the formal conclusion of the International Polar Year (IPY 2007-2008) in March 2009, most of the ongoing and future Antarctic research efforts are now focused on formulating a framework for securing the legacy of this significant international event.</AbstractNarration>
