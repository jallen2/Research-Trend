    <AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for U.S. participants in two programs on quantum information science in Sweden during the fall of 2010:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The scientific program on Quantum Information held at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (NORDITA), Stockholm, Sweden, from 27 September to 29 October, 2010. (http://agenda.albanova.se/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=1434)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The program in Quantum Information Theory held at the Mittag-Leffler Mathematics Institute, Djursholm, Sweden, from 1 September to 15 December, 2010. (http://www.mittag-leffler.se/programs/future/1011f/)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both programs share involvement in a common central meeting, the "International Conference on Quantum Information and Computation," held 4-8 October 2010 at the Wenner-Gren Center, Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;br/&gt;(http://agenda.albanova.se/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=1440)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support under this travel grant is targeted to young U.S. scientists, enabling them to make important contacts in the international scientific community, and contributing to the training of the next generation of quantum information scientists. For further information, please contact Dr. Mary Beth Ruskai, Tufts University [marybeth.ruskai@tufts.edu].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information science is the study of using quantum effects for computation, communication, and cryptography. A quantum computer would be more powerful than existing ones; it could perform tasks which are not feasible with the classical computers of today. Although building a quantum computer remains a formidable challenge, much progress has been made, and devices for new quantum methods of cryptography are now commercially available. Quantum information science is an interdisciplinary field, whose participants range from experimentalists working on the physical implementation of quantum computers and other information processing devices to mathematicians working in abstract fields which have had unanticipated applications in quantum information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A quantum computer would threaten the security of commonly-used encryption protocols for tasks ranging from secure transmission of credit card numbers or medical records to transmission of information vital to national security. It is essential that the U.S. remain a leader in this rapidly developing field. This grant will facilitate the participation of U.S. scientists in important international research programs on quantum information theory.</AbstractNarration>
