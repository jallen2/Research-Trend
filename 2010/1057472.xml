    <AbstractNarration>Forest litter plays important roles in global carbon cycling and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystem. We are still not clear about the long-term decomposition patterns of litter, in part because it is difficult to acquire precise and accurate litter carbon chemistry. Traditional methods to determine litter chemistry, such as wet chemical techniques, measure samples destructively, lack specificity, and in some cases produce erroneous results. One potential approach is solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which can measure samples nondestructively and elucidate chemical structures precisely and is regarded as the best tool to investigate the complex structures of litter and decomposed litter. Several new advanced solid-state NMR techniques for systematically elucidating the structures of complex organic matter have been developed by our team, however, they have not been used to examine changes in litter chemistry during decomposition. This project will employ these new, systematic, advanced NMR to investigate the possible range in variations of litter chemical compositions of different species and sites from the Long-term Intersite Experiment Team (LIDET). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a joint effort between Old Dominion University and Oregon State University. It will train a female graduate student in applying, improving and developing advanced solid-state NMR techniques for ecosystem study. The project will also provide opportunities for recruiting and retaining underrepresented students including African Americans and women which constitute a large body of students at Old Dominion University.</AbstractNarration>
