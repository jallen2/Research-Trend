    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;The cerebellum is a large part of the brain that is involved in sensory-motor control and motor learning as well as in cognition. Most scientists consider that motor learning is mediated at two separate sites, the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). All effects of the cerebellar cortex are mediated by Purkinje cell inhibition of DCN neurons. However, our understanding of how cells of the DCN integrate inhibitory input from Purkinje cells with excitatory input from other sources has been impeded by the large spatial separation between these two important cell types in mammals. This project focuses on a special system, the caudal cerebellar lobe of mormyrid fish, where these two cell types are close together. The proximity of these two cell types in the mormyrid cerebellum will allow the PI to record simultaneously from both cell types in an in vitro slice preparation. Such recording will allow the effects of Purkinje cells on their target neurons to be determined precisely. Determination of synaptic dynamics and plasticity at this synapse will advance our understanding of the functional circuitry of the cerebellum. Science teachers and students are intrigued by mormyrid electric fish and the electrical pulses they use to probe the environment and communicate with other fish. Groups of students and teachers from local schools will participate in this project examining these fish and their discharges through hands-on experiments. Such experiments will help stimulate student interest in both the biological and physical sciences. The goal will be to make electric fish part of the science curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
