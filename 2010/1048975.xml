    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the workshop is to establish the fundamental research challenges for trustworthy biometric systems in identity management. The link between biological identity as we know it today and our digital persona is rapidly changing where transactions in the cyberspace rely on establishment of trust. The intersection between personal identity, biometrics (measured identity), and identity in cyberspace is the topic of this workshop. In cyberspace, there is opportunity to create multiple digital identities (or pseudonyms) to one human identity, where guarded anonymity and privacy preserving tools are needed which provide levels of trust and scale in the information content linked to true identity. Biometrics, based on physiologic or behavioral measurements, is a technology that fundamentally ties an individual to a transaction/location and may be a tool to establish trust enabling identity management for a wide array of applications, including border control, information technology, e-commerce, and war-time environments. There is a need to develop methodologies that address privacy, acceptability, usability, and security of stored and transmitted biometric information. The proposed workshop will bring a team of interested individuals from academia, government, and industry to discuss fundamentals and future directions in identity science related to privacy, trust, and security.</AbstractNarration>
