    <AbstractNarration>This award funds students to attend a summer school in Bangalore, India, hosted by IIT-Bangalore in India from May 23 - 30, 2010. The goal of this school is to expose graduate students and young researchers to new and important ideas in concurrent and real-time programming. Concurrency is an important topic involved in design of new hyper-threading techniques in computer architectures, specification of non-blocking data structures and algorithms, implementation of scalable computer farms for handling massive data sets, and the design of a robust software architecture for distributed business processes. Recent architectural advances in multi-core and many-core architectures have made this an essential topic for a serious student of computer science. The focus will be on real-time systems, programming language design, program analysis, specification, and implementation as they relate to concurrent systems. Real-time issues are important in many kinds of critical embedded and other types of systems. The trip to India will also be an international experience and a community-building experience for the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>
