    <AbstractNarration>The shortage of women in computer science related education is a significant and continuing problem. This effort is engaging high school, college freshman, and college sophomore women in information assurance (IA) activities. The project is increasing the participation of women in SFS-related areas and attracting women to specifically explore and work on IA efforts. A three-phase plan is being utilized to increase IA visibility and hands-on experiences to acquaint female students with IA. Phase I provides rising 11th and 12th grade high school girls a summer-camp experience, exposing them to the careers and opportunities in IA. Phase II exposes freshman women to long-term research experiences where they work collaboratively to solve real problems; increasing their motivation to work in the information assurance field. Phase III engages sophomores in summer internships with federal agencies, where they explore opportunities that will enable them to contribute to the national good. A mentoring program has been established for the women participating in all phases of the project and an advisory board of female faculty from CAE/IAE or CAE-R institutions is helping guide the efforts.</AbstractNarration>
