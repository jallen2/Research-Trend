    <AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;This project will make use of computer simulation techniques to understand how different ways that scientists make day to day choices might influence the ability of the community of scientists to succeed in learning about the world. Through decades of careful study, we now have a deeper understanding of the various factors that influence choices and beliefs of scientists. While we now understand the causes of scientists' behavior better, we do not have a very detailed understanding how science as a whole is influenced by the small scale choices of individual scientists. Here are some questions of that sort that need to be addressed. Does misconduct on the part of a few scientists have a effect on the reliability of science as a whole? If scientists are motivated by particular political ends, does this color the output of their research?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The PI will employ new simulation methods from the physical and social sciences in order to answer three primary questions: What are better and worse social arrangements for science? What is the effect of different ?impure? behaviors on the overall reliability of scientific practice? And what is the effect of efforts to reduce these impure behaviors? Learning the answers to these questions will both help us understand when scientific communities should be trusted and when they should be questioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Beyond its contribution to the scholarly understanding of science, this research will also help to guide science policy so that scientific disciplines might be made better. The PI also plans to develop courses for both graduate and undergraduate students to help further the understanding of scientific practice.</AbstractNarration>
