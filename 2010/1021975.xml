    <AbstractNarration>Alice is a high-impact, high-interest program visualization environment, that is increasingly being used to teach novices object-oriented programming in a range of courses. Results provide evidence that using Alice can significantly improve achievement, retention and recruitment of high-risk CS majors during their first year. This project is expanding the capabilities of Alice by integrating an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). The ITS has three major functions: 1) intelligent delivery of individualized instructional materials, 2) automatic detection of off-task student behavior and 3) the ability to alert instructors that a student may be having difficulties. Expected project outcomes include the enhanced version of Alice with the ITS and additional curricular materials. Assessment is designed to determine if student achievement and attitudes improve as a result of using the ITS. The PIs expect to grow the community of ITS developers for computing education. The Alice community includes hundreds of college faculty and high school teachers across a diverse collection of settings and has been used by thousands of students.</AbstractNarration>
