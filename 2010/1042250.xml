    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of a&lt;br/&gt;high-performance FPGA implementation of full 3-D seismic Waveform Inversion (WFI), the&lt;br/&gt;most advanced and resource-demanding seismic imaging application used today in the oil and gas&lt;br/&gt;industry. The objective of WFI is to estimate a model of the Earth?s subsurface that minimizes&lt;br/&gt;the difference between recorded data and synthetic simulated data derived from an iteratively&lt;br/&gt;adjusted Earth model. The computational kernel of WFI is the 3-D wave equation in a&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous medium. This equation is solved repeatedly in a gradient optimization process&lt;br/&gt;yielding highly accurate seismic images. The deliverable of the Phase I project will be a novel&lt;br/&gt;Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of an especially optimized WFI kernel&lt;br/&gt;in the form of a socket compliant special-purpose device. In a continuation Phase II project, the&lt;br/&gt;Phase I deliverable will be evolved into a prototype full-fledged implementation of WFI,&lt;br/&gt;delivering order-of-magnitudes improvements in performance over conventional software&lt;br/&gt;implementations on traditional hardware. As microprocessors reach the limits of attainable clock&lt;br/&gt;frequencies and power consumption, there is a growing need in the oil and gas industry to go&lt;br/&gt;beyond conventional computer software/hardware solutions. The proposed project addresses this&lt;br/&gt;need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to usher in a new era of low impact,&lt;br/&gt;low energy, and much higher-performance computing in the oil and gas industry. FPGA&lt;br/&gt;computing is likely to become a disruptive technology for geophysical exploration, allowing&lt;br/&gt;unprecedented improvements in capability and performance. With the proposed technology, 3-D&lt;br/&gt;seismic data will be processed faster, and used more effectively to characterize and delineate oil&lt;br/&gt;and gas reservoirs in extremely complicated geological settings. Furthermore, the proposed&lt;br/&gt;technology will enable WFI in production settings. The urgent need for this new capability is&lt;br/&gt;highlighted by domestic and foreign oil companies' recent announcements that their main&lt;br/&gt;technological focus and critical requirements are for increasingly challenging environments. In&lt;br/&gt;this context, the accurate, higher resolution, and faster seismic imaging enabled by FPGAs will&lt;br/&gt;have economic impact by: (1) improving the odds of finding new deposits of oil and gas, (2)&lt;br/&gt;reducing extraction and development costs by providing higher imaging accuracy, (3) increasing&lt;br/&gt;the amount of hydrocarbons recovered, augmenting the national oil and gas reserves, reducing&lt;br/&gt;dependence on foreign oil, and benefiting the U.S. economy.</AbstractNarration>
