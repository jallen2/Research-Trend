    <AbstractNarration>Circadian rhythms are important biological signals that have been found in almost all major groups of life from bacteria to man. Yet, it remains unclear if any members of the second major prokaryotic domain of life, the Archaea, also possess a biological clock. From an evolutionary perspective, the study of the Archaea is of great relevance, as their origin and relationship to the eukaryotes and bacteria thus far remains unresolved. Interestingly, DNA sequence information has revealed the presence of circadian gene homologs, known as kaiC, throughout a number of diverse archaeal genomes. KaiC is a major driver of the cyanobacterial circadian clock that acts to regulate rhythmic gene expression and to control the timing of cell division. To date, experimental evidence has not been provided to explain a functional role for any of these archaeal kaiC homologs. This project focuses on examining both the genetic regulation of four kaiC homologs found in the genome of the model system, the obligate halophilic, or salt-loving, archaeon Haloferax volcanii, as well as performing targeted gene knockouts to ascertain their true function. Evidence suggests that these four genes are regulated by diurnal cycles of light and darkness. Specific objectives for this research have been designed to define and characterize what role, if any, these circadian rhythm genes are playing in the Archaea. The following questions are addressed: How important is each of the four H. volcanii circadian-like genes in contributing to diurnal light sensing?; Are these genes inter-dependent for proper function? A multi-faceted experimental approach will involve classical genetics and microbiology, molecular biology, and protein biochemistry. These experiments will give a more complete picture regarding the nature of the ubiquitous kaiC homologs found among the Archaea. These results will provide the necessary first steps for better understanding if Archaea do indeed have some type of circadian clock, cyanobacterial-like, or otherwise. Alternatively, if the circadian clock hypothesis is dispelled following these experiments, the results will nevertheless be important in improved understanding of the role played by the haloarchaeal kaiC homologs, and, by association, the kaiC homologs found among the Archaea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;All of the proposed research will take place at Rider University, a small, liberal arts school that does not have graduate programs in the sciences. Thus, undergraduate involvement in this work is imperative for the timely completion of the proposed experiments. The PI is committed to the training of undergraduates in bench research, public speaking, and scientific writing. Greater than 70% of students mentored in the Bidle lab over the last nine years (n=40) have been female and 30% were underrepresented minorities (African-, Caribbean-, Latin-, or Arab-Americans). Nearly half of these 40 students have been accepted into graduate (both Ph.D. and Master's level) or professional (Medical, Nursing, Dental, Veterinary) programs. Students mentored in the Bidle lab have been the recipients of national research awards in microbiology, have been listed as authors on peer-reviewed journal publications and present their data at national scientific meetings each year. These students are trained in fundamental techniques covering a host of disciplines including genetics, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and microbiology. Hands-on, experiential learning is fostered in the Bidle lab, leading to the graduation of well-trained, next-generation life scientists.</AbstractNarration>
