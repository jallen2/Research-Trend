    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1034753&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jozef H. Przytycki, Mikhail G. Khovanov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal asks for financial support for US based&lt;br/&gt; participants, for a 3-week long summer program devoted to Knot&lt;br/&gt; Theory: Knots in Poland III: conference on Knot Theory and its&lt;br/&gt; Ramifications. It will be a conference interspersed with&lt;br/&gt; specialized workshops and tutorials. It will be third&lt;br/&gt; conference in the series of large, very successful international&lt;br/&gt; conferences ``Knots in Poland". The conferences will take place&lt;br/&gt; in Warsaw July 18-25 and in Banach Center in Bedlewo July&lt;br/&gt; 25-August 4, 2010. Specifically, we propose to support about 15&lt;br/&gt; graduate students and 10 mathematicians without grant. As part&lt;br/&gt; of the conference we will have a series of 3 talks by Tom Mrowka&lt;br/&gt; on his proof that Khovanov homology can be understood as a page&lt;br/&gt; in a spectral sequence converging to a version of Instanton&lt;br/&gt; Floer homology. A consequence of this is that Khovanov homology&lt;br/&gt; detects the unknot. Knots have fascinated people from the dawn&lt;br/&gt; of the human history. Much of the early knot theory was&lt;br/&gt; motivated by physics and chemistry (e.g. Kelvin theory of vortex&lt;br/&gt; atoms). The fundamental problem in knot theory is to be able to&lt;br/&gt; distinguish non-equivalent knots. There have been exciting new&lt;br/&gt; developments in the area of Knot Theory in recent years. From&lt;br/&gt; the Jones, Homflypt, and Kauffman polynomials, through quantum&lt;br/&gt; invariants of 3-manifolds, Topological Quantum Field Theories,&lt;br/&gt; to relations with gauge theory type invariants in 4-dimensional&lt;br/&gt; topology (Donaldson, Witten, etc). More recently, Khovanov&lt;br/&gt; introduced homology theory of links which categorifies the Jones&lt;br/&gt; polynomial (a chain complex is build on the Kauffman model of&lt;br/&gt; the Jones polynomial). Soon after, Ozsvath and Szabo developed&lt;br/&gt; Heegaard-Floer homology, that lifts the Alexander polynomial.&lt;br/&gt; These two significantly different theories are closely related&lt;br/&gt; and the dependencies are the object of intensive study. One can&lt;br/&gt; mention here Khovanov-Rozansky categorification of Homflypt&lt;br/&gt; polynomial, categorification of the Kauffman bracket skein&lt;br/&gt; module of some 3-dimensional manifolds, and the result of&lt;br/&gt; T.Mrowka that Khovanov homology detects the unknot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject has significant applications and relations with&lt;br/&gt;biology, physics, chemistry and the theory of computation. We&lt;br/&gt;feel that a conference on this subject is highly appropriate at&lt;br/&gt;this time, and we strive to be in the frontier of new development&lt;br/&gt;in knot theory and its ramifications. The project has broader&lt;br/&gt;impact in several aspects. Knots in Poland conference brings&lt;br/&gt;together from all over the word, third-world countries, former&lt;br/&gt;Soviet Union, minorities, women, and provides an opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;researchers and students to share their latest ideas and to&lt;br/&gt;collaborate with each other. The knowledge obtained on this&lt;br/&gt;occasion will be disseminated by participants throughout the&lt;br/&gt;world. Distinguished researchers (including about 10 woman) will&lt;br/&gt;deliver plenary talks surveying the state of knowledge related to&lt;br/&gt;Knot Theory and its Ramifications. PhD students and fresh PhD's&lt;br/&gt;will be encouraged to attend. We expect to publish conference&lt;br/&gt;proceedings (as we did in the past) containing cutting-edge&lt;br/&gt;research papers and lecture notes which will be suitable for&lt;br/&gt;research mathematicians, students and readers with background in&lt;br/&gt;other exact sciences, including biology, chemistry, computer&lt;br/&gt;science, and physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference Web Page:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~traczyk/knotpol2010/&lt;http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/%7Etraczyk/knotpol2010/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
