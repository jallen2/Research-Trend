    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to bring together faculty and students from the U.S. Southwest area through a workshop on theoretical and applied topics pertaining to cyber-physical systems (CPS). The target U.S. Southwest area, which comprises the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah, has numerous active research projects of interest to the global CPS community. Through this single-track workshop, which will take place during the Fall of 2010 at the University of Arizona, Tucson, participants will have an opportunity to present new results and explore new venues to contribute to CPS. Additionally, invited speakers from academia and government agencies will deliver technical and informative talks on open problems, opportunities, and future directions of CPS research. The workshop will provide funds to graduate students, faculty, and invitees to attend the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will promote the exchange and discussion of creative ideas across the multidisciplinary fields bridged by CPS. This workshop is a key step in materializing the collaborative vision of CPS, regionally within the Southwest as well as nationally as a potential model activity across the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will strengthen collaboration between universities in the Southwest region on topics of national interests. It will provide an ideal venue for dissemination of research results of the participants. The involvement of participants from EPSCOR states will promote new research collaborative activities enlarging their research capabilities. The workshop will provide graduate students a unique opportunity to present and discuss their research with peers and experienced researchers in a semiformal environment. It will consist of the first workshop on CPS in the region, the goal being to have it organized yearly by participants from other institutions within the region. Dissemination of workshop information will be primarily through the workshop website supplemented by e-mail.</AbstractNarration>
