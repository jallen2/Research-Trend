    <AbstractNarration>1033468&lt;br/&gt;Young&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green chemistry and green engineering approaches are the product and process design philosophies necessary to unite continuing economic prosperity with environmental and public health protection. The sharing of the precepts and advances in these areas within the expert community and with potential new students has been the mission of the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute, utilizing the annual Green Chemistry &amp; Engineering Conference as chief vehicle. Dr. Jennifer Young serves as the PI for ACS Green Chemistry Institute. The theme of the 14th Annual Conference is Innovation and Application which is aligned with current imperatives for science studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is expected to draw some 400+ experts from industry, academe and government to discuss the concepts and recent advances in the areas. The student participants will be exposed to this exciting environment including the principles of green chemistry and engineering, the newest research in the area and the approaches and methodologies for dealing with environmental issues in an economically beneficial manner. In addition, they will have a forum for presenting their own research and for developing potential future collaborations. Specific student-oriented events will include a full day Student Workshop following the conference proceedings which will focus on hands-on outreach activities to bring back to their respective communities, a student research poster session with prizes, and a student award session concurrent with the presentation of the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards by the Environmental Protection Agency.The NSF award is to fund travel grants, student housing and conference registration for under-graduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, as well as to cover Workshop Instructor expenses.</AbstractNarration>
