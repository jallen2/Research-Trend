    <AbstractNarration>This project is creating a model alternative energy certificate program, that leads to a new Associate of Applied Sciences degree in industrial technology and a new certificate program for wind energy technicians. The project is establishing career pathways to technical work in the renewable energy fields. The specific needs for a renewable energy certificate are being identified, and space in the planned Community Technology Center is to be devoted to the laboratory areas needed for the program. The A.A.S. degree in industrial technology is meeting the needs of students and incumbent workers by providing a clear career pathway from an industry-related certificate to an A.A.S. degree and then to a baccalaureate degree. The new A.A.S. degree is meeting the needs of industry by encouraging students and incumbent workers who earn a technical certificate to pursue the additional education/training that offers the most benefits to the worker and the employer. That additional education focuses on areas often referred to as "soft skills", for example, communication, teamwork and critical thinking. The need for soft skills in the industry workplace is widely recognized and has been documented in a number of reports.</AbstractNarration>
