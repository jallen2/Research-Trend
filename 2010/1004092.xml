    <AbstractNarration>1004092&lt;br/&gt;Mahesh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a workshop proposal to support a gathering of CAREER eligible faculty at the 2009 APS/DFD meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The workshop will involve discussion of CAREER Award criteria and issues by NSF personnel and discussion among CAREER eligible faculty and past CAREER awardees&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This is not a typical proposal in terms of specific "intellectual merit." The merit of this workshop is to make new faculty more aware of what NSF is looking for in CAREER proposals to help young faculty focus their efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Besides the specific goal of informing new faculty what NSF is looking for in CAREER proposals, this workshop will also provide an opportunity for new faculty to learn more about NSF. This includes NSF budgets, trends in grants and awards and other information that will be useful to new faculty in submitting proposals to NSF. A specific effort will be made to invite faculty from under represented groups to this workshop.</AbstractNarration>
