    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1006180&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Lei Ni, Zhiqin Lu, &lt;br/&gt;Chuu-Lian Terng, Benjamin Weinkove&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to continue the Southern California Geometric Analysis Seminar (SCGAS). This Seminar has been supported by the NSF since 1991. Geometric analysis is an important part of modern mathematics and is related to many other branches of mathematics. Using analysis as its main tool and differential geometry, topology and algebraic geometry as foundations, it has solved a large number of problems in global geometry, topology, several complex variables and mathematical physics. There is much enthusiasm for its continuation among geometers, analysts and mathematicians of related fields at institutions from the southern California, as well as young geometric analysts cross the country. It is the unique annual meeting of its kind in the Southern California area, and continues to foster interest in geometric analysis at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Seminar is to promote interaction among mathematicians in Southern California who are interested in geometric analysis and related areas and to introduce graduate students and post-docs to some of the best works in geometric analysis. The SCGAS has become an important and anticipated event for the Southern California region, as the success of the first sixteen meetings has demonstrated. In fact the SCGAS also attracts a substantial number of participants from all over the country. The Seminar, organized jointly by UC-San Diego and UC-Irvine, will continue its commitment to encourage and support participation of graduate students and recent PhDs, especially young women and minority mathematicians, and will continue to invite top women mathematicians as speakers. As a new feature to our proposal we will include a junior speaker for the proposed meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference has a website at: http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~scgas/</AbstractNarration>
