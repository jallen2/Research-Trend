    <AbstractNarration>The second cumulant tensor of a multivariate distribution is its&lt;br/&gt;covariance matrix, which provides a partial description of its&lt;br/&gt;dependence structure (complete in the Gaussian case). Innumerable&lt;br/&gt;successful statistical methods are based on analyzing the covariance&lt;br/&gt;matrix, e.g. imposing rank restrictions as in principal component&lt;br/&gt;analysis or zeros in its inverse as in Gaussian graphical models.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the covariance matrix plays a critical role in optimization&lt;br/&gt;in finance and other areas involving optimization of risky payoffs,&lt;br/&gt;since it is the bilinear form yielding the variance of a linear&lt;br/&gt;combination of variables. For multivariate, non-Gaussian data, the&lt;br/&gt;covariance matrix is an incomplete description of the dependence&lt;br/&gt;structure. Cumulant tensors are the multivariate generalization of&lt;br/&gt;univariate skewness and kurtosis and the higher-order generalization&lt;br/&gt;of covariance matrices, and allow a more complete description of&lt;br/&gt;dependence. The research investigates a number of problems in theory,&lt;br/&gt;estimation, algorithms, and applications around modeling higher-order&lt;br/&gt;non-Gaussian dependence with cumulant tensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data arising from modern applications like computer vision, finance,&lt;br/&gt;and computational biology are rarely well described by a normal&lt;br/&gt;distribution, though analysis often proceeds as if they were. For&lt;br/&gt;example, one cause of the financial crisis and the damage it did to&lt;br/&gt;many investors was an over-reliance on the variance-based risk&lt;br/&gt;measures appropriate primarily for normal distributions. This can&lt;br/&gt;allow risk to be in a sense hidden in the higher-order structure,&lt;br/&gt;where it can be ignored or even made worse by application of&lt;br/&gt;traditional risk metrics. Cumulant tensors provide a promising avenue&lt;br/&gt;for modeling higher-order dependence. Success in developing these&lt;br/&gt;models will have broad impacts in the analysis of real-world data with&lt;br/&gt;complex dependence, particularly in modeling and managing financial&lt;br/&gt;risk and in dimension reduction, and could help improve the robustness&lt;br/&gt;of parts of the financial system.</AbstractNarration>
