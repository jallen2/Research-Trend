    <AbstractNarration>Bolivia represents one of the world's richest countries for mosses. Mosses are among the smallest of plants; however they play a major role in the Andean ecosystem, particularly in the mountain forest and humid puna (alpine) regions. These plants quickly absorb water from rainfall or fog mist, and then gradually release the water into the immediate environment, thus they moderate water flow, arrest erosion, and assist in preventing landslides and flooding down slope. Continuing degradation of the existing natural landscape in Bolivia (e.g., deforestation), coupled with rapid deglaciation, will have a major impact on the ecosystem, particularly the availability of water. This project will provide documentation of the more than 900 mosses in the country through field inventories of the highly diverse ecological regions of Bolivia. This 'Final Phase' project will complete the researchers' goal to document the diversity of mosses in Bolivia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive text and database collections will be made accessible by a project web page to the scientific community and general public. Two major publications will be produced; first, an illustrated guide to the 69 families and 275 genera, intended for beginning students or those unfamiliar with mosses; second, a technical illustrated treatment for species identification intended for biologists and conservationists. To promote public awareness of these organisms, educational material will be prepared specifically for high school and university students, park staff, and those interested in natural history. Furthermore, environmental changes make it critical and timely that the ecological role of these organisms be documented. The collection data and descriptive treatments of the mosses will provide the means to study further the diversity and ecological role of these organisms. Through workshops and direct collaboration the project will foster a community of Bolivians with the experience and expertise to ensure continuation of bryological knowledge and research for future generations in the country.</AbstractNarration>
