    <AbstractNarration>Given a graph, such as a social/computer network, or the blogo-&lt;br/&gt;sphere, how will a virus (or rumor or new product) propagate in&lt;br/&gt;it? Will it take over, creating a pandemic? How to select the&lt;br/&gt;'k' best nodes/edges for immunization, or, conversely, the best&lt;br/&gt;'k' blogs for the fastest dissemination of a new idea? The an-&lt;br/&gt;swer to such questions is vital, for public health, for network&lt;br/&gt;security, for market penetration, for blog monitoring and many&lt;br/&gt;more applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the PI's past work, they studied arbitrary graphs, and showed&lt;br/&gt;that propagation depends on a single number, namely, the first&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network. Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;they studied the so-called 'epidemic threshold' for flu-like&lt;br/&gt;propagation (``SIS'' model = susceptible-infectious-susceptible),&lt;br/&gt;on un-directed, un-weighted static graphs. All earlier work fo-&lt;br/&gt;cused on full cliques, or homogeneous graphs, or specific cases&lt;br/&gt;of power-law graphs - *all* of which are special cases of the&lt;br/&gt;PI's eigenvalue result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major thrusts of the current proposal are two. The first is&lt;br/&gt;*theory*: For a mumps-like model (``SIR'' = susceptible - infect-&lt;br/&gt;ed - recovered), and for additional models, when will a virus re-&lt;br/&gt;sult in a pandemic? What can we say about weighted graphs? About&lt;br/&gt;time-evolving graphs, like an ad-hoc network of mobile phone&lt;br/&gt;users? The second thrust is on *algorithms*: Given a graph, a&lt;br/&gt;virus model (SIS, SIR, etc), and a fixed budget of 'k'&lt;br/&gt;nodes/edges to immunize, how can we quickly find an optimal or&lt;br/&gt;near-optimal solution, to best contain the virus? How can we&lt;br/&gt;modify the algorithm, when the network changes over time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TECHNICAL MERIT of the work is that it is the first to focus&lt;br/&gt;on *arbitrary* graphs, thus including real ones. In contrast,&lt;br/&gt;the vast majority of past analytical work makes unrealistic as-&lt;br/&gt;sumptions about the graph topology (cliques, homogeneous graphs&lt;br/&gt;etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BROADER IMPACT is high, as dynamics of large-scale graphs ap-&lt;br/&gt;pear in numerous settings: cascades on blogs; product penetration&lt;br/&gt;and viral marketing; rumor/information propagation; immunization&lt;br/&gt;policies; advertisement policies etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page: URL:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/NSF-PROJECTS/Immunization/</AbstractNarration>
