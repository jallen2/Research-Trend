    <AbstractNarration>During the course of this CAREER award, Professor Kathryn Zurek from the University of Michigan aims to continue her interdisciplinary work at the boundary between particle physics and astrophysics/cosmology. In the area of collider phenomenology, the PI plans to pursue signature-based studies of physics beyond the Standard Model, especially as it concerns the nature of dark matter. The PI also plans to also continue her work to ensure that unexpected physics --- such as that emerging from a possible low-mass hidden sector (or so-called ``Hidden Valley'') --- is not missed in analyses of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the astrophysics and cosmology side of her work, the PI plans to focus on the indirect detection of dark matter, and on the construction and analysis of various models of neutrino physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity also includes a major program of education and outreach, with three specific public-outreach activities planned. The first is to develop, in collaboration with the Exhibit Museum for Natural History at the University of Michigan, a segment visualizing dark matter and its detection, on scales from the earth to clusters of galaxies. Such a segment will have a reach of 18,000 annual visitors to the museum planetarium, and many more through distribution to other planetaria nationwide. Second, the PI will present public lectures in a very popular Saturday-morning lecture series at the University of Michigan, discussing the existence of dark matter and the fundamental physics of cosmic anti-matter. Approximately 500 people attend these lectures in person, with much wider availability made through the University television station and iTunes U downloads on the web. Finally, the PI will act as a role model, and plan activities and demonstrations in a "Science for Tomorrow" program which is specifically designed to reach girls and minority youth interested in careers in science.</AbstractNarration>
