    <AbstractNarration>Since 2006, the annual workshop for Women in Machine Learning (WiML) has brought together female&lt;br/&gt;researchers in industry and academia, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students from the machine&lt;br/&gt;learning community to exchange research ideas and build mentoring and networking relationships. The&lt;br/&gt;one-day workshop has been especially beneficial for junior graduate students, giving them a supportive&lt;br/&gt;environment in which to present their research (in many cases, for the first time) and enabling them to&lt;br/&gt;meet peers and more senior researchers in the field of machine learning. The networking opportunities&lt;br/&gt;provided by the workshop have also helped senior graduate students find jobs following graduation.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This workshop will advance machine learning knowledge and foster collaboration&lt;br/&gt;within the machine learning community. As invited speakers, established researchers at top universities&lt;br/&gt;and research labs will teach workshop participants about cutting-edge ideas from diverse areas of&lt;br/&gt;machine learning. Students will present their own research and receive valuable feedback from both&lt;br/&gt;senior researchers and their peers. By enabling women at all stages of their careers in machine learning to&lt;br/&gt;exchange research ideas and form new relationships, we expect that new connections and research&lt;br/&gt;collaborations will be established, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art of the field.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This workshop will provide a forum for female graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,&lt;br/&gt;junior and senior faculty, and industry and government research scientists to exchange research ideas and&lt;br/&gt;establish networking and mentoring relationships. Undergraduates, particularly those who are interested&lt;br/&gt;in pursuing graduate school or industry positions in machine learning, are also welcome to attend.&lt;br/&gt;Bringing together women from different stages of their careers gives established researchers the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to act as mentors, and enables junior women to find female role models working in the field&lt;br/&gt;of machine learning. The workshop will also benefit the wider machine learning community: Firstly, the&lt;br/&gt;WiML website, which lists all previous workshop presenters, serves as a useful resource for organizations&lt;br/&gt;looking for female invited speakers. Secondly, co-locating with a major machine learning conference&lt;br/&gt;enhances the visibility of female researchers among the wider machine learning community. Thirdly,&lt;br/&gt;travel funding provided to workshop participants also facilitates their travel to the co-located conference,&lt;br/&gt;which for some participants would otherwise not be possible. Finally, all workshop materials (slides,&lt;br/&gt;abstracts, etc.) will be made available on the workshop website in order to ensure broad dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
