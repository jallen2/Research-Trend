    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the design of a robust and low-cost enzyme immobilization system to increase the cost-competitiveness of bio-catalytic processes. The lack of a universal, sound, and affordable enzyme immobilization technique has been a large barrier to widespread deployment of bio-catalysis for chemical production, which hold immense promise for reducing the chemical industry?s environmental footprint. This Phase I project will lift this barrier by developing a robust and low-cost enzyme immobilization system with broad application for many different bioprocesses using one of Arzeda Corp.?s proprietary enzymes as the basis of the binding strategy. Ultimately, this project will lead to an economically viable system for immobilization of any enzyme on a bio-catalysis column with increased catalytic efficiency and longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research result from the fact that Arzeda has the only proven technology to design novel enzymes with catalytic machinery not existing in nature And is helping address many of the most pressing needs of the bio-refinery industry:&lt;br/&gt;? Developing bio-catalytic routes to currently inaccessible renewable chemicals and&lt;br/&gt;? Increasing profitability through extending enzyme lifetime and increasing enzyme lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;As such, Arzeda sees the success of this project as a way to increase the adoption of bio-catalysis and thereby increase the market for its enzyme products. To achieve this, Arzeda will apply its core technology along with the proposed enzyme immobilization strategy to develop bioprocesses enabling high value, renewable chemicals from biomass.</AbstractNarration>
