    <AbstractNarration>The project "RMR-TTU: Recruitment, Mentoring, and Research in Mathematics and Science at Texas Tech University" is being introduced to provide research, academic, and financial opportunities that encourage 60 students to pursue and complete degrees in the mathematical and biological sciences. Students will be paired with faculty to work on a variety of projects integrating mathematics and biology and will participate in a range of activities (e.g. formal courses, annual RMR-TTU colloquia, and participation in local, regional, and national meetings) designed to expose them to all aspects of research in biomathematics. RMR-TTU will implement several key best practices across disciplinary boundaries, including targeted recruiting, summer research opportunities for high school and university students, academic year research projects, and peer mentoring activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in the RMR-TTU program will gain first-hand knowledge of the research process in a way that is not possible in a traditional educational format. They will be part of a fully functional research team spanning different academic departments and colleges, yet also with one-on-one training between students and mentors. Because this program will reach students at early stages in their academic development and involve them in all stages of conducting research, it will prepare them for graduate school and subsequent careers. The project will recruit the cohorts from majors at the host institution and from local high schools with a strong emphasis on underrepresented groups. The West Texas area contains a large number of very sparsely populated areas with higher than average populations of Hispanics and first generation college students. Thus, the impact of this program will be significant locally and regionally as it provides exposure to advanced math education to students from economically disadvantaged groups and in geographically isolated regions. The number of new degree students has the potential to transform the scientific knowledge base of the rural communities of West Texas.</AbstractNarration>
