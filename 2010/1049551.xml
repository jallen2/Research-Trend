    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Hisashi Yamamoto of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago will continue his efforts in developing catalysts based on chiral tethered bis(8-quinolinolato) metal complexes (TBOxM) for modern chemical synthesis. This class of complexes provides well defined and rigid configuration and has been shown to be capable of introducing a high level of enantiocontrol in several different reactions. In the next funding period, two specific aims will be explored. The first aim is to study TBOxM for Lewis acid catalysis and the second aim is to study them for redox reaction catalysis. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students, broadening participation through the inclusion of researchers on the project, and continuing to build a useful chemical transformation strategy for the society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such chemistry will contribute to build the solid base of molecular engineering in the future. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on any area of activity in which the synthesis of catalyst is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, material, and the biological research activities based on chemistry. In addition to the impact that would derive from adoption of this area of research by the wider community, the project offers an excellent training ground for both graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
