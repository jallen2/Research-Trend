    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 07-09268&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Du, Xiaojiang&lt;br/&gt;Institution: North Dakota State University &lt;br/&gt; Fargo, ND 58105-5756&lt;br/&gt;Title: A Heterogeneous Sensor Network Laboratory for Integrated Research and Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, building a Heterogeneous Sensor Network (HSN) testbed consisting of 100 low-end and 20 high-end sensors, and 4 workstations, studies the capacity (throughput) and lifetime limits of HSNs. The testbed aims to support the following projects regarding HSNs: &lt;br/&gt;. Determining Fundamental Performance Limits;&lt;br/&gt;. Investigating Innovative Network Architectures; and&lt;br/&gt;. Designing Secure and Efficient Time Synchronization Schemes.&lt;br/&gt;The former studies capacity (throughput) and lifetime limits to provide insight to the design of better protocols and algorithms. The second project investigates architectures that support reliable and efficient clustering and communications. The latter concentrates on the design of secure and efficient time synchronization schemes. Performance evaluation includes energy consumption, signal strength, communication overhead, computation overhead, storage requirement, data delivery rate (throughput), end-to-end delay, security, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The infrastructure contributes to attract underrepresented groups (including Native Americans, female, low income, and first generation students) in an EPSCoR state. Is also contributes to military, homeland security, health care, environment, agriculture, manufacturing, and other areas where sensor networks have applications.</AbstractNarration>
