    <AbstractNarration>Science of Learning Center Initiatives for Translational Science: The Ultimate Block Party and LEARN&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to bring representatives of the Science of Learning Centers together to discuss ways to disseminate the rapidly accumulating science of learning to the lay public and to educators. Scientists who study how children learn have long known that play and playful engagement is the source of much learning that prepares children for success in school and in life. Research indicates that when learning takes place in a playful manner, it can be extended to solve problems in new situations, it is retained longer, and it gains additional meaning as it links up to what learners already know. The broad goal of the proposed workshop is to increase the amount, the nature, and the effectiveness of outreach on the science of learning to the lay public and to educators. Through attendance at the Ultimate Block Party in New York City -- a radical new form of scientific dissemination -- and a subsequent workshop, representatives from Science of Learning Centers will pursue three goals: To increase cooperation between the Centers for improving and expanding outreach to the community (both local and national); to observe and evaluate how families engage in playful, informal learning at the Ultimate Block Party; and to develop new ways to communicate the nuggets of science to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of this project is that it contributes to America's future. America needs to educate its citizens about the science of learning so that the next generation of individuals to enter the work force 30 years hence have the skills required to succeed. Families and educators must understand how children learn best to be able to provide them with the experiences that foster the development of the competencies demanded in the 21st century workplace. The days when children could learn just the '3Rs' have passed; tomorrow's children need to know content as well how to collaborate and communicate across international lines, how to engage in critical thinking to question and integrate vast amounts of information, and how to have the creativity and confidence to persevere that have been key to America's economic strength.</AbstractNarration>
