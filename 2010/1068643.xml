    <AbstractNarration>This grant will support a workshop focused on developing ideas for a training course in marine microbial genomics, consistent with recommendations of the US-European Commission Taskforce on Biotechnology Research. Leading scientists from the US and Europe will meet in October, 2010 in Washington, DC. These experts will discuss recent scientific progress in marine microbiology that has accrued from modern genomic approaches, as well as opportunities and challenges for continued progress given the fast pace of genome technology advances. Analyses of the state of the science and technology will then frame consideration of the most effective ways to train next-generation scientists who will capitalize on these advances and tackle the technological challenges, a prerequisite for continued progress in this important scientific area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop sessions will examine the computational methods used to process large amounts of DNA sequence information, current and future DNA sequencing methodologies and tools being used to connect gene and genome sequence information with functional properties of the relevant microbes. The outcome of the presentations and discussions will be a workshop report that provides an overview of critical issues and provides recommendations from each session. It will also include a basic description of an advanced training course on the topic of genomic analyses of marine microbes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: this entire grant is focused on the needs of the United States and the European Commission to continue to work together in the field of marine microbial genomics in order to expedite advances in basic sciences and in biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
