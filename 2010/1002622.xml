    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental condensed-matter physics research on a new class of materials that are relevant to future energy applications and advanced electronic devices. This class of materials exhibits new physical properties that cannot be understood with traditional ideas. Using the complementary expertise of the investigators, this project will explore the fundamental physics underlying the new emergent phenomena, both at the surface and in the bulk, utilizing the most sophisticated growth and characterization techniques. Any device application will utilize the properties of surfaces or interfaces. The ultimate goal is to address one of the grand challenges of materials science: how do complex phenomena emerge from simple ingredients? This research project offers an ideal training ground for undergraduate and graduate students, post docs, and visiting scholars, exposing them in frontier scientific research. In particular, two PhD students, supported through this project, will obtain hands-on experience in state-of-the-art instrumentation, and will be well trained for future careers either in academia, national laboratories, or industries. In addition undergraduate students, who are "Chancellor's Future Leaders in Research," will spend several years during their undergraduate tenure involved with this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This research project is designed to study the surface and bulk physical properties of newly discovered transition-metal layered compounds. This class of materials has characteristically strong coupling between charge, spin, lattice, and orbital degrees of freedom. The physical properties of these materials are extremely susceptible to a subtle change either internally (chemical doping), or externally such as the creation of a surface, or the application of a magnetic field or pressure. Using the complementary expertise of the investigators, this project will explore the fundamental physics underlying the emergent phenomena seen in the bulk or in the environment of broken symmetry generated by the creation of a surface. Research and educational training will utilize the most sophisticated techniques for growth and characterization (on at atomic scale). The ultimate goal is to address one of the grand challenges of materials science: how do complex phenomena emerge from simple ingredients? Two PhD students, supported through this project, will have hands-on experience in frontier scientific research, and be well trained for careers either in academia, national laboratories, or industries. The project will also involve two or more "Chancellor's Future Leaders in Research" undergraduate students during their four years as undergraduates at LSU.</AbstractNarration>
