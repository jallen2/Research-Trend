    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on development of materials for production of energy from biomass. Liquid fuels and hydrogen can be produced from biomass, promoting energy independence and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. New catalyst materials that are resistant to contaminants found in biomass are needed to make these processes more economical and efficient. In this project, new materials will be fabricated, studied, developed, and then tested in simulated process streams. Effects of process conditions on catalyst performance will be studied and used to produce high-performing materials. The end goal is development of catalysts that can operate in the full range of contaminants found in biomass sources, reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of fuel production from biomass. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are related to reduced dependence of the United States on fossil fuels, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions while promoting energy independence. Unlike fuel crops, biomass is a waste product that has no use for human consumption, so the technology does not compete with food sources. The technology being developed could have application to a wide range of other catalytic reactions as well. The work being carried out during this project will improve understanding of catalyst deactivation from contaminants. Overall, the project will contribute novel results to the body of literature in catalysis and materials development.</AbstractNarration>
