    <AbstractNarration>This NSF award will provide partial financial support for the Twentieth &lt;br/&gt;International Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods, to be held at &lt;br/&gt;the San Diego Supercomputer Center on the campus of the University of &lt;br/&gt;California at San Diego, in February 2011. Domain decomposition, in some &lt;br/&gt;form, is by far the most common paradigm for large-scale simulation on &lt;br/&gt;massively parallel distributed, hierarchical memory computers. This &lt;br/&gt;paradigm permeates almost all arenas of simulation, from such practical &lt;br/&gt;concerns as numerical climate modeling, modeling of complex biological &lt;br/&gt;molecules and biological processes, the design and testing of automobiles, &lt;br/&gt;aircraft and other structures, and the modeling of complex porous media &lt;br/&gt;flows, to more abstract scientific endeavors such as modeling black holes &lt;br/&gt;and searching for the origins of the universe. However, many users of &lt;br/&gt;domain decomposition do not avail themselves of the most sophisticated &lt;br/&gt;and efficient methods known. This has become more pronounced as the size &lt;br/&gt;of the large-scale scientific simulation community has grown with the &lt;br/&gt;availability of hardware in the past few years, particularly inside &lt;br/&gt;scientific communities without traditionally strong ties to the &lt;br/&gt;computational mathematics or computer science communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this conference is to promote advances in domain decomposition &lt;br/&gt;methods by encouraging interdisciplinary technical interchange throughout &lt;br/&gt;the international computational science and engineering communities, and by &lt;br/&gt;taking advantage of conference siting, to attract to this important area &lt;br/&gt;many new U.S. scientists. It is strongly aligned with NSF's, and more &lt;br/&gt;generally, our national priorities to promote and advance fundamental &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research in Computational Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding will make possible financial support for graduate students, &lt;br/&gt;post-docs, and other young researchers who otherwise might not be able to &lt;br/&gt;attend. The funding will also allow for increasing participation of women, &lt;br/&gt;African Americans, and Hispanic Americans from across the nation as well as &lt;br/&gt;from the diverse Southern California scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
