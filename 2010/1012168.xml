    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Graham Fleming of the University of California, Berkeley will develop and extend spectroscopic methods for the study of quantum confined systems such as carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, and molecular systems. The approach is to use two-dimensional ultrafast electronic spectroscopy to simplify spectra, and to reveal fundamental quantum mechanical aspects of the dynamics. Very high time resolution, various polarization sequences, and mixed time-frequency methods will be applied to reveal fundamental aspects of complex quantum systems. The broader impacts involve disseminating the new techniques world-wide, engaging a very wide range of audiences in the issues of energy security and climate change, educating and inspiring young women from high-risk underserved areas of the local area, and developing distance learning opportunities for students in school science programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will expand the understanding of quantum confined systems for opto-electronic applications ranging from display technology to the conversion of solar energy to electricity and/or chemical energy.</AbstractNarration>
