    <AbstractNarration>Connecticut Geoscience Investigations (CGI) is a professional development opportunity for middle school educators developed in partnership with several federally defined high-needs school districts and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. The project is: 1) providing standards-based professional development in Earth science to 48 teachers annually at multiple sites in Connecticut; 2) developing teachers' inquiry-oriented and place-based instructional techniques; 3) assisting teachers with improving their existing curricula to meet the specific needs of their school district; 4) increasing teacher content knowledge and confidence in working with Earth science scholars; 5) improving teacher skills in synthesizing and transforming their knowledge to be used in the classroom; and 6) encouraging teachers to provide field trip experiences for their students. Students are increasing their skills in inquiry-based science by learning about local landscapes through classroom and field experiences. Digital resources are being developed to increase teacher confidence in leading field trips, improve their awareness of sites close to their location, and provide pre- and post-fieldtrip activities that will be widely disseminated. The program involves three intensive summer institutes that, geographically, span the state and feature seminars, hands-on activities, and field work. Teachers receive year-round support through evening workshops and regular electronic communication. The project also has an informal community education component comprising two family event days for Museum visitors during Earth Science Week. The program is providing a scientific learning experience, designed to serve urban disadvantaged youth, that is based on current geoscience research and directly addresses two realities in today's classroom: the challenges of taking students on field trips and the necessity for curricula materials that fit strict district mandates.</AbstractNarration>
