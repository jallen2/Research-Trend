    <AbstractNarration>The S-STEM program at California State University-San Bernardino (CSUSB), known as Mathematics and Science Scholars (MASS), promotes the success of a diverse group of academically talented, financially needy students in six STEM departments, by building on an established scholarship program. Specifically, the MASS program offers 26 annual academic scholarships to students of high academic potential and financial need, enrolled in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Geological Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics, as well as in the School of Computer Science and Engineering. Students are recruited from among top high school graduates, as well as top transfer applicants, through established partnerships among the College of Natural Sciences, the Office of Recruitment &amp; Admissions, and the Office of Financial Aid. MASS scholarship recipients receive academic and career support provided by MASS faculty and staff personnel and others, including those of CoyoteCareers, McNair Scholars, and LSAMP. Successful students continue as Scholars after quarterly review, while priority registration in courses and opportunities for research and internships facilitate retention and graduation. As over 70% of CSUSB students are the first in their families to go to college, the assigned personal disciplinary mentor and co-curricular experiences are vital to the Scholars' academic progress and development as professionals. Since MASS Scholars are recruited from the economically and educationally disadvantaged population of Inland Southern California, the program serves an important role in preparing much needed STEM leaders in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives of MASS are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Recruit new freshmen and transfer students each year, in order to maintain 26 Scholars, as well as additional equally talented students without financial need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Provide mentors (faculty mentors in their disciplines) to Scholars, in addition to cohort-specific academic support services in order to promote the Scholars' continued academic success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Offer co-curricular activities to develop MASS students as scientists, mathematicians, engineers and STEM teachers, including MASS-sponsored events, Departmental and College research seminars, attendance at local or other scientific conferences, participation in the seminar series sponsored by CoyoteCareers, and opportunities to participate in STEM research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Graduate well-prepared candidates for employment in STEM fields, or for graduate study in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
