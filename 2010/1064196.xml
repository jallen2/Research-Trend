    <AbstractNarration>1064196&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wind turbine icing represents the most significant threat to the integrity of wind turbines in cold weather. In this proposed research, an integrated experimental, numerical and theoretical study is carried out to quantify important micro-physical processes pertinent to the wind turbine icing phenomena. More specially, detailed experimental investigations are conducted to examine the transient behavior of unfrozen surface water film and rivulet flows on ice accreting surfaces to elucidate underlying physics for more accurate prediction of ice formation and accretion on the surfaces of wind turbine blades. Computational and theoretical investigations, which include numerical simulations of the three-phase nonlinear coupling between air, water and ice as well as comprehensive asymptotic modeling of those processes, are also conducted to coordinate with the experimental work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: By elucidating the underlying physics, the proposed research would significantly improve our understanding about the important micro-physical processes pertinent to wind turbine icing phenomena. A better understanding of the important micro-physical processes will enable us to improve current ice accretion models for more accurate prediction of ice formation and ice accretion on wind turbine blades. The new findings derived from the proposed research can also be used to develop effective and robust anti-/de-icing strategies tailored for wind turbine icing applications to ensure safer and more efficient operation of wind turbines in cold weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research program will be incorporated into the Iowa State's curricula (both undergraduate and graduate). The findings derived from the proposed research will be disseminated broadly to contribute to the knowledge base of icing physics and wind turbine technology. Female and minority students will be recruited to work on the proposed research to promote the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. Various outreach activities are planned to impart K-12 teachers and students, and by extension, the public at large, a greater awareness of renewable energy and wind turbine technology and their importance to our daily lives.</AbstractNarration>
