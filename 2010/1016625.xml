    <AbstractNarration>In real-time voice and high-speed data applications, limited delay is a key design constraint; indeed, packet sizes as short as a few hundred bits are common in wireless systems. The objective of this research is to go beyond traditional refinements to the fundamental asymptotic information theoretic limits and investigate the back-off from capacity (in channel coding) and the overhead over entropy (in lossless compression) and the rate-distortion function (in lossy source coding) incurred by coding at a given blocklength. We plan to revisit the major design principles stemming from the analysis of capacity, rate-distortion function and minimum source coding rate and see which of them still apply in the non-asymptotic regime, and for those that do not, assess the penalty incurred by abiding by them for short blocklengths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our study of the non-asymptotic behavior of the optimum rate achievable as a function of both blocklength and error probability involves two complementary goals:&lt;br/&gt;a) computable upper and lower bounds tight enough to reduce the uncertainty on the non-asymptotic operational fundamental limit to a level that is negligible compared to the gap to the long-blocklength asymptotics; b) analytical approximations to the bounds that are accurate even for short blocklengths, so as to offer insights into good coding strategies and enable practically relevant optimization problems. Those approximations typically involve a parameter we refer to as dispersion, which quantifies the stochastic variability of sources and channels.</AbstractNarration>
