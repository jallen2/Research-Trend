    <AbstractNarration>In this IRES project, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students under the direction of Professor Evan Scannapieco at Arizona State University will carry out forefront studies of cosmic magnetism with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), a remarkable new European radio telescope. Due to its sensitivity, resolution, and frequency coverage, LOFAR will allow for magnetic field measurements that are orders of magnitude better than previous constraints. Over the course of three years, a total of 15 U.S. students will make use of this instrument in collaboration with the German Long Wavelength Consortium and Prof. Marcus Brüggen of Jacobs University in Bremen, helping to open a new window on the magnetic universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic fields thread the universe, yet very little is known about their properties. On galaxy scales, students will probe the connection between star formation and magnetism and the origin of the magnetic fields that surround galaxies. On galaxy cluster scales, they will study the unknown physics of the hot intracluster medium and the evolution of the mysterious "radio relics." On cosmic scales, they will uncover the magnetic properties of the filamentary web of gas that connects all galaxies. Each of these projects will not only shed new light on the structure of the magnetic universe, but help students to build the expertise necessary to play a leading role in the impressive series of international, low-frequency radio experiments that will take place over the next decade.</AbstractNarration>
