    <AbstractNarration>The 2010 Gordon Conference on Mitochondria &amp; Chloroplasts will provide a unique forum for scientists working on plant, animal, and fungal systems to identify common mechanisms and shared properties of these organelles relevant to organismal growth, development, vigor, photosynthesis, fertility, adaptation and senescence/ageing. It will convene investigators who specialize in physiology, genetics, biochemistry, proteomics, and structural biology, thereby fostering a cross-disciplinary perspective, the sharing of technological expertise, and the establishment of new collaborative efforts. Attendance will be limited to 200 participants in order to maintain an intimate environment that is conducive to discussion and interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC on Mitochondria &amp; Chloroplasts hosts an international community comprising representatives from 15 or more countries. The group also comprises a strong mix of graduate student, postdoctoral and independent investigators at all levels. The educational mission of the conference will be enhanced by the accompanying Gordon Research Seminar, which provides a special forum for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to present and discuss their research prior to the main conference. Participation of Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from undergraduate institutions will be further encouraged by reserving slots in the main conference for attendees in these categories.</AbstractNarration>
