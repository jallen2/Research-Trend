    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: EPS-1003907&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Bionanotechnology for Public Security and Environmental Safety &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed RII is the strategic framework for an integrated effort that plans to position West Virginia to achieve measurable growth in bionanotechnology. The vision is an establishment of a nationally recognized and sustainable Center in Bionano-technology that integrates research and education and advances knowledge through innovative collaborations while vitalizing the economy of the state. The specific goal is to provide necessary infrastructure focused on bionanotechnology for enhanced public security and environmental safety. The interdisciplinary research effort is led by West Virginia University, Marshall University, and West Virginia State University. Also engaged in research and workforce development activities are the state's Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions and Community and Technical Colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;Scientific and engineering research aims at the development of fundamental knowledge needed for field-deployable sensors that can monitor, in real time, the presence of specific heavy metals, pathogens, and other environmental threats. The research program is organized around three Interdisciplinary Research Thrusts (IRT), IRT 1 - Portable and Rapid Identification Platforms, IRT 2 - Field-deployable Microfluidic Electrochemical Sensors for Multiplexed Detection of Heavy Metals and Small Molecule Toxins, and IRT 3 - Ex Vivo and In Vitro Biomimetics for Cellular Response Monitoring. IRTs include faculty with complementary expertise to create new platforms for integrated devices. They propose to solve several fundamental science and engineering problems including the interconnects between sensor elements and underlying chip architecture; developing microfluidic devices with downstream nanosensors; and integrating viable cells in a microfluidic chip where metabolism will be measured using calibrated nanosensors. Proposed IRT research capitalizes on benefit from prior infrastructure investments, new faculty hires and significant upgrades of bioengineering research facilities at WVU. Equipment to fabricate hybrid integrated biological/solid state microfluidic, optical and electronic devices would be housed in new and satellite facilities and sustained by integration with existing shared facilities. New Cyberinfrastructure is expected to support IRT research in computing atomistic classical force fields, newly developed coarse-grain modeling techniques, and density functional theory for validation and prediction of experimental measurements related to biological/inorganic interfaces, micro/nanofluidic flow and photonic crystals among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This RII promises to advance technology important to national security and provide research and education experiences for a diverse group of students, post docs, high school teachers and institutions in the state. Research discoveries in the field-deployable sensors that can monitor, in real time, presence of specific heavy metals, pathogens, and other environmental threats, combined with the education and workforce development programs, are expected to enhance the prosperity of the State and the nation by preparing our citizens for the increasingly knowledge-based economy.</AbstractNarration>
