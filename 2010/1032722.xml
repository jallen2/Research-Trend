    <AbstractNarration>Urban transportation congestion continues to be a major economic, environmental and social problem in the United States. The volatility of petroleum prices, urban pollution, and concern for global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions provide new incentives to develop effective measures for reducing urban congestion. New information and communications technologies provide opportunities for the development of novel urban congestion management measures. In this project, the research team will build upon past work to incorporate these new concerns and technologies, estimating external costs and developing a systematic, consistent analysis tool for congestion management measures and assessing the efficacy of congestion management measures with regard to costs, urban air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The team will also investigate the possible role of such measures in the development of ?smart growth? guidelines and standards. This integrated consideration of climate change, air pollution, new technologies and congestion management requires project participants with knowledge in all these areas and the ability to integrate these different concerns in a compelling analysis of congestion management strategies. For example, the introduction of alternative fuels in the form of ethanol and plug-in hybrids alters the estimation of congestion emissions and fuel consumption. It is this holistic analysis which is the primary goal of this project. This project will result in new tools to identify and develop mitigation strategies for the large economic, environmental and social impacts of urban transportation congestion. The models and methods developed will identify cost effective approaches to congestion management, including greenhouse gas emission and urban air pollution reduction benefits. The team will assess the potential contribution of urban congestion management as a ?wedge strategy? to attain greenhouse gas emission reduction goals relative to other transportation strategies such as direct emissions controls and gasoline price floors. The project will enable large numbers of consumers to gain understanding of the life cycle impacts of their decisions, and enable behavioral change. Furthermore the project will allow transportation authorities and decision makers to consider various options when it comes to congestion management. A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students will participate on the project team.</AbstractNarration>
