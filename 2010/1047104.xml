    <AbstractNarration>In this EAGER project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Lin Pu of the Department of Chemistry at University of Virginia will explore the development of peptide nucleic acids (PNAs)-based novel double helical catalysts for asymmetric catalysis. In comparison with the catalysts currently developed for asymmetric catalysis, the proposed PNA-based double helical catalysts could have several advantages. For example, the PNA-based duplexes could amplify the chiral information of the incorporated catalytic site to generate the macromolecular double helical structure which could provide rigid, stable, and well-defined helical cavities for efficient chiral induction. In addition, unlike the use of DNAs, using the synthetic PNAs makes both helical configurations readily available for the asymmetric synthesis of both enantiomers of a chiral molecule. These macromolecular catalysts can also be easily recovered by filtration (heterogeneous) or membrane filtration (homogeneous). The proposed work on PNAs will utilize the technology developed in chemical biology for the discovery of new chiral catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful development of the project will have an impact on any area of activity in which the synthesis of molecules is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and the biological and chemical research activities. Graduate students and undergraduate students of diverse backgrounds will be recruited to conduct the research described in this project. Thus, this project will provide extensive education and training for these researchers in areas such as organic synthesis, catalysis, chiral chemistry and chemical biology. They will learn many laboratory skills that are useful for their future employment. After the training through this project, the students can become new innovators and professional researchers to further benefit the society.</AbstractNarration>
