    <AbstractNarration>Sitting Bull College (SBC) STEM programs are poised to make dramatic impacts in producing Native American scientists. Major academic enhancements and increases in student enrollment programs have been established directly through the current TCUP grant and because of foundation provided by TCUP-supported activities. We propose a comprehensive initiation plan to build on our existing strengths through innovative programs, outreach, and a focus on research and technology education. The SBC TCUP project will directly affect 90 Undergraduate Researchers, 75 community professionals, 75 middle school students and 15 middle school teachers, five faculty members, one administrative person, two laboratory technicians, one secretarial position, and numerous students enrolling in SBC STEM courses.&lt;br/&gt;To address emerging and established needs of our students and community, we propose the following goals (1) to enhance student abilities with scientific research methodologies through increasing research skills by providing authentic research opportunities by fully integrating student research into STEM courses, (2) to provide the community with a technologically-advanced workforce by producing cohorts of graduates with advanced training in biotechnology, pollution science, geospatial technology, GeoSciences, and wildlife conservation and training local professionals, K-12 teachers, and community members in applied science, and (3) to increase interest in STEM fields by a wider variety of students through innovative recruitment and retention programs (including Middle School Science Academy), increased online curricula, cohort building activities, a Native Science track, and investigating a Master?s Program.</AbstractNarration>
