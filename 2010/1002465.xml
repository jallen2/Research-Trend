    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2010. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Juliana Rangel-Posada is "Queen supersedure in honey bees: how and why do workers replace their mother queen with a sister queen?" The host institution for this research is North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. David Tarpy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social insects are a paradigm of cooperation among group-living species. However, cooperative behaviors are not observed in all aspects of colony life. When decisions about reproduction need to be made, conflict may arise if the interests of the workers in a colony differ from those of the reproductives. In honey bees (Apis mellifera), reproductive conflict can occur when workers and queens strongly interact during queen replacement, which occurs (a) when a colony reproduces via "swarming," i.e. a daughter queen is produced to inherit the maternal nest while the mother queen leaves with most of the colony's workers to establish a new nest, or (b) when a colony performs queen "supersedure," i.e. the mother queen is replaced by a daughter queen. While much attention has been paid to swarming, very little is known about supersedure. Nonetheless, this subtle and ephemeral event has significant fitness implications because a colony's fitness will strongly depend on the quality of the queen that inherits the nest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include (1) exploring the mechanisms of supersedure; (2) evaluating the effects of supersedure on colony fitness; (3) assessing the current rate of supersedure; (4) determining if preparations for queen supersedure can be predicted. The broader impacts of the project include the dissemination of the results to the beekeeping community through workshops, the publication of findings in popular articles featured in beekeeping magazines, the inclusion of undergraduate exchange students from Zamorano University in Honduras, and the collaboration with other social insect biologists at NCSU and other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
