    <AbstractNarration>Many researchers and educators assume that innate aptitude explains the range of student success in introductory programming courses. In contrast, this project investigates whether students enter computer science classrooms with non-programming knowledge that can be leveraged in learning to program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1 includes identifying students' productive non-programming strategies used on questions that are correlated with success on the Advanced Placement Computer Science exam. Students from a major public university, community college and a local high school will participate in the study. Phase 2 includes an experiment to assess the effectiveness of teaching methods designed to leverage these student strategies. Curricular materials are iteratively refined and used in the classroom during phase 3. An external advisory board is involved throughout the project to assess the reliability of methods and the validity of results. Materials and final results are disseminated in phase 4 of the project. Outcomes are expected to include a refined curriculum that can support the success of a more diverse student population.</AbstractNarration>
