    <AbstractNarration>One of the most persistent questions in evolutionary biology is how the genes for new traits arise. One potential process for evolving novel traits is by the incorporation of genetic information from outside sources into an existing genome, a process known as horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer occurs widely in bacteria, but very few examples in animals have been described. One class of genes, called transposable elements, can easily move between genes within a cell; perhaps they might also move between organisms. Because the larvae of parasitic wasps develop in very intimate contact with their fruitfly hosts, a pilot study was undertaken to determine whether transposable elements might be able to move between fruitfly and wasp genomes: the PIs found abundant evidence of such horizontal gene transfer. The PIs will conduct experiments designed to assess the direction of transposable element transfer between flies and wasps and to determine the evolutionary fate of these elements in their novel genomes. This project will help to develop the Drosophila-wasp interaction as a model system for the study of horizontal gene transfer between higher organisms. It will reveal characteristics affecting the ability of transposable elements to invade novel genomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seemingly bizarre life histories of these organisms pique student interest and facilitate teaching fundamental biological concepts. This study's findings will be used to further expand the system's uses in both classrooms and research labs. Co-PI Milan will continue to use this project as an avenue to engage in discussions about research science and its value with diverse, lay audiences that otherwise may not be exposed to evolutionary biology and genetics.</AbstractNarration>
