    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore how techniques from coding and signal processing can be used to build better digital to analog converters for RF communications and other applications. A key requirement for such devices in radio frequency hardware is dynamic range, i.e., the ability to represent small and large signals simultaneously. Today, the highest dynamic range converters use a technique called Sigma-Delta modulation. Sigma-Delta modulation allows a high precision signal to be generated from binary quantized data, and so removes the requirement for precise analog levels. Traditionally, Sigma-Delta modulation is explained in terms of a linear feedback system. This research will show that Sigma-Delta modulation is, in fact, a crude optimization algorithm. The work will go on to find far better ways of solving this optimizations problem than the Sigma-Delta approach that is used now. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will appear wherever digital computation&lt;br/&gt;must be interfaced to the physical world, e.g., to get the analog signal which an antenna radiates.&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, the digital revolution depends on analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion. Personal CD&lt;br/&gt;players, cellular telephones, high definition TV, computer modems, and deep space communication&lt;br/&gt;systems all use analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion blocks. Furthermore, A to D and D to A conversion is currently the weak link in many important systems, e.g., software defined radio. Looking at the conversion problem from a new perspective will result in solutions with improved performance and reduced complexity.&lt;br/&gt;Considering the number of CD players, cellular telephones, modems, and televisions in existence&lt;br/&gt;today, any improvement in performance or cost reduction in the manufacturing of these products&lt;br/&gt;will have a major impact on the world in which we live and improve our standard of living.</AbstractNarration>
