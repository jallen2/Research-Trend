    <AbstractNarration>This Phase 2 Noyce project is recruiting strong candidates with STEM degrees to become 45 new science or mathematics teachers. It is adapted to the life circumstances of non-traditional candidates: multiple entry points through the year, early and intense experiences in school classrooms, mastery learning, a learning community, and online delivery. It also provides a pathway to teaching for undergraduate Arts and Sciences and Engineering majors by identifying and orienting promising candidates and involving them in the teaching of lower level undergraduate science and math courses and working with middle and high school students in urban school settings. Upon graduation with a STEM degree the undergraduate candidates enter an accelerated teacher licensure program. The project explores new recruitment techniques through Arts and Sciences and Education college collaboration, improves the mentoring and induction experiences, and develops a better understanding of the support needed to retain new teachers. Given the high drop-out rate of new teachers, research into the particular factors involved in their recruitment and retention as well as the continued development of beginning teachers is crucial. So, a major component of the project is to fully involve school districts in the training of teachers of diverse backgrounds in a deep and substantive manner through vigorous, intentional efforts to foster school and university cooperation. This effort explores how schools and universities can and should work together to plan careful induction experiences and create sustaining structures that allow teachers to collaborate in ways that support and nurture communities of practice to enhance the learning and growth of teachers and students</AbstractNarration>
