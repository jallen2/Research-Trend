    <AbstractNarration>The proposal is to request funds for a small invitation only workshop comprising principally of members of the Software Taskforce and invitees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This taskforce constituted as a subcommittee of the ACCI is focused on examining issues in Software Infrastructure. The charter for this task force is to form recommendations on how best to fulfill the NSF mission and help meet the demand for ubiquitous, reliable, and easily accessible software to support science and engineering research needs. Software infrastructure has evolved organically and inconsistently, with its development and adoption being driven by patchwork funding structures and sporadic application-specific resource availability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this time, a draft report has been developed with communication via telecons and emails. To allow for a more effective and efficient discussion about the report details, it is important to have a face-to-face meeting whereby discussions can occur over hours instead of minutes. The goal of this meeting is to go through the details of the report such that a refined early report can be disseminated to the broad community for buy-in and feedback. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting outcome will consist of a refined report that will be ready for dissemination to the broad community.</AbstractNarration>
