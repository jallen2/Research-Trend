    <AbstractNarration>Research advances provide evidence that most animals and plants depend upon associations with coevolved communities of microorganisms. These consortia of beneficial microbial symbionts play critical roles in physiological balance, and partner with the host's immune system to foster health. Recognition of these phenomena is revolutionizing how biologists view the function of the normal microbiota of animals and plants. Investigation of host-microbe interactions has been enabled by recent technical advances, making this a critical time to examine research frontiers in this area. The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) has held internationally attended conferences on beneficial microbes in 2005 and 2008 that brought together biologists from a broad range of scientific disciplines. This year the conference will be held in Miami, Florida. The aim is to provide a forum for discussion and exchange of ideas, and to develop new approaches and a conceptual synthesis. This young field is attracting graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, many of whom will attend this conference. To assure a broad representation, 30% of the organizational committee are women; in addition, 7 of 21 of the invited speakers are junior (pre-tenure), and 8 of the 21 are women. Of the 39 contributed oral presentations, 18 (46%) will be selected for support from submitted abstracts, ensuring ample high-visibility for innovative investigators and ideas. As in the previous meetings, the selection process for these supported presentations will focus on junior researchers, women and minorities. Students at underrepresented minority institutions will be also targets for support. The proposal budget includes 10 travel awards for minority graduate students with US citizenship, and the awardees will be selected based on the quality of their abstracts.</AbstractNarration>
