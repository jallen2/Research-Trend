    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Charles McKenna and colleagues from the University of Southern California will acquire a state-of-the art single-source X-ray diffractometer. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) environmentally benign energetic materials, (b) C-H activation with palladium complexes, (c) structural analysis of biologically active phosphonates (d) structural studies of fluoroorganic compounds, (e) phosphorescent complexes for optoelectronics, and (f) metal-catalyzed reactions for oxidation catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and will also be available to Primarily Undergraduate Institutions in the greater Los Angeles Area for undergraduate research projects.</AbstractNarration>
