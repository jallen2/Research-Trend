    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the UNL Science Teacher Scholars Program is to engage STEM professionals in the development of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary to meet the challenges of the 21st century science classroom. This project is increasing the number and quality of science teachers certified each year at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln through the recruitment of 14 STEM professionals and graduates of the Colleges of Arts and Sciences and Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources each year for five years, resulting in 70 new secondary science teachers for Lincoln Public Schools. Faculty from the Colleges of Education and Human Sciences, Arts and Sciences, and Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources are working together to achieve the following specific objectives: (1) provide stipends for STEM professionals to complete a high quality, rigorous, science-focused certification and master's degree within a 14-month period; (2) create inquiry-based experiences with students in grades 7-12 during the 14-month in-service experience; and (3) build a New Teachers Network to provide support for the UNL Science Teacher Scholars through mentoring, coaching, and ongoing support throughout their first years as a science teacher. The Scholars complete a 44-credit-hour cohort based Master of Arts in Science Teaching (MAST) degree program designed for STEM professionals who have earned a bachelor's degree in a science discipline and wish to pursue a career in science teaching. The MAST preservice program integrates methods courses with a nine-month classroom-based internship and engages students in a required master's level pedagogical inquiry project based on the Scholar's field experience in the classroom. Students graduate with a Master's degree and Natural Science endorsement in addition to certification in a focus area, enabling them to understand and represent an integrated approach to science teaching. Information acquired through evaluation is providing needed data related to the effectiveness of this post-baccalaureate program and support network. A key component of this paradigm is the New Teacher Network (NTN), which provides opportunities for Scholars to continue to link their theoretical understanding of teaching and learning to practice through mentorship and coaching. The UNL Science Teacher Scholars Program and partnership is providing a deeper understanding of how STEM professionals benefit from having an enriched, rigorous, and focused learning experience, and participating in experiential-based environments for learning.</AbstractNarration>
