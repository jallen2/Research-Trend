    <AbstractNarration>Smith&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008396&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project aims to better understand the role of&lt;br/&gt;inertia-gravity waves in two highly relevant problems in&lt;br/&gt;geophysical fluid dynamics: (i) the origin of observed ocean wave&lt;br/&gt;spectra, and (ii) tropical cyclogenesis and the preconditioned&lt;br/&gt;state for the development of hurricanes. Both studies involve a&lt;br/&gt;similar dynamical core, namely, the rotating Boussinesq equations&lt;br/&gt;with strong stratification. Previous theoretical progress toward&lt;br/&gt;understanding ocean spectra has been made by considering exact&lt;br/&gt;three-wave resonances under the weak turbulence paradigm. Here&lt;br/&gt;the investigator studies new partial-differential equation models&lt;br/&gt;including all three-wave interactions, thus capturing more&lt;br/&gt;complete physics. Effects of rotation, stratification and&lt;br/&gt;hydrostatic balance are deduced analytically through explicitly&lt;br/&gt;derived, nonlinear coupling coefficients. Numerical simulations&lt;br/&gt;characterize energy spectra and generation of shear. Adding&lt;br/&gt;simplified cloud dynamics (condensation and evaporation of water)&lt;br/&gt;to the Boussinesq core allows for investigation of the hurricane&lt;br/&gt;embryo. The latter project involves numerical implementation and&lt;br/&gt;exploration of a minimal, active moisture model including fast&lt;br/&gt;waves, extending recent work using imposed heat sources to&lt;br/&gt;incorporate moist processes within the context of balanced models&lt;br/&gt;(excluding fast waves). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Inertia-gravity waves result from the earth's rotation and&lt;br/&gt;density stratification of the atmosphere and oceans. The effects&lt;br/&gt;of inertia-gravity waves are varied, for example, waves can&lt;br/&gt;self-organize to form large-scale coherent structures widely&lt;br/&gt;observed in nature, such as cyclones and/or anticyclones,&lt;br/&gt;east-west jets, and horizontal shear layers. Yet there are&lt;br/&gt;critically important flows for which the dynamical role of&lt;br/&gt;inertia-gravity waves is yet to be described by a fully&lt;br/&gt;self-consistent mathematical theory. The project addresses two&lt;br/&gt;such fundamental application problems using a combination of&lt;br/&gt;analytical and numerical calculations: (i) the scale distribution&lt;br/&gt;of wave energy in the oceans, and (ii) tropical cyclogenesis&lt;br/&gt;(also known as the hurricane embryo problem). In the oceans,&lt;br/&gt;tidal and wind forcing generate internal gravity-wave breaking,&lt;br/&gt;ultimately establishing the balance between small-scale mixing&lt;br/&gt;and global circulation. For the problem of tropical&lt;br/&gt;cyclogenesis, previous mathematical models have filtered out the&lt;br/&gt;fast waves, and there is much to learn about the role of fast&lt;br/&gt;waves for the emergence and stability of low-altitude cyclonic&lt;br/&gt;vertical vorticity, leading ultimately to the formation of a&lt;br/&gt;hurricane. The topics involve ocean mixing and ocean-atmosphere&lt;br/&gt;interactions, which are important factors in climate.</AbstractNarration>
