    <AbstractNarration>Video-on-demand (VoD) is an attractive service that has&lt;br/&gt;already gained popularity in the Internet by&lt;br/&gt;allowing users to view a video from a large catalog at&lt;br/&gt;any time. A limitation of existing VoD services, both&lt;br/&gt;using traditional design as well as P2P is their inability to support&lt;br/&gt;efficient streamed access to ALL content at high quality,&lt;br/&gt;regardless of demand: not just blockbusters that millions want to&lt;br/&gt;see, but also niche content that has relatively small demand in&lt;br/&gt;comparison to their highly popular counterparts: re-runs of TV shows,&lt;br/&gt;non-blockbuster releases, replays of sporting events, and speeches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The peer-to-peer (P2P) approach is an effective&lt;br/&gt;solution for scalable content distribution without imposing a&lt;br/&gt;significant burden on a centralized infrastructure. In a P2P-based&lt;br/&gt;VoD system, users receive streamed videos from VoD servers as well as&lt;br/&gt;from the peers. The ability of peers that are viewing the videos to&lt;br/&gt;collaborate with each other reduces the load on serving&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project extends the design of successful P2P VoD systems to&lt;br/&gt;enable support for efficient delivery of a large, potentially&lt;br/&gt;limitless library of high (movie) quality stored VoD. Regardless of&lt;br/&gt;a video's popularity, a high-quality version will be playable by any&lt;br/&gt;client attached to the network without interruption within seconds of&lt;br/&gt;its request. The research utilizes three design principles: leverage&lt;br/&gt;P2P technologies, implement altruistic cross-content caching and&lt;br/&gt;serving, and utilize playback-point weighted caching strategies.&lt;br/&gt;Results include models that describe desirable caching behavior,&lt;br/&gt;distributed algorithms to implement the desired caching behavior, and&lt;br/&gt;a functional prototype.</AbstractNarration>
