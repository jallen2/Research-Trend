    <AbstractNarration>SES-1028932&lt;br/&gt;Muge F. Gocek&lt;br/&gt;Anju Mary Paul&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interview-based research, conducted in 2008 by the co-principal investigator with 95 Filipino migrant domestic workers in the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore, revealed that a multi-state international migration pattern was adopted by many aspiring migrants. These migrants consciously worked their way up a hierarchy of destination countries, accumulating capital in the process, so that they could eventually secure an entry visa into their preferred country in the West. Such a ?stepwise international migration? trajectory was a means for these migrants to increase their savings, gain the necessary work experience to qualify for jobs in more preferred countries, build their network of overseas contacts, and thereby ease the process of applying for visas to their desired destination. These preliminary findings raise several questions: (1) How widespread is the practice of stepwise international migration among migrants who managed to gain entry into the top destination countries such as the United States and Canada? (2) What distinguishes the successful stepwise migrant from other types of migrants? (3) How do stepwise migrants go about accumulating the necessary resources to support their entry into their preferred destination? Are some resources more useful than others? (4) How much influence do the immigration policy regimes of individual countries have in shaping the multi-state trajectories of prospective stepwise migrants? In order to answer these questions, 200 surveys and 70 in-depth interviews will be conducted with Filipino immigrants in three sites in the United States and Canada--San Francisco, New York City, and Toronto. The findings from this study will extend our knowledge of migration patterns by highlighting one that differs from more traditional patterns in its number of stages, temporal range, hierarchical nature, intentionality, and dynamic nature. This study also will shed light on a new type of migrant--the stepwise migrant--to add to our existing categories of the "sojourner" and the "settler" migrant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study's findings will provide an insight into how migrants choose among destination options, and how a country can try to improve its standing among prospective immigrants. Thus this study can inform immigration programs that seek to encourage highly skilled immigrants to settle down in a country, rather than keep moving. In other words, it can help craft policies to turn stepwise migrants into permanent settlers. Findings from this research will be disseminated broadly within the academic community via professional conferences and peer-reviewed publications, and also will be shared with Filipino immigrant communities in the above research sites through local Filipino grassroots organizations.</AbstractNarration>
