    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on string theory, a leading candidate for unifying particle physics with gravity. The proposal aims to characterize features of the typical string compactification by applying algebraic geometry to study topological invariants of manifolds and to search for correlations between these data and structures relevant to model building, both in particle physics and cosmology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is of interest to an interdisciplinary community of theoretical physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists. Researchers in this project are highly involved with the NSF-sponsored String Vacuum Project the results of this research are expected to cross-fertilize that endeavor. The software employed for computational algebraic geometry is publicly available, and the project involves several algorithmic improvements that can be incorporated into future versions of these codes. All computations are to be ported and developed for use in the Microsoft Azure platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award corresponds to the Computing in the Cloud competition and is co-funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
