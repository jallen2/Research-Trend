    <AbstractNarration>Wireless networks are inherently vulnerable to external and internal network attacks, due to the open nature of the wireless medium and the poor physical security of wireless devices. While external attacks can be neutralized through a combination of cryptography-based measures and robustness mechanisms, internal attacks, which are launched from compromised nodes, are much more sophisticated in nature. Insider adversaries exploit knowledge of network secrets (e.g., cryptographic keys and pseudo-random spreading codes) and protocol semantics to maximize their detrimental impact by selectively and adaptively targeting critical network functionalities. This project focuses on designing and evaluating secure protocols for thwarting sophisticated insider attacks of selective, adaptive, and cross-layer nature. A unified adversarial model is considered in which selective jamming and/or dropping of high-value packets (e.g., control information) is used as the primary vehicle for denying network service. Defending wireless networks under this model is particularly challenging, because the adversary remains active for short periods of time and may adapt/modify his strategies on the fly. The impact of insider attacks on critical network functions such as end-to-end reliable data delivery and routing is quantified via extensive experimentation and modeling. Novel protocols are developed which detect ongoing attacks and identify compromised nodes in a timely manner. Project results will reinforce the resilience of wireless networks to denial-of-service attacks launched by insiders. The proposed research is expected to have profound impacts on every wireless technology (e.g., WiFi, WSNs, MANETs, CRNs, Mesh, etc.), due to the generality of the addressed vulnerabilities.</AbstractNarration>
