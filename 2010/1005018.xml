    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Connecticut that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, during the summers of 2010-1012. The Department of Physiology and Neurobiology (PNB) will offer research opportunities to undergraduate sophomores and juniors from non-Ph.D. granting institutions. The students will participate in graduate level research projects on physiological and neural systems in animals. The goal is expose students to a career in scientific research, and to increase student applications to graduate programs in basic science. Students are selected on the basis of their academic record, personal and professional goals described in a required essay, and letters of recommendation. Students are housed together, and work with faculty mentors on their own research project. Professional development activities and social events are planned. Seminars introduce students to topics such as safe practices in the laboratories, ethical issues in science, how to apply to graduate school, and how to present research results effectively. An end-of-session symposium features student platform and poster presentations. The program is assessed using interviews, observation, and surveys, including the web-based assessment tool common to the REU Sites program.
