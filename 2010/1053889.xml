    <AbstractNarration>Acquisition of a Piston Cylinder Apparatus will enhance experimental petrology and mineral physics research in the Jackson School of Geosciences (UT Austin). First, research will focus on the deeper roots of subduction zone volcanoes. The focus will be on the importance of degassing of CO2-rich fluids from intermediate to silicic magma, how such fluids the impact on the solubility water and CO2 in intermediate magma, how CO2-rich bubbles are generated, and how volatiles and other elements partition between CO2-rich fluid and intermediate magma. Mineral physics research into the upper mantle will be enhanced by allowing high-quality, single and polycrystalline samples to be synthesized at controlled conditions. Those crystals will be used in diamond anvil cell experiments to research carbonates and carbon storage in the deep mantle, garnets in the upper mantle and transition zone, and the effects of hydration on the elastic properties of olivine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanding research capabilities with the Piston Cylinder will enhance the education and training of graduate students in experimental research, and enrich the educational experience of undergraduate students, through their involvement in undergraduate research projects. Such research will also enhance a number of outreach programs, including UTeach and GeoFORCE at UT Austin, by being able to demonstrate the Piston Cylinder to secondary school teachers and students during their summer programs.</AbstractNarration>
