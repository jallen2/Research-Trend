    <AbstractNarration>This three-year REU Site program at Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&amp;T) is focused in the area of Additive Manufacturing (AM). Each year eight undergraduate students from U.S. universities outside of Missouri S&amp;T will join the Missouri S&amp;T team to engage in exciting, interdisciplinary AM research. There will also be one undergraduate student who will participate during the academic year. Investment in this program will help the United States maintain a competitive advantage in this critical manufacturing technology. To meet the interdisciplinary nature of AM, the proposed program will be a joint effort of the Departments of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Material Science and Engineering, and Information Science and Technology, as well as the Intelligent Systems Center and the Center for Aerospace Manufacturing Technologies on the Missouri S&amp;T campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this REU Site program are to: 1) introduce undergraduate students to all aspects of AM; 2) provide students with individual challenging research projects in AM that include analytical, computer aided design and analysis, and hands-on components in state-of-the-art research laboratories; 3) integrate individual research projects into an interdisciplinary, team based environment where research results will be used to fabricate 3D components; 4) attract talented undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented students, to conduct research in AM and motivate them to pursue graduate studies; and 5) provide extracurricular activities to expose the students to other exciting areas of research and cutting-edge technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site program includes the following components: 1) a ten week summer program on AM research that combines analytical studies and computer aided design and analysis with a hands-on laboratory experience; 2) a set of challenging individual research projects utilizing the skills of mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, and materials science and engineering, to address critical issues in AM; 3) integrated individual projects in an interdisciplinary, team-based environment to fabricate functional 3D components; 4) a mentoring system for the undergraduate students that includes a network of students and faculty; 5) weekly roundtable discussions where industry and faculty experts discuss topics such as emerging technologies, ethics, graduate school opportunities, etc.; and 6)an environment where the undergraduate students learn effective communication in a variety of media, teamwork, project management, and leadership skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site program will target undergraduates in their junior or senior year in the fields of mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, and materials science and engineering. Particular attention will be paid to underrepresented students in order to ensure program diversity. This REU program will encourage undergraduates to pursue graduate education.</AbstractNarration>
