    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will examine the entire process of soliciting, evaluating, funding, and scheduling work on the R/V Langseth. It will also address how to improve access to the data acquired during sea-going expeditions. The products of the workshop will include 1) a report summarizing the discussions, the items of consensus and contention, and recommendations; 2) a glossy brochure describing the science opportunities for active source seismology in the upcoming years; 3) an implementation plan for a new mode of operation of the R/V Langseth.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This is a time of unprecedented opportunity for marine seismology, as the R/V Langseth completes its second year of successful operations. The capabilities of the R/V Langseth will enable key scientific advances. However, along with the new opportunities come new challenges, including the high cost of 3D seismic acquisition, the difficulty of forecasting areas of operation, and ensuring broad community access to the data. The workshop will address these issues and provide a roadmap for operating this unique facility in the future</AbstractNarration>
