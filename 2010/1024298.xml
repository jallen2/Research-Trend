    <AbstractNarration>Conventionality lies at the center of human communication. For communication to be effective there must be symbols that are shared among speakers. In this proposal, Dr. Koenig investigates the possibility that understanding the conventional nature of words serves as a powerful tool in language acquisition. While speakers are often consistent in the particular language they use, the presence of different languages across speakers raises important questions about the scope of children's conventional understanding when more than one language system is involved. Can monolingual toddlers learn foreign terms from foreign speakers? Do they treat foreign terms as distinct from inaccurate terms? This project will compare 24-month-olds' ability to learn new words from an accurate English speaker versus an inaccurate English speaker and a native Dutch speaker. Given promising evidence that children can learn foreign terms presented in Dutch, an interesting question arises of how broadly they generalize what they have learned across speakers. This study will examine toddler's generalization across different types of speakers, native and foreign. Broad generalization would indicate that infants have accepted the word, but not demarcated the boundaries of their own system versus a foreign language. Narrow generalization -- generalizing English but not foreign terms to users of your own language -- would suggest that infants have begun to understand that different systems can exist. In the final component, this project will directly examine the possibility that observation of consistent word use across speakers is more powerful evidence in favor of a word than is consistency that is demonstrated by only one speaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of this research is to provide insight into different aspects of conventionality in language: (1) knowing that conventional systems can, in principle, vary across speakers; (2) knowing that word knowledge generalizes to other speakers, but not all speakers; and (3) knowing that the basis of conventionality lies in consistent word use across speakers. Each aspect reflects an important conceptual achievement in understanding language as a system, and a central aim of this project is to identify the emergence of each component. As a result, it will contribute to scientific knowledge about the development of conventional understanding, and advance current theories of language development. Beyond elucidating a critical aspect of language learning, these studies will promote future research in bilingual populations and shed light on the more general question of how children extract and generalize cultural and social norms.</AbstractNarration>
