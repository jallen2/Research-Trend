    <AbstractNarration>"Deep Fin" is an emerging international consortium of systematic ichthyologists and theoreticians with expertise in the analysis of fish biodiversity, seeking to integrate knowledge of morphology, paleontology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. The ultimate interest of the group is to establish the phylogenetic tree of all fishes, to decipher their evolutionary relationships. The goals of the RCN are (i) to build on this incipient organization and provide leadership in fish phylogenetic studies; (ii) to develop cyberinfrastructure, a portal for fish phylogenetics (www.deepfin.org) with networking tools and interconnected relational databases; and (iii) to develop didactic material to foster education on fish biodiversity, fish evolution, and current knowledge on the phylogenetic relationships of fishes. These goals will be reached by coordinating activities in three main fronts: group meetings/workshops, website and database development, and student recruitment, training, and exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This effort bridges disciplines in both physical and virtual space to promote communication and education between senior-level systematic ichthyologists, students at all levels, and the general public. Development of cyberinfrastructure and public databases will significantly increase information and material sharing throughout the international community dedicated to phylogenetic studies of fishes. The newly established phylogenetic framework will enhance scientific understanding in other disciplines, such as genomics and evolutionary developmental biology. "Deep Fin" will provide public outreach and education. A student exchange program will increase communication between institutions and disciplines. Active recruitment of students for the proposed activities will broaden opportunities for underrepresented groups in systematic ichthyology. Most importantly, a new generation of scientists will be broadly trained across disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
