    <AbstractNarration>This three year REU Site program at Iowa State University is designed to enable undergraduate students to aspire to leadership in wind energy research that contributes to the workforce needed for enhancing use of renewables in meeting national energy needs. The project objectives are (1) to engage students in a rewarding and intellectually challenging research experience such that they see the benefits of pursuing graduate education and careers in the wind energy arena; (2) to assemble diverse student teams from a variety of disciplines, i.e., atmospheric sciences and multiple engineering departments, such that the REU makeup reflects the interdisciplinary nature and broad impact of research in wind energy; (3) to enroll a cohort of REU students of high quality with at least 30% of the participants being women or from traditionally underrepresented groups within engineering. During the 10 summer weeks, the students will participate in a series of wind energy short courses, have responsibility for an independent research project performed using state-of-the-art equipment and software, contribute to a team research effort, engage with leading industry experts in the wind energy field and visit representative sites including design, manufacture, operation, and management of wind energy systems. Students will be exposed to a wide range of specializations within wind science and engineering, with specific attention to policy, economic analysis and potential impediments to expansion of wind energy. This will provide program participants with the vision to pursue advanced educational programs in preparation for leadership positions in wind energy. To ensure effective mentoring, workshops will be conducted before the beginning of the program with the mentors prior to arrival of the students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing relationships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), community colleges, and leading research institutions will be the focus of recruitment efforts. Partnerships with Women in Science and Engineering, Science Bound, and Leadership through the Engineering Academic Diversity program will help recruit qualified students from diverse backgrounds. A website describing the program and research projects will be populated with updates reflecting student accomplishments and their progression through wind careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The involvement of students in exciting research in wind energy science enhances the likelihood that they will consider post-graduate study and broaden the base of the Nation's technical manpower. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EHR/EPSCoR).</AbstractNarration>
