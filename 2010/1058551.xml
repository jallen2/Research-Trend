    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for&lt;br/&gt;renewably powered and always available energy for powering personal medical and other&lt;br/&gt;location aware sensors. The project advances wearable thermoelectric generator (WTEG)&lt;br/&gt;technology. The system will yield new advances in terms of miniaturization, increases in&lt;br/&gt;WTEG power densities, application of advanced heat transfer materials, and integration with&lt;br/&gt;cutting edge locator system electronics. The research focuses on matching the thermal&lt;br/&gt;resistance of the thermoelectric generator with the thermal resistance of the skin to air interface,&lt;br/&gt;accomplished through the optimization of thermocouple geometries implemented in thin film&lt;br/&gt;semiconductors applied to a flexible polyimide substrate. The anticipated result of the research&lt;br/&gt;will be a fully functional wristband locator system that is lightweight, adjustable, waterproof, and&lt;br/&gt;renewably powered from the human body.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes applications for location&lt;br/&gt;tracking of Alzheimer?s patients, nursing home patients, and elderly home healthcare. As our&lt;br/&gt;population ages, achieving a balance between personal independence while providing for&lt;br/&gt;primary healthcare monitoring will be critical. Wearable thermoelectric generator technology&lt;br/&gt;can be used to power wireless sensors that monitor patient location and help facilities track ?at&lt;br/&gt;risk? residents. Additionally, wireless sensors can help healthcare providers improve treatment,&lt;br/&gt;increase efficiency, and cut costs. A wide range of other follow-on medical applications include&lt;br/&gt;glucose monitoring for diabetic treatment and care, diagnosing sleep disorders, and the&lt;br/&gt;physiological monitoring of first responders, law enforcement, and soldiers. Each of these&lt;br/&gt;applications has been limited by finite and limited battery life. Harvesting body heat and&lt;br/&gt;converting to usable electrical energy opens up a new era of autonomous wearable devices.</AbstractNarration>
