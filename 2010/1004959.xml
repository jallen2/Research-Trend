    <AbstractNarration>This three-year REU Site program at Iowa State University is focused in the area of Microscale Sensing, Actuation and Imaging. Ten undergraduate students each year will pursue fundamental investigations in the area of design and manufacture of sensors, actuators and smart materials as well as imaging and diagnostic systems. The key components of this REU program include: 1) a research project chosen by the student and advised by a faculty member and graduate student; 2) a series of technical short courses; 3) professional development activities such as Lunch-n-learns with local researchers, workshops on career opportunities and graduate school, journal clubs and e-portfolio maintenance; 3) social and cultural events designed to complement the research activities; and 4) an REU Research Symposium to provide feedback on student work and to recognize exceptional achievement. Participants will also receive training in ethical implications of engineering. At the end of the REU Site program, students will present a paper discussing ethical issues raised by the research projects in which they participated and the research they may plan to pursue in their careers. Participants will be encouraged to present a technical paper/poster at the Annual International Mechanical Engineering Congress &amp; Exposition (IMECE) or the Materials Research Society (MRS) meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will be targeted to undergraduate students from 4-year colleges, community colleges and incoming freshman. A talented and diverse group of students will be recruited at a regional and national level, with special efforts that leverage College and University wide programs to attract women and minorities, namely the SPEED (a summer mentoring program for incoming women and underrepresented minority freshman) program, Program for Women in Science and Engineering and the Iowa-AGEP program.</AbstractNarration>
