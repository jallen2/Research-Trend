    <AbstractNarration>Travel support to attend and participate in conferences sponsored by the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability (BSMSP) is requested for the period 2010-2014 of four years during which the PI will serve as president-elect (2010-2012) and president (2012-2014) of BSMSP. BSMSP is an international professional society devoted to the advancement of education and research in probability and mathematical statistics. The goals of BSMP are continued outreach to mathematical scientists in both developed and developing countries throughout the world as a professional society uniting intrinsic scientific interests in mathematical statistics and probability. The benefit of BSMSP to the overall US scientific enterprise is evident in the many collaborative publications that have evolved as the result of opportunities for its members to meet under the sponsorship of a professional society whose international credibility traces back to the very beginnings of the field. In addition it provides a professional forum for mentorship of postdocs and graduate students through various committees engaged in education, scientific discourse, and networking among professional educators and researchers. It is the duty of the executive council to provide liaison and direct major committees of BSMSP to continue to achieve these broad benefits and goals. The educational impact of BSMSP is enhanced by making membership free to PhD students with a sliding scale for postdocs and members from developing countries. BSMSP works cooperatively with the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS), headquartered in the United States, and the International Statistical Institute (ISI), headquartered in The Netherlands, and is an essential organization in facilitating continued international cooperation in mathematical statistics and probability. Support of this proposal facilitates the PIs travel for participation in select international meetings and conferences involving (BSMSP) in an executive capacity.</AbstractNarration>
