    <AbstractNarration>Information theory, communication theory, and statistical signal &lt;br/&gt;processing have proven spectacularly successful as innovation engines &lt;br/&gt;for communication, data compression, and information processing &lt;br/&gt;technologies. Although in principle these theories are quite general, &lt;br/&gt;in practice they are most useful for a particular family of models, &lt;br/&gt;such as discrete Markov sources and channels with additive &lt;br/&gt;Gaussian noise. Although this family is quite rich and encompasses &lt;br/&gt;many practical technologies, there are several important scenarios that&lt;br/&gt;fall outside of these models. In particular, the timing of discrete events is &lt;br/&gt;the modality of interest in many applications, such as neuroscience&lt;br/&gt;and certain problems in network security, and this modality does &lt;br/&gt;not fit neatly into the standard classes. This research involves&lt;br/&gt;extending information theory, communication theory, and statistical signal&lt;br/&gt;processing to develop a general theory of information transfer via timing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of this research involves solving several concrete&lt;br/&gt;problems involving information transfer via timing, such as the&lt;br/&gt;secrecy capacity of timing channels and how to minimize information&lt;br/&gt;transfer via timing side channels in both wireless and wireline&lt;br/&gt;networks. The second phase involves interconnecting these disparate&lt;br/&gt;problems to form a general theory of information transfer via timing.&lt;br/&gt;By elevating the role of timing in information transfer,&lt;br/&gt;this research better positions the fields of information theory,&lt;br/&gt;communication theory, and statistical signal processing to&lt;br/&gt;impact allied fields such as networking, neuroscience, and &lt;br/&gt;operations research, where timing and delay are of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;importance. This impact is facilitated through special topics &lt;br/&gt;courses and invited sessions at conferences, both of which are &lt;br/&gt;designed to attract participants from a range of areas.</AbstractNarration>
