    <AbstractNarration>This project provides travel support for students to attend the 7th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS) to be held during the first week of November 2010. MASS has become a premier international technical venue in a very short period of time (6 years) and has been featuring work of excellent quality attracting attendees from all over the world. The conference has already gained its prominence in providing a superb forum for information exchange. In 2010, the seventh edition of MASS will take place in San Francisco, California, USA during the first week of November. By being located fairly close to the Silicon Valley, MASS 2010 promises to attract record participation from academia and industry. For all its previous venues, MASS has been able to provide student travel grants thanks to NSF's support. Making travel grants available has been very effective in accomplishing the goal of encouraging student participation in technical meetings, especially in the case of under-privileged student populations. Besides the main conference, several workshops and a demo/poster session will take place as part of MASS 2010. Student participation in such events is a critical part of their education and training no matter what career path they plan to take.</AbstractNarration>
