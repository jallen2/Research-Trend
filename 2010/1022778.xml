    <AbstractNarration>Biologically-inspired design is an emerging field with considerable potential to provide innovative solutions to a variety of problems in human design and engineering. Biologists and engineers each face the problem of identifying design criteria, yet each discipline approaches design from a unique perspective. Through the adoption of a common language and a merging of perspectives, students exemplify the interdisciplinary process in overcoming the barriers that often inhibit true multidisciplinary collaborations. Through problem solving exercises, they learn how to use the design process to create biologically-based systems or prototypes that solve specific engineering problems and test hypothesized functions of biological properties. Employing classroom observations, in situ cognitive studies, experiments conducted in class, and detailed analysis of student design products, this project is focusing on five learning objectives: (1) novel techniques for creative design, (2) interdisciplinary communication skills, (3) knowledge about domains outside students' core training, (4) a uniquely interdisciplinary design process, and (5) techniques for applying existing technical knowledge to a new discipline. By treating nature as a respected mentor, a greater appreciation for the information found in natural systems promotes conservation and sustainability efforts to preserve biodiversity. Biologically inspired designs are efficient solutions to real-world problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also establishing assessment metrics to measure design education outcomes, and to empirically validate the degree of success of the BID education platform. This is being undertaken through evaluations of the project's key themes: creativity, communication, cross-domain knowledge transfer, and design skills. The evaluation work is also assessing student differences as functions of their backgrounds and, for group projects, as a function of the diversity of backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
