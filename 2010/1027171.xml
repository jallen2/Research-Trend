    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research examines how an American social movement uses science to argue its position. In response to criticism that the movement privileged the interests of one set of actors over those of another set as well as to changes in law and policy, numerous groups adopted different tactics and began to seek scientific evidence to support its new position. This shift in tactics has led to new types of engagements in the movements for and against this medical intervention and has come to involve a variety of factors including scientists, federal agencies, and professional organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will draw on content analysis of relevant scientific publications, news media, and activist-produced documents as well as observations of political rallies and interviews with key actors in the debate. This data will inform an analysis of the changes in social movement tactics and an assessment of what these new arguments about the negative health consequences for women can tell us about social movements in the U.S. during the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. This dissertation seeks to understand the following questions: How and why has the debate in the United States changed? Why do actors within these movements see scientific arguments as important? Under what circumstances did these arguments emerge and to what extent have they been taken up? How have government institutions and professional organizations responded to the use of science in this particular case study? How does this shift in tactics fit into the goals and strategies of the larger movement in the U.S.? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to a larger body of research on science and social movements as well as address topics of concern within Science and Technology Studies such as controversies, credibility, and expertise. Furthermore, the research may be useful in policy decisions regarding sexuality, reproduction, and health.</AbstractNarration>
