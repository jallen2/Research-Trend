    <AbstractNarration>The fundamental goal of this project is to create and implement effective models to increase retention of academically talented, economically disadvantaged students known to be at-risk for non-completion of science technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. The specific goal is to increase the numbers of predominately Kentucky, Southern Indiana and/or Northern Tennessee first-generation, women, and minority high school students as freshmen and community college transfer students through financial and academic support, enrichment opportunities, and facilitation in student career placement. Three cohorts of four-year students (18 total) and three cohorts of community college transfer students (21total) are being provided $6000 scholarships per year. The college has committed to providing scholarships to cohort students who maintain eligibility that allows them to complete their degrees after funding ends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The college has collaborations with high schools and community colleges which are being used to recruit high school and transfer students into STEM programs. Retention of students is being improved through a program designed to provide students with a variety of academic, social, and career oriented programs. The comprehensive support program is relying on existing student support services and community partnerships to connect students to mentors (both faculty and alumni), peers, and professionals. Existing programs include freshman orientation, faculty advisement, undergraduate research, internships, practical experiences (i.e. pre-service teaching opportunities), work-study, grade monitoring, social and cultural activities, supplemental instruction, peer tutoring, and career counseling and placement services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project advances knowledge in STEM disciplines by enabling members of underrepresented and financially needy groups to achieve their educational goals. The comprehensive support program offers a rich learning environment that prepares students to enter the workforce or enter post-baccalaureate programs. Utilization of living-learning communities as well as faculty, peer and professional mentors is creating a supportive environment for scholars ensuring their academic success, retention, and timely graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This program is broadening participation in STEM fields by providing support for first-generation college, women and underrepresented students. This program benefits society by increasing diversity in student population at the college, creating a strong and diverse workforce, and improving the regional level of educational attainment. In addition, students serve as role models in their home communities. Local employers are benefitting from a larger and more qualified applicant pool.</AbstractNarration>
