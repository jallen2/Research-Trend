    <AbstractNarration>The origin of the flower is considered one of the most important innovations resulting in the diversity of plant forms present on earth today. The flower components of a typical are flattened and two-dimensional. However, in crested Iris species, the flower components have perpendicular growth giving rise to a three-dimensional, elaborately colored, and fringed flower. The development of this novel, yet morphologically diverse flower, will be studied in an evolutionary context. The study of spatial and temporal factors within the floral bud will examine how novel structures evolve in relation to other floral organs through integrative evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide information and models for studies on the evolution of novel structures, the genetic bases for development of floral organs, and pollinator-plant interactions. This research will enhance knowledge on the development of the showy crest found in Iris and other floral organ elaborations that are prized in horticulture. Fieldwork will include researchers and graduate students at one USA and three Chinese plant science institutions and will provide an opportunity to inform local Chinese of the importance of conservation of rare Iris species.</AbstractNarration>
