    <AbstractNarration>Laramie County Community College (LCCC), and several partnering two-and four-year educational institutions and companies, seek to create unique and effective renewable/wind technology programs to serve as national models. Objectives are to improve renewable energy technology programs by increaing academic rigor and relevance; to concurrently grow career pathways; and to enhance and broaden recruitment, retention, and placement efforts with an emphasis on underrepresented populations. LCCC staff, supported by well-qualified curriculum and evaluation consultants, are to provide leadership and administrative management for the project. The primary target audiences include: 1) current and prospective community college students (traditional age and returning adults); 2) postsecondary faculty involved in teaching renewable/wind energy technologies;and 3) other academic and technical faculty interested in the development of a team-based, problem solving learning model. This approach recognizes that the core abilities and foundational competencies for wind energy technology include electricity, hydraulics, fluid power, and mechanical drive systems, which are also the foundational components of other traditional and renewable/alternative energy technologies. Building upon research, the proposal promises to verify wind energy specific knowledge, skills, and attibutes that combines STEM competencies and industry-driven, performance-based, standards for integrated systems and wind energy technology programs. The partnership is to promote outreach and dissemination efforts at local, regional, and national levels.</AbstractNarration>
