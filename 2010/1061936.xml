    <AbstractNarration>Advanced Nanoscaled Nonvolatile Semiconductor Memory (NVSM) Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to conduct fundamental research on charge transport and storage in ultra-thin, oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) hetero-insulator nanostructures used in high density, low-power, low voltage, nonvolatile semiconductor memories (NVSMs). The approach is to fabricate, electrically characterize, and model new NVSM device structures: (1) an NROMTM device in an NOR-type architecture programmed (written) with hot electron injection and 2 bit spatial storage, and (2) a MANOS device in a NAND-type architecture programmed and erased with quantum mechanical tunneling and multiple level charge storage. This structure uses a high-K aluminum oxide (A) dielectric to form an ANO hetero-insulator nanostructure. &lt;br/&gt;These NVSMs will find wide applications in ultra high density, low power semiconductor memories with replacement of hard-drive storage in computers, and portable electronics ? cell phones and PDAs. This research is essential for U.S. leadership and economic benefits in the global semiconductor industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of our program rests in a vision where future advancements in silicon-based, nonvolatile semiconductor memory storage will play a central role in nanoscaled science and engineering. Our program integrates research and education to explore high-density NVSMs with unique hetero-insulator nanostructures. The research will generate new knowledge in the study of charge transport (write/erase) and storage (retention) in advanced nanoscaled NVSM devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader aspects in our program will advance diversity in the nanoelectronics work-force through intellectual technology transfer, integration of research and education and promotion of partnerships with the industrial sector of the economy. Our educational and outreach programs will increase diversity through scholarships at the university and interim summer positions with industry in nanoelectronics, especially the area of semiconductor devices. This research program provides an excellent vehicle for student research and education, minority student outreach and partnerships with industry.</AbstractNarration>
