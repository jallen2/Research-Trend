    <AbstractNarration>Identifying bugs in software continues to be a challenging, but essential problem to solve. One particularly difficult task is ensuring the integrity of large-scale data structures stored in memory. Existing bug-finding techniques, such as static analysis of the code, have not been effective on this problem, especially for complex and highly dynamic software, such as web applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores a new technique for checking data structures dynamically as the program executes. Dynamic checking is effective and precise, but must be efficient in order to avoid significantly slowing program execution. The key idea in this work is to piggyback checking on the garbage collector, which already periodically visits all data structures in the program. An efficient and precise tool for detecting data structure errors could be widely deployed to improve the reliability of critical software infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of three specific avenues of research. The first involves developing a declarative language for expressing dynamic data structure properties, building on existing techniques from static analysis and verification. The second investigates the class of properties that can be checked during a single pass of the garbage collector. The third builds on the machinery of concurrent garbage collection, allowing heap checks to proceed concurrently with the application on available extra CPU cores.</AbstractNarration>
