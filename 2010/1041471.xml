    <AbstractNarration>Following the success of the 1st Pan-American Congress on Plants and BioEnergy held in 2008, the plant bioenergy community will come together again for the 2nd Pan American Congress on Plants and BioEnergy to be held August 8-11, 2009 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. As with the 1st Congress, the goal of this meeting is to bring together governmental policy makers and science administrators along with plant biologists, agronomists, microbiologists, economists and ecologists to discuss issues related to bioenergy security. This year's meeting will focus entirely on bioenergy crops - the progress that is being made to introduce them into the agricultural landscape, the underlying biology of bioenergy plants, and new ideas to enhance biomass yield and quality for the energy crops of the future. The funding provided by NSF helps defray the costs of participation of students and young investigators from the U.S. scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
