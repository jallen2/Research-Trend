    <AbstractNarration>MentorNet is an educational organization devoted to the advancement of underrepresented minority groups in the STEM disciplines, particularly women. To this end, the organization has goals that are directly in line with the mission of the NSF ADVANCE Program. Specifically, MentorNet, through the proposed ADVANCE PAID project will provide online and virtual tools that will enable women of color to expand exiting professional networks and engage in electronic mentoring. The proposed project will also provide an electronic resource of current news, career opportunities and discussion forums for this cadre of women in the academic STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The MentorNet ADVANCE PAID project will serve to raise awareness of and sensitivity to the unique issues and circumstances that are experienced by women of color. Specifically, because of the nature of the electronic platform that will be developed by this project, significant progress will be made in understanding what factors in social networking influence the growth and engagement of women of color as well as what factors produce positive outcomes for mentoring relationships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This organization is able to leverage its vast capacity to provide access to social networking and electronic mentoring to women of color across the nation. Additionally, in its capacity to sustain itself, this project will also indirectly affect future generations of women of color in the STEM disciplines. To that end, the MentorNet ADVANCE PAID project has the potential to contribute significantly to addressing the underrepresentation of STEM women of color in the US and abroad.</AbstractNarration>
