    <AbstractNarration>The International Workshop on Stopping and Manipulation of Ions (SMI-10) will be held at the Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA from March 21-24, 2010. This award will assist with the travel expenses for 3 graduate students and postdocs, allowing broad participation by young scientists to this important workshop. SMI occurs every three years and has been held at a variety of locations around the world. These meetings have international participants, and cover the production, extraction and online separation/identification of rare exotic isotopes. There are many connections between these techniques and those being developed for low background experiments where the identification of specific final state nuclei/atoms could be used to reduce backgrounds. It is expected that, along with its traditional goals, SMI-10 will connect these two communities and provide cross-fertilization.</AbstractNarration>
