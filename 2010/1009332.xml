    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop high efficiency polymers for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). OPVs based on polymers are ideal for environmentally-benign and affordable energy generation. However, the efficiency of OPVs is still low compared to their inorganic counterparts, currently at 7.9%. One of the major reasons is the lack of polymers with the required properties for a high efficiency device, such as strong and broad absorption, high carrier mobility, and appropriate energy levels. This project is expected to demonstrate 10% efficiency for OPVs through the following approaches, (1) design and synthesis of new conjugated polymers with ideal band gap, molecular energy levels, mobility, and processability; and (2) optimization of device structure, polymer film morphology, and interfaces. In this project, processes that will enable OPVs on flexible substrates will also be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to result in high efficiency OPVs that are low-cost, flexible, and can be easily manufactured. This project is anticipated to benefit organic electronics industry by potentially replacing current battery technology in portable power source, thus limiting the use of toxic materials. Successful completion of this project will provide the possibility to achieve up to 7% solar module efficiency.</AbstractNarration>
