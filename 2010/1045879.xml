    <AbstractNarration>The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico on 20 April 2010 has resulted in the largest oil spill in U.S. history. The release continues to this time and has spread to coastal areas of Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds for Oceanographic Instrumentation through Grants for Rapid Response Research to purchase a Seal Analytical QuAAtro 4-channel nutrient analysis system for use at sea aboard the R.V. Cape Hatteras in support of research days for the calendar year 2010 and beyond in their efforts to map in near real time the extent of the plume, both at the surface and in the water column.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
