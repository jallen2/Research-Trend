    <AbstractNarration>Spatial data collections with an incomplete coverage yield regions&lt;br/&gt;with holes and separations that often cannot be filled by&lt;br/&gt;interpolation. Geosensor networks typically generate such&lt;br/&gt;configurations, and with the proliferation of sensor colonies,&lt;br/&gt;there is now an urgent need to provide users with better information&lt;br/&gt;technologies of cognitively plausible methods to search for or&lt;br/&gt;compare available spatial data sets that may be incomplete. The&lt;br/&gt;objective of the investigations is to advance knowledge about&lt;br/&gt;qualitative spatial relations for spatial regions with holes&lt;br/&gt;and/or separations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core activity is the study of the interplay between topological&lt;br/&gt;spatial relations with holed regions and topological spatial relations&lt;br/&gt;with separated regions to address the potentially complex&lt;br/&gt;configurations that feature both holes and separations. Three&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of such a set of topological relations are addressed:&lt;br/&gt;the formalization of a sound set of relations at a granularity that&lt;br/&gt;allows for the distinction of the salient features of holed and&lt;br/&gt;separated regions, while offering the opportunity to generalize to&lt;br/&gt;coarser relations in a meaningful and consistent way; the relaxation of&lt;br/&gt;such relations so that the determination of the most similar relations&lt;br/&gt;follows immediately from the applied methodology; and the qualitative&lt;br/&gt;inference of new information from the composition of such relations to&lt;br/&gt;identify inconsistencies and to drawn information that is not&lt;br/&gt;immediately available from individual relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis is that combining the relation formalization with sound&lt;br/&gt;similarity and composition reasoning yields critical insights for a&lt;br/&gt;sufficiently expressive, common approach to modeling topological&lt;br/&gt;relations for holed regions and regions with separations. The resulting&lt;br/&gt;theory of topological spatial relations highlights a parallelism&lt;br/&gt;between relations with holed regions and regions with separations,&lt;br/&gt;which is most apparent when these regions are embedded on the&lt;br/&gt;surface of the sphere, while some parts of these regularities are often&lt;br/&gt;hidden in the usual planar embedding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since topological relations are qualitative spatial descriptions, they&lt;br/&gt;come close to people's own reasoning, so that a better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the relations for compound spatial objects will have ramifications for&lt;br/&gt;qualitative spatial reasoning, without a need for drawing graphical&lt;br/&gt;depictions to make inferences. It also lays the foundation for&lt;br/&gt;linguistic constructs to communicate in natural language spatial&lt;br/&gt;configurations, ultimately leading to talking maps. An immediate impact&lt;br/&gt;of this theory of topological relations between holed and separated&lt;br/&gt;regions is on the querying and reasoning about dataset that are&lt;br/&gt;gathered by geosensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page:&lt;br/&gt;URL: http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~max/holesAndParts.html</AbstractNarration>
