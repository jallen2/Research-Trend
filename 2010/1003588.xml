    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to support the participation of undergraduate students at the 112th Annual American Ceramic Society (ACerS) meeting to be held in conjunction with the annual 2010 Materials Science and Technology Meeting (MS&amp;T-10) in Houston, TX, October 17-21, 2010. This meeting brings together people across the entire spectrum of activities in the Ceramics community. The funds will be used to cover the cost of conference registration, travel to Houston, TX and per diem for 20 US students. The costs of a facility tour during the conference, as well as participation in the ACerS Annual Awards and Honors Banquet, will also be covered. All the students will be expected to give an oral presentation at the meeting, assuming his or her abstract is accepted.</AbstractNarration>
