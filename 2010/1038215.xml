    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this EFRI-SEED project is to explore materiality from nano- to macroscales based upon understanding of nonlinear, dynamic human cell behaviors on geometrically-defined substrates. The insights as to how cells can modify their immediate extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment with minimal energy and maximal effect will lead to the biomimetic design and engineering of highly aesthetic, passive materials, and sensors and imagers that will be integrated into responsive building skins at the architectural scale. The PIs will (1) use architectural and computational algorithms to guide the design and fabrication of soft substrates with generic 1-D to 3-D geometrical patterns; (2) quantitatively measure and visualize in real-time how human pulmonary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, that interact to contract or relax these substrates to modify substrate geometry; (3) redeploy architectural and algorithmic tools, and model and simulate pattern and material manipulation resulting from nonlinear cellular behaviors so as to transfer this fine-scale design ecology to the macro-scale design of adaptive building skins; (4) apply the understanding to optimal design of materials and geometries that are responsive to environmental factors (e.g. heat, humidity and light); (5) design biomimetic sensors and control systems using CMOS and nanotechnology, and (6) transform the concept from modeling, materials manipulation, and device integration at the nano- and microscales to the design of responsive, yet passive building skins at the architectural and human scale. This project represents a unique avant garde model for sustainable design via the fusion of the architectural design studio with laboratory-based scientific research. In turn, this will benefit a diverse range of science and technologies, including the construction of energy efficient and aesthetic building skins and materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create a significant opportunity to excite the general public, thereby provoking and engaging their interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This work will offer an effective tool to recruit and train students at all levels in a highly-integrated research and educational environment. The research results will be disseminated through: (1) (bi)weekly chalk talks and faculty retreats at Penn, annual workshops at the Mid-Atlantic region, and national conferences and workshops; (2) The website of LabStudio for new discoveries in cell science, visualization techniques, materials, fabrication, and computational modeling frameworks developed from this project; (3) Advertising the technology through the Lab-to-Market Forum and LabStudio to attract industrial interest, and (4) Installation of architectural models resulted from the research at international exhibitions. The research contains novel and synergistic activities, including: (1) the study of cellular nano- and micro-mechanics in Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine (School of Medicine, SOM); (2) materials fabrication and characterization in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE; School of Applied Science &amp; Engineering, SEAS); (3) architectural design, computational modeling, simulation and digital fabrication in design and research labs in Architecture (School of Design, SOD) and Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering (ESE; SEAS) respectively, and (4) device fabrication and integration in labs in ESE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FY 2010 EFRI-SEED Topic that supports this project was sponsored by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorates for Engineering (ENG), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and Computer &amp; Information Science and Engineering in collaboration with the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</AbstractNarration>
