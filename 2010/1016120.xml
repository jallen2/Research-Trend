    <AbstractNarration>OISE 10-16120&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together faculty at Montana State University (MSU) and Gorno Altaisk State University (GASU) in Russia to plan informal science education research and education activities in two distinct but similar mountain systems (Yellowstone USA and Altai Russia). A team of MSU faculty and students will travel to GASU for workshops addressing similar interests in science learning in informal settings. The team will also meet with community members of two villages (Ongudai &amp; Kosh-Agach) in critical ecological and ethno-cultural areas of the Altai. &lt;br/&gt;The MSU principal investigators are Michael Brody (Education), Cliff Montagne (Ecology) and John Fisher (Archaeology). The GASU coordinator of the workshop is Natalia Yurkova (Education &amp; International Programs). In addition, Eleanor Abrams (Education) from the University of New Hampshire (UNH), representing school-based science learning with indigenous Altai people will participate in the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will address informal science learning in an ecological context and focus on issues of culture and diversity as they relate to indigenous populations in contrasting ecological and social systems. Two separate one and a half day workshops in Ongudaisky Region and Kosh-Agachsky Region, Altai Republic will focus on native people?s understanding, values, interests and concerns related to informal learning settings and how these will influence our future research and education activities. &lt;br/&gt;These workshops contribute significantly to our emerging understanding of science learning in informal settings. They address a unique conception of ecological learning in three dimensions; personal, community and cultural perspectives. The inclusion of a school-based perspective merges our understanding of formal and informal science learning in these unique settings. This collaboration provides a holistic view of science learning and will unite diverse intellectual resources and research efforts in unique ecological and social systems.&lt;br/&gt;This work is expected to extend our understanding of science learning related to critical natural and cultural resources and their management. An understanding of how, why and where learning takes place will help extend the US and international research and education agendas related to informal and formal science learning, natural and cultural resource management and social and ecological sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
