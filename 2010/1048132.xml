    <AbstractNarration>The Conference for African-American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences (CAARMS) is an annual conference that allows minority researchers and students in the mathematical sciences from across the country to interact with each other as research mathematicians. Lectures are given by 12 invited speakers who are primarily African-American but not exclusively. The format of the conference allows all of them to give single hour, non-parallel lectures over at three day period. This is to ensure that all the participants of the conference are exposed both to the breath of African-American researchers in the mathematical sciences as well as the breath of the mathematical sciences themselves. Students are encouraged to attend and contribute to the intellectual activity of the conference by making poster presentations on the first day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young researchers attending the conference serve as judges for the posters. Awards are given to the students on the second day. On the third day, the winning students give short lectures about their work. Finally, there are refereed proceedings for some of the conferences. Five have been published to date. Future plans are to have a pre-conference workshop for undergraduate students who are beginning to learn about doing research in the mathematical sciences and one for young faculty on research collaborations and proposal writing. A permanent CAARMS website (www.caarms.net) is being developed that will encourage research collaborative activity throughout the year. The schedule for the next three CAARMS conferences is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAARMS17 (2011)--Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), June 1-4, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;Chairs: Prof. William A. Massey (Princeton University) and Prof. Russel Caflisch (IPAM,&lt;br/&gt;UCLA)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAARMS18 (2012)--Stanford University, June 2012.&lt;br/&gt;Chairs: Prof. William A. Massey (Princeton University) and Prof. Peter Glynn (Stanford&lt;br/&gt;University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAARMS20 (2013)--Princeton University, June 2013.&lt;br/&gt;Chair: Prof. William A.
