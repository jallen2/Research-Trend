    <AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place July 10-23, 2011, at the Instituto Geofísico of the Escuela Politecnica Nacional in Quito, Ecuador. This PASI is a collaborative effort by Olga Cabello of the Incorporated Research Institutions of Seismology Consortium (IRIS) in the United States, and the Centro Regional de Sismologia para America del Sur (CERESIS) in Ecuador. The PASI will gather together early-career researchers to develop a basic understanding of sustainable network operations and earthquake science, as well as to facilitate data exchange and collaboration. It is designed to enable graduate students and post-docs who have a strong background in the fundamentals of seismology to begin collaborating in seismological research internationally and to facilitate future collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to transform the culture of how seismic networks and scientists operate throughout the Americas by encouraging greater data archiving, standardization and sharing. Participants will gain the ability to implement modern seismic methods, including improving earthquake locations and source mechanisms detected by their network. Capacity building for seismic networks across the Americas will benefit the U.S. seismological community by increasing the potential for scientific collaboration with other countries where success of a project often depends on the availability of collaborators and access to reliable data. Expected outcomes for this PASI include: 1) a guide to sustainable network operations; 2) a publically distributed inventory of networks in the Americas; and, 3) a digital index of software and a portal to facilitate future international research. The PASI results will be disseminated through electronic devices for educational purposes with links, updates and logistic information, guides to the network operations, and an inventory to provide the latest data on research problems.</AbstractNarration>
