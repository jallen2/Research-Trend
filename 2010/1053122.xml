    <AbstractNarration>The 2010 Rock Deformation Gordon Research Conference, held August 8-13, 2010 at Tilton School, New Hampshire, highlights the latest research and future trends in brittle and ductile rock mechanics, with experimental, field and theoretical contributions. This conference brings together experts and students in these research areas with experimentalists and theoreticians studying the same processes. Participants explore what is known about non steady-state deformation and how to advance current understanding through geological and geophysical field investigations, laboratory experiments and modeling. Thematic sessions are: 1) what is steady-state?; 2) seismogenic faulting and brittle fault rocks; 3) episodic creep during the seismic cycle; 4) deformation in zones of temperature and stress cycling; 5) deformation, metamorphism and fluids; 6) mechanism and microstructure transitions during deformation; 7) mechanism and microstructure transitions related to mantle geophysics. Participants include specialists in rock mechanics, seismology, tectonics, rheology, geodesy, and structural geology reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of the conference theme. The program includes significant time for all conference participants to debate current problems and future research directions. The principal goal of this conference is not so much to assess or present what has already been accomplished, but rather to look towards the future and open up new research directions. The conference format is designed to involve established leaders, both men and women, in a range of disciplines, in discussion with all participants, and to inspire the postdoctoral scientists and graduate students who will carry the field forward.</AbstractNarration>
