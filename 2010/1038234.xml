    <AbstractNarration>Renewable energy sources including wind and solar can supply a significant amount of electrical energy in the US; however, because of their intermittent nature, the potential of these two energy sources can be fully exploited only if a suitable energy storage system is provided. Considering the requirements of energy capacity, efficiency and cost of this application, the hydrogen-bromine fuel cell has been identified as the most suitable electrical energy storage system. This system has many advantages among which are extremely fast reaction kinetics, high energy storage capacity, and high reliability. The potential was recognized by industrial teams which attempted to develop commercial systems; however, the use of expensive Pt-based catalysts on unstable electrode supports, the high cost, durable and high-performance membranes, and non-optimal cell configurations did not allow for widespread deployment of these fuel cells at the capacities required to have an impact on US energy requirements. The goal of this project is to generate the enabling science and create the engineering technologies needed to develop the regenerative hydrogen-bromine fuel cell system into a cost-effective, efficient, and reliable large-scale energy storage system for renewable energy sources. Four main focus areas have been identified: the design and synthesis of low-cost and durable eletrocatalysts with high reactivity and selectivity for the hydrogen and bromine reactions; the development of highly selective and durable proton conducting membranes for hydrobromic acid operation; the development of electrode microstructures and cell designs that minimize transport effects and maximize conversion efficiency; identification of system configurations and operation that are optimal for integration to the electrical grid. In terms of broader impacts, providing economical technologies to facilitate the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources is a grand challenge of the 21st century. Production of abundant, cheap, clean, reliable, renewable energy is the key, and the search for and commercialization of these energy sources will be the next great global industry. The discoveries, insights, and knowledge gained from this project will have impacts on other electrochemical power systems and may find applications in areas such as electric vehicles and residential/commercial power. The educational and outreach component of this project will help create a new diverse generation of engineers and researchers who will play a major role in development of this technology and the creation of a new energy industry. The outcome of this project will contribute to fundamental advances in electrocatalysis, polymer science, electrode design, nano-manufacturing and integration of large-scale energy storage to the electrical grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FY 2010 EFRI-SEED Topic that supports this project was sponsored by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorates for Engineering (ENG), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and Computer &amp; Information Science and Engineering in collaboration with the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</AbstractNarration>
