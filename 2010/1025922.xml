    <AbstractNarration>The family Phoridae is a large group of small (0.5-6.0 mm long) flies that are found worldwide. The 4,000 species that are currently known may represent as little as 10% of the actual total number of species. In the phorid genus Apocephalus, 275 described species are found only in North, Central, and South America. These flies are parasitic, mostly on ants, and the larvae feed on ant tissue and often decapitate their ant host. In addition, the parasitic flies may have profound effects on a variety of ant behaviors. In this project, approximately 400 species of Apocephalus will be revised (the rest of the genus having been previously treated by the PI). Many new species will be described, their relationships investigated using both DNA sequences and body structure, and a new classification proposed. Field work in North America (Arizona, Texas) and the New World tropics (Argentina, Costa Rica, Peru) will uncover additional new species and host-parasite associations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These flies have a strong potential to be used as biological control agents of their host ants. This project will make Apocephalus species available as possible biocontrol tools by providing published and online keys for identifying the species, and making web pages so that information about them is generally available. Two new graduate students will be trained in the project, providing more expertise on phorid fly identification and broadening the scope of the project.</AbstractNarration>
