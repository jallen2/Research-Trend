    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of an adaptive immersive experience for on-going teacher in-service education and to improve science teacher?s understanding of physics concepts and principles which they will in turn teach to their own students. The innovation underlying this proposal is to integrate pedagogically sound training principles derived from intelligent tutoring system research into immersive environments to improve the understanding of physics concepts and principles in both teachers and students in high school and post-high school educational settings. An intelligent immersive environment will adapt its instruction e.g., differentially giving advice to students based on an assessment of their overall performance, to the individual learner thus improving the efficacy and efficiency of the instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing scarcity of qualified science teachers and especially physics teachers at the high school level. The proposed activity will advance the education and training communities? understanding of intelligent instruction in immersive environments by creating an instance (i.e., a physics environment) which can serve as a foundation for future research. In addition, the innovation is a point solution aiming to improve science teacher?s understanding of physics concepts and principles to improve their own teaching endeavors. The initial solution will be fielded in San Antonio and the South Texas region, an area with a high Hispanic population. Upon refinement, the physics environment could reach traditionally under-represented populations who have limited access to master physics instructors. Locally, the proposed project will extend the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) relationships of the ongoing San Antonio Math Science Education Coalition (SAMSEC) involving business, secondary education, and post-secondary education organizations.</AbstractNarration>
