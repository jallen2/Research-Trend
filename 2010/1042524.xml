    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial support to students matriculated at US institutions for attending ACMMM 2010. ACM Multimedia is the most prestigious conference world-wide in the multimedia area, covering all aspects of multimedia technologies and applications. Being the flagship conference of ACM Special Interest Group in Multimedia since 1993, it has been the most comprehensive and competitive venue for publication and interaction in the community. It includes a highly dynamic program consisting of a wide spectrum of activities, ranging from full-length research papers, demos, brave new topics, art exhibitions, to industrial grand challenge competitions. The pervasive presence of industry players provide a valuable opportunity for researchers and especially students to access knowledge, expertise, and problems arising from the industry settings. The unique location in Italy also attracts many well-known leading research groups from around the world and multi-national projects in Europe. It represents a great opportunity for US students to interact with top researchers in this forum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requires funding to partially support US students to attend ACMMM2010. Student applications for this travel support are solicited from the broad multimedia community, and are reviewed by a student selection committee. The Intellectual merit includes the opportunity for students to learn the cutting edge research and interact with experts in the best multimedia conference. The broad impact is to train and develop the future generation of leaders and workforce in this critical field.</AbstractNarration>
