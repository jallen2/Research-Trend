    <AbstractNarration>Over the past decade, a variety of nanomaterials have been synthesized as a result of intense research efforts. Now, it is very important to investigate collective behaviors/phenomena/interactions from a group of nanomaterials and find methodologies of maneuvering their extraordinary properties for the use of practical applications. Proposed research is to synthesize building blocks of various nanoparticle heterostructures and characterize transport properties of energy carriers such as electrons and phonons. Multi-dimensional nanomaterials including nanodots, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanosheets will be mixed to form films and bulk materials. In addition, the junctions and surfaces of such nanomaterials will be systematically altered for investigating the influence of modifications. The chemistry and methodologie for modifying nanomaterials, which is of great importance for building functional materials, will be intensively explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will reveal key knowledge and understanding for developing and designing practical bulk-scale applications as well as provide profound understanding of carrier transport phenomena across nanoscale contacts/junctions/interfaces, which have not been extensively studied, but are of great importance in nanomaterials. Studying collective behaviors of nanomaterials is very transformative because nanomaterials need to be combined to build function materials for a practical use. Furthermore, this study offer fundamentals that are essential for many charge/heat transport related applications including thermoelectric and photovoltaic energy conversion, electronics, thermal management, and sensors. Research outcomes have been or will be integrated into core undergraduate courses, a new graduate course for undergraduate/graduate students as well as research/education programs for 6-12/undergraduate/graduate students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>
