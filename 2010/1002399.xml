    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Lawrence Hall, Mary K Gaillard, Ori Ganor, Hitoshi Murayama, and Bruno Zumino at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These five faculty members are pursuing a many-faceted program of research in theoretical high-energy physics. Professor Ganor conducts research in M-theory, string theory, supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, and field theories in higher dimensions, and he will search for possible tests of string theory and M-theory in cosmology. Professor Gaillard studies effective supergravity theories at the quantum level, with an emphasis on those derived from the weakly coupled heterotic string. She will explore the implications of these theories for collider physics and cosmology. Professor Hall will study unsolved issues involved in electroweak symmetry breaking, and connections between particle physics and cosmology. For example, he will study how inflation and dark energy can be incorporated into fundamental theories. Professor Murayama will study the physics behind the electroweak symmetry breaking. He will also study underground physics such as neutrino physics and the physics of dark matter and proton decay. Finally, Professor Zumino studies various aspects of non-commutative quantum field theories and (super)string theories. He plans to go beyond the known mathematical techniques in order to develop a deformation quantization of differential forms for gauge theories and a functional super-star product for (super)string field theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Collectively, this research group provides training to students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists. They also promote diversity through a female PI, and they seek and encourage participation by women students and scientists. Because the general public is deeply interested in fundamental questions, the Berkeley theory group will also work with QuarkNet teachers to bring the excitement of forefront research to high-school students. Strong ties to the Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU) in Tokyo through Murayama's directorship will also bring international connections to students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>
