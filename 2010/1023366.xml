    <AbstractNarration>The Arctic lower troposphere represents a sensitive balance between surface, atmospheric boundary layer, and cloud processes, forming a cloud-ABL-surface (CAS) system. Changes to a component in this system will produce physical responses in the other components, culminating in the net system response to the change. In order to accurately simulate the net CAS contributions and responses to a component change, such as to the predicted change from primarily multi-year sea-ice to first-year sea-ice, the process interactions between the CAS components must be well understood and quantitatively represented in coupled climate models. Unfortunately, the understanding of various key processes and their interactions is very nascent, leading to poor representations in current global or regional climate models. Hence, significant uncertainties exist in modeled parameters such as cloud fraction, ice water path, and liquid water path, resulting in surface cloud radiative forcing that varies by 40 W m-2 among models and modeled surface turbulent heat fluxes that have poor correlations with observations. Even basic surface parameters, such as albedo, are often not physically represented and provide a source of significant errors to the CAS system. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on understanding the complex processes and interactions in the Arctic CAS system using existing observations and process models and on improving key parameterizations in these process models. A broad range of existing in-situ and remotely sensed observational data will be used in the analyses. The process modeling will be done with multiple-resolution configurations of the Weather and Research Forecasting Model (WRF). Observational analyses and model evaluations will be conducted using process-oriented diagnostics -- diagnostics that reveal physical relationships directly relevant to a process and/or parameterization. Through informal collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), preliminary evaluations of the ability of a state-of-the-art global climate model (GCM), the Community Climate System Model (CCSM), to faithfully represent these process interactions will also be performed, providing initial insight as to whether key processes and relationships found in observations and process models are also represented in CCSM.</AbstractNarration>
