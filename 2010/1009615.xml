    <AbstractNarration>The potential for cosmological observations in the 21 cm line, using the Universe's phase transition from neutral to ionized hydrogen called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), has been widely recognized. The EoR, when the first stars, proto-galaxies and quasars emerged, is a very interesting time, because that object formation leads to patchy 21-cm brightness structure, which should be detectable today at redshifts near nine. Several large telescopes sensitive at meter wavelengths are already being used in attempts to detect and eventually map this patchiness. A great deal of theoretical work has been dedicated to predicting 21 cm signatures, and many groups are awaiting the first observational data. This project will use the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to observe the patchy neutral gas and thus pin down the timing of the reionization as well as the duration of the partially ionized era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these astronomical goals, this study will continue a program of noise reduction at GMRT, including the elimination of terrestrial noise sources and the installation of lower noise amplifiers, which will benefit all users of the telescope. Additional benefits will come from the development of new signal processing techniques, from programs to make astronomy and physics more accessible to students and to the public, and from several programs specifically targeting high school students.</AbstractNarration>
