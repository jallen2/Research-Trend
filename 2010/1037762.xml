    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will study the impact of a unique educational model on the engagement and retention of veteran students in their first year of engineering study. The model centers around the creation of a veteran engineer's Learning Community and establishing active learning pedagogies for students who are veterans. The project seeks to understand how each of these interventions impacts learning outcomes, retention, and transition of veterans from two year college to other programs or careers. The model proposed may be widely transferable to other schools who also seek to target veterans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project are to inform other colleges about effective interventions for veterans. The proposed program seeks to create balanced, long-term, incremental improvements. The program specifically targets outreach efforts towards low income, first generation students, Native Americans, rural veterans.</AbstractNarration>
