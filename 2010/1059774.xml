    <AbstractNarration>The American Institutes for Research (AIR) will implement a process to analyze, engage, and inform the higher education communities' direction and approach to workforce development and broadening participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). AIR will gather expert and stakeholder input that informs workforce development and broadening participation efforts. The study will include a thorough analysis of underrepresented group STEM enrollment and graduation over time in institutions of higher education in the United States. As a result of this work, the STEM higher education community will be provided with suggestions for strengthening STEM education at the undergraduate level in colleges and universities throughout the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The national STEM workforce imperative and the diversity challenge in the U.S. require critical examination. This project will advance the knowledge and understanding related to STEM diversity at the undergraduate level. Ultimately, this knowledge can inform the training and preparation of future generations of workers and thus strengthen U.S. competiveness. The integration of national trend analysis of enrollment and completion data, stakeholder input and review of STEM scholarship and NSF reports will provide a triangulated platform upon which to build improved workforce development strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. As the global economy depends increasingly on the kinds of innovations and ideas made possibly by a highly educated workforce, the United States needs to increase the number of American citizens who pursue degrees in STEM disciplines. Shifts in the demographic makeup of the U.S., in turn, make on-going concerns about educational diversity for all sectors of the community increasingly important. The NSF workforce development and broadening participation portfolio of programs is designed to enhance diversity in STEM, but the field needs to know where STEM degree production excels and why. By soliciting recommendations and feedback from a wide range of stakeholders, information will be obtained to inform the development and strengthening of programs and strategies, as well as provide direction for the improvement of STEM education at the undergraduate level.</AbstractNarration>
