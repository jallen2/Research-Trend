    <AbstractNarration>The cognitive science view of humans as "cognitively limited information processors" has spread to many of the sister behavioral sciences, including political science. Few political scientists have thoroughly embraced this approach, however, to the extent of adopting its methodologies or critically examining its implications for the discipline. Even fewer political scientists are conducting the type of research that will advance our basic understanding of how people think about, feel, and process social information. One of the difficulties for political scientists pursuing an information processing perspective is the dearth of serious research methodologies that are well-suited to gathering detailed information processing data in the types of complex social environments that political scientists like to study. Moreover, few political scientists are trained in the type of experimental methods that are utilized in basic cognitive research. This project seeks to rectify this situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With prior support from the National Science Foundation, the principal investigators developed one such methodology, which they call dynamic process tracing, and software to implement the methodology, Dynamic Process Training Environment Program. This task has taken longer than was originally anticipated. Pretesting and error checking of "Version 1.0" of the software has already begun, as has a nascent dissemination program. This project will result in the completion of the software, its final testing, and its distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once the software has been completed and thoroughly tested, it will be publicized, making it and an associated programming manual freely available to others in the scientific community. The principal investigators will also provide training sessions at professional meetings to encourage other researchers to use the program.</AbstractNarration>
