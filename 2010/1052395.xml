    <AbstractNarration>The root is of vital importance because it anchors plants to the soil and it absorbs and transports water, nutrients and solutes to the shoot. Despite its importance, questions remain about how root architecture is controlled, particularly in important crops. Which genes and pathways regulate root architecture, cell patterning and proliferation? How are these genes and pathways different in plants that display natural variation in root architecture? Which root architecture genes were selected during domestication of crops from wild species? Root architecture in the wild tomato relative, Solanum pennellii is of special interest, due to its drought and salinity tolerance. This project will identify important genes regulating root development using lines derived from a cross between wild S. pennellii and domesticated tomato (S. lycopersicum). Each line has different genes from S. pennellii that may contribute to its root architecture. Morphological and cellular measures of root development, along with molecular genomic data describing gene expression differences will be collected for this population. Using these data and statistical and computational methods quantitative trait loci (QTL) and expression QTL (eQTL) that contribute to differences in root architecture will be identified. Further work will define gene regulatory interactions, biological processes, and ancestral regulatory pathways as well as identify candidate causal genes controlling variation in root development. A significant goal of this project is to train all team members in an interdisciplinary manner linking quantitative biology to the cell biology associated with plant development. For many, tomato is a major component of the daily meal and it constitutes an important source of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. This project will identify genes influencing root architecture, and potentially drought resistance and insect tolerance in this important crop. The outcome will influence our basic understanding of genes and regulatory pathways associated with root development, speciation and evolution.</AbstractNarration>
