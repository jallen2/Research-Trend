    <AbstractNarration>This project funds the Early Career Symposium as part of the Annual International Conference of the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT). The conference is held in Anaheim California October 26-30, 2010.The Symposium will engage participants in a day and a half of focused mentoring, and provide a wiki for continuing community development. The Symposium brings together three groups of people: mid career faculty that will act as mentors, early career faculty, and advanced doctoral students. The invited mentors are recognized for their contribution to the fields of instructional technology and learning sciences. The goal of the Symposium is to (1) mentor advanced doctoral students in the social and professional network as partners in idea-making, (2) support advanced doctoral students and early career faculty in developing viable technology oriented research agendas, (3) provide specific feedback and guidance to advanced doctoral students and early career faculty about their research agendas, (4) provide information about building a research agenda, pursuing funding, and building collaborations, (5) develop a community of researchers interested in ways technology can transform teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>
