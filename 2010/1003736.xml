    <AbstractNarration>This project is a partnership between the Configurable Space Microsystems and Innovations Center at the University of New Mexico, Chandler-Gilbert Community College, Glendale Community College, Central Arizona College and J.F. Drake State Technical College to create a complete on-line curriculum, including laboratories, in the area of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for electrical and computer technicians that is suitable for community colleges. The goals of this project include (1) development of an online core curriculum (including laboratory material) for FPGA technician education, (2) establishment of FPGA laboratories at four community colleges, (3) a series of educational workshops for 90 academic instructors to build teaching capacity at the community colleges, (4) increased use of hardware description language (HDL) design techniques in degree and certificate programs at community colleges with articulation to 4-year degree programs, and (5) the creation of an industry advisory council to establish skill standards for FPGA technicians. The project starts with four community colleges and ultimately expands to twelve institutions, thus ensuring that the project has statewide impact and that students from a variety of backgrounds and groups have the opportunity to participate. The course materials developed in this project are being made available electronically at no cost via an existing web portal hosted by the University of New Mexico. The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator. The evaluation plan is designed to establish the quality of the materials and to ensure the project goals are met.</AbstractNarration>
