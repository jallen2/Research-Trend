    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the University of Mary Washington (UMW) is completing a series of initiatives to recruit and retain STEM majors, particularly students who are members of groups that are traditionally under-represented in the STEM disciplines. The suite of activities in this Type 1A project provides pathways to success in the STEM disciplines by (1) enhancing an existing summer bridge program with a revised pre-calculus course and a new interdisciplinary science research course to better prepare students for STEM disciplines, (2) adding new undergraduate research experiences, particularly for first and second year students, including peer mentoring by upper-level STEM majors and early-engagement training for faculty through workshops, (3) creating a new STEM outreach program for high school students that provides opportunities to engage in research and other activities with faculty and undergraduate student research teams, (4) creating a STEM learning community by implementing a supplemental instruction program, (5) establishing a STEM diversity scholarship program to attract qualified, culturally diverse students to UMW, and (6) creating a new STEM colloquium for faculty and students to share their research with a larger STEM community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal of the STEREPS project is that the University of Mary Washington will graduate an additional 20 STEM majors per year by years 3-5 of the project, with approximately 5 of these STEM majors from under-represented groups each year. The project provides an environment for improved collaboration and dissemination across the STEM disciplines at UMW, an increase in the number and diversity of STEM graduates entering the region's STEM workforce, and the dissemination of scientific and pedagogical results at regional and national conferences.</AbstractNarration>
