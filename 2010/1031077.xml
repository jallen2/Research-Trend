    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this Grant Opportunities and Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) investigation is to understand how multiple Synthetic Jet Actuators (SJAs) can work together in arrays and to advance the field of SJA-based active flow control toward practical application. The proposed research involves 1) the extension and experimental validation of analytical models of synthetic jet actuators that incorporates the dynamic coupling of multiple actuators and the surrounding flow fields; and 2) use of these models for creating synthetic jet arrays capable of facilitating closed-loop active flow control on real flight platforms. The proposed research includes introducing new modeling techniques that mitigate the need for empirical data and allow for inclusion in closed-loop control algorithms. To achieve this multiple straight vortex tubes will be aligned to simulate the issuing jet arrays. This new modeling technique will allow for the addition of multiple jets in close proximity and due to its low computational expense, is well suited for plant implementation and closed-loop control. The ability to quickly model multiple actuator configurations and include them in a control law will enable the optimization of synthetic jet actuator arrays for a multitude of applications. This fundamental design ability is the link between synthetic jet technology and the realization of active flow control on full-size aerospace vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthetic jet actuator-based active flow control holds the potential for widespread application throughout the aerospace industry. However, the current state of the art of synthetic jet performance is inadequate to realize this potential on full-scale applications. Increased structural efficiency, simplification of control surfaces and increased variability of aerodynamic properties are a few example benefits this technology will substantially contribute to and through which it will impact the ?Green Aircraft? revolution. For example, ?virtual shape change? is the displacement of streamlines without the use of traditional control surfaces such as ailerons and flaps. By using a spatially distributed SJA array, the wing can be structurally optimized to minimize weight and complexity while SJAs displace the streamlines to create a virtual airfoil shape that also optimizes aerodynamic performance. The outcome of this goal will be fundamental insights into the use of multiple actuators for creating synthetic jets with performance output, controllability and versatility heretofore not seen in the industry.</AbstractNarration>
