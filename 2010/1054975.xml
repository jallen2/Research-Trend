    <AbstractNarration>Mobile phones and other similar portable systems are essentially embedded systems designed using analog/mixed-signal system-on-chips. These systems consist of several heterogeneous components including digital circuits, analog/mixed-signal circuits, power management systems, and software. The goal of International Symposium on Electronic System Design (ISED) is to bring experts from these fields together for the efficient design of such portable systems. The next issue that arises is how to train the next generation engineers to acquire the needed expertise. Thus, ISED has an integrated Workshop for Engineering Scholars (WES) and an Expo on Electronic Systems (EES). Overall, ISED creates a venue for researchers, educators, students, and industry personnel for close interaction for the advancement of research, education, and international collaboration in electronic system design. ISED is being held for the first time in Bhubaneswar, India, and this proposal seeks funding for supporting the travel and registration expenses of a few selected US students and keynote speakers to attend the conference in India. This should help in increasing the Indo-US collaboration in the area of electronic design.</AbstractNarration>
