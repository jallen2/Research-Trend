    <AbstractNarration>Piedmont Virginia Community College proposes to strengthen its Information Systems Technology and Electronics and Computer Technology programs to meet growing demand for technicians in the region. The college is piloting several strategies to increase enrollment, retention, and job placement. Some of these strategies include establishing a technology consortium of local employers, faculty professional development for high school and community college faculty, and paid student internships. Best practices will be implemented, including targeted recruitment, to attract women and to maintain the current high percentages of minority students. Increased production of computer technicians is expected to make a positive impact on the economic success of the Central Virginia region. Project results will be shared with the Virginia Community College System and the NSF ATE community.</AbstractNarration>
