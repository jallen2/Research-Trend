    <AbstractNarration>Multinational companies' ability to communicate effectively and establish good relationships with their political, economic and social stakeholders (i.e., those who have a say in or whose welfare is directly or indirectly affected by their projects) are important. Financial, marketing, engineering and legal strategies are often undermined by a lack of political and social support. This research integrates expected utility models from political economy with network models from sociology to explore the link between stakeholder engagement strategies and financial and operational performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The empirical context for analysis is 28 gold mines across 20 countries operated by 21 firms listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. This sample is chosen due to the high political and social salience of the industry, Canadian regulatory requirements to disclose detailed financial and operational data, and the ability to link stakeholder events to this financial and operational data due to the ownership of no more than three mines by each company. The research constructs a detailed hand-coded stakeholder event database capturing each instance in which two stakeholders are linked by a subject-verb-object triple in a sentence within one of the 24,000 media articles reporting on these mines. Additional data on the degree of cooperation or conflict between stakeholders and the content of stakeholder actions is also hand-coded. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This combination of data allows for the construction of dynamic stakeholder networks for each mine in which stakeholders are clustered according to their degree of cooperation or conflict and/or the depth of their joint activity. Using this data, the research examines whether investor efforts to enhance cooperation with or construct new ties with stakeholders in this network are facilitated or impeded by prior decisions regarding which stakeholders an investor associates with, the existing structure of the stakeholder network, and the content of the activities the investor engages in with stakeholders. Further analysis will explore the relationship between the resulting degree of cooperation or conflict within this network and investor financial performance in terms of abnormal stock market returns and operational performance in terms of delays in opening of the mines. Qualitative field work on 4-6 mines will supplement this quantitative analysis by examining more precisely the mechanisms of stakeholder influence and contingencies or context dependence that lie outside the scope of econometric investigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the intellectual merit described above, the project will have broader impacts. The stakeholder event database will be publicly released for widespread academic use. Findings from the research should have practical implications for both managers and public policy makers.</AbstractNarration>
