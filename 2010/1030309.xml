    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the effort to better understand and measure ocean mixing around the globe, which is important for understanding the ocean role in climate and improving ocean climate prediction models. Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (LADCP) and CTD data will be compared with micro-structure observations to test and improve methods for implementing the Gregg-Henyey method of parameterization. The PI is an expert in the treatment and processing of LADCP data, and believes that widely varying discrepancies in mixing estimates may result from problems in how that data is used. The ultimate goals of the project will be the public distribution of a combine fine- and micro-structure database for estimating ocean mixing; an accurate and reliable implementation of the Gregg-Henyey parameterization; and an improved suite of LADCP processing software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has a strong record of community service to oceanographers through the development of refined techniques for obtaining and processing LADCP data. These data are used globally and influence many areas of oceanographic research. The project has the potential to further impact the oceanographic and climate communities by making it possible to confidently estimate ocean mixing from routinely available data at sea. The PI has intimate knowledge of the caveats and issues and is uniquely poised to make transformative progress on the topic.</AbstractNarration>
