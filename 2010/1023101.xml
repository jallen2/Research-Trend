    <AbstractNarration>Engineered networks usually operate at their capacity limits. The ability for a complex engineered network to maintain its robustness and functionality in the presence of attacks and/or failures is an outstanding issue in science and engineering with tremendous implications to society and homeland defense. The aims of the exploratory research are to develop a mathematical theory to understand the critical dynamics of complex engineered networks and to articulate effective control strategies for building more efficient, secure, robust, and optimally functional networked systems. In particular, the interplay among the functionality, network evolution, robustness and security will be investigated. Network capacity will be defined based on laws of physical flows and the impact of network's evolution toward the capacity limit on its structure and function will be explored, leading to effective control strategies. Results from the exploratory research will form the base for a more comprehensive program of interdisciplinary study on complex networks at ASU with significant applications in natural sciences, engineering, social science, economy, and defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on fundamental issues concerning the functionality, structure, security and dynamics of complex networks, enabling identification of the vulnerabilities of real-world engineered networks, which can be used either for the protection of infrastructural networks or for the destruction of pathological and adversarial networks. The research will also provide guidance for designing more robust engineered networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research requires tools from statistical and nonlinear physics, mathematics, control and industrial engineering, and scientific computing. Besides providing a solid mathematical foundation for the problem of network robustness and security, the work will be a demonstration of how interdisciplinary approach can lead to solutions to realistic problems of significant societal concern, due to the ubiquity and importance of complex engineered networks to the modern infrastructure of the US. The research will also help create an exciting interdisciplinary environment for graduate and undergraduate students from various disciplines of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
