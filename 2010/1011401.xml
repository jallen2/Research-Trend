    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science Master's Program in Biomanufacturing and Bioprocessing: From Science to Business in Biomanufacturing: the Missing Link for the US Biotechnology Industry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Georgia's Science Master?s Program in Biomanufacturing and Bioprocessing will train science and technology graduates for leadership roles in the rapidly expanding and vitally important biomanufacturing field, impacting areas such as biofuel production, green chemical manufacturing and biopharmaceuticals. Biomanufacturing is the production of natural products using living organisms such as yeast and bacteria through fermentation and cell culture. The program will prepare students for immediate engagement in an industry that is short of leaders equipped with the necessary science, technology and engineering skills combined with proven business and project management training. The program will be innovative in its combination of academic and industry led training; in bringing together exceptional scientific, engineering and business educators with a combined focus; and in giving students access to state of the art equipment, practical and virtual training experiences to ensure their readiness for a challenging and rewarding workplace. Students will have access to the exceptional and unique biomanufacturing facilities at the University of Georgia where they will work with industry leading equipment and control systems. Potential employers and companies that produce biomanufacturing tools will work alongside faculty to guide, train, set challenges for, and provide internships to students. Students will emerge with an understanding of the biology, biochemistry, chemical engineering, process control and regulatory aspects that underpin fermentation, cell culture and product purification. More importantly, they will have the ability to apply that knowledge in a competitive global business community to support the growth of environmentally sustainable manufacturing in the USA with beneficial impacts on the economy, environment, healthcare and national security.</AbstractNarration>
