    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professors Thomas Spiro, David Baker, Daniel R. Gamelin, and Christine K. Luscombe, all of the University of Washington, who seek support for research on the creation of metallo-macrocycle-protein constructs as novel photocatalysts for H2 production from water. The central idea of this project is to combine photon capture and H2 production into a single chemical assembly. This proposal brings together the key design elements needed to produce an effective H2-evolving solar photocathode. Progress toward the goal of efficient H2 photoproduction will provide more in-depth understanding of photoelectrochemistry and catalysis. Both topics are of intense current interest, but are generally studied separately. Should the project succeed, it will bring both scientific and practical dividends. Water splitting is a major scientific focus for the future, and these results will garner wide interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program, Professors Thomas Spiro, David Baker, Daniel R. Gamelin, and Christine K. Luscombe, all of the University of Washington (UW), will perform research on a project that may point the way toward efficient and inexpensive photocatalysts, which could play a significant role in the development of a solar-hydrogen economy. This work is motivated by the urgency of developing new and clean sources of energy. The capture and conversion of sunlight can meet a major fraction of future human energy needs; however, energy storage and conversion to transportation fuels pose major challenges. Broader impacts include communicating with the public through participation in the University of Washington's CLEAN ENERGY initiative, which maintains a website and runs conferences and workshops for energy stakeholders. The PIs will also participate in Seattle's Pacific Science Center outreach activities. In addition, the general public will be recruited to contribute to the protein design aspects of the project through the popular fold.it (http://fold.it) on-line computer game developed by the Baker group and collaborators. They will also participate in the successful high-school outreach program run by the NSF Center for Enabling New Technologies through Catalysis, housed at UW, which also provides us a mechanism for recruiting minority undergraduates to their laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
