    <AbstractNarration>This NSDL Usage Development Workshops project is increasing and improving the use of NSDL Science Literacy Maps as tools for understanding K-12 science learning progressions and for selecting and using NSDL resources. To foster the broader adoption and meaningful use of the interactive maps, the project leaders are: (1) conducting face-to-face workshops to introduce users to the Science Literacy Maps and engage them in activities designed to help them understand and use all of the map features; (2) developing just-in-time online learning tools that are accessible through the Science Literacy Maps home page and the individual NSDL Pathways' web sites; and (3) undertaking a broad dissemination strategy that leverages the capabilities of AAAS and the collaborating NSDL entities. This work is guided by an analysis of user needs, an expert advisory group, and an evaluation plan designed to provide necessary formative input as well as summative data. Feedback from workshop participants is also informing the long term development of the Science Literacy Maps in a user-driven process. Finally, to contribute to the NSDL program's goal of testing "the impact of collections and resources for instructors on teachers' activities," the investigators are examining the extent participants in the workshops are able to subsequently apply the knowledge and skills gained to accomplishing educational tasks.</AbstractNarration>
