    <AbstractNarration>Abstract Proposal 1039543 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to develop and demonstrate a hybrid aeroelastic flutter and piezoelectric energy harvesting system based on freestanding graphene. Individual microdevices consisting of a graphene layer covered with the piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) trifluoroethylene (TrFE) will generate an alternating electric potential as air-flow induces a self-oscillitory flutter motion in free standing regions. Power is generated from the alternating tension/compression of the bottom layer of the P (VDF-TrFE), and extracted via the conducting graphene-band supporting the polymer layer. In this Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER), we will perform the feasibility of graphene-based energy harvesting systems with the goal of achieving a proof-of-concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will lead to the development of a new energy resource of microscale wind-belt based on combined aerodyanamic, piezoelectric, and nanoelectric systems if successfully demonstrated. As part of the project, critical insight will be gained into fundamentals of graphene dynamics and electrical properties when measured in a laminar-flow microfluidic channel. Furthermore, investigating novel systems such as the proposed piezo-flutter generator is critical to decreasing the use of wasteful and often hazardous batteries, while simultaneously allowing increases in power consumption and functionality desired in today's mobile devices. Finally, the proposed research will examine the coupling of flutter and piezoelectric phenomenon, and study the nature of the graphene flutter phenomenon while studying hybrid freestanding structures in microfluidics to control flow turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This project will design and develop a new class of graphene-based flutter energy harvesting system which will benefit our society in many important ways. The grapheme based flutter system will provide a knowledge base, and benefit practical applications such as a micro-battery and an energy resource for sensors without the requirement of strict maintenance. For education efforts, the new knowledge gained from the proposed research will be incorporated into the PI's nanotechnology undergraduate education (NUE) course, ENG 0240. For student training, a graduate student and undergraduate students will work together on this project.</AbstractNarration>
