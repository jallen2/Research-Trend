    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program, Profs. Richard Van Duyne and George Schatz of Northwestern University, and Dr. Francesca Casadio of the Art Institute of Chicago, seek to develop new analytical and theoretical methods to determine the molecular structure of natural organic pigments and dyes, both original and deteriorated, used in cultural heritage materials. Targeted aims include ultrahigh sensitivity, high spatial resolution, minimum sample damage, generality, and independence from reference libraries for identification. Both plan-view and cross section molecular mapping capabilities are sought, at multiple spatial scales (micro to macro). Deep near infrared (NIR; 800-1300 nm) excited surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) will be developed to study pigments and dyes with minimum fluorescence and minimum damage to precious art works. Advanced theoretical methods will be used for molecular structure identification beyond the limitations of a pigment library. Theory will also be used to predict possible degradation mechanisms of faded colorants and to model optical properties and optimal structures of plasmonic nanoparticles and their assemblies to give maximum SERS sensitivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These collaborative studies will have broad impact not only on nanoscale science and technology (including plasmonics/SERS), but from providing opportunities for students and postdocs (including members of underrepresented groups) to appreciate and engage in unique research at the interface between art and science. The work includes outreach to a wide public audience, using both the visual and media appeal of research stories tied to widely recognized paintings and works of art. Finally, the PIs will work with the AIC's Museum Education Department to develop innovative materials and programs that illuminate the myriad connections between exploration in the sciences and interactive experiences with art. Specifically, a one-week intensive summer course for teens (Inquire/Design) will be developed and offered broadly with an emphasis on attracting minority students in Chicago. The broad audience base in terms of general public and teachers/students served through the AIC's Student Program division of the department of Museum Education will exponentially enhance the outreach of this science/art program.</AbstractNarration>
