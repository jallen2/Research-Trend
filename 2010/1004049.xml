    <AbstractNarration>The Fields Institute in Toronto will host and fund (Canadian $200,000) a Thematic Program on The Mathematics of Drug Resistance in Infectious Diseases", July-August 2010. This application seeks support for junior U.S. researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty) to participate in the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drug resistance by bacteria and virus has been regarded as one of the biggest threats to public health in the new century. The proposed two-month thematic program at the Fields Institute will focus on the Emergence of Drug Resistance in Infectious Diseases and will bring together leading researchers in mathematical epidemiology/immunology from around the world in order to stimulate major progress in this area. The program will consist of two main sub-themes that are of fundamental importance to understanding and predicting the emergence of drug resistance: (a) Mathematical Immunology: from In-host to Population Modeling; (b) Transmission Heterogeneity in Infectious Diseases. Each of the above sub-themes represents an important area of current research interest and importance to public health, and each also provides ample opportunities for the advancement of mathematical theories and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>
