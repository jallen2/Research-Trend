    <AbstractNarration>This project is to support the participation of students in Fifth Symposium on Computational Wind Engineering in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on May 23-27, 2010. The symposium is organized every four years and is a major event emphasizing the computational aspects of wind engineering. The student participation in this symposium will provide them an excellent opportunity to interact with and learn from a large number of established researchers and practitioners working in the area of wind engineering and wind hazard mitigation. This will enhance their scientific knowledge base to get involved more deeply in the topic to address the engineering problems of current interest. This will also help in training the next generation of workforce who will eventually be involved in the mitigation of the wind related hazards.</AbstractNarration>
