    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Department of Defense (ASSURE Program) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Christopher T. Culbertson and Stefan H. Bossmann at Kansas State University. The majority of research projects supported in this site are in areas of chemistry with applications in national security (e.g. detection of chemical and biological agents.) The site will have support for three summers, commencing in 2010. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. Sample projects include: (1) the development of microfluidic devices with integrated surface plasmon detectors; (2) the detection of pathogenic Burkholderia bacteria based upon their surface virulence components; (3) the development of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectroscopies for detection of chemical and biological warfare agents; (4) the design and synthesis of portable biosensors ; (5) the design of porous inorganic-organic hybrid materials for incorporation and destruction of chemical warfare simulants; (6) the development of nanoelectronic biosensors for biosecurity; (7) the detection of chemical and biological warfare agents with terahertz spectroscopy; (8) the investigation of the surface chemistry of Group III nitrides for detecting chemical and biological warfare agents; (9) the inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication; and (10) single-molecule studies of molecularly-imprinted silica films. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities. An interesting component of this REU site is the inclusion of lectures on the history and philosophy of science. The site also includes training in scientific ethics. The site will recruit nationwide, with a particular focus on recruitment of students in the Kansas/Missouri community and will include students in community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity. The research projects are in diverse areas of chemistry, many of which will have an impact in areas of national security. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
