    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Research objectives and approaches: The objective of this research is to develop next generation 3-dimensional (3D) neural probes with combined electrical and chemical interfaces. The approach of the proposed neural probe technology is based on a flexible skin technology and a simple folding process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The proposed technology simplifies the fabrication and assembly process of high density 3D arrays of electrodes. Furthermore, this technology enables integration of microchannels with 3D neural probes. These channels, together with electrodes, enable combined electrical and chemical stimulation, thus opening the door to many important new applications. Local drug delivery at the implantation site by microchannels would be a promising approach to reduce/suppress tissue response, one of the major obstacles for successful chronic implantation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The proposed neural probes are expected to make a significant impact on treatment of many neural disorders such as paralysis, refractory epilepsy, Parkinson?s disease, Alzheimer?s disease, blindness, deafness, and tinnitus. These probes will also help us to better understand the operation of the brain, as a result of the 3D spatial resolution and multi-modal stimulating/sensing capability. The new methods and findings will be incorporated into a Micro/Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems course developed by Prof. Xu. A unique component of the education plan is the training of an MD/Ph.D student. This team is committed to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, evidenced by the PI?s active role in the Research Apprentice Program for Minority Students in Detroit Public Schools.</AbstractNarration>
