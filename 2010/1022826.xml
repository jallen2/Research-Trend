    <AbstractNarration>Computer Engineering (32)&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California Santa Barbara is expanding a CCLI Type I project that successfully demonstrated the integration of interactive dialogue technology with computer-based instruction in first-year undergraduate and middle school outreach environments. Results from the Type I project also showed that the benefits of this technology can be enhanced if students work in on-line environments that provide context-sensitive structuring to support collaboration. This project is creating intelligent agent-monitored, internet chat-based modules for integrating mathematics and engineering in undergraduate engineering curricula. The project is also building on prior NSF funded work at Wright State University that demonstrated that learning mathematics in the context of engineering applications leads to increased student achievement in both subjects in subsequent courses. The project is implementing modules in the intelligent agent-based system covering the mathematics of differentiation, integration, and differential equations in engineering contexts. An independent evaluator is conducting a rigorous evaluation of the modules and their impact on specific student learning outcomes. The modules are being made available for free download via the project's website and the study results disseminated through conference and journal publications. The modules are also being used in an outreach effort to middle school students in an effort to increase their interest in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
