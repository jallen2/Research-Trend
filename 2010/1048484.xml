    <AbstractNarration>Project Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This workshop on Cognitive Bias and Forensic Science brings together about two dozen leading psychologists, forensic scientists and others to explore the ways in which psychological factors may affect the conclusions that forensic scientists reach. It will be held on Sept. 23-24, 2010 at the Searle Center at Northwestern Law School in Chicago, IL. The workshop will begin with a series of background presentations. These presentations will explore the methods used in the forensic sciences, the roles that various psychological factors may play in forensic pattern recognition, and review portions of a recent National Academy of Sciences report on the current state of the forensic sciences. In the afternoon of the first workshop day, participants will break into small groups to discuss ways in which judgmental bias may affect what forensic scientists see, the actions that they take, and their final judgments about who or what is the source of evidentiary items recovered from an investigation. The sources of bias discussed will include such diverse sources as the nature of a forensic task, the environment in which the forensic judgment is made, pre-existing expectations of the forensic scientist, emotional biases, and biased decision-making strategies (e.g., looking for evidence to confirm an idea rather than looking for evidence to disconfirm it). Groups will be encouraged to convert general theories and testable hypotheses into concrete research proposals that advance our understanding of social and cognitive effects on judgment and decision making with an eye toward using that new understanding to identify potential areas for reform in the forensic sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the second day of the workshop, each group will present their ideas to the complete set of workshop participants. Time will be left for discussion to refine those ideas. The workshop will end with a session designed to pull together workshop contributions and to identify a concrete agenda for further research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this workshop include the possibility of developing theories and empirical projects that advance our understanding of bias and error in human forensic judgment. Current evidence suggests that cognitive and contextual factors do affect forensic judgment, but such research is in its infancy. By bringing together a diverse group of participants, this workshop will encourage a process of cross-fertilization wherein the forensic researchers think about new ways to employ behavioral theories and findings in their future work, and the psychologists think about using the forensic sciences as a platform for their social and cognitive research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the workshop also stems from the synergy that will result from bringing together personnel in disciplines that have much in common but ordinarily have little to do with one another. If this workshop leads to improvements in the training of forensic scientists and the output of their analyses, the criminal justice system will benefit from the corresponding increase the accuracy of forensic science testimony and evidence presented at trial. Similarly, the forensic sciences may reap benefits by becoming more intertwined with mainstream science and scientific institutions.</AbstractNarration>
