    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the work of Professor Jerry L. Atwood in the area of nanocapsule design and synthesis. The objectives of this research include: (1) the synthesis of new capsules seamed by metal-ion coordination; (2) transport across capsule walls; (3) the synthesis of very large nanocapsules and (4) tube assemblies seamed by metal-ion coordination. The increased understanding of the self-assembly process involved in the nanocapsule assembly will have ramifications in other areas of metal-ion induced self-assembly. In addition, the development of capsules over a range of sizes will provide new containers for carrying out chemical reactions in constrained environments. The extension of the research from capsules to tubes involves a logical development of the self-assembly process which terminates with the formation of a capsule to that which extends essentially infinitely in one dimension. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing new fundamental knowledge, this research on nanocapsules presents opportunities for practical applications such as targeted drug delivery and catalysis. Furthermore, this research contributes to the development of human resources in sciences. The undergraduate students, the graduate students, and the postdoctoral fellows involved in this program will be trained to carry the research forward with the understanding that such basic research is goal oriented.</AbstractNarration>
