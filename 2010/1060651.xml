    <AbstractNarration>In the Scholarships for Science and Technology Careers project, Milwaukee Area Technical College (MATC) is providing scholarships to students in three cohorts of approximately 12 students each. Scholarship recipients are academically-talented, economically disadvantaged students enrolled in MATC's Chemical Technology, Civil Engineering Technology, Electronics Technology, Mechanical Design Technology, Information Technology (IT) Network Specialist, and IT Programming/Analyst Associate in Science Degree programs. Within the Electronics Technology program, students can graduate with an AAS specialty of Computer Electronics Technology, Biomedical Electronics Technology, and Electronic Engineering Technology. Students in these programs are targeted due to consistent demand for graduates, growth in local industries, and the needs identified by local economic development initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A college-wide, interdisciplinary team of qualified faculty and staff - all experienced in mentoring, advising, financial aid, and assessment - is administering the project, which has the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt; - To increase the number of academically talented, economically disadvantaged freshmen entering STEM Associate Degree programs;&lt;br/&gt; - To attract underrepresented women and minorities into STEM careers;&lt;br/&gt; - To provide financial support and reduce the need for outside employment;&lt;br/&gt; - To deliver academic and individualized support and enrichment experiences designed to increase program retention/completion;&lt;br/&gt; - To prepare students for transition into careers or baccalaureate degrees; and &lt;br/&gt; - To enhance recruitment of students into another major program on campus entitled "Biochemical Excellence in Science and Technology (BEST)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship recipients have access to all MATC support structures as well as additional innovations in services designed to further their success. For example, pre-testing for at-risk factors, assessments and case management enables early interventions. Moreover, a core curriculum is being re-sequenced and technical skills social groupings are employed to develop cohorts among the interdisciplinary, urban commuter students. Participants all have opportunities to help plan and attend scientific conferences and professional meetings. Internships are available to give participants real-life experiences, and business mentors are helping the scholarship recipients transition into careers or baccalaureate programs.</AbstractNarration>
