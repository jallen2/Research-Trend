    <AbstractNarration>Future networks will be heterogeneous and they will need to be scalable, highly controllable, and secure. These future heterogeneous networks will have multiple modalities (wired, wireless, satellite) and range from low (100?s of b/s) to ultra-high user data rates (over 100 Gb/s). Major challenges facing the deployment of such networks include; the coordination of the widely different data rates offered by different subnets to the users, efficient support of heterogeneous voice, video and data services with several orders spread in transaction sizes and rates, and the development of a common set of protocols that works across disparate networks with very different physical layer attributes. This workshop brings together investigators to discuss the research and development activities needed to enable the end-to-end, scalable, highly controllable, secure heterogeneous networks of the future. This activity is of interest to the Large Scale Networking Coordinating Group (LSN) of the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) interagency community.</AbstractNarration>
