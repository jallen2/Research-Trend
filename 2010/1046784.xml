    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop ?BunkerGreen?, a drop-in replacement fuel blend for use in medium and low speed marine diesel engines.~ The pending 200-mile EPA Emissions Control Area off U.S./Canada coastlines will require vessels transiting or operating within the area to burn fuels producing less than equivalent 0.1% sulfur fuel emissions. Presently, a potentially hazardous fuel switch from heavy fuel oil to less engine compatible low sulfur diesel fuel is required to achieve EPA requirements.~ ?BunkerGreen? will address fuel switching concerns by enhancing safe operation at sea through increased engine compatibility of low sulfur diesel fuel, using a proprietary blend formulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research will allow vessels to meet the new U.S./Canada emissions requirements without the dangers of switching to a less engine-compatible low sulfur fuel, and to do so with minimal upgrade costs as compared to stack-scrubbing or other mechanical solutions.~ This initially represents approximately 575 million gallons annually. Other potential markets include current bunker fuel users in heavy transportation, commercial power, and manufacturing market sectors, with an estimated volume of 4.5 billion gallons used annually. These represent a combined market value of nearly $87.5 billion according to the Energy Information Administration.</AbstractNarration>
