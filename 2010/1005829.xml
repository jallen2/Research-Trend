    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1005829&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Alan D. Weinstein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports travel to Brazil for US participants&lt;br/&gt;(primarily graduate students and postdocs) at the conference&lt;br/&gt;"Poisson 2010," to be held in IMPA in Rio de Janeiro, July 26-30,&lt;br/&gt;preceded by a preparatory school of three days in length. With&lt;br/&gt;roots in classical mechanics about 200 years ago and work of&lt;br/&gt;Sophus Lie about a century ago, the subject of Poisson geometry&lt;br/&gt;crystallized through work of Lichnerowicz and Kirillov in the&lt;br/&gt;1970's. Its influence now extends to a wide variety of areas,&lt;br/&gt;including symplectic geometry and topology, deformation theory,&lt;br/&gt;representation theory, algebraic geometry, integrable hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;systems, and field theory. In recent years, Poisson geometry has&lt;br/&gt;found new applications in string topology, the geometric&lt;br/&gt;Langlands program, and the geometry of complex surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;Developments in these and other timely subjets will be addressed&lt;br/&gt;in the school and conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting, whose full title is "Poisson Geometry in Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and Physics," is the seventh in a biannual series which brings&lt;br/&gt;together mathematicians and mathematical physicists with common&lt;br/&gt;interests in Poisson geometry and its applications. This&lt;br/&gt;geometry provides a very important bridge between mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;physics and between classical and quantum physics. Speakers at&lt;br/&gt;the school and conference have been chosen not only for the&lt;br/&gt;importance of their results but also for their ability to&lt;br/&gt;communicate them to a broad audience of mathematicians and&lt;br/&gt;physicists. Proceedings will be published in a manner which&lt;br/&gt;makes them accessible at low (or no) cost to a wide readership,&lt;br/&gt;in order to stimulate further study and research in the rapidly&lt;br/&gt;growing area of Poisson geometry. Detailed information about the&lt;br/&gt;conference, and about others in the biannual series, may be found&lt;br/&gt;at poissongeometry.org.</AbstractNarration>
