    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Don L. Warner at Boise State University for the summers of 2010-2012. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. The research projects focus on research in areas that span areas of chemistry and biology. Sample projects include: (1) a study of the ways in which the coordinating metal alters the functionality of the peptide deformylase enzyme; (2) the study of the DNA-binding properties of synthetic aziridinomitosenes; (3) the study of the substrate and inhibitor recognition by human carbonyl reductase; (4) the study of quorum sensing in mutants of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus; (5) the colorimetric detection of DNA with oligonucleotide-functionalized colloidal gold nanoparticles; (6) the calculation of the structure and binding of conotoxin ligands with the acetylcholine-binding protein of A. californica; and (7) the study of the binding of actinides with dithiophosphonic acid ligands. Besides being exposed to compelling research, the students participating in this program will participate in site visits, social activities, and professional development activities -- including sessions on peer mentoring (for returning students) and ethics in scientific research. The site will recruit from first year students from regional 2-year and 4-year colleges with little research infrastructure. Many of the targeted students are first-generation college students and members of other groups underrepresented in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training to a significant number of students who might not have this opportunity at their home institution. The interdisciplinary projects that the students will work on while at Boise State University, are excellent examples of the kinds of cross-disciplinary work that is becoming more and more typical of the most fruitful avenues for modern laboratory research. Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
