    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: EPS-1004057 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Infrastructure to Advance Life Sciences in the Ocean State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rhode Island Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) program focuses on cutting edge research to understand how marine biological organisms are affected by variations in their surroundings due to climate change effects. The goals of the project are to advance Rhode Island's competitiveness in marine life science, foster collaboration among researchers and educators in the state, and build diverse, well-trained workforce teams involving nine institutions of higher education across the state. This project is regionally relevant, nationally significant, takes advantage of unique Rhode Island resources including the Narragansett Bay, and aligns well with the state Science and Technology plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;A number of studies predict that with ocean warming and acidification, many single and multiple cell organisms will be under stress whereas many pathogenic microbes and parasites will thrive. The resilience of marine organisms to climate change will depend crucially on acclimation and adaptation. The Rhode Island RII program is aimed at understanding, predicting, and mitigating the impacts of environmental stresses on marine organisms and ecosystems. These studies are fundamentally important to the global biosphere (and locally to Narragansett Bay) as nutrient cycles and sustained biological production in the ocean, ultimately determine the availability of seafood. The investigations focus on key individual organisms (e.g., fish, plankton, marine pathogens), food webs, and the spread of infection and disease among marine host populations. The studies will explore how these species are affected by changes in chemical and physical parameters in the ocean such as temperature, acidity, and nutrient availability. Through these activities, the researchers at Rhode Island will be well positioned to make significant intellectual contribution to the assessment of climate change effects on marine organisms and ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The infrastructure improvements for life sciences research and education and the partnership among public and private institutions of higher education including two- and four-year colleges will assist in building Rhode Island's research capacity. The Rhode Island EPSCoR Academy will coordinate efforts to foster collaboration among diverse institutions, broaden participation to increase diversity, and engage students at all levels in research and educational training. Fellowships for students and programs aimed at increasing the participation of under-represented minority groups are included in this RII project. A unique aspect of this project is the involvement of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) for interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists and RISD artists and designers. This interaction is expected to enable the development of improved tools and strategies for the visualization and communication of complex scientific information to K-12 students and non-traditional audiences. In addition, collaborations with the University of Rhode Island's Metcalf Institute will enhance science communication by strengthening interaction among scientists, students, and journalists.</AbstractNarration>
