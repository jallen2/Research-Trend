    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID proposal brings together a collaboration among Universities in states affected by the Deepwater Horizon (DH) oil release. With the millions of gallons of oil released, the use of dispersants and the likelihood of movement of the subsurface oil "bloom" into bays and estuaries, an unprecedented anthropogenic impact on human and natural populations may result. This study will define the physiological and evolutionary impact of the DH oil release using the fish Fundulus grandis, a natural inhabitant of estuaries along the Gulf of Mexico. By applying cutting edge technologies, the genetic effects of man's impact on this environment will be described and, thus, provide the baseline data to document the effect of oil pollution on genetic diversity and effectiveness of remediation in limiting negative biodiversity consequences of the spill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These data will inform society about the short and long-term impacts of the DH oil spill, which has not been possible prior to the recent innovation in genomic techniques. The application of genomic technology provides insights into the genes affected by DH oil and whether cleanup efforts effectively minimize loss of genetic diversity. Thus, this research should provide the evidence of the effectiveness of BP cleanup efforts. Additionally, by measuring the impact of DH oil on fish genomics, additional information will be gathered regarding the genes that matter for human health. Simply put, by measuring the genes in fish that survive exposure to DH oil, genes that may also be important for human health will be identified.</AbstractNarration>
