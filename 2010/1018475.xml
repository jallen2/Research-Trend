    <AbstractNarration>Numerous organizations including government agencies are sitting on &lt;br/&gt;mountains of spreadsheet data that are becoming increasingly common on &lt;br/&gt;the web, but whose contents remain out of reach via search engines &lt;br/&gt;because direct links to the contents of their constituent cells are&lt;br/&gt;rare. Thus spreadsheet data represent legacy databases, especially&lt;br/&gt;since many of their underlying schemas are no longer accessible. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this research is to discover the schema according to which the &lt;br/&gt;spreadsheet is constructed. The focus is on the spatio-textual&lt;br/&gt;spreadsheet which is a spreadsheet where the values of the spatial&lt;br/&gt;attributes are specified textually. Such spreadsheets support spatial&lt;br/&gt;searches whose output is visual and whose utility is enhanced by being&lt;br/&gt;able to handle spatial synonyms. This is done, in part, by devising&lt;br/&gt;methods to automatically discover the spatial attributes of the&lt;br/&gt;spreadsheet as well as how to distinguish between several instances of&lt;br/&gt;them which arise due to the presence of a containment hierarchy. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, use is made of spatial coherence which is manifested by&lt;br/&gt;observing that spatial data in the same column are usually of the same&lt;br/&gt;spatial type, while spatial data in the same spreadsheet row usually&lt;br/&gt;exhibit a containment relationship. Moreover, adjacent or nearby rows&lt;br/&gt;exhibit spreadsheet coherence in that they are usually similar. The&lt;br/&gt;broad impact of this research is to make spreadsheet data a first&lt;br/&gt;class citizen on the web with the same chances of being discovered and&lt;br/&gt;accessed as data found in other documents. Reports describing&lt;br/&gt;results of this and related research will be available at&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hjs/spreadsheets.html</AbstractNarration>
