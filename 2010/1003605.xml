    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary: The Department of Political Science at the University of North Texas (UNT) runs this unique REU Site program to provide undergraduate students (recruited from across the country, but with special emphasis on underrepresented students in Texas and Oklahoma) the opportunity to engage in graduate-level research in conflict management and peace studies. This is a senior faculty mentored, in-residence, summer research experience that integrates training in civil conflict management with training in computer simulation skills. Participants use computer simulation software to develop theoretical propositions (via exercises in counter-factual research) that are later tested empirically. Participants collect and analyze empirical data and report their findings in a public forum. Activities include workshops on computer simulations, research methodology, and the graduate school application process. There are also activities designed to build a sense of research community among students, faculty and graduate student mentors. At this stage, this is a one-year Pilot phase of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The program explores the causes of civil conflict occurrence (or recurrence) and investigates possible institutional configurations and other types of actions that may assist in ameliorating civil conflict. In particular, the project trains students in counter-factual reasoning, which promotes innovative thinking and problem solving skills. Developing empirical skills to test the theoretical propositions derived from the use of computer simulations also hones the scientific and analytical skills of the student participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Given the growing frequency of civil conflicts in the world, and the security concerns these conflicts engender for the United States in the 21st century, the development of human capital that is equipped to deal with these challenges is critical for the national security of the country. In particular, training in conflict management that includes populations historically underrepresented in higher education (but which are growing as a proportion of the undergraduate student population) is a national imperative. This program addresses the need to develop further expertise in conflict management by providing opportunities to engage in advanced empirical research to students from such populations, students who would not otherwise have such opportunities. The University of North Texas is well positioned, both institutionally and geographically, to provide this access. To that end, this REU site has secured formal commitments from Hispanic and Native American Serving Institutions and from Historically Black Colleges/ Universities (HBCU) in Texas and Oklahoma to assist in broadening the pool of applicants to the program. However, the program solicits applications from across the country as well, and creates balanced cohorts of undergraduate participants.</AbstractNarration>
