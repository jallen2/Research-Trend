    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will confirm the feasibility of developing flexible packaging that does not leach chemicals having estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity (EA), while maintaining all the fit-for-use properties of conventional flexible plastic packaging having EA. Hundreds of studies have shown that exogenous chemicals having EA can cause many adverse health effects (including reproductive dysfunctions, learning disabilities, birth defects, and increased rates of cancers). PlastiPure's data show that nearly all plastic products leach chemicals having easily detectable EA at concentrations having known adverse health effects. PlastiPure is developing proprietary materials and processes to fabricate EA-free flexible films and bags that are cost- and performance-competitive with conventional packaging having EA. This project is innovative because no other firm has shown that it is feasible to develop the polymer-based materials and processes needed to produce EA-free flexible films and bags for use in medical, food, and beverage packaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research is the widespread commercialization of EA-free flexible film products. In the past few years, a rapid market switch from PC containing BPA-based plastics to BPA-free plastic products has shown that consumers apply market pressure to ensure that safer products are commercially available. Almost all BPA-free plastic products on the market today leach many chemicals having easily detectable EA, often at levels higher than the original BPA-based product. The funding of this NSF SBIR grant will help facilitate a comprehensive reduction of risks to public health and reduced environmental impact from chemicals having EA.</AbstractNarration>
