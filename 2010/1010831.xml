    <AbstractNarration>The Museum of Science, Boston, (MOS) is conducting a multi-phase project that builds on the groundwork laid by the 2009 report of the NSF/ISE-funded Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education (CAISE) Inquiry Group on the "public engagement with science" model (PES) in informal science education. In comparison to the Public Understanding of Science model (PUOS), where the emphasis is on a one-way transmission or translation of knowledge from experts to the public (often via the mediation of professionals in informal science education), the PES model calls for activities, events, or interactions that are characterized by mutual learning among people of varied backgrounds, scientific expertise, and life experiences, where perspectives, ideas, knowledge and values are articulated and discussed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-year project will explore the possibility of new large-scale collaborative public engagement activities, find topics and approaches that are of broad interest with the ISE community, identify potential partners and advisors, and develop future project plans and proposals. In its multi-phase process, MOS will first collect, analyze and publish case-study information about current PES activities using a "dimensions of PES" analytical tool to identify clusters of PES and PUOS activities across a broad spectrum of projects. After the data collection and analysis stage, a workshop of national and international professionals will be convened to explore the implications and identify future directions for the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce and disseminate three reports: A summary of findings from the case study phase; a report of the findings of the workshop; and a summary of findings of the evaluation of the project and the impact on project participants.</AbstractNarration>
