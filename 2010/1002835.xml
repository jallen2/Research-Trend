    <AbstractNarration>This project examines how artistic processes and forms of communication contribute to scientific and design problem-solving. By bringing together scientists, engineers and artists for a pilot study of interdisciplinary collaboration at Purdue University, the PIs aim to convey the significance of this new nature [next generation knowledge] in images and tangible artifacts, data visualization, engineered design prototypes, generative and kinetic installations for the public. The resulting case study and empirical evaluation of the social and collaborative process across disciplines will be an important step towards the successful development of a Center for Creative Collaboration (CCC) at Purdue University. The PIs envision the Center for Creative Collaboration as a variable network connecting science, engineering and the arts on Purdue's West Lafayette campus to enrich STEM education and provide a local model for STE(A)M (STEM disciplines plus Art) which emphasizes creativity and innovation; critical thinking and problem-solving; flexibility and adaptability; communication and collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research in engineering, computer science and bioscience is revolutionizing our understanding of nature from the nano to the global. Rapidly changing knowledge about the natural environment in relationship to the 'new natures' presents new challenges for the development of strategies in computer science and engineering and in turn influence new generations of computational and engineering methods, technologies and materials. At the same time, contemporary artistic interventions are creating a critical public dialog about social, cultural and aesthetic affordances and implications of these 'new natures'. The proposed interdisciplinary educational framework for this project combines art, science and engineering strategies in the exploration of the natural environment and the 'new natures' in three interrelated project components: (1) a course titled "Images of Nature" that will bring together students from a range of disciplines at Purdue University, combining STEM disciplines with the Arts and Design; (2) a public exhibition of the devices, sculptures, computer graphics applications; photographs, etc. resulting from the course in an empty storefront in Downtown Lafayette, IN - the community surrounding Purdue University and; (3) a summer program exploring the theme of "Images of Nature" for Indiana area high school juniors from communities currently underrepresented at Purdue. By developing interdisciplinary approaches to image production guided by metaphorical thinking and polysensorial (i.e. engaging more than the sense of sight) technology, the experimental course and summer program will contribute to solving two larger problems: 1) scientists communicating their knowledge to the public and; 2) creating opportunities for artists to interpret contemporary understandings of nature created by new explorations in science and technology. These project goals will educate a new generation of scientist and artists who learn the benefits of cross-disciplinary inquiry.</AbstractNarration>
