    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use state-of-the-art assays to detect estrogenic activity (EA) and anti-EA in antioxidants (AOs). Chemicals like AOs that have EA or Anti-EA (EA**) produce adverse health effects, including reproductive and behavioral disorders and some cancers. AOs have not been examined for EA**, much less AO packages reformulated to have specific levels of EA for specific commercial applications. This project will assess the EA** of 10 additional organic AOs, and 15 EA-**Free/EA**-specified formulations made from combinations of conventional, organic, water-soluble, and oil-soluble AOs that are stable when exposed to common-use stresses. These AO formulations will be used by identified partners to produce animal feeds, cereals and other foodstuffs that are EA**-free or have well-specified levels of EA** providing a clear path to commercialization and additional patents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that fetal or juvenile mammals, including humans, are especially sensitive to chemicals having EA** at very low dosages and should not indiscriminately ingest such chemicals. Conversely, other conditions (e.g., menopausal symptoms, some cancers or abnormalities of the prostate) are ameliorated by chemicals having controlled levels of EA**. Hence, this project will minimize the risks of unintentional consumption of chemicals having EA** by using EA**-free AOs in products such as cereals and baby formulas or specified-EA** AOs in products such as fitness drinks and dietary supplements for post-menopausal women.</AbstractNarration>
