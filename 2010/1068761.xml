    <AbstractNarration>This theoretical research program, to be performed by a collaboration among Dr. Mark Edwards of Georgia Southern University and researchers at the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI), an institute run jointly by the University of Maryland and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will be devoted to the exploration of new ultra-cold atom interferometer designs, inspired by techniques developed in Quantum Information Science, for the avoidance, minimization, and correction of decoherence in quantum computers. These new designs will be targeted toward improving the sensitivity, stability, and robustness of ultra-cold atom interferometers. Applications of such interferometers include enhanced navigation sensing, precision metrology, and quantum information processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will enable two talented Georgia Southern University undergraduate physics majors to gain cutting-edge research experience in the area of ultra-cold atom theory, thus advancing discovery while promoting learning. A Virtual Research Group will be established in which Georgia Southern students will attend the weekly Quantum Information/Bose-Einstein meetings at NIST via the internet. The project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by maintaining an established collaboration among an undergraduate institution (GA Southern), a national laboratory (NIST), and a major research university (University of Maryland). Broad dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding will be accomplished by bringing distinguished scientists to the Georgia Southern University campus to present colloquia and to hold face-to-face research meetings. Finally, development of new interferometric methods for precision sensing using ultracold-atom systems can provide the foundation for a new generation of practical devices that will find applications in navigation, metrology, geodesy, and studies of the fundamental properties of matter.</AbstractNarration>
