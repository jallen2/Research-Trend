    <AbstractNarration>Climate change projected for northeastern North America in the 21st century is likely to influence the distribution and abundance of migratory songbirds by altering the amount and quality of habitat available to them. Long-term studies of Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) have revealed that climate strongly influences habitat quality in this species. The focus of the present proposal is on how a changing climate will affect the key choices that birds make: where to breed (territory selection), whether to return to a territory in a subsequent year (site fidelity), and how to allocate limited resources into mating and parental care (reproductive effort).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term research proposed complements multiple other studies within the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study that focus on ecosystem responses to environmental change. This research will provide numerous opportunities for undergraduate training and education of the general public through lectures, educational materials, international partnerships (e.g., the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center's Bridging the Americas program) and web-based information. Results will be of critical interest to policy makers and decision makers because of their multiple connections to biodiversity, the health of public lands and the broader interest of the public in birds, especially migratory songbirds.</AbstractNarration>
