    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research program is to explore and understand the microscopic origin of high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity in iron and copper based superconductors using neutron scattering as a primary tool. Specially, the project will focus on electron-doped iron and copper based high-Tc superconductors. We will investigate the nature of the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. Neutron scattering experiments, the core part of this research program, will be performed mostly at the high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) and Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). However, the project will also utilize other world-class facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities are unavailable at HFIR and SNS. The impact of this research program will include the training of the next generation of neutron scatters and elucidating the nature of the exotic properties of these high-Tc superconductors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF project addresses the fundamental physical processes that give rise to novel collective phenomena such as high-transition temperature superconductivity. The materials known to exhibit these collective phenomena are the strongly correlated electron materials. The understanding of these phenomena will not only enhance our knowledge of basic science, but also gives us the ability to design materials with novel and predictable properties. Specifically, the experimental program integrates neutron scattering experiments with lab based materials efforts, aimed at the fundamental understanding of the spin and lattice excitations in electron-doped high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors based on iron and copper. The objective of the program is to explore and understand the microscopic origins of various phases of iron and copper high-Tc superconductors using neutron as a probe. Neutron scattering experiments will be performed mostly at the high-flux isotope reactor (HFIR) and Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. However, the project will also utilize other world-class facilities in the U.S. and Europe when similar capabilities are unavailable at HFIR and SNS. The impact of this research program will include the training of the next generation of neutron scatters and elucidating the nature of the exotic properties of the correlated electron materials.</AbstractNarration>
