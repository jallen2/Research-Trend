    <AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Gong Chen of the Pennsylvania State University. Professor Chen will develop directed palladium-catalyzed functionalization of chemically inert sp3-hybridized carbon-hydrogen bonds. Common functionalities such as carboxylic acids, alkynes, arenes and alkenes are to be leveraged in the directing chemistry, such that C-H activation occurs proximal to the groups. Furthermore, stereoselective functionalization will be explored through either substrate control, chiral auxiliaries or chiral carboxylic acid ligands. While these methodologies can be widely applied toward structural diversification for medicinal chemistry research, Professor Chen seeks to demonstrate their synthetic utility in the context of complex natural product synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach efforts to promote teaching, training and learning, and to help broaden the participation of underrepresented groups are being pursued through a set of integrated summer activities, including: A) research projects for K-12 science teachers related to the primary research goals of this program; B) summer research curricula for high school students from underserved minority populations and C) a research and education collaboration with minority college faculty with limited research resources. The interdisciplinary nature of the Chen research program will provide these researchers with a broad-based exposure to science in a research laboratory setting.</AbstractNarration>
