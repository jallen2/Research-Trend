    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1066994&lt;br/&gt;Van Tassel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many problems in the chemical, materials, and biomedical sciences and engineering involve adsorption of large molecules at the solid-liquid interface. Optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) is a premier technique allowing for the real-time detection of macromolecular adsorption at the solid liquid interface. The PIs group has used the OWLS technique extensively to build a research program focusing on bio-interfacial engineering. However, of the two original OWLS instruments, one no longer functions and the other suffers severely from an antiquated computer interface system. MicroVacuum, the commercial manufacturer of OWLS technology, has offered the PI a completely new instrument with a heavy discount making it economically as well as scientifically advantageous to purchase a new instrument rather than repair/ upgrade either of the old instruments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides the funds to acquire a new OWLS 210 system from MicroVacuum. The new instrument will be used i) to complete the current NSF funded project Carbon nanotubes as antimicrobial agents (CBET-0756323), ii) to begin work on four new projects, iii) as the primary experimental tool for undergraduate researchers in the PI's lab, and iv) as a teaching tool in the Yale Undergraduate Chemical Engineering Laboratory course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new OWLS instrument in the PI's lab will have a broad impact in several ways. Scientific impact will come from the currently funded project and four new projects. In particular, new nanoscale polyelectrolyte films will emerge that will impact areas such as separations, energy storage/delivery, cell-based diagnostics, and tissue engineering. OWLS has proven to be a straightforward technique for undergraduate researchers; their involvement in these new projects will bring forth a large educational impact. Finally, use of the new instrument is proposed for an experiment in adsorption kinetics in Yale's Undergraduate Chemical Engineering Laboratory beginning in Spring 2011.</AbstractNarration>
