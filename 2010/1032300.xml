    <AbstractNarration>1032300 &lt;br/&gt;Batarseh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a cooperative workshop organized by the Dr. Issa Batarseh, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, Dr. Ned Mohan, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota and Dr. Dr. Lana El Chaar, Electrical Engineering Department at the Petroleum Institute (PI) in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates in December 2011. The objective of the three-day workshop is to discuss educational and research in power electronics as applied to energy research and development. The workshop will focus on various energy research requirements in different Electrical Engineering (EE) departments while identifying new topics that should be integrated to support the major developments in the energy sector, especially renewable sources, energy efficiency and conversion. The participants will include experts from both academia and industry and students. The workshop will address the implementation of both hardware and software laboratories supporting energy research to improve the practical aspects to enhance the research process and to induce critical thinking for better energy solutions. In addition, recent research and development issues in the energy sector will be presented while exploring possible international collaboration. Recommendations from industrial and academic representatives will be developed. The published workshop proceedings will be available on the world wide web of the PI?s institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: There is a need to have a dialogue on energy education and research activities between experts in the Gulf region and the Middle East countries (M.E.) and US experts. The M.E. is a major source of hydrocarbons but also is rapidly increasing its investment in renewable energy. The recently-established International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is stationed in Abu Dhabi. The US and M.E. participants will explore possible joint research collaboration with the objective of accelerating practical developments of alternative sources of energy as well as energy conservation techniques. The participation by academics from both sides who can impact engineering curricula will help meet the increasing demands of globalization in the engineering profession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The workshop is to develop a better understanding of the research needs and changes when it comes to investigating energy systems from different prospective. New research materials and laboratory experiments will be outlined and distributed to universities in the U.S. and in Middle East. The workshop will pay attention to ways to promote the ever increasing need for engineers focusing on energy, especially renewable sources, energy efficiency and conversion. Ideas for recruiting, retaining, and mentoring undergraduate students, graduate students and young faculty in these areas will be discussed and developed. It is expected that 5 U.S. graduate and undergraduate students will participate.</AbstractNarration>
