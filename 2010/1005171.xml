    <AbstractNarration>This award supports travel of U.S. postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty participating in the meeting "Emerging Topics in Dynamical Systems and Partial Differential Equations," held in Barcelona, Spain from May 31 through June 4 of 2010. The meeting is organized jointly by the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics Activity Groups on Analysis of Partial Differential Equations and on Dynamical Systems, the Real Sociedad Matemática Espanola, the Societat Catalana de Matemàtiques, and the Sociedad Espanola de Matematica Aplicada. The meeting features plenary talks by distinguished speakers, presentations contributed by junior participants, and lectures for a general audience. The conference includes a panel discussion on new directions and open problems in the fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference brings together a globally diverse group of participants and facilitates interaction between U.S. researchers and their Catalan and Spanish counterparts, with the goal of catalyzing new research collaborations. The conference includes time devoted to discussion of global diversity issues and sharing of experiences on how to improve participation of minority groups in professional mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://www.siam.org/meetings/dspdes/index.php</AbstractNarration>
