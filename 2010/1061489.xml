    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 10-61489&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Papanikolopoulos, Nikolaos;Hondzo, Miki; Morellas, Vassilios; Anaraki, Siavash Pourmakamali; Voyles, Richard M.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Minnesota &lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI RAPID: Collaborative Research: Swarms of Robotic Aquapods to Assess Impact of Oil Spills on Marshlands&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;The project, testing the adequateness of underwater robots to swiftly and repeatedly sample large areas of Golf Oil Spill, aims to determine the spatial heterogeneity of the impacts on the shoreline, revealing "hot spots." These are areas of high oil concentration that constitute a challenge since hot-spots move due to shoreline morphology, wind patterns, and water circulation. To this end, small robots called "Aquapods" will be deployed. Aquapods are miniature robots with a high mobility-to-size ratio. As a form of locomotion, they are based on tumbling which allows them to locomote on the water, under the water, and on sandy and marshy shoreline. A recent version of the Aquapod (developed as part of the IUCRC on Safety, Security, and Rescue) can be completely submerged in water to operate on a lake or stream floor. Additionally, this robot is equipped with a buoyancy control unit that allows the robot to either sink or float in water, thus offering many unique applications in both environmental monitoring and surveillance. The work develops a more advanced system than the first generation radio controlled design, incorporating functionalities more appropriate to monitor oil spill effects.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;As the proposed research can drastically improve oil spill cleanup efforts, the potential broader impacts are large. The project exhibits the ability to assess the environmental impact on areas not easily accessible by humans. The PIs have a solid plan to involve middle-schoolers from underrepresented groups in the proposed project. Moreover, the developed instrument will be free for use to the interested groups of scientists. Planned are solid dissemination and education efforts both at the University of Minnesota and the University of Denver.</AbstractNarration>
