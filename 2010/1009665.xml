    <AbstractNarration>Scientific interest in birdsong, particularly in the phenomenon of locally shared vocalizations (dialects), has been intense for many decades. Oddly, this interest has focused almost exclusively on a very restricted set of species: temperate, socially monogamous songbirds. This project experimentally tests four hypotheses explaining the maintenance of microgeographic dialects in a tropical hummingbird, the little hermit. Hummingbird songs, though comparatively less well studied, have long been known to show dialectal variation, and offer an unparalleled opportunity to investigate questions about the evolution of vocal variation in a study system that represents a contrast to the traditional songbird model. A combination of molecular genetic analyses, field playback experiments, and close behavioral observations will be employed to identify the selective pressures that maintain dialects. The proposed research, by investigating a widespread phenomenon (dialects) in a poorly studied taxon (hummingbirds) will help advance our knowledge about the processes leading to the formation of shared signals in general as well as to elucidate the factors that influence the spatial and social organization of individuals in social groups. This project will provide research experience for a number of assistants, creating an opportunity for mentoring and inspiring a new generation of scientists. In addition, the close proximity of the rural community of Brasso Seco to the field site in Trinidad enables a number of opportunities to engage the community in science and conservation: from lectures given at the local school to active participation of villagers in research activities such as nest searching and radio-tracking.</AbstractNarration>
