    <AbstractNarration>This project is designed to recruit 102 academically talented, financially needy students to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs at the college. By providing scholarships and a continuum of support services the project seeks to increase retention and assist graduates in transitioning to further education or employment at one of the private sector companies, military installations, and government agencies in the region. Targeted programs include Applied Sciences and Technology, Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Computer Information Systems, Computer Science, Engineering, Engineering Technology, Environmental Technology, Information Services Technology, Information Systems Security, and Mathematics and Physical Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project objectives include: &lt;br/&gt;(a) increasing enrollments by capitalizing on extensive K-16 STEM activity in the region;&lt;br/&gt;(b) increasing student retention through community building, weekly cohort contact, mentoring, tutoring, and enrichment experiences; &lt;br/&gt;(c) expanding and streamlining articulation to facilitate transfer to four-year institutions; and engaging employers in recruiting, mentoring, and &lt;br/&gt;(d) providing work-based enrichment experiences for students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is introducing a customized, one-credit College Success Skills course as the vehicle for shaping students from diverse STEM disciplines who attend programs on three different campuses into small learning communities. The approach uses lessons learned from improving retention and academic performance by student athletes. By bringing students together over four semesters, offering them shared enrichment experiences, and providing mentors from both academia and the employment communities, the initiative is demonstrating a replicable approach for increasing success within STEM populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is increasing the number of academically talented, financially needy students, many of whom are first-generation college-goers, who have the opportunity for advanced careers. In an institution where females comprise 63% of the student body, and nearly half the full-time science majors are minorities, significant numbers of participants are expected to be from groups typically underrepresented in STEM careers. Outcomes for varied student population groups are being tracked and disseminated via the project website, presentations, and/or scholarly articles.</AbstractNarration>
