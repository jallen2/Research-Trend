    <AbstractNarration>The Nile is the longest river in the world, and it splits into two tributaries, both of which drain to the Mediterranean. Around 2500 years ago during pharaonic times, there was a third channel of Nile called the Pelusiac River, running west to east. Over time, this channel of the river closed due to prograding beach accretion. Today, the ancient Pelusiac River area is covered by sand and silt layers that are several meters thick. This area is undergoing rapid growth and a random urbanization process. There is concern that rapid urban growth may destroy valuable undiscovered archaeological sites in this area. The main objective of this work is to carefully map the Pelusiac River and its natural and artificial branches and to locate signs of previously unidentified archaeological sites on its banks. It is also intended to understand the shallow subsurface geology and groundwater conditions. To achieve these goals, the PI will collaborate with Dr. Mohamed A. Rashed, of the Geology Department at Suez Canal University in Egypt to analyze remote sensing and DEM data in order to locate the exact track of the Pelusiac River and its branches. Then, target areas for further studies will be selected. The PIs will image the subsurface to search for buried channels, archeological sites and related features using geophysical surveys and conducting Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Very-Low Frequency (VLF) surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;This work can help in processing and interpretation of the radar data collected on other parts of the Earth and potentially on planetary surfaces such as Mars. Without a raw model, processing and interpretation of data can be extremely difficult, and a good portion of information can be lost due to bad processing parameters or interpretation artifacts. The geological, hydrogeological and climatic conditions of the study area make it a good candidate for an experimental GPR survey. Combining GPR results with the geologic information known from previous geological and geophysical studies is expected to yield a reliable interpretation, especially when integrated with the remote sensing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work builds on several years? of discussions between US and Egyptian scientists. This project will provide the opportunity to further this collaboration. Early career Egyptian scientists and graduate and undergraduate students will be trained at the University of Houston with support from the Egyptian side. For US graduate and undergraduate students, this project will provide opportunities for scientific and cultural exchange. Project results will be disseminated by publications and presentations at national and international meetings. Identifying the exact track of the Pelusiac River will help in mapping groundwater, which is very important for development in this desert area. Similarly, locating the signs of archaeological sites on the banks of the Pelusiac River will help in protection of any undocumented archaeological sites. Understanding the subsurface geology will help decision makers as future expansion in this area is planned and undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering's Africa, Near East, and South Asia program.</AbstractNarration>
