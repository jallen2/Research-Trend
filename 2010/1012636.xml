    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Chrys Wesdemiotis of the University of Akron and his group will develop new mass spectrometry techniques for the characterization of synthetic polymers. Tandem mass spectrometry studies involving collision-activated as well as electron-transfer dissociation will be performed on a variety of copolymers with the goal to elucidate the corresponding fragmentation pathways and evaluate the information they reveal about copolymer microstructure and sequence. A further goal is to create interfaced separation/mass spectrometry strategies for the analysis of multi-component polymer mixtures. Specifically, interactive liquid chromatography will be examined for the characterization of amphiphilic blends, and ion mobility mass spectrometry for the identification of polymer architectures, in particular the structures of supramolecular polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A major impetus for the planned studies is the need of precise and sensitive chemical analyses for the new macromolecular materials designed and produced for industrial, clinical, and biomedical use at the University of Akron and several corporations in Northeast Ohio. The methods developed in this project will help to engineer better, commercially viable materials for a wide variety of applications. In addition, the planned research will educate and train undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate researchers, including students from underrepresented groups, in materials research and mass spectrometry analysis, two areas of increasing employment opportunities both locally and nationally.</AbstractNarration>
