    <AbstractNarration>This award provides continuing support for a program of research for the High Energy Physics (HEP) group at the University of Chicago. The HEP group participates in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland, the CDF experiment at Fermilab, and the Double Chooz experiment at the Chooz Nuclear Power Station in northern France, as well as performing R&amp;D in accelerator physics and the development of photo-detectors with picosecond resolution. In the tradition of the group, participation in each experiment involves construction of major subsystems and electronics and leadership roles in the physics analysis and administration of the experiment. The ATLAS experiment is the major effort of the group. During the grant period the group will be heavily involved in physics analysis, initially of the standard model, but then on searches for new physics phenomena; also, the start of construction for the FasTraKer (FTK ) upgrade is expected to begin. The current suite of analysis topics was chosen to be appropriate to early operation of the experiment. In addition to testing the performance of the detector and its data analysis tools, they provide the potential for seeing new phenomena against the background of well understood physics. Physics analysis using CDF data will continue, albeit at a reduced level. In Double Chooz the group will install both outer veto (OV) systems in the far and near experiment halls, in France. After installation it will start commissioning the detectors. Simulation studies directed to the separation of candidate events from background will be carried out. Algorithms for neutrino detection events will be investigated as will algorithms to identify and reconstruct muons passing through the OV detector. Further effects will be studied as part of the program to produce a measured value or upper limit on theta-13. The broader impact reach of the group includes working with undergraduate and graduate students on research problems, mentoring of postdocs and graduate students, continued commitment to outreach by continuing its traditional participation in the Chicago Public Schools and the Illinois Math and Science Academy, the creation of two new outreach and educational programs for disadvantaged children from urban areas and extending technologies developed in its research to other fields.</AbstractNarration>
