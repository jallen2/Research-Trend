    <AbstractNarration>This award, made to the University of Iowa, is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE program and the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences. The University of Iowa will provide research training for 10 weeks for 8 students, for the summers of 2010-2012. The scientific focus of the research program is microbiology. The program encourages students to pursue a career in basic science and gives them the skills to succeed in that path. Each student will conduct an independent laboratory research project under the guidance of a faculty and a graduate student co-mentor. Lectures, workshops and social activities will expose students to graduate school and other career options, will include training in ethics and the responsible conduct of research, and will promote informal interactions. At the end of the summer, students will prepare a written report and present their findings at a University-wide symposium. Students will also be encouraged to present their results at regional or national meetings. The success of the program will be assessed by student tracking and an evaluation process that includes use of a common assessment tool. Students will receive a stipend and money for travel and living expenses. The program is open to undergraduates who have finished their sophomore or junior year of college, are interested in scientific research, and are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Recruitment will emphasize students from demographic groups that are underrepresented in the sciences and/or students from small colleges where opportunities for research are lacking.
