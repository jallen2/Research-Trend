    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop resources for STEM learning by &lt;br/&gt;redesigning and expanding the "Jonathan Bird's Blue World" website; adding &lt;br/&gt;components to enable teachers and students to search episodes for specific &lt;br/&gt;themes, locations, or scientific concepts; and enhancing the lesson plans to &lt;br/&gt;explicitly match the content standards for teaching science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major objectives is to make the "Jonathan Bird's Blue World" web &lt;br/&gt;site content more widely accessible as an open source via an internet &lt;br/&gt;connection with a dynamic search capability. The project adds a significant &lt;br/&gt;amount of educational material and uses ocean topics to illustrate nationally &lt;br/&gt;accepted standards for science learning. It is applicable to both formal and &lt;br/&gt;informal environments and contains a multi-faceted approach to achieve its &lt;br/&gt;goal including the following objectives: (a) build a web site search &lt;br/&gt;capability that includes National Science Educational Standards&lt;br/&gt;(NSES) and Ocean Literacy Principles with a link to segments illustrating &lt;br/&gt;specific NSES; (b) create webisodes that feature specific NSES and develop an &lt;br/&gt;interactive map on the web site; (c) create a user survey tool and outreach for &lt;br/&gt;these improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By partnering with researchers and educators to incorporate nationally &lt;br/&gt;accepted standards for science learning into the website redesign, the project &lt;br/&gt;has a broad impact on professional development for teachers. It has the &lt;br/&gt;potential to reach diverse audiences in schools, homes and afterschool &lt;br/&gt;programs. "Jonathan Bird's Blue World" is designed to complement other &lt;br/&gt;educational materials and provide a useful resource for teachers everywhere, &lt;br/&gt;improving public scientific literacy in informal and formal settings.</AbstractNarration>
