    <AbstractNarration>The Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) is a wide-field 4.2-m diameter optical-infrared telescope being constructed by Lowell Observatory and scheduled for first light in mid-2011. The $42M telescope was funded entirely through private donations - largely from Discovery Communications and its founders the Hendricks family - and is located on the dark and high-altitude site of Happy Jack Mountain, near Flagstaff, AZ. In addition to its planned use toward understanding the stellar content of galaxies, star formation in interstellar clouds, cometary dust and gas, and Kuiper belt objects, the DCT is in the remarkable position of being the focal point of an ongoing variety of astronomically-related multimedia programming for an established world-wide audience of more than a billion subscribers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program, Dr. Philip Massey of Lowell Observatory intends to construct a wide-field imager for the DCT using a state-of-the-art CCD that will be the largest single square device possible on the 150-mm silicon wafers used in today's semiconductor foundries. This 6144 x 6144 (38 megapixel) detector will be teamed with corrector optics, a wide assortment of remotely-selectable filters, and guider hardware to make up the workhorse research instrument on the telescope for at least the first several years of use. The imager will also provide the scientific material and large-scale astronomical images to highlight the educational programming on the Discovery Channel and for outreach programs to the 80,000 members of the public who visit Lowell Observatory annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Channel is renowned for producing entertaining and educational programming relating to scientific discovery and achievement. Their production for the DCT will include a documentary on the construction of the telescope itself, features on the astronomical instrumentation in use, on the research programs underway, and short spots called "Tonight at the DCT". Lowell astronomers will participate in preparing and vetting these programs for scientific accuracy and relevance, as well as in using the DCT for many of the educational programs that the observatory sponsors. The latter range from graduate student research programs, to Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs, to outreach activities into the public schools of Flagstaff and the surrounding Navajo and Hopi nations.</AbstractNarration>
