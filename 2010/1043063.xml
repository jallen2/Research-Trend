    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER project uses newly developed micro-ultrasonic and micro-electro-discharge machining methods to develop rapid prototyping of a new generation of nano-enabled sensors. If successful, the work will both dramatically expand available options for lithography-compatible, batch-mode microfabrication of ceramic and metal microstructures and provide new technology allowing the development of new, more sensitive, and more robust environmental sensors for aquatic environments. Recently developed lithography-compatible micromachining techniques will be explored, with the goal of decreasing the thickness and increasing the sensitivity and spatial resolution of protonic ceramic membranes, such as yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YST), a ceramic used in pH and redox sensor electrodes that are used to make measurements in high temperature (400 degree C) corrosive environments (seawater). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include the collaboration of researchers from three fields that do not commonly interact (nan-manufacturing, geoscience, and biology), development of new infrastructure for science engineering, and the potential for dramatically improving aquatic sensor sensitivity and longevity even in harsh environmental conditions like those found in seafloor hydrothermal vents. Student training in novel, state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques and nanotechnology is also involved.</AbstractNarration>
