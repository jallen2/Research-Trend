    <AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Improving the accuracy and precision ofmonazite and allanite geochronology via ID Th-Pb ages for referencematerials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal limitation for obtaining high-precision, accurate standard-based 208Pb/232Th ages from monazite and allanite is the lack of appropriate, well-characterized reference materials. Because both monazite and allanite are compositionally variable and SIMS, LA-ICP-MS incur instrumental mass-dependent fractionation, it is essential to closely match standards with unknowns. This proposal seeks to determine isotope dilution (ID) Th-Pb ages for the Th-rich accessory minerals monazite and allanite. Th-Pb ages currently exist for only one reference material that is commonly used-'554'. Consequently, all standard-based geochronologic measurements require an assumption that Th-Pb and U-Pb ages are equivalent. This assumption is unnecessary and, in many cases, invalid. By obtaining high-precision ID Th-Pb ages for a suite of well-characterized, community-wide reference materials, this research will provide a means of independently calibrating Th-Pb ages for minerals that can be linked to fundamental tectonic processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;o Eliminates the need to assume concordance among the three decay systems (235U, 238U&lt;br/&gt;and 232Th decay chains) by providing independently verified U-Pb and Th-Pb ages.&lt;br/&gt;o Improves precision on age measurements for a chronometer that can be directly linked&lt;br/&gt;to the metamorphic and magmatic history of a terrane&lt;br/&gt;o Provides well-characterized standards to the community for high-precision, standardbased&lt;br/&gt;geochronology.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;1. This proposed research seeks to address the fundamental aim of the EARTHTIME initiative: "the development of the geochronological techniques necessary to produce temporal constraints with uncertainties approaching 0.1 % of the radioisotopic ages."&lt;br/&gt;o A website will be developed that contains the information about the reference materials and the methods for measuring the ID TIMS and ICP-MS ages. This information will be linked to the EARTHTIME website.&lt;br/&gt;o An educational module will be developed that can be integrated into the EARTHTIME mission for educating students about understanding geologic time. This module will demonstrate linking pressure, temperature and time histories.&lt;br/&gt;2. This project supports two early career scientists-John Cottle (UCSB faculty) and Emily Peterman (Stanford Postdoctoral Fellow). In addition, Peterman is a young female scientist (Ph.D. 2009).&lt;br/&gt;3. This study will train undergraduates (UCSB) in laboratory investigations and provide a component of graduate research for graduate students at UCSB and Stanford.&lt;br/&gt;4. The results of the proposed research will impact the geochronology community at large:&lt;br/&gt;o Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry&lt;br/&gt;o Secondary Ionization Mass Spectrometry&lt;br/&gt;o Electron Probe MicroAnalysis&lt;br/&gt;o (Laser Ablation) Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry</AbstractNarration>
