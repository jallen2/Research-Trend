    <AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Dong-Sheng Yang of the University of Kentucky and his research group will investigate the bonding and structures of reactive gaseous metal clusters and metal-molecule complexes. Emphasis will be placed on early transition metal cluster oxides, which are relevant to catalysis, and lanthanide-benzene complexes, which are relevant to organometallic synthesis and also pose a challenge to quantum theories of chemical bonding. These short-lived chemical species will be prepared in laser-vaporization molecular beams, identified with photoionization mass spectrometry, and studied using a variety of techniques including zero electron kinetic energy photoelectron, mass analyzed threshold ionization, and infrared-ultraviolet photoionization spectroscopy. Combining the spectroscopic data and theoretical predictions will allow for the characterization of electronic states and molecular structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will lead to new knowledge about the size-dependent structures and electronic properties of the metal clusters and metal-ligand binding and energetics of the metal complexes. The results will be of interest to practitioners in organometallic chemistry, surface sciences, materials synthesis, and chemical catalysis. This project provides technologically challenging research training opportunities for students and postdoctoral associates to prepare them effectively for careers in industry or academia.</AbstractNarration>
