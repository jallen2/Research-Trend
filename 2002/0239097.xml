    <AbstractNarration>Bal&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his students study wave and particle&lt;br/&gt;propagation in heterogeneous media and related inverse problems.&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, they analyze the refocusing and stability&lt;br/&gt;properties of time reversed waves, which can be used in&lt;br/&gt;non-destructive testing and wireless communication. They also&lt;br/&gt;analyze photon propagation in human tissues to understand how the&lt;br/&gt;properties of these tissues can be imaged from photon intensity&lt;br/&gt;measurements. Numerical tools and software are developed to&lt;br/&gt;simulate the aforementioned forward and inverse problems. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator also develops a course on theoretical and numerical&lt;br/&gt;inverse problems.&lt;br/&gt; In many applications a good understanding of wave and&lt;br/&gt;particle propagation in complicated media is necessary: seismic&lt;br/&gt;wave propagation generated by earthquakes, acoustic wave&lt;br/&gt;propagation to destroy kidney stones (lithotripsy), microwave&lt;br/&gt;propagation in wireless communication, or photon propagation in&lt;br/&gt;optical tomography, a quite powerful imaging technique to detect,&lt;br/&gt;for instance, brain tumors and finger arthritis. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;devises theoretical and numerical tools to analyze wave and&lt;br/&gt;particle propagation and to understand how it can be used to&lt;br/&gt;solve practical problems, such as the maximal capacity of&lt;br/&gt;communication that can be obtained in a specific environment, or&lt;br/&gt;the minimal size tumor that can be imaged in optical tomography.&lt;br/&gt;It is also a primary goal of the investigator to teach coming&lt;br/&gt;generations of undergraduate and graduate students the novel&lt;br/&gt;techniques that have emerged recently in the applied mathematical&lt;br/&gt;community to address these problems.</AbstractNarration>
