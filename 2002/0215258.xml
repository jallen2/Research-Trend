    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test a novel method for&lt;br/&gt;Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements for process control&lt;br/&gt;and monitoring in semiconductor lithography applications. It builds on the demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;success of employing planar grating diffraction to achieve SE measurements in the visible&lt;br/&gt;wavelengths. For SE measurements in the VUV, it is necessary to employ conical&lt;br/&gt;diffraction geometries which do not require sheet-type polarizing elements in the&lt;br/&gt;detection system. This permits the construction of a Conical Diffraction- Grating&lt;br/&gt;Division of Amplitude Photopolarimeter (CD-GDOAP) that is the analyzer/detection system in&lt;br/&gt;the VUV-SE. By intercepting four or more dispersed orders of the cone of diffraction, a&lt;br/&gt;CD-GDOAP can measure the polarization state of light over the full spectrum in the VUV&lt;br/&gt;with no moving parts. The VUV-SE will: (i) operate in the 140-280 nm spectral range, (ii)&lt;br/&gt;have no moving parts, and (iii) provide high temporal resolution. In Phase I, we propose&lt;br/&gt;to characterize the performance of a laboratory breadboard CD-GDOAP by investigating (i)&lt;br/&gt;conical diffraction geometries, (ii) robustness of polarization detection, and (iii)&lt;br/&gt;performance of optical components in the VUV. If successful, it will lead to a compact,&lt;br/&gt;high-speed VUV-SE for use in semiconductor processing.&lt;br/&gt;Potential Commercial Applications of the Research&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SE based on CD-GDOAP will permit real-time measurements for VUV lithography&lt;br/&gt;applications at 157, 193, and 248 nm in a single instrument. Presently there are no&lt;br/&gt;commercially available instruments (used in production facilities) that can access all of&lt;br/&gt;these wavelengths. Successful completion of this project will ensure rapid entry into the&lt;br/&gt;marketplace, through the business relationship that CRI is developing with major&lt;br/&gt;semiconductor metrology equipment companies.</AbstractNarration>
