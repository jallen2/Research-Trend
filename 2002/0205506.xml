    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0205301&lt;br/&gt;Albert Corbett&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR: Collaborative Research: Putting a Face on Cognitive Tutors:&lt;br/&gt;Bringing Active Inquiry into Active Problem Solving&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative project with:&lt;br/&gt;0205506&lt;br/&gt;Michelene Chi&lt;br/&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on a growing body of research concerning effective learning and tutoring strategies. The project involves constructing and evaluating educational technology that emulates human tutors by integrating a state-of-the art educational technology called Cognitive Tutors with a innovative interactive questioning environment called Synthetic Interviews to produce an inactive learning environment that rivals the effectiveness of human tutors. Cognitive tutors are built around a cognitive model of problem solving knowledge and provide precisely the support students need to complete problems successfully. Used alone, cognitive tutors do not support the help-seeking and meta-cognitive skills that characterize active learners. By incorporating a novel interactive communication technology called Synthetic Interviews, an Active Learning Environment is offered that rivals the effectiveness of human tutors in supporting deep student learning. Synthetic Interviews allow learners to engage in active inquiry by providing the means for conversing in-depth with an individual. Synthetic Interviews permit knowledge capture in a new form providing utility similar to an expert system but a development effort approaching the simple video taping of a conversation. The Active Learning Environment serves as a research tool to examine both computational and pedagogical challenges and also as an educational environment in classrooms and homes. In particular, the domains of knowledge that are constructed around this learning environment are mathematics and biology courses. The project promises to make important contributions to cognitive science, computer science and educational practice including the following: 1) The analysis of student questions during synthetic interviews will contribute to basic cognitive models of the functional relationship between declarative conceptual knowledge and procedural problem solving knowledge, 2) This project will integrate cognitive models of student knowledge and tutorial dialogue structure. More generally, the project will help define a design and engineering process for intelligent learning environments, 3) The research will inform the design of more effective computer-based learning environments. 4) The research and the active learning environment can support improved professional development both for pre-service and in-service teachers. The Active Learning Environments for mathematics and biology that are developed in this project promise to directly improve educational practice nationally. Current generation cognitive mathematics tutors are already in use in about 2% of middle schools and high schools around the country. The demand for effective mathematics and science education continues to grow. States are increasing mathematics graduation requirements and instituting assessments that govern student graduation and school evaluations. If Active Learning Environments are more effective than current generation Cognitive Tutors, they promise to rapidly enter widespread classroom use.</AbstractNarration>
