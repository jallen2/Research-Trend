    <AbstractNarration>Microorganisms play a critical role in plant health. Depending on the organism, microbes can cause disease or prevent it. Despite their importance to our agricultural base and food security, we know little about them on a genomic level. To enable the scientific community to intervene in disease and to understand the basis of biocontrol, a concerted and well-coordinated genomic analysis of these microbes is essential. Members of the American Phytopathological Society (APS) have developed a prioritized list of plant-associated microbes for genome analysis, i.e. the structural and functional analysis of the microbial genes and the proteins encoded by those genes, with ultimate emphasis on those genes and proteins involved in plant associations. The APS prioritized list will serve as a foundation for a workshop with the goal of developing a strategy to obtain the genomic information needed to understand these important microbes and their interactions with host plants and the environment. The Workshop on Genomic Analysis of Plant-Associated Microorganisms will be held in Washington, D.C, April 9-11, 2002. This award will help defray the travel expenses of about 20 experts from the genomics and microbial research communities. These experts will be challenged to (1) detail and prioritize the scientific and technical needs and (2) develop a plan for a coordinated and collaborative effort for genomic analysis of these plant-associated microbes. The results of this workshop will be disseminated to the wider APS membership via an emailed "News Capsule" and published in Phytopathology News. Additionally, a follow-up forum sponsored by the APS Policy Board will be held at the Society's 2002 Annual Meeting held in August to inform members and generate wider discussion about the issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>
