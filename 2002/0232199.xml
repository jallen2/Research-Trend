    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is intended to establish the&lt;br/&gt;technology for the production of an innovative polymer-based microcellular&lt;br/&gt;nanocomposites (MCNC). The synergistic marriage of microcellular foaming with&lt;br/&gt;nanocomposite technology would create an end product with enormous market potential.&lt;br/&gt;This new composite would fill a critical need for the next generation of materials for the&lt;br/&gt;aerospace, automotive, medical and electronic industries. Nanocomposites offer&lt;br/&gt;enhanced mechanical and physical properties while the microcellular foaming process&lt;br/&gt;offers distinct processing advantages and weight savings. The project research entails three inter-related stages: application of mixing theory, computational simulation, and experimental investigation. This systematic study of the processing technology will permit for the efficient production and facilitate market penetration of MCNC materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the potential for numerous commercial applications. Current trends across various industries create the demand for materials that offer enhanced physical and mechanical properties, reduced weights, and improved processing times. These requirements lead to a significant impetus to develop a new class of materials derived from the marriage of nano-fillers and microcellular foaming technology. Some estimates put the worldwide market for nanocomposites by 2009 to be in excess of 1 billion lbs. MCNC materials have the potential to capture part of this market, while opening new ones due to the attractive properties that these materials possess.</AbstractNarration>
