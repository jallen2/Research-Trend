    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204627&lt;br/&gt;Joanna Kania-Bartoszynska &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the introduction of quantum invariants of three dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds the fact that these invariants are only defined at roots of&lt;br/&gt;unity has been an obstruction to analyzing their properties. However,&lt;br/&gt;there is ample evidence that quantum invariants of three manifolds&lt;br/&gt;exist as holomorphic functions on the unit disk that diverge&lt;br/&gt;everywhere on the unit circle but at roots of unity. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;uses the results of her previous research to study further quantum&lt;br/&gt;invariants and to find additional applications of that research to&lt;br/&gt;classical 3-manifold topology. Specifically, she works on the problem&lt;br/&gt;of extending the parametric domain of the quantum 3-manifold&lt;br/&gt;invariants beyond roots of unity. She also studies the application of&lt;br/&gt;quantum topology to detecting symmetries of 3--manifolds and to&lt;br/&gt;answering questions relating to Dehn surgery on knots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum topology is a rapidly developing area of mathematics that&lt;br/&gt;brings together ideas from physics, algebra, geometry and&lt;br/&gt;topology. This theory has produced a wealth of new invariants for&lt;br/&gt;three dimensional manifolds. Three-manifolds are objects which locally&lt;br/&gt;look like the common 3-dimensional space we live in, and "topological&lt;br/&gt;invariants" are numbers which can be associated to manifolds that&lt;br/&gt;encode some information about their structure and help to classify&lt;br/&gt;them. The investigator works on one of the fundamental problems in&lt;br/&gt;this area, namely that of finding topological interpretations for&lt;br/&gt;these new invariants.</AbstractNarration>
