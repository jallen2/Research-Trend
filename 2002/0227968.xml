    <AbstractNarration>United States participation in and leadership of international Arctic science will be strengthened by a senior U.S. Arctic research scientist representing the interests of the U.S. Arctic science community in the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and by serving as President of the IASC Council. The Arctic is very important scientifically and plays a strong role in global, including climate, change. However the conduct of research in the Arctic poses many pragmatic problems, e.g., it is a harsh and remote environment; no permanent facilities can be located in much of the region; and eight different countries control various parts of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent land areas. Thus, international cooperation in the Arctic is not only useful, but often essential. IASC, established in 1990 to encourage and promote such cooperation, provides a forum for exchange of information among scientists and between scientists and governments on a wide variety of Arctic science topics. IASC also supports international coordination of national Arctic research efforts by supporting small focused scientific planning meetings/workshops. U.S. participation and leadership in IASC and its Council will assist IASC to address on a priority basis: an assessment of the impact of the climate and climatic changes on the Arctic and its peoples; development of an international bathymetric chart of the Arctic Ocean; a study of the role of humans in caribou/reindeer grazing systems; a study of biocomplexity and biodiversity in Arctic tundra ecosystems; and providing scientific advice to the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental organization that focuses on interaction between the Arctic environment and its indigenous peoples.</AbstractNarration>
