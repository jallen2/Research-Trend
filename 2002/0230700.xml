    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230700&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Olafsson, Sigurdur&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: An Active Learning Environment for Information Technology Across the Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;NSF RECEIVED DATE: 06/04/2002&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iowa State Department of Industrial Engineering will reformulate its curriculum using information technology as the integrating common experience. This project will perform a proof of concept study in designing and prototyping a learning environment where students (a) learn to effectively use information technology solve real world engineering problems, (b) develop their cognitive ability to structure schemas in industrial engineering knowledge domains, (c) develop their metacognitive ability to apply discipline-specific knowledge to solve engineering problems and monitor their problem solving strategies, and (d) fully appreciate the connection between isolated relevant course content. The key concept of this proposal is therefore a learning environment based on new and emerging information technology tools and concepts that will integrate isolated course content. In addition, this learning environment will reflect current thinking in learning theory. The environment will thus be learner-centered, knowledge-centered, and assessment-centered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach to achieving the objectives is through a set of active learning modules in &lt;br/&gt;which students use domain knowledge, data, methods, and software tools to achieve a pre-defined &lt;br/&gt;goal for a set of simulated industrial engineering scenarios. These scenarios will not only draw on &lt;br/&gt;the knowledge base from each course but also explicitly make connections with material from other courses. For each scenario, students must independently define goals, formulate problems, and develop solution strategies while mastering the course material. This environment is thus a fundamental shift from an emphasis on the traditional lecture format to active learning. The modules are also an ideal tool to encourage cooperation with other students.</AbstractNarration>
