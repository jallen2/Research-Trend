    <AbstractNarration>This grant is for the development of computational tools for&lt;br/&gt;simulating very large-scale problems involving granular flow.&lt;br/&gt;Rather than use a continuum model of a granular material (which&lt;br/&gt;involves a large number of assumptions and approximations about the&lt;br/&gt;way they behave), rather we look at the computational challenges in&lt;br/&gt;discrete element models.&lt;br/&gt;These are challenging large-scale problems with thousands to millions&lt;br/&gt;of grains that have to be simulated.&lt;br/&gt;Direct interactions are usually between touching grains.&lt;br/&gt;However, one grain can not only affect the others that it touches, but&lt;br/&gt;those will affect their neighbors, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;Further, the network of interactions is dynamic.&lt;br/&gt;Indeed, the overall pattern of interactions can become very&lt;br/&gt;different depending on the circumstances: if a sand table is shaken,&lt;br/&gt;then most of the sand grains will be independent; when the grains&lt;br/&gt;settle, each grain will be touching many others.&lt;br/&gt;In order to efficiently organize the computational tasks, we need to&lt;br/&gt;use techniques from graph or network theory.&lt;br/&gt;These tools include graph partitioning techniques, graph coloring&lt;br/&gt;techniques, and new techniques for handling the collisions of grains.&lt;br/&gt;Since the problems are very large scale, currently available&lt;br/&gt;techniques often have to be adapted from dealing with small-scale&lt;br/&gt;problems to deal with large-scale problems.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, since the network of interactions is dynamic, these&lt;br/&gt;techniques have to be adapted to use information about the previous&lt;br/&gt;network in order to efficiently obtain the corresponding information&lt;br/&gt;about the new network.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we will be developing these tools and drawing&lt;br/&gt;techniques from graph theory, continuous optimization, complementarity&lt;br/&gt;theory, and computational geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Granular materials are materials made of small, relatively hard&lt;br/&gt;objects that collide off each other.&lt;br/&gt;Sand, breakfast cereals, talcum powder, and a box of marbles are all&lt;br/&gt;examples of granular materials.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding these materials and simulating their behavior directly&lt;br/&gt;is difficult because the position and velocity of each of the&lt;br/&gt;``grains'' in the material needs to be tracked and updated as they&lt;br/&gt;move and collide.&lt;br/&gt;In order to do this well, we need high-performance computers, and we&lt;br/&gt;need to use them well.&lt;br/&gt;The crucial problem is to understand the nature of the interactions&lt;br/&gt;between the grains, and to develop automatic tools that can determine&lt;br/&gt;how to divide the computational tasks so that they can be tackled&lt;br/&gt;efficiently on high-performance and parallel computers.</AbstractNarration>
