    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204191 PI: Georgios Daskalopoulos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes three projects. In the first, the PI proposes to&lt;br/&gt;study regularity of harmonic maps into the completion of Teichmueller&lt;br/&gt;space. The two main applications are on symplectic Lefschetz pencils&lt;br/&gt;and on superrigidity of lattices in the mapping class group. In the&lt;br/&gt;second project the PI proposes a proof of higher dimensional partial&lt;br/&gt;analogues of the conjectures of Atiyah and Bott on Yang-Mills&lt;br/&gt;equations over Riemann surfaces. These are nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;generalizations to higher dimensions of the PI's previous work on the&lt;br/&gt;connection between Yang-Mills and the theory of holomorphic vector&lt;br/&gt;bundles. Finally in the third project the PI proposes some questions&lt;br/&gt;about harmonic maps from three-dimensional manifolds to trees which&lt;br/&gt;generalize the well-known theory of harmonic maps from surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for the first project is to use harmonic maps in order&lt;br/&gt;to understand analytically the results of Kaimanovich-Masur and&lt;br/&gt;Farb-Masur on the superrigidity of lattices of rank at least 2 in the&lt;br/&gt;mapping class group. In the process the PI realized that the methods&lt;br/&gt;should also shed light in the rank one case. The second project&lt;br/&gt;shows that there are still very close connections between the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the Yang-Mills equations and algebraic geometry. These&lt;br/&gt;connections have been exploited in great detail by several people in&lt;br/&gt;the case of Riemann surfaces but very little is known in higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensions. The PI's work sheds some light in this direction.</AbstractNarration>
