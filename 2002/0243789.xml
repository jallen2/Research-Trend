    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site Program is designed to organize the resources, environment and experience of a major research University so as to provide enhanced research opportunities in Cellular and Molecular Biology to promising undergraduate students. The Program builds upon major strengths in the University of Rochester's programs in the Biological Sciences and it is intended not only to provide outstanding research experiences, but also to encourage participating undergraduates to pursue career paths in the biological sciences. Students will be recruited principally from four-year colleges, including minority-serving institutions with which the Program Director has developed linkages. The central research experience will take place during a 10-week, full-time work period each summer. At this time, each REU student will pursue an independent research project under the supervision of a specific faculty mentor, and with the hands-on guidance of a "bench advisor" such as a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow, who will provide assistance with laboratory methods and new techniques. The summer experience will be enriched through seminars on a range of research topics and career-development issues (including a roundtable discussion of careers in science). In addition, a GRE prep course will be offered for interested students, and all participating students will be encouraged to get to know each other through scheduled social activities. All students who do not live in the Rochester area will also be offered no-cost housing for the summer in a single on-campus dorm, located within 5-minutes walk of the laboratories in which they will conduct their research. All students will be given the opportunity to enhance their communication skills by presenting posters on their research at the end of the summer, at a mini-symposium that will be attended by other trainees and faculty members. Finally, all students will be strongly encouraged to present their research at national and local scientific meetings, and to continue part-time research work during the academic year. The major goal of this program is to help to support the progression of promising undergraduates into Ph.D. programs in the Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
