    <AbstractNarration>Self-assembly is the process by which simple objects &lt;br/&gt;spontaneously assemble into complexes. &lt;br/&gt;It is expected to ultimately become &lt;br/&gt;an important technology at the level of atoms and&lt;br/&gt;molecules. The development of researches in programmable&lt;br/&gt;self-assembly is reaching the stage that we have&lt;br/&gt;to understand it mathematically in order&lt;br/&gt;to take full advantage of this new tool.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to study &lt;br/&gt;the computational aspects of self-assembly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project includes: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Solving concrete problems in the Tile Assembly Model,&lt;br/&gt;including but not limited to&lt;br/&gt;finding an approximation algorithm for the Minimum&lt;br/&gt;Tile Set Problem (MTSP)&lt;br/&gt;and characterizing the shape languages.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Exploring different modelings of self-assembly, which&lt;br/&gt;will give a more accurate abstraction of &lt;br/&gt;the experimental results and will reflect the massive parallelism &lt;br/&gt;in molecular/DNA computing.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Studying the connections between &lt;br/&gt;the algorithmic self-assembly and the classical theory&lt;br/&gt;of computation, especially the communication theory&lt;br/&gt;and the resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project will integrate teaching activity &lt;br/&gt;into the research of self-assembly.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will offer graduate level courses in &lt;br/&gt;molecular computing and closely-related fields such as &lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics, and introduce the research&lt;br/&gt;to undergraduate and graduate students in general theory courses.&lt;br/&gt;This project will adopt the active learning techniques in teaching.&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the project will contribute to understanding&lt;br/&gt;the engineering power of self-assembly, and to disseminating&lt;br/&gt;the current research information to students as well.</AbstractNarration>
