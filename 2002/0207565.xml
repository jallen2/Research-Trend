    <AbstractNarration>Carbonate-Associated Sulfate in Modern Sediments of South Florida: &lt;br/&gt;Diagenetic Relationships &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biogeochemical cycling of sulfur at and near the earth.s surface is intimately linked.through a &lt;br/&gt;complex set of feedbacks.to ambient redox conditions, including the availability of &lt;br/&gt;atmospheric oxygen. Our ability to delineate and quantify these cycles and the associated &lt;br/&gt;biospheric impacts hinges on the strong preferential utilization of 32S relative to 34S during &lt;br/&gt;bacterial sulfate reduction. Historically, temporal trends in the relative magnitudes of critical &lt;br/&gt;redox pathways have been estimated by monitoring the 34S of the ocean as manifested in a &lt;br/&gt;limited sedimentary record of gypsum. Consequently, the models are only as good as the data, &lt;br/&gt;which fail to provide even minimal constraints for most of the Precambrian. During the earth.s &lt;br/&gt;early history, gypsum deposition was less abundant, and preservation is poor due to its &lt;br/&gt;vulnerability during weathering. In light of these complications, carbonate-associated sulfate or &lt;br/&gt;CAS, which is complementary to but generally not overlapping with a promising new barite &lt;br/&gt;approach, has emerged as a viable alternative. CAS, which often occurs at concentrations of &lt;br/&gt;hundreds to thousands of ppm, is a component of most limestones and dolostones and shows &lt;br/&gt;great promise for continuous, high-resolution records of ancient seawater sulfate. Interest in the &lt;br/&gt;method is peaking, yet applications greatly outnumber studies tracking even the basic &lt;br/&gt;systematics of CAS and the potential loss of seawater signals through diagenesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite encouraging initial results for CAS in ancient sediments, no systematic attempt has been &lt;br/&gt;made to test the method in a modern setting where the controlling factors are more easily and &lt;br/&gt;independently constrained. Furthermore, any attempts at modern calibration have neglected the &lt;br/&gt;precursor of the most abundant carbonate component of the geologic record.carbonate mud.&lt;br/&gt;and the effects of diagenesis. The primary objective of the proposed study is to understand how &lt;br/&gt;CAS is incorporated, distributed and preserved in modern carbonate sediments in south Florida. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, we will observe isotopic and concentration trends across a carefully chosen set of &lt;br/&gt;well-characterized depositional settings in Florida Bay and at lagoonal sites seaward of the Keys. &lt;br/&gt;The resulting diversity translates into spatial and temporal gradients in the parameters that &lt;br/&gt;control sulfur cycling, such as the availability of labile organic compounds, salinity and the &lt;br/&gt;physical and biological properties of the sediment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the overall fidelity of the seawater isotopic signal recorded in bulk mud samples that are &lt;br/&gt;undergoing carbonate dissolution, precipitation and mineral transformations on early diagenetic &lt;br/&gt;time scales within the confines of an evolving pore-water sulfate reservoir? Although we &lt;br/&gt;recognize the profound differences between modern and ancient settings, it is these bulk mud &lt;br/&gt;samples that will illuminate the conditions under which primary signals may or may not be &lt;br/&gt;preserved. Various coarser sketetal components will also be tracked from life through burial to &lt;br/&gt;depths up to several meters. These goals are facilitated by Lyons. experience working in modern &lt;br/&gt;settings, including south Florida, although many of the questions asked will stem from the &lt;br/&gt;ultimate goal of testing the robustness of a paleoenvironmental proxy. In particular, Lyons. past &lt;br/&gt;work with sediment diagenesis, carbonate sedimentology/geochemistry and sulfur geochemistry &lt;br/&gt;will be most helpful. The tight focus of this study.as requested by the panel following review of an earlier version of this proposalwill allow us to track CAS within a rigorous organic and &lt;br/&gt;inorganic geochemical context. The multi-component approach, including rate measurements &lt;br/&gt;and concentration and isotopic determinations for a wide range of relevant species, is designed to &lt;br/&gt;provide the biogeochemical sulfur mass balance necessary for understanding ppm levels of &lt;br/&gt;sulfate within reactive carbonate grains. In the end, CAS may help fill the many gaps in the &lt;br/&gt;.Claypool curve. through use of continuous sections of shallow-water carbonates from even the &lt;br/&gt;oldest rocks. But as with all carbonate proxies for ancient seawater, our interpretations are only &lt;br/&gt;as good as our understanding of the multiple diagenetic pathways.</AbstractNarration>
