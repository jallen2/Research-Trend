    <AbstractNarration>Competitively awarded support for University of Idaho (UI) research &lt;br/&gt;has steadily grown from $35 million in FY'96 to $63 million in FY'01.&lt;br/&gt;This increase is due, in part, to the research activities of several&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary research institutes and groups. For example, UI's&lt;br/&gt;NASA Grand Challenge team provided the top-ranking concept for&lt;br/&gt;detecting extraterrestrial life. This concept would be accomplished&lt;br/&gt;in space using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. At&lt;br/&gt;present, UI simply does not have the capabilities needed to implement&lt;br/&gt;and test MEMS designs in their own laboratories for reliability in&lt;br/&gt;harsh environments. In addition, UI researchers are conducting other&lt;br/&gt;projects expected to result in a miniaturized tandem mass spectrometer&lt;br/&gt;system, miniature resonators, micro pumps, autonomous vehicle guidance&lt;br/&gt;systems, magnetic random access memories, and magnetic films for small &lt;br/&gt;monolithic microwave integrated circuits. All of these research activities&lt;br/&gt;will benefit from the added capabilities requested through the Major&lt;br/&gt;Research Instrumentation Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As a result of current progress in funded research projects, and with&lt;br/&gt;the support of the university's administration, the PIs seek to acquire&lt;br/&gt;instruments to fabricate, test, and evaluate the robustness of new&lt;br/&gt;technologies. This request includes a plasma enhanced chemical vapor&lt;br/&gt;deposition system, an e-beam evaporator, a vibration / shock table, a&lt;br/&gt;thermal vacuum chamber, and a laser vibrometer. Acquisition of these&lt;br/&gt;instruments will also provide more opportunities to integrate research&lt;br/&gt;training with graduate and undergraduate education. The University of&lt;br/&gt;Idaho is requesting approximately $290,000 from the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation from a total project cost of over $611,000. This equipment&lt;br/&gt;will add significant capabilities to their region by complementing&lt;br/&gt;existing equipment at neighboring Washington State University and by&lt;br/&gt;providing research equipment that is currently unavailable in the inland&lt;br/&gt;Northwest. It will also provide additional opportunities for participants&lt;br/&gt;in Idaho's HOIST program (Helping Orient Indian Students and Teachers to&lt;br/&gt;Science and Technology) to get hands-on experience in engineering&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project will be managed by experienced PIs who will use proven&lt;br/&gt;instrument management approach to ensure efficient operation and&lt;br/&gt;maintenance of the equipment. A qualified engineering technician will&lt;br/&gt;assist them. The equipment will be housed within a single building on&lt;br/&gt;the main UI campus, and this MRI award will receive full administrative&lt;br/&gt;support from the Director and staff of the UI Microelectronics Research&lt;br/&gt;and Communications Institute.</AbstractNarration>
