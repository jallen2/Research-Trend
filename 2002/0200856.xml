    <AbstractNarration>The project addresses problems covering a rather broad&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of discrete mathematics (DM), some drawn from related&lt;br/&gt;areas such as statistical mechanics (SM), probability, and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science (TCS). A common thread in many &lt;br/&gt;of these problems is:one is given a probability distribution &lt;br/&gt;on some large discrete space (e.g. independent sets in, or &lt;br/&gt;proper colorings of, a graph), and wants to know whether &lt;br/&gt;behavior in one part of the system can significantly affect &lt;br/&gt;behavior in other, distant parts. The loose term&lt;br/&gt;``long range effects" (LRE's) is used for such interactions.&lt;br/&gt;Both strong and weak LRE's are of interest:&lt;br/&gt;For SM what's wanted is, more often than not,&lt;br/&gt;strong LRE's, usually under the name ``phase transition" (PT).&lt;br/&gt;In very recent work, the investigator and his student David&lt;br/&gt;Galvin used mainly combinatorial ideas to settle one&lt;br/&gt;much-studied question in this area (concerning PT's in the&lt;br/&gt;``hard-core lattice gas model"), and a particular hope at&lt;br/&gt;present is that ideas from this work, and, more generally,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator's combinatorial perspective, will lead to&lt;br/&gt;progress on various more or less related questions.&lt;br/&gt;From the perspectives of DM and TCS, on the other hand,&lt;br/&gt;weak LRE's are often desirable, e.g. because of their&lt;br/&gt;connections with rapid mixing of Markov chains (a topic&lt;br/&gt;of major interest in TCS), and because in combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;applications of probability, systems with sufficiently&lt;br/&gt;weak LRE's can sometimes substitute for probability spaces&lt;br/&gt;based on purely independent choices. (This again involves&lt;br/&gt;the hard-core model, which arises in surprisingly diverse&lt;br/&gt;mathematical contexts.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking very generally, the (main part of the) project aims&lt;br/&gt;at understanding the degree of order or disorder in various&lt;br/&gt;large random systems, for instance the extent to which the&lt;br/&gt;global structure of a physical system can be predicted from&lt;br/&gt;knowledge about interactions between neighboring particles.&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, random systems similar to those used to model&lt;br/&gt;physical reality have played increasingly important roles&lt;br/&gt;in TCS and DM, partly because they can be helpful in analyzing&lt;br/&gt;(algorithmically and/or theoretically) even non-random problems&lt;br/&gt;in these areas; and there has been an increasing realization of&lt;br/&gt;the degree to which the issues arising in these three disciplines&lt;br/&gt;are related. One major theme of the present project is an interest&lt;br/&gt;in applying ideas and methods across mathematical boundaries:&lt;br/&gt;especially in using ideas from the investigator's core area (DM)&lt;br/&gt;to attack problems in SM and TCS, but also in bringing an &lt;br/&gt;increasing familiarity with techniques from the latter areas to&lt;br/&gt;bear on several problems of longstanding interest in DM.</AbstractNarration>
