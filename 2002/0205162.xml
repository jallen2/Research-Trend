    <AbstractNarration>The University Materials Council (UMC), an organization of department chairs of materials science and engineering programs, and the Federation of Materials Societies (FMS), a network of materials-related professional societies, are co-organizing a meeting on materials education entitled in Materials Education: Opportunities over a Lifetime. This meeting will involve a thorough interchange of beneficial ideas and practices in materials science and engineering education among concerned citizens, professional educators, and "funders"/policy makers at three levels: grassroots, K-12, and college/university. The goals are for all groups involved in materials education to learn about the possibilities for parallel activities and collaboration. Professional educators will become aware of the broad spectrum of potential sources of support. Funding organizations and policy makers will become acquainted with the needs, opportunities, and activities in materials education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one and one-half day forum will take place at the University of Maryland- College Park on May 20-21, 2002, with a registration fee that will cover all meals and will feature a presentation by a concerned member of Congress. The meeting is a continuation of the series of FMS Biennial Meetings. Outside sponsorship is requested in order to allow participation by a wide and varied group of individuals interested in materials education.</AbstractNarration>
