    <AbstractNarration>Seawater Calcium Isotopes and Carbonate Deposition History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes in the amount of carbonate precipitation and dissolution have significant effects&lt;br/&gt;on oceanic alkalinity, total CO2, and atmospheric CO2, thus climate. Knowledge of the&lt;br/&gt;carbonate depositional history is important for understanding the global calcium and&lt;br/&gt;carbon cycles and may lead to improved understanding of global biogeochemical cycles&lt;br/&gt;operation on Earth on various time scales and the potential feedback mechanisms in these&lt;br/&gt;cycles and their effect on climate. The calcium isotope ratio is seawater at any given&lt;br/&gt;time is largely controlled by biological precipitation of calcium carbonate, a process that&lt;br/&gt;discriminates against heavy isotopes. This fractionation causes seawater to be enriched&lt;br/&gt;in heavy calcium relative to the average isotopic ratio of input sources to the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, reconstruction of seawater Ca isotope ratio could lead to an estimate of the&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations in the amount of calcium carbonate deposited in the oceans through time and&lt;br/&gt;to better understanding of the calcium and carbon cycles. Accordingly, the main&lt;br/&gt;objective of this SGER proposal is to explore the potential of the mineral barite separated&lt;br/&gt;from deep-sea sediments to trace the variations in seawater Ca isotope ratios, and to&lt;br/&gt;evaluate the use this proxy for reconstruction of the calcium carbonate deposition history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work fits the criteria for a SGER proposal as it seeks partial support for conducting&lt;br/&gt;preliminary work of an untested and novel idea it is a high risk project and applies newly&lt;br/&gt;developed tools (so far only two labs in the USA measure Ca isotopes routinely). Results&lt;br/&gt;if encouraging will provide a basis to perform further more detailed research that will&lt;br/&gt;advance our understanding of the global biogeochemical cycle and its coupling with&lt;br/&gt;climate and contribute significantly to the field of paleoceanography and earth history.</AbstractNarration>
