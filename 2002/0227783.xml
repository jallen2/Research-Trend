    <AbstractNarration>The overall goals of this research are to achieve rate enhancements of several thousand fold, and to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) for the activation process. This research will therefore provide new insights into the factors that govern enzyme activity in organic solvents, and will enable enzymes to play an expanded role in industrial processes, including chemicals and pharmaceuticals synthesis, polymer synthesis, drug discovery, and waste treatment, among other emerging applications of biocatalysis. Moreover, the same techniques that lead to improved enzyme function in organic solvents are likely to be of use in the stabilization of dehydrated protein systems, which is a critical issue in biotherapeutic protein formulation and delivery. Thus, this work has broad impact, ranging from biocatalysis to drug discovery to biopharmaceutical formulations.</AbstractNarration>
