    <AbstractNarration>When an engineering structure is loaded by a vibratory source such as a&lt;br/&gt;motor, resonances occur in the neighborhood of normal modal vibrations. These resonances are&lt;br/&gt;often undesirable, resulting in large deformations and possible destructive effects. If&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear effects are taken into account in the engineering model, the normal mode vibrations are&lt;br/&gt;periodic motions known as nonlinear normal modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work concerns nonlinear normal modes in two degree of freedom systems.&lt;br/&gt;Such systems are subject to a phenomenon known as autoparametric excitation. This&lt;br/&gt;involves energy being transferred between nonlinear normal modes in a resonant fashion, with the&lt;br/&gt;possibility that a nonlinear normal mode may become unstable. If a structure were to be designed to&lt;br/&gt;operate in a particular vibrational mode, and if that mode turned out to be unstable, the design&lt;br/&gt;would be a failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The usual procedure for determining whether a nonlinear normal mode is&lt;br/&gt;stable or not involves using a mathematical theory known as Floquet theory. This offers&lt;br/&gt;predictions of instability based on for example numerical integration of the differential equations of&lt;br/&gt;motion. In the proposed research, we address a situation (called coexistence) in which Floquet theory predicts stability, but which involves instabilities which would result if the model was changed slightly.&lt;br/&gt;Since no engineering model perfectly represents a physical situation, such instabilities in models with&lt;br/&gt;coexistence are inevitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although coexistence occurs in a variety of models of physical systems very&lt;br/&gt;little research has been aimed at understanding the associated instabilities. This project aims 1) to&lt;br/&gt;determine which systems exhibit coexistence (from a general class of systems), and 2) to examine the&lt;br/&gt;nature of the resulting instability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will fund a graduate research student at the doctoral level and&lt;br/&gt;thus will integrate research and education. The results of the research will be broadly disseminated by&lt;br/&gt;being presented at a scientific/engineering meeting and published in a scientific journal. In&lt;br/&gt;this way it is hoped that engineers will be made aware of possible design trouble that could be caused by the&lt;br/&gt;hidden instabilities which are the subject of this research.</AbstractNarration>
