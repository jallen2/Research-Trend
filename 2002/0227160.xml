    <AbstractNarration>9805771 CHAPMAN During development, different tissues and organs require different numbers of cells. Programmed cell death (or "apoptosis"), along with cell division, is a primary way that cell number is controlled. Apoptosis occurs as a series of cellular and biochemical events in which the cell, instead of dividing, involutes, falls apart, and is engulfed. Every normal cell appears to have the "program" for cell death, which can be activated in a number of ways. The neurotrophin receptor gp75NTR or NTR, expressed by neurons and some immune cells, is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors known to regulate many cellular decisions to undergo programmed cell death. The NTR contains an intracellular domain that is similar to the "death domain" of other receptors that can initiate apoptosis, but it has not yet been shown that the NTR's putative death domain functions in apoptotic signaling. The objective of Dr. Chapman's study are to establish whether the NTR's death domain interacts with elements of the apoptotic mechanism (caspases), and to demonstrate whether this receptor can induce programmed cell death when expressed ectopically in cultured mammalian cells. This project is particular suitable for a POWRE award. Dr. Chapman recently made the unusual transition from the biotechnology industry to take a faculty job at the new San Marcos campus of the California State University system. CSUSM emphasized hands-on laboratory experience with modern technology to prepare their students in the biological sciences for careers as researchers, science teachers and in the biotechnology industry. Dr. Chapman brings real world experience to her students, and will be able to actively engage them in research with this POWRE award, which will provide the funding for her to initiate this research project.</AbstractNarration>
