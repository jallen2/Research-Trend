    <AbstractNarration>EAR-0230027&lt;br/&gt;Wannamaker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR02-30027: Modes of lithospheric extensional consumption and magmatism: testing&lt;br/&gt;for end-member cases at the Great Basin-Colorado Plateau transition, Utah, with a&lt;br/&gt;magnetotelluric resistivity transect&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Philip E. Wannamaker (University of Utah, Energy &amp; Geoscience Institute, 423&lt;br/&gt;Wakara Way, Suite 300, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, pewanna@egi.utah.edu)&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;End-member possibilities for stable lithospheric extension will be tested according to&lt;br/&gt;their influence on physical properties of the deep crust and upper mantle across the Great&lt;br/&gt;Basin-Colorado Plateau transition zone, south-central Utah. The main geophysical&lt;br/&gt;property to be investigated is electrical conductivity, together with its implications for&lt;br/&gt;thermal and rheological state, which will be imaged using the magnetotelluric (MT)&lt;br/&gt;technique. New MT surveying primarily across the transition zone (TZ) per se will join&lt;br/&gt;existing data into an E-W transect nearly 400 km in length, with a depth range of&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity from 100's of m to 250-400 km approximately. Data will be acquired using&lt;br/&gt;wideband and long-period recorders of the University of Utah and University of&lt;br/&gt;Washington, which reside in the NSF-supported EMSOC instrument facility. Existing&lt;br/&gt;geophysical indicators show a strong N-S strike orientation at upper crustal to&lt;br/&gt;lithospheric scales and should allow accurate cross sections of model conductivity using&lt;br/&gt;mainly current 2-D regularized inversion platforms. Substantially reduced electrical&lt;br/&gt;resistivity values at lower crustal and upper mantle depths inferred from MT field&lt;br/&gt;data most likely reflect melts and exsolved ionic fluids. Previous surveying indicates&lt;br/&gt;that the onset of low resistivity in the deep crust occurs for T &gt; ~500-550 o C in high-grade&lt;br/&gt;metaigneous host rocks. Depth variation in low resistivity thus will approximate&lt;br/&gt;an isotherm which should evolve gradually from the GB to the CP in the case of&lt;br/&gt;uniform TZ warming, or show an upwelling under the little-extended TZ in the case&lt;br/&gt;of non-uniform, enhanced extension at depth. Exsolved fluids weaken the lithosphere&lt;br/&gt;greatly through diffusion creep, so resistivity will provide a clear view of at least&lt;br/&gt;relative rheological contrasts. Conductivity, heat flow and constraints on composition&lt;br/&gt;and timing of extension, will be used in time-dependent, 2-D thermal modeling for an&lt;br/&gt;improved projection of the thermal field into the upper mantle.</AbstractNarration>
