    <AbstractNarration>The neutron interferometer is a device that uses the quantum mechanical &lt;br/&gt;(QM) wave-like properties of free neutrons to measure certain &lt;br/&gt;properties of nature very precisely. It functions much like an optical &lt;br/&gt;interferometer, except that it detects the interference of neutron &lt;br/&gt;"waves" rather than light waves. A slow neutron (speed less than about &lt;br/&gt;2000 m/s) has an associated QM wavelength comparable in size to the &lt;br/&gt;spacing of atoms in a solid, so it interacts with matter coherently, &lt;br/&gt;i.e. like a wave rather than a particle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a slow neutron enters the interferometer, its QM wave is &lt;br/&gt;diffracted in a perfect silicon crystal and splits into two sub-waves, &lt;br/&gt;each taking a different path. These two sub-waves then strike a second &lt;br/&gt;silicon crystal and are diffracted again, into four sub-waves, all &lt;br/&gt;still associated with the original single neutron. Two of these four &lt;br/&gt;sub-waves meet again in a third silicon crystal and can interfere with &lt;br/&gt;each other. The degree of interference determines the probability of &lt;br/&gt;detecting the neutron in a neutron detector placed behind the &lt;br/&gt;interferometer. We can place a piece of matter, a magnetic or electric &lt;br/&gt;field, or even a gravitational field inside the interferometer to shift &lt;br/&gt;the phase of one sub-wave relative to another and change this &lt;br/&gt;interference. By noting the resulting change in the neutron detection &lt;br/&gt;rate we precisely measure the amount of phase shift. This gives &lt;br/&gt;important and often unique information about the strength and nature of &lt;br/&gt;the neutron's interaction in the material or field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In one experiment, we single out the neutron phase shift caused by its &lt;br/&gt;interactions with electrons in a silicon crystal. Overall the neutron &lt;br/&gt;is electrically neutral, but it does feel a force from charged &lt;br/&gt;particles such as electrons because of its magnetic moment, and because &lt;br/&gt;it contains charged quarks. Our measurement will lead to a much better &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the internal charge distribution in the neutron. In &lt;br/&gt;another experiment, we precisely measure the phase shift due to the &lt;br/&gt;neutron's interaction with He-3, a rare light isotope of helium, and &lt;br/&gt;how it changes when the neutron's spin direction is made the same or &lt;br/&gt;opposite to the spin direction of the He-3 nuclei. This will provide &lt;br/&gt;important details about the nature of the force between neutrons and &lt;br/&gt;protons inside atomic nuclei. A third experiment measures the neutron's &lt;br/&gt;phase shift in the Earth's gravitational field using a special neutron &lt;br/&gt;interferometer that floats in a zinc bromide solution. We will try to &lt;br/&gt;resolve a long-standing discrepancy between past neutron experiments of &lt;br/&gt;this type and Einstein's Weak Equivalence Principle, which states that &lt;br/&gt;a particle's gravitational and inertial masses are equal.</AbstractNarration>
