    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will develop improved monolithic carbon electrodes for capacitive deionization. Capacitive deionization technology (CDT) is a new method for purifying ocean and brackish well water. In this process, a constant voltage is applied between two porous carbon electrodes, and soluble salts are collected on their surface, thus purifying the water. The operating costs of CDT are roughly half those of reverse osmosis, the current system of choice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obtaining a reliable and plentiful supply of clean water is becoming a worldwide problem. From this work, society (both in the U.S. and worldwide) will benefit from an inexpensive method of producing potable water from large existing reserves of brackish (saline) water. Inexpensive mesoporous carbon electrodes could also be used in capacitive deionization for industrial processes such as boiler feed, as well as in electrical energy storage, such as in capacitive energy storage.</AbstractNarration>
