    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests partial travel support for ten junior investigators to attend the Conference on Collective Motion in Nuclei Under Extreme Conditions (COMEX 1) to be held in Paris from June 10-13, 2003. COMEX 1 is the seventh conference of the Giant Resonance series as well as the&lt;br/&gt;beginning of a new series that will provide the appropriate forum of discussion for the nuclear structure physics community. The conference will cover new experimental and theoretical developments in the study of collective excitations in unstable nuclei and in nuclei at high temperature or angular momentum. The conference organizers have committed funds to cover the local costs for ten junior investigators from the U.S. The requested funds will support half the travel costs for ten students who would make important and valuable contributions to the conference, but who would not be able to participate without financial assistance.</AbstractNarration>
