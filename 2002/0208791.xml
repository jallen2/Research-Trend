    <AbstractNarration>Mixing in turbulent flows play an essential role in diverse engineering&lt;br/&gt;applications. Beneficial non-equilibrium dynamics impact on engine&lt;br/&gt;efficiency, durability, stability, and emissions, on reduced drag in&lt;br/&gt;aircrafts and in naval vessels. The unique focus of this research is on&lt;br/&gt;feedback regulation of active mixing control. Technical challenges are&lt;br/&gt;an outgrowth of the complexity and sensitivity of fluid dynamic systems,&lt;br/&gt;and require an integrated approach to modeling, information technology,&lt;br/&gt;control theory, algorithm development, and software and hardware&lt;br/&gt;implementation. Modeling will focus on dominant coherent structures,&lt;br/&gt;periodicity, and concepts of Hamiltonian energy. Those provide also&lt;br/&gt;possibilities for efficient parallel implementation on an embedded&lt;br/&gt;system. Intended models will range from lumped point vortex models, to&lt;br/&gt;purely phenomenologically derived I/O correlations of main structures.&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid models arise naturally as a design framework, subject to (nearly)&lt;br/&gt;periodic vortex generation and elimination. On a finer time scale,&lt;br/&gt;hybrid models will be used as a means to parallelize spatially&lt;br/&gt;distributed control and observer implementation. This project includes&lt;br/&gt;collaborations with industry, government and academe. If successful,&lt;br/&gt;this high risk-high yield undertaking will include both technology&lt;br/&gt;transition in critical applications and developments of integrated&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems and control design methods for interesting classes of&lt;br/&gt;complex, nonlinear systems.</AbstractNarration>
