    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the purchase of a continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer, which is essential in the synthesis of novel organic magnetic materials and is valuable in the characterization of other magnetic materials. The EPR spectrometer system will replace the current 20+ year-old X-band EPR instrument that is no longer functional. The superior capabilities of this new EPR spectrometer will be tailored to materials research in magnetism, which will complement existing bulk magnetic measurement capabilities based upon superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry/susceptometry. This new spectrometer will have a significant impact on the following projects: (1) synthesis of organic polymer magnets with stability at ambient conditions; (2) coordinating organic ligands with a few unpaired electrons (high-spin organic molecules) for new organometallic magnets with improved ordering temperatures; (3) organic molecules for potential magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents and radical ions of molecules and polymers with chiral p -conjugated systems; and (4) inorganic metal-based magnets, transition metal complexes, magnetic nanostructures and films. &lt;br/&gt;The results of the indicated projects will be disseminated in the peer review journals, conference presentations, and web-based publications. In particular, the significant progress toward practical organic polymer magnet is expected to attract wide attention, promoting better understanding of basic research in materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research activities will advance fundamental understanding of magnetic materials and may have a significant impact on the future electronic technology through the development of soft magnets based upon conjugated organic polymers. The EPR spectrometer is indispensable in the training and education of students and postdoctoral associates in the interdisciplinary area of organic magnetism. The spectrometer will make possible a more advanced computer-controlled operation that will facilitate the training of undergraduate and graduate students. The overall infrastructure for materials research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will be enhanced, which will benefit other researchers studying magnetic films, nanostructures, and metal-based inorganic magnets and complexes.</AbstractNarration>
