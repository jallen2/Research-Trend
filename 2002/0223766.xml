    <AbstractNarration>Recent advances in telecommunications, materials nanotechnology and biology have potential implications in the area of control. The purpose of this workshop is to define the generic methodological research needs pursuant to these advances as: (1) they will involve a more detailed description of nature, down to the cellular and molecular level, and (2) the next set of engineering systems will be of a larger size and their complexity will be far greater than in the past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is for support of a multidisciplinary workshop that will address the research needs in the areas of Modeling, Dynamics, Control and Monitoring of Complex Engineering Systems. It will take place in Anchorage Alaska on May 11 and 12 following the American Control Conference. By scheduling it to follow immediately after the ACC, the cost will be substantially lower since most of the participants will already be on site and the meeting rooms on Saturday will be free. The organization of the workshop aims to avoid the segregation of issues and challenges along the traditional Engineering disciplines. A systematic effort will be undertaken to consider issues that are common to all engineering fields and breakout sessions will have participants that cover all engineering disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
