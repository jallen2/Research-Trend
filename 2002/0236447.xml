    <AbstractNarration>This grant will partially support for a 3-day workshop on using operations research to improve health care delivery. Approximately 40-50 participants will meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, September 25-27, 2002. A number of recent conferences, including an NSF workshop in Atlanta and one sponsored by the National Academy of Engineering, both in 2001, documented the opportunities for engineering to contribute to improving the quality and efficiency of health care delivery. This workshop would bring together experts from the health care and operations research communities to identify critical research issues that can drive operational improvements in health care delivery systems. The workshop would be jointly hosted by the University of Michigan which is a leader in both medical and health care research.</AbstractNarration>
