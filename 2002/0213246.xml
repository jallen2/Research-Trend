    <AbstractNarration>This study will utilize high-resolution analysis of cores from closed-basin lakes in the northern Great Plains to determine the frequency, intensity, duration, periodicity, and synchrony of droughts during the Holocene and to examine how vegetation and fire responded to drought. Since vegetation and lakes in the Northern Great Plains are highly sensitive to drought, this region offers an extraordinary opportunity to document decadal- to-century scale climate cycles in the mid-continental United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The working hypothesis is that the signal of drought from a single site is regional and that droughts were synchronous across the region. To test this hypothesis, the study will utilize lake-sediment mineralogy, fossil pollen, carbon isotopes of charcoal, and charcoal abundance to develop detailed reconstruction of drought cycles from the Northern Great Plains at a decadal scale. This will facilitate evaluation of the teleconnections between mid-continental climate and the North Atlantic region, where recent investigations have linked century to millennial scale climate oscillations to variations in solar irradiance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential for broad impact in range of physical and social sciences. Assessment of drought impacts forecast by atmospheric models for the Northern Great Plains requires understanding of natural drought variability. Evidence from paleoscience suggests that 20th century droughts (e.g., the Dust Bowl) do not provide perspective on the range of severe droughts that have occurred in even the recent past. Historical evidence is incomplete and paleoscience data have not yet been assembled at appropriate temporal and spatial scales to assess the intensity, periodicity, and impacts of past droughts.</AbstractNarration>
