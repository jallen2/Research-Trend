    <AbstractNarration>0210936&lt;br/&gt;Malek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:&lt;br/&gt;This award is for support of a joint research project by Dr. R. I. Malek, Materials Research Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University (PSU), University Park, Pennsylvania and Dr. Gamal Kamh, Geology Department, Menoufia University, Shebeen El-Kom, Egypt. The objective of this research is to provide database on compositions of new restoration mortars and preservation procedure for old structures. The two scientists plan to investigate deterioration mechanisms. They will determine the compositions of new mortars that are relevant to the causes of deterioration and that are compatible with host structures as well as the use of new binders. They will diagnose the causes of damage using chemical analysis, ultrasonic spectroscopy, x-ray and Magic Angle Spinning NMR, color hue, porosity, and elasticity moduli at PSU. They will try several new binders including cement grout, geopolymers, cement/organic polymer blends, and phosphate-based binders. They will perform characterization of the binders to ensure their longevity and compatibility with the host structure. They will include geopolymers, which have an advantage as repair material in trapping salts due to the difference in charge between Aluminum and Silicates in the framework. They will test phosphate binders, which have the advantage of trapping salts and being color adjustable and are dimensionally stable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: &lt;br/&gt;The two collaborating investigators have complementary research background experiences. Dr. Malek has considerable experience in cementitious materials and their degradation and repair. Dr. Kamh has experience in modes of deterioration of historic buildings under natural weathering conditions and due to human activity causes. They will combine their experiences and using the laboratory resources at PSU for the study of the practical aspects of restoration and preservation of ancient buildings and monuments. The two will exchange visits PI will visit, first to Egypt for the field study and then to PSU for the laboratory analysis. Graduate students at both institutes will be involved in the field and laboratory research. The experience these students gain in the restoration and preservation science may help them further their career goals. Relevant educational materials will be prepared and used as a seed for a new curriculum on science and technology of restoration and preservation to further students' education. This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems.</AbstractNarration>
