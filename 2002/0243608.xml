    <AbstractNarration>0243608 Kujawski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Western Michigan University to provide a summer research experience in computer-aided testing and simulation of mechanical components and systems for ten undergraduate students each year. This program will take a multidisciplinary approach utilizing experimental and numerical techniques to provide a research experience that encourages students to consider graduate studies and pursue careers in engineering research. Students will be recruited from colleges in the Great Lakes region and also nationwide, with a special focus on students that do not have access to research opportunities at their home institution and students from underrepresented groups. Activities will include a short course on computer-aided testing and simulation; an ethics workshop; an evaluation program; and other related professional and social activities that will allow a fuller appreciation of research opportunities and careers in academia. This REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.</AbstractNarration>
