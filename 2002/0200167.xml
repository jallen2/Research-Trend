    <AbstractNarration>Determinants of Toeplitz matrices have arisen in many branches&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics and physics. For example, they describe the&lt;br/&gt;spin correlation between two sites in the classical Ising&lt;br/&gt;model of a two-dimensional magnet. More recently, they have&lt;br/&gt;been used to describe statistical properties of random &lt;br/&gt;matrices, whose eigenvalues model complicated systems. &lt;br/&gt;The asymptotic behavior of determinants of Toeplitz matrices&lt;br/&gt;is described using the Strong Szego-Limit Theorem and its&lt;br/&gt;generalizations. Recently, this theorem was improved in the&lt;br/&gt;sense that a new identity was found for the determinant that&lt;br/&gt;allows one to find very good estimates for the error in the&lt;br/&gt;Szego expansion of the determinant. The major purpose of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to extend this identity to other classes of&lt;br/&gt;matrices and operators. This has applications such as finding &lt;br/&gt;the distributions of linear statistics in random matrix theory,&lt;br/&gt;as well as finding the level spacing of the eigenvalues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many physical systems possess such complicated behavior that&lt;br/&gt;exact predictions become impossible, so instead average&lt;br/&gt;properties of these systems are studied. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;energy level of a particle of a compound nucleus in a slow&lt;br/&gt;nuclear reaction has complicated unpredictable behavior.&lt;br/&gt;Random matrix theory provides mathematical models that allow&lt;br/&gt;a simulation of the energy levels of the particle. &lt;br/&gt;One of the tools that is used to study the statistical behavior &lt;br/&gt;of the random matrices and thus of the energy levels, &lt;br/&gt;is a determinant of a Toeplitz matrix. A determinant is a &lt;br/&gt;number that yields important information about a square &lt;br/&gt;array of numbers. These Toeplitz determinants occur in many&lt;br/&gt;branches of applied mathematics. One classical use was to&lt;br/&gt;study the properties of models of two-dimensional (or very&lt;br/&gt;thin) magnets. Determinants are often hard to compute.&lt;br/&gt;However, there is a result, called the Strong Szego Limit&lt;br/&gt;Theorem, which yields an estimate for such a determinant.&lt;br/&gt;Recently, this estimate was improved so that error terms&lt;br/&gt;could be calculated more easily. One major goal of the&lt;br/&gt;project is to extend these results to other classes of&lt;br/&gt;determinants. This will yield information about the energy&lt;br/&gt;levels of complicated systems in other types of models, &lt;br/&gt;not covered by the Toeplitz case.</AbstractNarration>
