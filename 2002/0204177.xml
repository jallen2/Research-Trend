    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0204177. PI: Peter Petersen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to investigate manifolds with integral curvature bounds as opposed &lt;br/&gt;to the usual pointwise curvature bounds. Many traditional results carry over, &lt;br/&gt;but people do not have a complete picture of what can go wrong with the weaker &lt;br/&gt;curvature assumptions. The second and main part of the proposal addresses the specific &lt;br/&gt;but very hard question of which 3-sphere bundles over the 4-sphere have positive curvature. &lt;br/&gt;Only one of these spaces, namely the 7-sphere, is know to have positive curvature. &lt;br/&gt;We expect that several exotic spheres of this type have positive curvature and also that &lt;br/&gt;we will get some interesting infinite families of manifolds in dimensions 6 and 7 out of&lt;br/&gt;this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is proposing to work on two separate projects. The first deals with gleaning &lt;br/&gt;information from objects where one has fuzzy rather than specific assumptions about &lt;br/&gt;how they curve. The PI has already established some interesting results in this direction, &lt;br/&gt;but much is still unknown. The second and more ambitious part is an investigation of &lt;br/&gt;how round one can make twisted objects. Here one imagines a sphere as perfectly round and&lt;br/&gt; untwisted. There are no intuitive examples in the dimensions that can be visualized,&lt;br/&gt; but in dimension 7 there apear to be several objects which are not spheres but still &lt;br/&gt;could be fairly round. A positive solution to this problem would solve one very prominent &lt;br/&gt;problem and two lesser known problems.</AbstractNarration>
