    <AbstractNarration>Proposal number: 0212778&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2000 Gordon Research on Membranes: Materials and Processes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports partially the participation by invited speakers and discussion leaders from academic institutions at the Gordon Conference on Membranes to be held in New London, NH, from August 4 to August 9, 2002. The sessions scheduled for this year's conference include polymer membranes, inorganic membranes, fuel-cell membranes, mixed-media membranes, and biomedical applications as well as industry-university-government and international collaborations in the field. In each session there will be two or three invited speakers. Poster sessions are also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Conferences are kept small and are structured to give the participants considerable time for discussion and interaction. They provide a vehicle for communication between research groups, which will be represented here by researchers not only from U.S. universities but also from industry and universities in Europe and Japan. This grant is specifically targeted to permit attendance by twenty advanced-level graduate students and post-docs at the conference.</AbstractNarration>
