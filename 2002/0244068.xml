    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0244068 Date: 1-07-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Anderson Institution: Virginia Polytechnic &lt;br/&gt; Inst. &amp; St. University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University for the summers of 2003-2005. Mark R. Anderson is the site's program director. Ten students will carry out research with faculty and research groups in the chemistry department for ten weeks. Student recruitment will focus on small colleges and underrepresented groups in Virginia and other Appalachian states. The program will have a research focus on physical and physical-analytical chemistry. It will emphasize undergraduate research projects that make extensive use of modern spectroscopic and analytic methods. The students will participate in a nine-week lecture series. They will present their results at a mini-symposium at the conclusion of the program.</AbstractNarration>
