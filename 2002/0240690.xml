    <AbstractNarration>The need for a technology roadmap for the capital projects industry has been a matter of discussion at many board meetings of corporations and industry organizations in recent years: it is part of the FIAPP (Fully Integrated and Automated Project Processes) Steering Committee's charter to desighn and develop a technology roadmap for the industry. Since October 2001, a technology roadmap has been evolving to define a comprehensive technology research and development agenda, based on input from experienced, forward-thinking technical and business professionals from various parts of the capital projects industry. The roadmap serves to identify critical technology needs that crosscut all sectors of the industry as well as the requirements for focused R&amp;D to meet those challenges. This small award recognizes the criticality of engaging the academic community at this stage in the development of the Roadmap R&amp;D plans through financial support to academics to encourage them to attend FIATECH's Capital Projects Integrated Technology Roadmap Workshop in October .</AbstractNarration>
