    <AbstractNarration>NER: Massively Parallel Electron Photoemitter Micro-arrays for Nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;Lithography, Imaging and Inspection Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Present electron-beam lithography, imaging and inspection systems&lt;br/&gt;are limited to serial scanning of patterns with only one beam. As a&lt;br/&gt;result the ability of such systems to scan substantial areas at&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale resolution with practical throughput is not possible. However&lt;br/&gt;if such machines were to scan using a massively parallel array of&lt;br/&gt;independently modulated beams, the resultant parallelism would make&lt;br/&gt;possible not only significantly improved throughput for conventional&lt;br/&gt;applications in the nanoscale environment but also enable faster device&lt;br/&gt;development by software changeable patterns. However at this time there&lt;br/&gt;is no practical multiple-beam electron emitter source available that&lt;br/&gt;will meet system-level performance and reliability requirements. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of the proposed research is to prove feasibility of photocathode&lt;br/&gt;microarrays for massively parallel and independently modulated electron&lt;br/&gt;sources. A key deliverable of the research will be a fabricated&lt;br/&gt;individually gated array of sources with sufficient emission current&lt;br/&gt;density to expose a line of electron sensitive resist 5 to 100nm in&lt;br/&gt;width.&lt;br/&gt; The successful demonstration of feasibility for photocathode&lt;br/&gt;massively parallel microarrays will require a stable, low noise and&lt;br/&gt;reproducible photocathode and a viable scheme for fabrication and&lt;br/&gt;independently modulating the current in each beam. As a result the work&lt;br/&gt;will focus on two key aspects. First the extension of our previous work&lt;br/&gt;to develop a thin film stack photocathode and pretreatments that will&lt;br/&gt;provide the emission stability and intensity necessary and second to&lt;br/&gt;examine schemes for producing microarrays using such photoemitters.&lt;br/&gt; Photoelectron source arrays will make nanoscale lithography and&lt;br/&gt;rapid e-beam review testing possible. Lithography and testing on the&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale are necessary if the manufacturing at this scale for&lt;br/&gt;microelectronic devices, sensors and electrical- mechanical systems is&lt;br/&gt;to become as high in yield and rapid as sub-micron fabrication is&lt;br/&gt;today.</AbstractNarration>
