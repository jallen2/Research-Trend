    <AbstractNarration>We propose to investigate a n mber of topics,including:&lt;br/&gt;Hard Pion Electroproduction. We will calculate high transverse momentum semi-exclusive&lt;br/&gt;pion electroproduction,considering especially the higher twist process where the pions are pro-&lt;br/&gt;duced directly and appear kinematically isolated,but including leading twist (where the pions&lt;br/&gt;are produced by parton fragmentation and appear as part of a jet)and estimates of soft pro-&lt;br/&gt;cesses.The direct and leading twist processes allow data to yield information about the quark&lt;br/&gt;and gluon distributions in the target.Two particular new items are to do electroproduction&lt;br/&gt;rather than photoproduction and to include initial state parton transverse momentum.An ap-&lt;br/&gt;plication is to see if the higher twist process are relevant to data from HERMES,and possibly&lt;br/&gt;Hall B data from Je .erson Lab,where there is considerable interest in the result.&lt;br/&gt;Dipions and the Polarization of Gluons. HERMES has measured dipions photoproduced&lt;br/&gt;with polarized photons o .polarized targets,which has given the .rst determination of the po-&lt;br/&gt;larization of gluons in the proton.The published result depends heavily upon the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;analysis,in turn heavily based on program packages that are tuned to higher energies.We&lt;br/&gt;propose what we believe is a necessary independent calculation the contributions of the vari-&lt;br/&gt;ous processes (photon-gluon fusion,QCD Compton,and vector meson dominance (VMD)),in&lt;br/&gt;particular to see the sensitivity of the results to di .ering fragmentation models,initial state&lt;br/&gt;transverse momentum,and di .ering estimates of the VMD contribution.&lt;br/&gt;The Deuteron Form Factor. The only perturbative QCD calculation of the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;deuteron form factor lies well below the data,but strikingly omits the short range wave functions&lt;br/&gt;that provide for hidden color states.We have recently developed ways to manipulate 6-quark&lt;br/&gt;cluster wave functions that model these components.We propose to calculate the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;form factor with wave functions including a hidden color component,to see the e .ect of the&lt;br/&gt;hidden color components upon the magnitude of the result.&lt;br/&gt;Bringing Perturbative QCD to Lower Momentum Transfers. We will study formal and&lt;br/&gt;applied aspects of relations between the Breit and light-front helicity amplitudes,next-to-leading&lt;br/&gt;power corrections to the high momentum transfer behavior of those amplitudes,and application&lt;br/&gt;of discrete symmetries to light-front amplitudes.The formal results can allow s,for example,to&lt;br/&gt;.nd constraints that approximations to the subdominant helicity amplitudes must obey (which&lt;br/&gt;are not always realized in the literature).More positively,we can se the formal results to guide&lt;br/&gt;investigation of how non-leading powers can be parameterized and see,again for example,how&lt;br/&gt;and where the N .(1232)transition may approach the perturbative QCD results.&lt;br/&gt;Phenomenology of Noncommutative Field Theory. Following up on an earlier research&lt;br/&gt;path,we would like to complete the set of Feynman rules for the Lorentz conserving noncom-&lt;br/&gt;mutative .eld theory and .nd the signatures of noncommutative spacetime for a selection of&lt;br/&gt;processes in addition to fAfA elastic scattering.Also we would like to consider ways to do Lorentz&lt;br/&gt;conserving noncommutative .eld theory with operator algebras in addition to the contracted&lt;br/&gt;Snyder algebra we have worked out so far.&lt;br/&gt;NSF Review Criteria. Intellectual merit of the proposed activity:Most of the activity is at&lt;br/&gt;the forefront of modern hadronic physics,and the rest is at the forefront of the phenomenology&lt;br/&gt;of an interesting direction in particle physics.The projects will lead to many publications&lt;br/&gt;in the leading refereed journals.Broader impacts of the proposed activity:The projects will&lt;br/&gt;help bridge the gap between hadronic theory and observed phenomena,and lead to greater&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the mechanisms of hadronic reactions.They will also train new students,&lt;br/&gt;including undergraduates.The PI has had two successful women Ph.D.students,and the&lt;br/&gt;present project may extend opportunities for women entering the .eld.The PI is regularly at&lt;br/&gt;the Je .erson Laboratory and bridging the gap between university and national lab as well as&lt;br/&gt;between data and theory.</AbstractNarration>
