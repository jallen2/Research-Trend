    <AbstractNarration>PI Name: Earl H. Dowell&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Duke University &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0218601 &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: ITR:Novel Hybrid {Discrete/Continuous} Computational Models for Very High Dimensional Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: From the Molecular to the Continuum Scale&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This ITR research and educational project is in an application area at the intersection of Information Technology and an engineering/science discipline. Work is proposed that will develop computational models of complex nonlinear dynamical systems that are often encountered in nanoscale phenomena and devices such as biological and polymer materials that are currently being studied experimentally with Atomic Force Microscopes. The principal goal is to develop a hybrid discrete/continuum model that will reduce by orders of magnitude the number of degrees of freedom needed to describe the system without any essential loss of information. &lt;br/&gt;The research will be complemented by an educational plan that includes a newly developed course, "Dynamics of Very High Dimensional Systems", the writing of a new textbook/monograph of that same title and the mentoring of a post-doc and undergraduate student who will assist with the research and the new course.</AbstractNarration>
