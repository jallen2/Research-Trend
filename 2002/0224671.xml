    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0224671&lt;br/&gt;Jeffrey T. Clark&lt;br/&gt;Brian M. Slator&lt;br/&gt;North Dakota State University - Fargo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE RR: Advancing Vidualization Projects Through the Use of High-Performance Virtual Reality Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal from an EPSCoR state, fostering development in computer visualization research, aims at acquiring equipment to support North Dakota's State University Archeological Technologies Lab. The research involves the use of compelling digital visualization experiences and authentic simulated virtual worlds to support the following projects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Virtual reconstruction of Like-a-Fishhook Village (to be displayed at the Heritage Center - state museum - in Bismarck and the Cultural Center of Three Affiliated Tribes in New Town),&lt;br/&gt;2. Virtual reconstruction of On-a-Slant Village (for display at the Fort Abraham Lincoln Museum in Mandan), and&lt;br/&gt;3. Immersive virtual environment of a Native American powwow-dancing competition for use in diabetes prevention in Native American youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An SGI Reality Center as a state-or-the-art technology augmentation to current NDSU facility and computer visualization capabilities will contribute to the virtual reconstructions of the villages and the computer simulation game for diabetes education. The work facilitates projects in archeology, anthropology, and museology. Expecting to develop and host a variety of virtual 3D environments at the highest levels and to send the virtual worlds to multiple remote location for concurrent display, the equipment and requisite software systems will constitute a qualitative leap in the capabilities to share high-detail 3D content for both research and education.</AbstractNarration>
