    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for advanced tribo-systems with wear resistant sliding interfaces pervades current technology, emerging technology, and much of the technology of the foreseeable future. Whether in the foreground, as in the design of high-temperature gas turbine engines, the development of highly reliable navigational and tracking systems, and the performance of magnetic storage devices, or in the background, as used in fusion reactors, tribology of sliding interfaces play a critical role in the success of the technology. Better understanding of the physics of material interaction under these harsh conditions is expected to lead to the development of more efficient tribo-systems would benefit our society in many ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed investigation we seek to capitalize on our experience gained during the development of the plate-impact pressure-shear friction experiments and the torsional Kolsky bar friction experiments, to better understand the behavior of technologically important material interfaces under extreme conditions. Key modifications will be made to these configurations in order to provide a more direct access to the frictional interface such that local critical interfacial quantities can be directly measured by using high-speed digital photography and thermal imaging systems. In this way, these experiments will not only provide information on quantities such as interfacial tractions and slip history, but also on key local thermo-mechanical interactions in the vicinity of the tribological interface. Interfacial quantities of interest include but are not limited to local plastic strains, plastic strain rates, temperature profiles, details of formation and growth of third body, kinetics of formation and growth of molten interfacial layers, and the details of slip-waves generated during the intense local thermo-mechanical interactions at the tribo-pair interface. Detailed optical and scanning electron microscopy along with the atomic force microscope will be used to examine the micro- and/or nano- changes in the topology of the tribo-pair surfaces during the slip process. In addition, X-ray diffraction and flourescence (EDS) will be employed to contribute to our understanding of the changes in the microstructure and transfer of material during the complex chemical/mechanical interactions that occur at and near the sliding interfaces. Along with the experimental study finite element simulations of the experiments will be conducted to correlate the experimental observations with our present state of understanding of the high-speed slip phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach is innovative and novel and entails considerable experimental and computational challenges. It represents a marked departure from experimental procedures to investigate dynamic friction in the past. The proposed is expected to contribute significantly towards strengthening our national capability by (a) contributing to the development of an experimental methodology for characterization of high speed sliding behavior under extreme conditions, (b) extending our present state of understanding of critical mechanisms operative during high-speed slip at technologically important material interfaces, and (c) by training graduate students at the interface of solid mechanics and materials science in technologically important areas.</AbstractNarration>
