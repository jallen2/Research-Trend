    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number DMS-0203072&lt;br/&gt;PI: Laszlo Lempert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two components. One concerns complex analysis&lt;br/&gt;on infinite dimensional manifolds, and the proposed problems &lt;br/&gt;are mostly cohomological in nature. They center around the&lt;br/&gt;computation of Dolbeault and sheaf cohomology groups. Two types&lt;br/&gt;of manifolds will be investigated: loop spaces of finite&lt;br/&gt;dimensional compact complex manifolds and Stein manifolds. One&lt;br/&gt;(longer term) goal will be to prove a Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch&lt;br/&gt;type index theorem on loop spaces, another to discover an&lt;br/&gt;appropriate class of sheaves for which cohomology can be proved&lt;br/&gt;to vanish on infinite dimensional Stein manifolds (generalization&lt;br/&gt;of the notion of coherent sheaves). I will also work on solving&lt;br/&gt;the inhomogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equations in pseudoconvex&lt;br/&gt;domains in Hilbert spaces. The finite dimensional component is&lt;br/&gt;about extending the concept of holomorphic motion from the &lt;br/&gt;complex plane to motions of higher dimensional complex manifolds&lt;br/&gt;and their subsets. This will hopefully provide a useful tool for&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensional complex dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics in general elucidates the formal structures&lt;br/&gt;that underlie the exploration of our world. An example of&lt;br/&gt;such a structure is a function, which formalizes the notion&lt;br/&gt;of "dependence" among variable quantities. For instance&lt;br/&gt;temperature at some location on Earth depends on the&lt;br/&gt;latitude and the longitude of the location, but also on&lt;br/&gt;the altitude, and the time of the measurement: we have a function&lt;br/&gt;of four variables. In another context, the temperature of say&lt;br/&gt;a mole of a gas depends on the velocity of each molecule of the&lt;br/&gt;gas, thus on trillions and trillions of variables. Functions&lt;br/&gt;of such a huge number of variables are best understood by&lt;br/&gt;idealizing to infinitely many variables. These are the main&lt;br/&gt;objects of the proposed research: functions of infinitely&lt;br/&gt;many variables. The variables are complex rather than real&lt;br/&gt;numbers. Introducing complex variables typically streamlines&lt;br/&gt;problems, and having solved the complexified problem one can&lt;br/&gt;often go back and obtain, by restriction, a solution to the&lt;br/&gt;original real problem. The problems to be considered are partly&lt;br/&gt;motivated by various mathematical disciplines, and also by&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics.</AbstractNarration>
