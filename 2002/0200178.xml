    <AbstractNarration>PI: John Mallet-Paret, Brown University&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200178&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose a fundamental study of qualitative properties of various classes&lt;br/&gt;of nonlinear dynamical systems, in particular as they arise from differential&lt;br/&gt;and difference equations. Among the systems to be considered are those from&lt;br/&gt;ordinary and partial differential equations, systems of lattice differential&lt;br/&gt;equations (that is, spatially discrete systems), differential delay equations,&lt;br/&gt;and nonlinear maps on cones. Issues such as existence of equilibria and their&lt;br/&gt;stability, spontaneous formation of spatial patterns and spatial chaos, and&lt;br/&gt;existence and qualitative properties of traveling fronts, will be studied for&lt;br/&gt;these equations. In addition to established techniques (both theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and numerical) from differential equations and dynamical systems, a significant&lt;br/&gt;portion of the proposed research involves the development and implementation&lt;br/&gt;of new tools and techniques with which to study these systems. Among the&lt;br/&gt;techniques to be employed are those involving singular perturbations,&lt;br/&gt;invariant manifolds, exponential dichotomies, and topological methods (Morse&lt;br/&gt;decompositions, fixed point theorems, degree theory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are developing new mathematical techniques for analyzing and understanding&lt;br/&gt;differential equations and difference equations which arise as models in&lt;br/&gt;various areas of science. Very broadly, these types of mathematical systems&lt;br/&gt;model time-dependent or evolutionary behavior, as it occurs in a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of scientific areas, including biology, chemistry, electrical circuit theory,&lt;br/&gt;image processing, and material science. While this is a very broad scope of&lt;br/&gt;inquiry, the specific problems to be studied exhibit features in common --&lt;br/&gt;spontaneous formation of patterns, self-sustained oscillations, regulation by&lt;br/&gt;internal feedback (often with time delays) -- which can be analyzed with some&lt;br/&gt;of the basic tools of dynamical systems theory. It is expected the resulting&lt;br/&gt;mathematical advances arising from these studies will increase the knowledge&lt;br/&gt;of and will provide insight into both the abstract theory of dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems and the scientific areas of inquiry.</AbstractNarration>
