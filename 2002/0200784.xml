    <AbstractNarration>PI: Yu Yuan, University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200784&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of a priori estimates and solvability for fully nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;equations with the convexity condition are well developed. While other&lt;br/&gt;concrete equations like Isaacs equations from the stochastic optimal&lt;br/&gt;control theory and special Lagrangian equations from calibration geometry&lt;br/&gt;do not have the usual convexity condition. Only preliminary attempts were&lt;br/&gt;made toward this direction in recent years. Though the complex&lt;br/&gt;Monge-Ampere equations have the usual convexity condition, the&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic invariance is too large. There is no theory of a priori&lt;br/&gt;estimates for the complex Monge-Ampere equations with non-smooth&lt;br/&gt;right hand side. This project concentrates on the following four parts. In&lt;br/&gt;part one, the objective is to derive Holder a priori estimates for&lt;br/&gt;finitely piecewise linear Isaacs equations by further employment of the&lt;br/&gt;ideas in recent work. In part two, the attempt is to study the regularity&lt;br/&gt;for general fully nonlinear elliptic equations in 3-d in the light of&lt;br/&gt;recent work that any homogeneous order two solution to fully nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;elliptic equation in 3-d must be linear. In part three, the purpose is to&lt;br/&gt;answer whether any homogeneous order two solution to special Lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;equation of dimension four or higher is trivial. In part four, the aim is&lt;br/&gt;to study the Bernstein problem for complex Monge-Ampere equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differential equations and differential geometry are further applications&lt;br/&gt;of Newton's calculus to the investigation of laws and shapes of nature,&lt;br/&gt;and even some phenomena of our real world. This project deals with some&lt;br/&gt;particular equations, like Isaacs equations from optimal stochastic&lt;br/&gt;control theory, special Lagrangian equations and complex Monge-Ampere&lt;br/&gt;equations from differential geometry. Understanding those equations would&lt;br/&gt;have impacts on not only the related mathematical fields, but also fields&lt;br/&gt;outside mathematics like physics.</AbstractNarration>
