    <AbstractNarration>Block copolymers, comprised of two chemically distinct polymer chains linked together at one end, microphase separate into arrays of ordered nanoscopic features that, in thin films, can be used as scaffolds and templates for the fabrication of sub-micron devices and structures. By developing novel chemistries to synthesize block copolymers, where one of the blocks can be thermally crosslinked and the second block can be decomposed at higher temperatures, the fabrication of templates and scaffolds can be dramatically simplified, opening up new avenues in the manufacture and utilization of nanostructures. It is the intent of this work to develop new block copolymers and fabrication strategies, which will meet the demands of this "one-step" processing goal. In addition, routes will be investigated for the fuctionalization of these nanostructures and to enhance the lateral ordering of thin films of the block copolymers so that each element can be quantitatively described in terms of its lateral position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated collaboration between academic and industrial institutions described in this proposal has the potential to provide a unique opportunity for enhancing the career development of students and postdoctoral fellows. Close interaction with industry will also help guide the academic research towards real-world goals, while at the same time facilitating technology transfer to industry. By performing cross-disciplinary research at both institutions, the students in this program will also develop fundamental skills in the synthesis, characterization and physics of polymeric materials and in the generation of well-defined nanoscopic structures. As a consequence, they will be better prepared for a multi-disciplinary industrial or academic career in materials science. The total educational experience gained by performing research at these two premier institutions will therefore far exceed that possible in a single academic environment. The utilization of x-ray and neutron facilities at national laboratories will further enhance the development of the researchers, exposing them to a third different research setting while at the same time integrating the program into a much larger national and international endeavor. The research environments of each of these institutions have strong, well-recognized efforts in the development of a diverse workforce and this program will draw on both efforts to promote the education and training of female and under-represented minority students.</AbstractNarration>
