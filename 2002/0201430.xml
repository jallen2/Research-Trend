    <AbstractNarration>PI: Lawrence A. Fialkow, SUNY New Paltz&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0201430&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research concerns an approach to the multidimensional truncated power &lt;br/&gt;moment problem based on an extension theory for the associated moment matrix. &lt;br/&gt;When this matrix admits an infinite, positive, finite rank moment matrix &lt;br/&gt;extension, this approach yields an explicit formula for a finitely atomic &lt;br/&gt;representing measure supported on the joint spectrum of a normal tuple of &lt;br/&gt;operators corresponding to the extension. The aim of this research is to &lt;br/&gt;determine concrete conditions on the moment data which permit the desired &lt;br/&gt;extension. Much of this research concerns, specifically, the multivariable &lt;br/&gt;truncated K-moment problem, where the support of a representing measure is &lt;br/&gt;required to be contained in a prescribed closed set K. For K an algebraic &lt;br/&gt;variety, this research concerns a new conjecture for solving the moment problem &lt;br/&gt;in terms of concrete algebraic and geometric invariants closely related to the &lt;br/&gt;moment data. For K semi-algebraic, this research seeks to apply the abstract &lt;br/&gt;solution of the truncated K-moment problem due to Curto-Fialkow to specific &lt;br/&gt;semi-algebraic sets such as the closed unit disk. A direct application of this &lt;br/&gt;study concerns the multidimensional cubature problem in Numerical Analysis. By &lt;br/&gt;applying the moment matrix extension technique in the context of cubature, this &lt;br/&gt;research seeks to construct minimal cubature rules for sets such as the disk, &lt;br/&gt;square, triangle, or annulus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One aspect of this research, the Quadrature Problem, concerns the efficient &lt;br/&gt;measurement of the size of an irregular area, or the measurement of the weight &lt;br/&gt;of a volume whose density is unevenly distributed. We seek to identify a small &lt;br/&gt;number of test points (or nodes) within the body in such a way that by measuring &lt;br/&gt;the density just at these few points, we may closely approximate the overall &lt;br/&gt;size or weight of the body. In the case of a linear body, such as a thin rod, &lt;br/&gt;the quadrature problem was solved with the fewest number of test points by the &lt;br/&gt;mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), using a technique now known as &lt;br/&gt;Gaussian Quadrature. At the present time, surprisingly few minimal-node &lt;br/&gt;quadrature rules are known for shapes in the plane or in 3-dimensional space, &lt;br/&gt;even for basic sets such as a disk or sphere. In order to study the Quadrature &lt;br/&gt;Problem, we actually study a more general problem, the Multidimensional &lt;br/&gt;Truncated Moment Problem. Many real-world systems can be described by a sequence &lt;br/&gt;of physical attributes called moments, such as mass, weight, momentum, etc., &lt;br/&gt;which relate to the physical space underlying the system. The truncated moment &lt;br/&gt;problem asks whether a system is uniquely determined by its sequence of moments, &lt;br/&gt;and also whether the moments of a system can be computed by studying the system &lt;br/&gt;at just a finite number of nodes in the underlying space. In this research, we &lt;br/&gt;develop algorithms for recognizing when such a sequence of nodes exists, and for &lt;br/&gt;efficiently computing them. In this way, we may describe a system in terms of &lt;br/&gt;just a finite number of points in the underlying space.</AbstractNarration>
