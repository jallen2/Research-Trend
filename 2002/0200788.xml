    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT: Tomography and Integral Geometry &lt;br/&gt;PI: Eric Todd Quinto, Tufts University&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200788&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Quinto will pursue problems in tomography and the mathematical analysis of Radon&lt;br/&gt;transforms. He will develop and refine singularity detection algorithms (including limited data Lambda CT and wavelet methods) and apply them to electron microscopy and limited data industrial and medical X-ray tomography, with the goal of testing the algorithms on&lt;br/&gt;real data and using them in scanners. Professor Quinto will continue to develop a boundary detection method that is applicable to Sonar in shallow water, and he will begin to develop these methods for synthetic aperture Radar. The theoretical underpinnings will be based on Professor Quinto's pure mathematical research. Radon transforms have an intimate relation to harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and complex analysis, and he will use integral geometry to prove theorems in these fields. The principal investigator will prove uniqueness and support theorems for Radon transforms defined by spreads of polynomials, including spherical&lt;br/&gt;transforms in Euclidean space and other settings. He and Professor Agranovsky will use these results to characterize zero sets of solutions of the wave equation on crystallographic domains and other sets. Zero sets, where the solution is zero for all time, are important and difficult to characterize. He will prove uniqueness theorems for Radon transforms on spheres and other surfaces and use these to solve Morera and mean value problems on manifolds. He will&lt;br/&gt;prove support theorems for X-ray transforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research encompasses both applied and pure mathematics: tomography and integral geometry. The pure research will be used to develop, understand, and justify the applied&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and the applied problems will motivate much of the pure research. Computed tomography (CT) algorithms will be developed for the nondestructive evaluation of rockets and other objects. The algorithms will allow scientists to detect cracks in rocket bodies, air pockets in rocket fuel, and delaminations in rocket exit cones. Limited data algorithms will be developed for electron microscopy as a part of a joint industrial project. The goal is to produce an algorithm that reliably produces accurate pictures for a SIDEC electron microscope. He will develop pure mathematics that will show how well the algorithms work and where their limitations might show&lt;br/&gt;up. These pure mathematical underpinnings are required to ensure that his (or any other) reconstructions are correct and are not lucky guesses. SONAR data can be modeled as averages over spheres (the spherical wave fronts of the sound) and Professor Quinto will prove&lt;br/&gt;theorems about these averages. He will use these theorems to develop simple algorithms to map the ocean floor and to find boundaries of objects in the ocean and to apply to Radar. This pure mathematics is intriguing in its own right. Professor Quinto will prove theorems about spherical averages which will be used to understand the wave equation (the equation that describes how sound and light behave). The wave equation describes the motion of a drum head, and he will&lt;br/&gt;specify which points on the drum do not move at all. Finally, he will prove theorems he will apply to complex and harmonic analysis, fields in pure mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
