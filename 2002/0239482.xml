    <AbstractNarration>0239482&lt;br/&gt;Johnson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year award supports a first-time sabbatical in Geneva, Bern, and Zurich, Switzerland to investigate the role of bacteria in decomposing pollutants in contaminated soils and waters. The project involves William B. Johnson of the University of Utah and his graduate student and three Swiss researchers. Their research focuses on observations of bacterial attachment-detachment dynamics in well-characterized systems. Using green fluorescence protein methodology, they propose to characterize bacterial cell surface properties and apply this relationship to how bacteria attach and detach themselves through porous media. The attachment-detachment behavior of selected bacterial strains on various surfaces will be examined under different environmental conditions (water velocity, bacterial surface characteristics, substratum surface roughness and solution chemistry). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international cooperative program brings together researchers with complementary expertise. Professor Johnson will perform characterization of bacterial cell surface properties with Dr. Paolo Landini, a microbiologist at the Swiss Institute for Environment Technology. Direct observation of bacterial attachment-detachment dynamics will be examined with Dr. Jaro Ricka of the University of Bern. Interaction and adhesion force profiles will be developed with Dr. Michal Borkovec at the University of Geneva. Understanding of attachment and detachment processes of bacteria in porous media have practical applications in environmental and pollution clean-up, and in particular, could lead to new methods to introduce pollution eating bacteria into contaminated sites.</AbstractNarration>
