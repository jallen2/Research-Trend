    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a process for producing high-aspect ratio boehmite nanoscopic platelets. Boehmite is an inexpensive mineral produced in large volumes as a precursor to alumina catalyst supports. In the project simple and inexpensive methods for modifying the surface of boehmite to render it dispersible in and reactive with a wide variety of polymeric matrices will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;Subtly changing the boehmite synthesis conditions and adding morphology-directing compounds to the reaction mixture will achieve the formation of high &lt;br/&gt;aspect-ratio boehmite platelets. Particle size and shape will routinely be measured by a &lt;br/&gt;combination of x-ray diffraction and light scattering techniques which will, in turn, be verified by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high aspect ratio boehmite developed in this research project will result in dramatic improvements to the barrier properties of its composites, leading to inexpensive nanocomposite barrier films for packaging, paints and coatings. Mechanical properties of composites with high-aspect ratio boehmite platelets are also expected to improve.</AbstractNarration>
