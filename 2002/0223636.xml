    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ATM-0223636&lt;br/&gt;Atlas, David&lt;br/&gt;Unaffiliated Individual&lt;br/&gt;Title: Physics and Remote Sensing of Convective Storms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports research on the microphysics and kinematics of tropical convective storms using archival data from NASA TRMM experiments in Brazil, Florida, and Kwajalein. The data consist of Doppler spectra measured by UHF profiler, polarimetric radar data, and supporting airborne and surface-based meteorological observations. Special attention is given to the relation between the updraft profile in the cloud and the drop-size distributions that evolve through different growth processes. Key questions center on the existence and significance of equilibrium drop-size distributions, established when collision-induced drop breakup is balanced by drop growth, and the interpretation of the so-called balance level where the mean Doppler velocity for vertical viewing is zero. Comparisons will be made between the drop-size distribution measured by profiler and the polarimetric radar measurements. One goal of the study is to improve the ability to measure rainfall rate by radar. Another is to advance precipitation physics by synthesizing the data from a unique combination of observing instruments.</AbstractNarration>
