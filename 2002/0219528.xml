    <AbstractNarration>Qing Huo Liu&lt;br/&gt;Duke University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to develop a novel framework for rapid and accurate processing of&lt;br/&gt;geophysical subsurface measurements in multilayer media. At present, only 2-D mappings&lt;br/&gt;(i.e., the low-resolution images on the ground surface) are available, greatly limiting the target&lt;br/&gt;depth information. Due to the excessive computational demand, previous inverse scattering&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for these sensors have been developed, but only for objects in a homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;background medium. This new computational framework is expected to dramatically improve&lt;br/&gt;the way environmental site characterization is being performed.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will develop rapid and accurate computational algorithms for the process-&lt;br/&gt;ing of some of the arguably most important measurements in environmental site characteriza-&lt;br/&gt;tion and oil exploration, namely electromagnetic induction (EMI), ground penetrating radar&lt;br/&gt;(GPR), surface seismic, and borehole sonic imaging measurements in 3-D heterogeneous,&lt;br/&gt;multilayer media. These algorithms, coupled with large-scale computing and visualization&lt;br/&gt;platforms, form a novel framework for current and future environmental site characterization&lt;br/&gt;where 3-D subsurface structures can be directly investigated, and sensor arrays can be adap-&lt;br/&gt;tively optimized. The main contributions of this research are: (1) Rapid inversion methods&lt;br/&gt;based on accelerated extended Born/Rytov approximations in layered media; (2) High-fidelity&lt;br/&gt;imaging algorithms based on preconditioned contrast source inversion methods in a multi-&lt;br/&gt;layer background; (3) A 3-D imaging and adaptive optimization framework using these fast&lt;br/&gt;inverse scattering algorithms for multi-sensors. These approaches are expected to yield a&lt;br/&gt;high resolution because they account for the important multiple scattering effects that cause&lt;br/&gt;the resolution degradation in previous linear inversion methods. The development of the al-&lt;br/&gt;gorithms for objects embedded in multilayer media represents significant advances in inverse&lt;br/&gt;scattering and its applications in environmental site characterization and oil exploration.</AbstractNarration>
