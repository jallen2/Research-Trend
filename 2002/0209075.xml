    <AbstractNarration>Rinard, Martin&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0209075&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate a new program analysis, interaction&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and a new set of implementation techniques to support&lt;br/&gt;future generations of embedded systems. Instead of executing low-level&lt;br/&gt;code whose sole responsibility is to control a specific piece of&lt;br/&gt;hardware, these future systems will be built in a layered fashion,&lt;br/&gt;with the core control software surrounded by outer layers of software&lt;br/&gt;that integrate the core software and the device that it controls into&lt;br/&gt;a larger integrated, distributed system of devices and users.&lt;br/&gt;The key challenge associated with realizing this vision is the need to&lt;br/&gt;effectively apply implementation mechanisms that enable the outer&lt;br/&gt;layers to share the hardware device without disrupting the actions of&lt;br/&gt;the time and safety critical core code. The economics of developing&lt;br/&gt;large software systems will ensure that most of the outer layers will&lt;br/&gt;consist of standard, off-the-shelf software components from the world&lt;br/&gt;of laptop, desktop, and server computing. The outer layer software&lt;br/&gt;will therefore have been developed to use implementation mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;that are unsuited for use in time-critical control&lt;br/&gt;software. Nevertheless, the core software and the outer layer software&lt;br/&gt;will need to interact. With standard implementation mechanisms,&lt;br/&gt;interactions mediated by objects shared with outer layers could easily&lt;br/&gt;lead to unacceptable delays and a loss of real-time control in the&lt;br/&gt;core.&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is the development and investigation of new&lt;br/&gt;interaction analysis algorithms that extracts the interaction patterns&lt;br/&gt;between the core and outer layers, then uses these patterns to&lt;br/&gt;classify objects into several categories. Each category can then use&lt;br/&gt;an implementation mechanism appropriate for how it is used in the&lt;br/&gt;system. The end result is a system in which the outer layers and core&lt;br/&gt;software effectively cooperate without a loss of safety or&lt;br/&gt;predictability.&lt;br/&gt;The envisioned analysis has several properties that will make it&lt;br/&gt;suitable for this application. First, it is capable of extracting a&lt;br/&gt;meaningful result with an analysis of only part of the program.&lt;br/&gt;Second, it can effectively analyze the multithreaded programs that&lt;br/&gt;come from the integration of the outer layers and the core. Third, the&lt;br/&gt;partial analysis is goal-driven to extract the required information&lt;br/&gt;with an analysis of only those parts of the program required to obtain&lt;br/&gt;the result.</AbstractNarration>
