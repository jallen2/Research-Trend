    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0239316&lt;br/&gt;Van V. Vu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the PI addresses some of the deepest and most&lt;br/&gt;important issues in probabilistic combinatorics, including sharp&lt;br/&gt;concentration inequalities and the semi-random method. The PI and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators plan to develop new sharp concentration inequalities and&lt;br/&gt;apply them, together with the powerful semi-random (Rodl nibble) method&lt;br/&gt;to attack several well-known and long standing conjectures in&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics. Among others, the PI will study a series of minimax&lt;br/&gt;problems in finite geometry, raised in the fifties. Another topic is the&lt;br/&gt;study of geometrical properties of random objects. Here is a typical&lt;br/&gt;question: how many points does one need to pierce n random d-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;boxes, where a random box is obtained as the Cartesian product of d&lt;br/&gt;random subintervals of the unit interval ? The PI also plans to use&lt;br/&gt;methods from probabilistic combinatorics to attack problems arose from&lt;br/&gt;very practical fields such as coding theory and the study of&lt;br/&gt;"real-world" graphs. For educational purposes, he intends to write a&lt;br/&gt;textbook on sharp concentration inequalities and its applications in&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and theoretical computer science. He also plans to design&lt;br/&gt;and teach a graduate course at UCSD on the probabilistic methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last twenty years, probability has become one of the most&lt;br/&gt;powerful weapons in discrete mathematics and computer science. The&lt;br/&gt;first main reason is that randomness helps us to overcome algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;and existence problems which cannot be solved deterministic means. The&lt;br/&gt;second main reason is that many important real-life objects (such as the&lt;br/&gt;internet) can be modeled by a random process. On the other hand, in&lt;br/&gt;many situations, the problems are so complex that traditional results&lt;br/&gt;from probability theory cannot be applied. The PI plans to develop new&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic tools which would have a break-thought impact on many such&lt;br/&gt;problems, some of them have been open for decades. Among others, these&lt;br/&gt;new tools would help us to design very efficient randomized algorithms,&lt;br/&gt;to prove the existence of interesting objects, and to analyze&lt;br/&gt;complicated processes. For educational purposes, the PI intends to&lt;br/&gt;write a textbook on discrete probability and its applications in&lt;br/&gt;discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science.</AbstractNarration>
