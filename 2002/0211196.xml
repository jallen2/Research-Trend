    <AbstractNarration>0211196&lt;br/&gt;Elgizawy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. A. Sherif El-Gizawy, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri and Dr. Maher Younan, Department of Mechanical Engineering, the American University of Cairo, Cairo, Egypt. The main goal of the work is to develop an understanding of the interactions between sheet-forming process variables and resulting properties, based on characterization and space-time evolution of process-induced damage. The investigators plan to develop an effective method for characterization and management of process-induced distortion in sheet forming. The nonlinear finite element method (FEM) is combined with an optimization scheme based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) for defining the process condition for global minimization of distortion in sheet metal products. The developed numerical model will be verified experimentally using high strength sheet materials. Implementation of the proposed approach in the stamping industry will increase the robustness of forming processes and improve the quality and consistency of stampings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: &lt;br/&gt;Process-induced distortions due to spring-back, wrinkles, and excessive localized thinning alter the product geometry from the designed one, and cause difficulties in joining and assembly of sheet products as in the cases of auto-body and airframe assemblies. The work is expected to yield models that can be used for design, control, and optimization of processes for fabrication sheet metal products. The PI's novel approach is based on a combination of FEA and genetic algorithms. The successful demonstration of the results could lead to commercial solutions for one of the major outstanding problem in design of sheet forming dies: predicting and avoiding springback problems. This collaborative research will integrate modeling with experimental observations to determine the effects of different process parameters to characterize and manage process-induced distortions, and will provide unique training for conducting engineering research for graduate and undergraduate students in both Egypt and the United States. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
