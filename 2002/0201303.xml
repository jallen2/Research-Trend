    <AbstractNarration>DDMS-0201303&lt;br/&gt;Rafal Ablamowicz and John Ryan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for active research mathematicians and&lt;br/&gt;scientists with limited means of support to attend in The 6th Conference on&lt;br/&gt;Clifford Algebras and their Applications in Mathematical Physics to be held at&lt;br/&gt;the Tennessee Technological University from May 20 through May 26, 2002, in&lt;br/&gt;Cookeville, Tennessee. The award, together with other funding, will provide&lt;br/&gt;travel support for some of the speakers and for some participants who do not&lt;br/&gt;have funds available through other source, with priority given to graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, recent Ph.D.'s, minorities and women. As part of the conference, a&lt;br/&gt;Lecture Series on Clifford Algebras and Applications aimed at graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and recent Ph.D.'s will be presented on May 18 and 19, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 6th Conference will be sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the&lt;br/&gt;American Mathematical Society, the International Society for Analysis, its&lt;br/&gt;Applications and Computation (ISAAC), University of Arkansas, George Mason&lt;br/&gt;University, and the Tennessee Technological University. The organizers of the&lt;br/&gt;conference look for interaction among mathematicians, scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include the following speakers, five sessions, six 90 minute&lt;br/&gt;lectures, and other activities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speakers: Christian Bar, Helga Baum, Carlos A. Berenstein, Michael Eastwood, Bertfried&lt;br/&gt;Fauser, Alexander J. Hahn, Jacques Helmstetter, David Hestenes, Tadeusz Iwaniec,&lt;br/&gt;Jan J.
