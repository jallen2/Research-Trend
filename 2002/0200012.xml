    <AbstractNarration>This project is concerned with the geometry of algebraic &lt;br/&gt;varieites. It builds on past experience which indicates that &lt;br/&gt;much can be learned about the geometry of a given algebraic &lt;br/&gt;variety by studying its Chow group. The Chow group is obtained &lt;br/&gt;from the free abelian group on all subvarieties of a given variety &lt;br/&gt;by modding out by the relation of rational equivalence. For &lt;br/&gt;algebraic curves the Chow group is a close relative of the &lt;br/&gt;Jacobian. While the Chow group is known to have good functorial &lt;br/&gt;properties, it is often very difficult to compute. Thus it is &lt;br/&gt;difficult to gain access to the subtle and valuable information &lt;br/&gt;that it frequently contains. This investigation focuses on three &lt;br/&gt;different aspects of the problem of computing Chow groups. First &lt;br/&gt;the torsion subgroup of the Chow group is being studied with an &lt;br/&gt;emphasis on the quotient by the subgroup generated by cycles &lt;br/&gt;algebraically equivalent to zero. Secondly, the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between the Chow group and singular cohomology with rational &lt;br/&gt;coefficients is being investigated. The Hodge Conjecture is an &lt;br/&gt;important concern here. The theory of Abelian varieties and &lt;br/&gt;techniques from classical algebraic geometry will be brought to &lt;br/&gt;bear on this problem. The third line of investigation involves &lt;br/&gt;the relationship between the Chow group and singular cohomology &lt;br/&gt;with integrer coefficients. An ancient guidepost here was the so &lt;br/&gt;called Integral Hodge Conjecture. It has turned out that the &lt;br/&gt;Integral Hodge Conjecture is false in some instances. The extent &lt;br/&gt;of its failure is poorly understood, so the principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;and a PhD student are working to clarify this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To a significant extent, the value of basic research in algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry results from the tendency of mathematicians to reduce &lt;br/&gt;problems in various other fields of mathematics to problems in &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. This tendency is due to the ultimate &lt;br/&gt;simplicity of algebraic geometry, where remarkably effective &lt;br/&gt;approaches to certain geometric problems have been developed&lt;br/&gt;with minimal reliance on infinite processes. While the initial &lt;br/&gt;translation of a problem from the physical world into mathematics &lt;br/&gt;frequently involves limits, derivatives, integrals, and further &lt;br/&gt;notions involving infinite processes which go well beyond ordinary &lt;br/&gt;calculus, mathematicians have learned to search for hidden aspects &lt;br/&gt;of these problems which are essentially of an algebraic or finite &lt;br/&gt;nature. Neither the task of translating real world phenomena into &lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems, the task of discovering a hidden algebraic&lt;br/&gt;core in a problem formulated using infinite processes, nor the &lt;br/&gt;task of solving this core problem using algebraic geometry is&lt;br/&gt;often easy. Nonetheless, this lengthy process has led to profound &lt;br/&gt;insights. For example, algebraic geometry and some of the &lt;br/&gt;algebraic varieties studied by the principal investigator are of &lt;br/&gt;great interest to physicists in their current attempts to unify &lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics with the theory of gravity.</AbstractNarration>
