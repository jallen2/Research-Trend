    <AbstractNarration>---------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;PI: Tom Kennedy, University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;DMS 0201566&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project concerns self-avoiding walks in two &lt;br/&gt;dimensions and their relation to Schramm's stochastic Loewner evolution &lt;br/&gt;process. Schramm's process is believed to describe the scaling limit of&lt;br/&gt;a variety of two-dimensional models, including the self-avoiding walk.&lt;br/&gt;The pivot algorithm provides a fast method for simulating &lt;br/&gt;self-avoiding walks. Recently, the principal investigator has &lt;br/&gt;found a new implementation of this algorithm that is as much &lt;br/&gt;as eighty times faster in two dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;This will be used to test both the conjectured conformal invariance of &lt;br/&gt;the self-avoiding walk and its equivalence with stochastic Loewner &lt;br/&gt;evolution. A version of the weakly self-avoiding walk in which the &lt;br/&gt;penalty for self-intersections decays with the length of the loop &lt;br/&gt;produced by the self-intersection will be investigated by simulations and &lt;br/&gt;perturbative means. The second part of the project concerns &lt;br/&gt;excited states in quantum spin systems. Recent work by the principal &lt;br/&gt;investigator has developed a method for studying the dispersion&lt;br/&gt;relation of one quasi-particle states and interface states in one dimension. &lt;br/&gt;The method is based on assuming a certain ansatz for the wave function &lt;br/&gt;of the states and then proving there is indeed an eigenstate of this&lt;br/&gt;form by a contraction mapping argument.&lt;br/&gt;This method will be used to study interface states in two dimensions and &lt;br/&gt;the excited states above these interface states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-avoiding walks are random walks which are not allowed to visit&lt;br/&gt;the same place more than once. They provide a model for linear polymers &lt;br/&gt;in a dilute solution. The interest in this model is, however, much broader &lt;br/&gt;since it is one of the simplest models that exhibits critical phenomena and &lt;br/&gt;in two dimensions conformal invariance. Recently there has been &lt;br/&gt;an explosion of conjectures relating the self-avoiding walk and other &lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional models to a new two dimensional stochastic&lt;br/&gt;process, called stochastic Loewner evolution, introduced by Schramm.&lt;br/&gt;Part of the project will study many of these conjectures &lt;br/&gt;for the self-avoiding walk by Monte Carlo simulations and &lt;br/&gt;by perturbative methods. The simulations will be done with &lt;br/&gt;a recent implementation of the pivot algorithm by the principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;that is much faster than previous implementations.&lt;br/&gt;This fast algorithm will also be used to study versions of &lt;br/&gt;the self-avoiding walk that are important in physical chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;Another part of the project is devoted to studying the low energy excitations&lt;br/&gt;in a variety of quantum spin systems. These are models of the behavior&lt;br/&gt;of the electron spins in crystals. At low temperatures the electron&lt;br/&gt;spins tend to align. However, several domains may form within which &lt;br/&gt;the spins are aligned, but between which the spins point in &lt;br/&gt;opposite directions. &lt;br/&gt;The interfaces between these domains will be studied by an &lt;br/&gt;approach which has proved very successful for studying &lt;br/&gt;one quasi-particle states. In particular, the nature of the excitations &lt;br/&gt;just above the interface states will be investigated.</AbstractNarration>
