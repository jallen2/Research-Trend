    <AbstractNarration>The Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) will carry out a small one-time award program to encourage collaborative activities in global change research among scientists and institutions of the IAI member countries. The Small Grants Program (SGP) will be the foundation of a second phase of IAI programmatic development, leading to the establishment of new long term research networks that will succeed the current Collaborative Research Network, supported in part by a separate NSF grant. High priority has been given in this selection to high-quality science and the participation of new/young scientists from IAI member countries.&lt;br/&gt;After an open call and a merit-based peer-review the IAI has selected the following activities:&lt;br/&gt;--A. Research (10 awards):&lt;br/&gt;1. Esteban Jobbagy, ARGENTINA: "Climate and Land Use Controls on Ecosystem Functioning: Understanding Processes and Developing Tools for a Sustainable Use of Temperate Ecosystems" (Other Countries: Uruguay and USA) $29,820&lt;br/&gt;2. Arturo Sanchez, CANADA: "Connecting Satellites to the Human and Ecological Dimensions: Sustaining Tropical Forests for the Future" (Other Countries: Costa Rica and Mexico) $28,360&lt;br/&gt;3. Claudia Wagner-Riddle, CANADA: "Carbon Sequestration Monitoring in Rubber-tree Plantations" (Other Countries: Brazil and USA) $29,980&lt;br/&gt;4. Roberto J. Fernandez, ARGENTINA: "Dendroecology as a Tool for Assessing Past Land-Use in Arid Zones: Wood Structure Modifications and Associated Hydraulic Changes on a Patagonian Shrub Caused by Site Grazing" (Other Countries: Chile and USA) $29,900&lt;br/&gt;5. Edwin Castellanos, GUATEMALA: "Adapting to Market Shocks and Climatic Variability in Mesoamerica: Coffee in Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras" (Other Countries: Mexico, USA) $29,990&lt;br/&gt;6. J.T. Arredondo Moreno, MEXICO: "An Inter-American Comparison of the Genetic Erosion of Key Species in Overgrazed Semiarid Rangelands" (Other Countries: USA and Argentina) $29,958&lt;br/&gt;7. Enrique Martinez, CHILE: "Inter-Hemispheric Comparative Studies of ENSO Effects in Kelp Populations: Inhibition and Facilitation Mechanisms Determining Restoration After Massive Mortality Events" (Other Countries: Mexico and USA) $30,000&lt;br/&gt;8.
