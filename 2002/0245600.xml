    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0245600&lt;br/&gt;Sapir, Mark V.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Asymptotic and algorithmic properties of groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to study asymptotic and algorithmic properties of groups.&lt;br/&gt;The topics include a torsion free non-amenable finitely presented group&lt;br/&gt;without free non-abelian subgroups, a finitely presented infinite torsion group, &lt;br/&gt;Dehn functions of groups including Dehn functions of residually finite and &lt;br/&gt;Metabelian groups, isoperimetric functions of aspherical manifolds, residually &lt;br/&gt;finite hyperbolic groups, structure properties of hyperbolic groups (is every&lt;br/&gt;torsion-free hyperbolic group free-by-finite exponent?), n-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;diagram groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic properties of groups have been a subject of intensive study&lt;br/&gt;since the beginning of the 20th century (Dehn and Tietze). Novikov, Boone&lt;br/&gt;and Higman showed deep connections between logic (especially the theory of&lt;br/&gt;recursive functions) and group theory. A more recent work by Gromov and&lt;br/&gt;others showed a connection between algorithmic and asymptotic properties&lt;br/&gt;(especially isoperimetric and growth functions) of groups and the related&lt;br/&gt;topological objects. The PIs found even more intimate connections between&lt;br/&gt;complexity of algorithms and asymptotic properties of groups. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;they have characterized groups whose word problem is in NP in terms of Dehn&lt;br/&gt;functions and Higman embeddings, found an NP-complete group, etc.. The PIs&lt;br/&gt;propose to further study these connections, and their applications to some&lt;br/&gt;outstanding Burnside-type problems. In particular, they propose to use&lt;br/&gt;Higman embeddings to construct finitely presented torsion groups and in the&lt;br/&gt;study of Dehn functions of metabelian groups. Another direction of their&lt;br/&gt;research deals with connections between geometry and structure of groups. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, they propose to study the class of finite dimensional diagram&lt;br/&gt;groups, for dimension greater than two which, they believe, include a large &lt;br/&gt;class of groups acting ``nicely" on cubical complexes. Structural properties of &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic groups will also be under investigation.</AbstractNarration>
