    <AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to further the understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of families of complex curves on a complex projective &lt;br/&gt;manifold X.This will be done by addressing both enumerative &lt;br/&gt;questions (e.g. How may curves are there with given degree and &lt;br/&gt;genus and incidences?) and deformation-theoretic questions&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. What deformations of curves lie in a generic deformation &lt;br/&gt;of X?). Some of the important tools for attacking such questions &lt;br/&gt;include the Atiyah-Bott localization theorem and Kuranishi's &lt;br/&gt;formal deformationtheory. In addition to the research component,&lt;br/&gt;the investigators will restart the successful WAGS&lt;br/&gt;(Western Algebraic Geometry) conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research relates to counting problems. &lt;br/&gt;For example, given the set of solutions of a polynomial equation &lt;br/&gt;in several variables, how many objects of a certain type (e.g. &lt;br/&gt;lines) lie entirely inside the solution set? We further study &lt;br/&gt;the 'shape' of the collection of objects even in cases in which &lt;br/&gt;that collection of objects is no longer finite. This research is &lt;br/&gt;related to a celebrated modern theory in physics, called 'string &lt;br/&gt;theory,' which proposes to resolve the problem of unifying the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental forces of nature by slightly 'thickening' space-time &lt;br/&gt;in six independent directions. Our research studies the geometry &lt;br/&gt;of the (tiny) cross-section of the universe in those six new &lt;br/&gt;directions.</AbstractNarration>
