    <AbstractNarration>The theory that the many different cell-types of the body are all derived from divisions of a single fertilized egg is well described, but poorly explained. This remarkable transformation is thought to be the result of differential regulation of the activity of genes constituting an individual's genome. The result is that each cell-type "expresses" its own array of genes required for their particular function in the body. Decoding the "rules" that govern when and where a given gene will be activated or silenced is key to understanding the basis for organismal development. Linked, non-coding DNA sequences are known to play a leading role in gene regulation. Innumerable sequences capable of regulating gene expression have been identified. However, the vast majority of such sequences do not function well in the natural "packaging environment" (called chromatin) in which genes normally reside. More recently appreciated is the emerging role of the regulation of "chromatin states" in determining gene expression status. However, the connection between regulatory DNA sequences and the alteration of chromatin states is still unclear. Using highly integrated research and educational approaches, the proposed research project will investigate novel DNA sequences that appear to regulate gene expression via the alteration of chromatin structure. Therefore, this work will help bridge the gap in the understanding of how chromatin is involved in gene regulation. This will help bring the field closer to a more complete understanding of the development of complex organisms, such as ourselves.</AbstractNarration>
