    <AbstractNarration>6th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports partially the expenses for participation by 15 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and young faculty in Sixth Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference, which will be held at the Georgetown University Conference Center in Washington, DC, on June 25-27, 2002. The subtitle of this conference is " Meeting Global Challenges Through Economic and Environmental Innovations." Like its predecessor conferences, this meeting is organized around the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards and is intended to accelerate the adoption of cleaner processes in all sectors of industry. In addition to presentation by award winners, research papers and posters on relevant topics are given. This year's conference is focusing on the role of science and technology in addressing such environmental issues as climate change, energy and food production, water and resource depletion, and the reduction of toxics in the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support is given to expand exposure and participation of young scientists and engineering and thus to contribute to education and expansion of research activities in this important environmental area.</AbstractNarration>
