    <AbstractNarration>Application partitioning is the task of breaking up the&lt;br/&gt; functionality of an application into distinct entities that can&lt;br/&gt; operate independently, usually in a distributed setting. As&lt;br/&gt; networking changes the computing landscape, application&lt;br/&gt; partitioning is becoming an increasingly common form of distributed&lt;br/&gt; programming. This project examines the possibility of automating the&lt;br/&gt; partitioning of a software application. Instead of hand re-coding,&lt;br/&gt; higher-level tools allow the user to express how the application is&lt;br/&gt; to be partitioned. The tools can then rewrite the existing&lt;br/&gt; application code to replace local data exchange (e.g. function&lt;br/&gt; calls, data sharing through pointers) with remote communication&lt;br/&gt; (e.g. remote function calls, remote pointers or mobile objects).&lt;br/&gt; The tools are based on a novel static analysis and translation&lt;br/&gt; algorithm. The potential impact of this work is in significantly&lt;br/&gt; simplifying distributed program construction, a prime&lt;br/&gt; intellectual and practical challenge of computer science.&lt;br/&gt; Automatic partitioning can revolutionize the way a large class of&lt;br/&gt; distributed programs is developed. Additionally, the proposed&lt;br/&gt; tools have a high educational value: they can be used for&lt;br/&gt; illustrating crucial concepts in both programming languages and&lt;br/&gt; distributed systems, while minimizing distractions due to low-level&lt;br/&gt; complexity.</AbstractNarration>
