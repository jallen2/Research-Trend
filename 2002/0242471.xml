    <AbstractNarration>This study examines the role of internal waves in mixing near source &lt;br/&gt;regions of internal waves by studying several different types of &lt;br/&gt;non-linear internal-wave interaction problems. Numerical experiments &lt;br/&gt;will be used to examine three different regimes. The first will look &lt;br/&gt;at the nonlinear cascade of energy between short and long internal &lt;br/&gt;waves in a run-down experiment initialized with a high-energy, &lt;br/&gt;random-phase internal wave field with a spectrum similar to that &lt;br/&gt;postulated by Garrett and Munk. The second set of experiments will &lt;br/&gt;look at energy transfer from internal waves at the frequency of the M2 &lt;br/&gt;tide, forced by tidal excursions over topography, to higher frequency &lt;br/&gt;internal waves when that tranfer is catalyzed by the presence of a &lt;br/&gt;background field of internal waves. The third focus is on interactions &lt;br/&gt;between wind-forced near-inertial waves and non-inertial internal waves. &lt;br/&gt;The numerical experiments will be conducted with a three-dimensional, &lt;br/&gt;non-hydrostatic, psuedospectral code. The numerical results will be &lt;br/&gt;compared to field data collected during a variety of prior oceanic and &lt;br/&gt;coastal experiments.</AbstractNarration>
