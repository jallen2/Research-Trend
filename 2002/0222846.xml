    <AbstractNarration>The project plans to solve two important network problems facing distributed computation and Grids. The first problem is to provide a sufficiently flexible and robust framework for authentication and authorization, and the second problem is to provide secure mechanisms to allow researchers to upload new or enhanced measurement tools in a secure and trustworthy fashion. Building on the National Internet Measurement Infrastructure (NIMI), the project plans to evolve NIMI to a truly large scale implementation. Work involves migrating messaging, authentication and authorization to commonly used components, and mitigating some of the security problems associated with uploading measurement tools by building fine-grained delegation support and different levels of security. These structures can be used for various forms of distributed passive monitoring and security monitoring such as intrusion detection systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NIMI architecture will be extended to support open large-scale grid technologies. The overall vision is to encourage researchers, especially grid-proejcts, to build clients which will interact with the NIMI infrastructure. The infrastructure can then be used for secure, flexible command and control mechanisms, and also be sued for distributed passive monitoring.</AbstractNarration>
