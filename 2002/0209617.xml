    <AbstractNarration>Strain&lt;br/&gt;0209617&lt;br/&gt; Robust global implicit representations of curves and&lt;br/&gt;surfaces simplify geometric operations such as evolving,&lt;br/&gt;offsetting and intersecting, while requiring accurate contouring&lt;br/&gt;and efficient implicitization techniques. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;focuses on fast new algorithms for the three key issues of&lt;br/&gt;implicit representations:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Fast accurate multiresolution methods that extract&lt;br/&gt;piecewise-smooth contours with tightly controlled geometry. These&lt;br/&gt;methods alternate between global topology resolution and local&lt;br/&gt;differential-algebraic boundary value problems, and solve&lt;br/&gt;industrial problems ranging from machine tooling to horizon&lt;br/&gt;finding.&lt;br/&gt; 2. Efficient implicitization methods that build a&lt;br/&gt;distributed implicit representation from given curves or&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. These methods, which invert contouring, are essential&lt;br/&gt;to modeling moving material interfaces such as the solid-liquid&lt;br/&gt;interface in melt growth of silicon crystals.&lt;br/&gt; 3. Fast stable deferred correction methods for the accurate&lt;br/&gt;solution of ordinary and partial differential-algebraic initial&lt;br/&gt;and boundary value problems that control local geometry.&lt;br/&gt;Differential-algebraic problems occur widely in engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;challenge existing numerical methods. For example, automated&lt;br/&gt;vehicle piloting requires real-time solution of differential&lt;br/&gt;systems with constraints that keep the tires on the road.&lt;br/&gt; Computer models of complex interlocking physical objects&lt;br/&gt;dominate technological processes ranging from semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;etching to surgery planning, from computer animation to&lt;br/&gt;computer-controlled machine tooling. Key steps in these processes&lt;br/&gt;involve operations such as evolving, navigating, intersecting and&lt;br/&gt;blending on these objects. The investigator and his students are&lt;br/&gt;developing efficient new computational tools for simulating these&lt;br/&gt;operations in robust user-friendly ways. This highly&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary enterprise combines mathematics and computer&lt;br/&gt;science to benefit scientific endeavors ranging from cartography&lt;br/&gt;to crystallography. The research objectives intertwine with an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary educational program, training future scientists&lt;br/&gt;and engineers through web-enabled courses,&lt;br/&gt;math/science/engineering seminars, and individual student&lt;br/&gt;research mentoring.</AbstractNarration>
