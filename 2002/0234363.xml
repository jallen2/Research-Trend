    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of the proposed project is developing novel fault-tolerance techniques which exploit the synergy between the host and network processors in high-speed networked systems, and providing&lt;br/&gt;tools for their validation and the assessment of their effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our project will include the following tasks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Construct a layered architecture with a symbiotic relationship &lt;br/&gt;between the network and host processors so that fault tolerance&lt;br/&gt;is provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Develop expanded fault injection capabilities in order&lt;br/&gt;to study and fully understand the fault propagation and detection&lt;br/&gt;process in a network architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Develop a tool for validating our fault detection and recovery &lt;br/&gt;policies and evaluate their effectiveness in a networked system using&lt;br/&gt;both traditional and specially constructed dependability measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Integrate our fault tolerance layer and the evaluation and&lt;br/&gt;validation tool into the NASA testbed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will deliver techniques to better utilize the resources of modern network architectures for fault detection and recovery. Such techniques are crucial in space missions, which are characterized&lt;br/&gt;by the need for a proper management of computational and networking resources for missions lasting years in severely resource-constrained applications.</AbstractNarration>
