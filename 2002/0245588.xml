    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0245588 &lt;br/&gt;Louis Kauffman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes a broad approach to virtual knot theory. Knot theory&lt;br/&gt;studies the embeddings of curves in three-dimensional space. Equivalently&lt;br/&gt;knot theory studies the embeddings of curves in a&lt;br/&gt;thickened two dimensional sphere. Virtual knot theory studies the&lt;br/&gt;embeddings of curves in thickened surfaces of arbitrary genus,&lt;br/&gt;up to the addition and removal of empty handles from the surface. From the&lt;br/&gt;point of view of classical knot theory a virtual knot&lt;br/&gt;will appear as the trajectory of a particle that sometimes abruptly&lt;br/&gt;disappears from three dimensional space and reappears later&lt;br/&gt;at another point in space. An example of such a trajectory would be a&lt;br/&gt;superstring moving in three dimensional space, but&lt;br/&gt;occasionally taking a detour into higher dimensions. Virtual knots have a&lt;br/&gt;special diagrammatic theory that makes handling them&lt;br/&gt;very similar to the handling of classical knot diagrams. With this&lt;br/&gt;approach, one can generalize many structures in classical knot&lt;br/&gt;theory to the virtual domain, and use the virtual knots to test the limits&lt;br/&gt;of classical problems such as the question whether&lt;br/&gt;the Jones polynomial detects knots and the classical Poincare conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;Counterexamples to these conjectures exist in the&lt;br/&gt;virtual domain, and it is an open problem whether any of these&lt;br/&gt;counterexamples are equivalent (by addition and subtraction of&lt;br/&gt;empty handles) to classical knots and links. Virtual knot theory is an&lt;br/&gt;important domain to be investigated for its own sake and for a deeper&lt;br/&gt;understanding of classical knot theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator hopes that the above analog relationship with string theory&lt;br/&gt;will bear fruit. Virtual braids are being used by the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator to establish relationships among quantum computing, quantum&lt;br/&gt;entanglement and topological entanglement. It is a long-standing goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project to work with knots, physics and&lt;br/&gt;other natural sciences such as molecular biology.&lt;br/&gt;Generalizations such as the virtual knot theory have&lt;br/&gt;potential for use in a wide variety of applications where there is a&lt;br/&gt;combination of topology, and combinatorially modeled physicality.&lt;br/&gt;In such applications, the topology is only part of the picture. One is&lt;br/&gt;dealing with systems that can be modeled in a discrete way so&lt;br/&gt;that certain specified changes are allowed in the forms of the models. The&lt;br/&gt;question that a topologist asks is: What is invariant under the changes?&lt;br/&gt;This question is significant in applications because it corresponds to the&lt;br/&gt;stable properties of molecular structures and to conserved quantities in&lt;br/&gt;the physics. The approaches used in combinatorial topology can be&lt;br/&gt;generalized for use in a wide variety of contexts. A good example of this&lt;br/&gt;is seen in the use of knot theory in molecular biology where the allowed&lt;br/&gt;changes are a combination of what the topologist regards as continuous&lt;br/&gt;deformations coupled with discontinous changes corresponding to enzymatic&lt;br/&gt;action and recombination. This has led to a vigorous interplay between&lt;br/&gt;knot theory and molecular biology. By asking these questions about&lt;br/&gt;topological relationship and the nature of knot theory, new insights and&lt;br/&gt;applications in molecular biology, physics and quantum computing are&lt;br/&gt;coming forth.</AbstractNarration>
