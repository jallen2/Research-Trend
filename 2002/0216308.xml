    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is to purchase a fully analytical JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM). The JEM-2010 is a multipurpose high-resolution analytical microscope with wide range of capabilities, such as high-resolution image observation, microarea X-ray analysis, versatile analysis by convergent-beam electron diffraction, and analysis of the atomic structure and/or bonding state of atoms. The primary TEM system will comprise: (i) a TEM with a high resolution pole piece for high resolution electron microscopy imaging (HREM) and convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED), (ii) a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) accessory, (iii) an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), (iv) an electron energy loss spectrometer (EELS) with an energy filter, and (v) a multichannel analyzer and support computers for data acquisition, storage, and processing. This instrument is capable of high spatial resolution imaging of crystalline and amorphous structures, small-beam electron diffraction, and compositional and spectroscopic analyses of micro-and nano-scale features, all necessary tools for characterizing materials structure. Numerous new scientific investigations will be enabled with the new equipment. This instrument will support research in a variety of materials systems including nanomaterials, semiconductors, ceramics, metals, polymers, biomaterials and mesoporous materials. The proposed research projects cover a broad area of research related to synthesis and characterization of high-performance materials for manufacturing applications and TEM will provide an opportunity to conduct high-quality research to understand the microstructural properties of the materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed TEM instrument will not only stimulate the productivity of the existing research projects related to the characterization of materials but also will be used for educational purposes. The instrument will be used in undergraduate and graduate courses, and in outreach program for minority students from local schools. It will thus allow for research training of future scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds in current techniques of electron microscopy and state-of-the-art instrumentation. A laboratory course will be introduced and the main purpose is to provide students hands-on experience starting from sample preparations to operations of TEM. Support for a TEM instrument will also allow the development and enhancement of creative partnership with the numerous local industries, including microelectronics manufacturing, optical coating manufacturing, biomedical company, and computer hardware company. Results of the project will be disseminated by paper presentation in regional and national conferences, and published in journals.</AbstractNarration>
