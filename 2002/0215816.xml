    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on the development and implementation of a Solvated Metal Atom Dispersion (SMAD) technique to support high rate production and commercial application of metal nanoparticle materials. Synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticle colloids for commercial use in the health care industry will be pursued as part of the proposed effort; the SMAD synthesis method will be optimized for commercial-scale manufacturing of gold and silver colloids. This approach yields high purity colloids, free of unwanted byproducts and ready for further processing without the cumbersome purification steps characteristic of other synthesis methods. This innovation significantly simplifies the manufacturing process of colloidal products and reduces production cost. The proprietary digestive-ripening step will be scaled up and developed to achieve monodispersion and particle size control of the metal nanoparticles contained in the colloids. Methods for transferring solvent-based colloids into an aqueous environment will be developed. Synthesis steps involved in the manufacturing of colloidal gold and silver will be integrated in a semi-continuous or continuous process.&lt;br/&gt; The commercial potential of this project will be for immunological labeling and DNA detection using the colloidal gold solutions. The project offers an alternative-manufacturing route that significantly lowers the cost. Silver-based colloids have potential applications in burn wound treatment or as effective disinfectants and anti-inflammatory agents. The development of SMAD technology will enable high-volume manufacturing of many nanoparticle materials whose availability is currently limited by production inefficiencies. These nanomaterials will support future technologies in industry and find application in both commercial and academic research, as highly reactive catalytic materials, magnetic information storage media, ferrofluids, and magnetic tracers.</AbstractNarration>
