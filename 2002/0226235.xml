    <AbstractNarration>This is a project to implement and exploit a novel means of measuring plasma density profiles in the ionosphere using low-power, ground-based radar. The technique utilizes the Faraday rotation of radar signals coherently scattered by plasma irregularities. Measurements are made with a bistatic radar system located in this case at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory and at a remote site in Paracas, Peru. The Faraday rotation technique was demonstrated recently by the PI of this project, who was supported by a CEDAR grant for one year to investigate its feasibility. The objective of the current project is to measure electron density profiles in the equatorial E region in the latitude sector where the electrojet flows. Such profiles cannot be measured with the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar because, paradoxically, of clutter generated by small-scale irregularities in the electrojet. Density profiles in the equatorial E region have been measured on a few occasions with sounding rockets but never before by remote sensing. Consequently, there is a poorly developed picture of the structure of the equatorial E region, particularly at night, and several experimental, theoretical, and modeling efforts in low latitude ionospheric physics are suffering as a result.</AbstractNarration>
