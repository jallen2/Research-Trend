    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the workshop is to bring together a multidisciplinary group of researchers to identify and explore promising research directions in the alternatives to CMOS, that is, nano-based technologies. The researchers come from diverse communities including computer science, design automation, computer architecture, device physicists, and physical designers. The workshop aims at pinpointing the areas in which computer scientists and engineers can make important contributions to the technology of nanoelectronic computers. Researchers are to present position papers followed by discussions and breakout groups in which everyone participates. Sample questions being addressed are:&lt;br/&gt;How will design sciences change in order to design, build and program future computers based on nanoelectronic principles?&lt;br/&gt;What are the enabling abstractions that permit productive research on the design of nano computers?&lt;br/&gt;What technologies from computer science and engineering are needed by the nanotechnology community?&lt;br/&gt;What investments are needed and when to foster proper development of computing technologies for nano computing?&lt;br/&gt;In order to provide a broad input to the workshop, there will be a workshop website. Prior to the meeting, comments from interested parties about the workshop topics can be posted on the website. A draft workshop report will be prepared at the meeting, posted on the workshop website and commentary from researchers solicited.</AbstractNarration>
