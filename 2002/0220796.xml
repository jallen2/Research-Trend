    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the University Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science Scholarships (UMECSS) program is to increase the number of low-income, and underrepresented students able to enroll in, successfully matriculate, and graduate from the University of Toledo in the fields of Engineering and Mathematics. This is accomplished by utilizing numerous individuals and organizations from various departments at the University that have an interest and proven history in preparing students from these groups for success in college and beyond. Furthermore, the UMECSS project builds on numerous already-established programs, many of which have successfully collaborated on similar projects in the past. After identifying and selecting students with an interest and potential for success in Engineering and Mathematics fields of study, services help these students to complete their degree programs and secure professional positions. These services include a "bridging" program to assist recipients with the transition from high school to college, tutoring, mentoring, and establishing cohort groups that utilize Supplemental Instructors to assist students (by sitting in on classes, helping with note taking, and providing Supplemental Instruction). This comprehensive set of support services, which is designed to augment their course work and help them adjust to the University setting, improve recipients' chances of successfully completing their degree programs and securing professional positions. The primary components of UMECSS focus on creating small learning communities, which enable students to form closer relationships with each other and University faculty and staff. Clustering or grouping students in core Math and Science classes with the same instructor in the same courses also allows for closer relationships, and allows for students to review the materials more effectively. Field trips and job shadowing activities with industry and faculty mentors help students begin to the make the transition from an academic setting to that of the workplace, and they familiarize students with a professional environment. Co-op assignments with industry and business partners, job fairs, help with resume preparation, interview skills, and professional etiquette are gradually incorporated as the students progress in their degree programs.</AbstractNarration>
