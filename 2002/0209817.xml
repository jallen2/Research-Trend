    <AbstractNarration>The production of surface nanofeatures has many important applications in critical emerging technology fields, including the heterogeneous integration of nanoscale components and devices in microelectronics, information storage and optoelectronic systems. The ultra-fast temporal scale of femtosecond pulsed laser radiation will be combined with the high spatial resolution of near-field optical microscope for nanomachining. This hybrid single-step experimental methodology offers superior flexibility and control over the nanofabrication process. The project will encompass both basic investigation of the extremely rapid transport phenomena in nanometer length scales as well as the design and demonstration of novel practical processes for nanomachining and nanofabrication. The main objectives of the proposed research are given below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Development of experimental procedures for nanomachining by coupling femtosecond laser radiation with near-field optical microscopes.&lt;br/&gt;2) Detailed study of the fundamental mechanisms of the ultra-fast laser energy deposition and the ensuing nanoscale phase transformations by in-situ time-resolved optical spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;3) Investigation of the ultra-fast transport phenomena in the machining, cutting and joining of nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the impact of the work in many nanotechnology applications, fundamental insight will be gained into the complex thermophysical phenomena in ultra-fast laser-induced nanoscale surface modification processes. Funding is being provided by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division and by the Nanomanufacturing Program of the Design, Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Division.</AbstractNarration>
