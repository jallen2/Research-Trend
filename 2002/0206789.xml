    <AbstractNarration>This proposal deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;the class of hybrid systems called (discrete-time) piecewise linear (PL)&lt;br/&gt;systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of hybrid systems concerns issues of modeling, computation and&lt;br/&gt;control for systems which combine discrete and continuous components.&lt;br/&gt;The subclass of PL systems, which we investigate in this project,&lt;br/&gt;provides one systematic approach&lt;br/&gt;to discrete-time hybrid systems, naturally blending switching mechanisms with&lt;br/&gt;classical linear components.&lt;br/&gt;PL systems are of interest as controllers as well as identification models,&lt;br/&gt;and they can be thought of as arbitrary interconnections of finite automata&lt;br/&gt;and linear systems. &lt;br/&gt;Tools from automata theory, logic and related areas of computer&lt;br/&gt;science and finite mathematics are used in the study of PL systems, in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with linear algebra techniques, all in the context of a ``PL&lt;br/&gt;algebra'' formalism. In this project, we will study basic algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;and computational problems for these problems with applications to&lt;br/&gt;modelling of biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More concretely, &lt;br/&gt;basic questions for any class of systems are those of equivalence, and, in&lt;br/&gt;particular, whether state spaces are equivalent under a change of variables.&lt;br/&gt;This project will address various algorithmic and computational challenges&lt;br/&gt;related to this state-space equivalence and isomorphism problem for PL&lt;br/&gt;systems, as well as questions of learnability and representability for such&lt;br/&gt;systems. The project also suggests the use of PL models for differential gene&lt;br/&gt;expression testing.</AbstractNarration>
