    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new joining technology that will provide substantial technical and cost advantages for multiple industrial applications, including metal-to-metal and metal-to-ceramic joining. The technology for joining metallic and ceramic components is a reactive joining process that uses reactive multilayer foils as local heat sources for melting solders or brazes. The foils are a new class of nano-engineered materials, in which self-propagating exothermic reactions can be ignited at room temperature with a spark. By inserting a multilayer foil between two solder (or braze) layers and two components, heat generated by the reaction in the foil melts the solder and consequently bonds the components. This new method of soldering eliminates the need for a furnace and, with very localized heating, avoids thermal damage to the components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of this reactive bonding process is more rapid than most competing technologies, and results in strong and cost-effective joints.</AbstractNarration>
