    <AbstractNarration>This project will develop an integrated framework for modeling, control, and guidance of robotic helicopters, which will enable these vehicles to exploit their full operating capabilities to fly fast, precise, and reliable missions in a variety of operations in urban and remote environments. Potential applications include search and rescue, surveillance, law enforcement, inspection, aerial mapping, wildlife observation, and cinematography. The integrated framework consists of three interrelated activities: (1) the development of a modeling technique for high-fidelity low-order dynamics modes, (2) the use of linear robust multiviariable control theory (H_infinity loop shaping), gain scheduling, and high-fidelity models for the design and simulation of high-bandwidth full-flight-envelope controllers, and (3) the use of optimal feedforward methods (model predictive control) for the design of guidance systems that rely on the performance and robustness of the closed-loop helicopter dynamics.A key aspect of the project will be the flight test validation and refinement of the framework on Carnegie Mellon's Yamaha R-50 and RMAX helicopters. Flight validation will include a complex mission in a known environment. The mission will consist segments of standard maneuvers (e.g. hurdle-hop, dash/quick stop, coordinated turn, slalom, rearward flight, S-turn, etc.). The robotic helicopters will fly the missions in several different ways (e.g for aggressiveness, precision, fuel economy, etc.) according to the mission specification.</AbstractNarration>
