    <AbstractNarration>This project involves long-term measurements of semi-volatile organic compounds (SOC) at selected locations in the U.S. Northwest, including a site routinely sampling the free troposphere. The objectives of this project include using SOC molecular tracer data to more completely characterize long-range transport of emissions from Asia across the Pacific Ocean, and investigating whether pristine ecosystems at high latitudes and elevations are affected by deposition of anthropogenic SOC. A variety of analytical techniques will be used to identify the characteristics and origin of the hi-volume ambient samples acquired, addressing a current void in semi-continuous data of this type available as tracers of intercontinental atmospheric transport. The importance of Asian emissions on intercontinental transport and global cycling of organic pollutants is timely and important, and results are likely to have policy relevance. The project will provide professional training for two graduate students and research experience for up to five undergraduates. The educational component of this CAREER award involves educational outreach to K-12 students and their teachers, including those from underrepresented ethnic groups. This project is the first NSF award to this new-start female faculty member.</AbstractNarration>
