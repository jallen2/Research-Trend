    <AbstractNarration>Florida Georgia Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program (Phase III)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Florida A&amp;M University in coalition with Albany State University, Bethune-Cookman&lt;br/&gt;College, Florida State University, University of Florida, University of South Florida,&lt;br/&gt;University of Central Florida, Florida International University, Florida Memorial&lt;br/&gt;College, University of Miami, Tallahassee Community College, Miami Dade Community&lt;br/&gt;College, and Florida Community College at Jacksonville has developed a program to&lt;br/&gt;significantly increase the quality and quantity of minority students successfully&lt;br/&gt;completing science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) B.S. degree programs as well as&lt;br/&gt;significantly increase the number interested in and qualified for matriculation into Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;SEM programs of study. Subsumed under these goals are the following measurable&lt;br/&gt;objectives: at least quadruple the annual entry of minority B.S. graduates into Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;SEM programs from 100 (year 2001 baseline) to 500 over the next five years; (2)&lt;br/&gt;increase by ten percent (baseline 2320), the number of B.S. degrees awarded to&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities in SEM disciplines by the year 2007; and (3) institutionalize&lt;br/&gt;the FGLSAMP Project at each participating institution by 2006 to insure FGLSAMP&lt;br/&gt;permanence after NSF funding ceases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alliance proposes to utilize a holistic model to transition SEM scholars from high&lt;br/&gt;school to college, positively influence their retention in college, enhance their B.S.&lt;br/&gt;graduation rates from college and entry into Ph.D. degree SEM programs of study.&lt;br/&gt;Project activities to realize these goals and objectives include developing structured&lt;br/&gt;relationships with school systems and community colleges to attract students to SEM&lt;br/&gt;majors; establishing workshops to increase student academic performance; implementing&lt;br/&gt;a pre-matriculation institute; and implementing a pre-junior graduate school orientation&lt;br/&gt;program and pre-senior research apprenticeship to stimulate student competence and&lt;br/&gt;interest in graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FGLSAMP Project will form partnerships with AGEP Projects, Ph.D. degree&lt;br/&gt;granting institutions, other appropriate NSF agencies, national/governmental laboratories,&lt;br/&gt;private foundations and private industry to assist in providing funds for research stipends&lt;br/&gt;and graduate fellowships for student participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Florida Legislature provides $640,000 in matching funds annually to support&lt;br/&gt;participating Florida institutions in the FGLSAMP Project. The results from this project&lt;br/&gt;will be shared with other institutions and scientists via reports, newsletters, FGLSAMP&lt;br/&gt;EXPOs and published articles.</AbstractNarration>
