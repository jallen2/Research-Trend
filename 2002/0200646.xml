    <AbstractNarration>PI: Matthew Gursky, Notre Dame University&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200646&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully nonlinear and higher order equations in geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract. The work described in this proposal lies at the &lt;br/&gt;intersection of three fields: higher order elliptic partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, fully nonlinear equations, and &lt;br/&gt;differential geometry. The equations we study are geometric&lt;br/&gt;in origin, and given by elementary symmetric polynomials &lt;br/&gt;of the eigenvalues of the Weyl-Schouten tensor, specifically&lt;br/&gt;under conformal deformations of the metric. There is a&lt;br/&gt;strong structural analogy between this problem and the more&lt;br/&gt;classical problem of prescribing the curvature(s) of a &lt;br/&gt;surface in three-dimensional space. To analyze our equations&lt;br/&gt;we use techniques from the field of fully nonlinear and &lt;br/&gt;higher order elliptic equations. The geometric consequences&lt;br/&gt;are most interesting in low dimensions: for example, we&lt;br/&gt;have developed a technique for constructing large families &lt;br/&gt;of conformal manifolds which admit metrics with positive&lt;br/&gt;Ricci curvature,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction of geometry and analysis dates back&lt;br/&gt;to at least the eighteenth century, and yet continues to be&lt;br/&gt;an important and highly active field of mathematical research.&lt;br/&gt;The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to&lt;br/&gt;understand certain properties of the physical world, and&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry was developed to understand the &lt;br/&gt;geometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature&lt;br/&gt;of the surface of the earth, or the curvature of space &lt;br/&gt;by matter predicted by general relativity. &lt;br/&gt;In the same way that Descartes realized that plane&lt;br/&gt;geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis,&lt;br/&gt;especially differential equations. This research in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal involves several such problems from Riemmanian&lt;br/&gt;and conformal geometry, whose analysis requires techniques&lt;br/&gt;from various fields within mathematical analysis.</AbstractNarration>
