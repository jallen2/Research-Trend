    <AbstractNarration>This proposal describes a set of new techniques for managing access to remote files in the wide area. The vehicle for evaluating these techniques will be a wide-area file system called MoteFS. MoteFS will provide fast, flexible, and secure access to remote files over untrusted wide-area networks. In more detail, the following mechanisms and policies will be investigated:&lt;br/&gt;- fine-grained namespace mechanisms that allow namespaces to be efficiently and securely added, mutated, transferred and deleted at granularities from single files to millions of files.&lt;br/&gt;- decomposable credentials, which allow credential holders to locally derive and transfer weaker credentials without contacting file owners.&lt;br/&gt;- a cross-server versioning abstraction, which allows correlated versions of a group of files to be referenced even if they span multiple users and file systems.&lt;br/&gt;- client-side differencing, which allows redundant data to be eliminated during network writebacks.&lt;br/&gt;- wide-area prefetching and caching algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;The combined effect of these techniques will allow allow users to interact with their files in a flexible, secure, location-independent manner.</AbstractNarration>
