    <AbstractNarration>A long-term goal at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is to increase the number, participation and leadership status of women in academic science and engineering through institutional transformation. Fundamental to this goal is the commitment and active participation of UIC administration at the highest level, leaders working closely with faculty and staff to create and actualize individual departmental programs in the eleven disciplinary areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The practices to be developed for these disciplines will have broader use and implications across campus. Under this award, UIC will focus its energies on instituting practices in the STEM disciplines to promote gender equity and leadership with a special focus on increasing the recruitment, promotion and tenure, and retention rates of STEM women faculty and advancing them into leadership positions. This will be done through the training and efforts of dedicated faculty facilitators in each of the disciplines. In addition, current efforts to improve networking, mentoring, and evaluating support services for women in STEM disciplines will be augmented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The goal of the ADVANCE program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. To meet this goal, the ADVANCE program provides award opportunities for both individuals and organizations and seeks to support new approaches to improving the climate for women in U.S. academic institutions and to facilitate women's advancement to the highest ranks of academic leadership.</AbstractNarration>
