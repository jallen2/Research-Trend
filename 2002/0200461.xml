    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the acquisition of an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) to be shared by a group of UC Santa Barbara investigators who have made extensive use of stable isotope analysis in their research programs. The new IRMS system will permit high-precision measurement of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen stable isotope ratios. The instrument would be configured to allow isotope measurements on solid samples of biological and geological origin, on both major and minor components of gas samples, and on purge-able gaseous, liquid, and ionic solutes in aqueous solutions. The instrument will be used in research that addresses a wide range of important and timely topics, including: measurements of fundamental microbial processes in marine environments, atmospheric methane levels, nutrient dynamics in soils from a variety of ecosystems and environments; and nutrient and food web linkages within coastal ecosystems. The instrument will be housed and maintained in a professionally managed, shared-use analytical and instrumentation facility at the University's Marine Science Institute. Besides providing a tool that is critical to the success of vital research programs, this equipment would also allow graduate student and postdoctoral users to become experts in this key technology for environmental science.</AbstractNarration>
