    <AbstractNarration>Kesler&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0227487&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a request for support for a conference that will focus on designing research objectives for the geology and geochemistry of ore deposits (economic geology) in the future. The conference will be held October 5, 2002, in Denver, Colorado, one day before the national Geological Society Conference meeting. The main goal of this conference is to outline research that will help clarify how mineral deposits and related geochemical anomalies form and how they are related to the global-scale processes that have produced chemical heterogeneity in our planet. Support will be used largely to supplement lodging costs for those already attending the GSA meeting. Results of the conference will be published in the Newsletter of the Society of Economic Geologists and other journals.</AbstractNarration>
