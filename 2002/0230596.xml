    <AbstractNarration>OIA-0230596&lt;br/&gt;McBay&lt;br/&gt;QEM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving the education of under-represented groups that have been historically undeserved by the nation's educational system. A successor to the Quality Education for Minorities Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop effective strategies of STEM education for minorities, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent minorities for receiving a high quality education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to QEM will provide technical assistance to junior faculty at minority-serving institutions and eligible underrepresented minority faculty at other institutions to enable them to participate more successfully in the NSF's Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program. Minority faculty play a significant role in the production of minority baccalaureate degree recipients in STEM disciplines as well as in the disproportionate production of minority college graduates who pursue graduate degrees. Consequently there will be the broadening of participation and enhanced diversity within the Foundation's programs as it relates to the strategic goal of People, Tools, and Ideas.</AbstractNarration>
