    <AbstractNarration>The new generation of ultrarelativistic heavy ion colliders, RHIC at Brookhaven and LHC at CERN&lt;br/&gt;will open a window to the Early Universe when it was one microsecond old. In these experiments&lt;br/&gt;a new state of matter-the quark gluon plasma- will be formed. This state prevailed when the&lt;br/&gt;Universe was younger than a microsecond with temperatures larger than 1012 K. This novel state&lt;br/&gt;is also conjectured to exist at the core of the densest stars in the Universe-neutron stars- and to be&lt;br/&gt;the primary constituent of hypothetical quark stars. The density in these astrophysical objects is&lt;br/&gt;about 1015gr/cc, these stars are the remnant of the most powerful events in the present Universesupernovae&lt;br/&gt;explosions. The properties of neutron stars and the existence of quark stars is currently&lt;br/&gt;being studied by a host of satellite missions: HST, Rosat, Chandra, XMM-Newton and forthcoming&lt;br/&gt;neutrino telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;Assessing potential observables and experimental signatures of the quark gluon plasma requires&lt;br/&gt;studying the strong interactions in an unprecedented regime of temperatures and densities. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions the quark gluon plasma is expected to be a transient&lt;br/&gt;state with an unprecedented short lifetime of the order of 10-22 seconds, undergoing a phase transition&lt;br/&gt;to a phase in which quarks and gluons are con.ned inside hadrons. Thus the challenge is to&lt;br/&gt;extract observational signatures fromthe short-lived and rapidly evolving plasma. The focus and&lt;br/&gt;goal of this proposal is to implement the methods that we developed during the last several years&lt;br/&gt;to study equilibriumand non-equilibriumexp erimental signatures of the quark gluon plasma and&lt;br/&gt;the phase transitions in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and in compact stars. In particular&lt;br/&gt;we focus on: i) electromagnetic signatures (photons and lepton pairs), ii) transport phenomena&lt;br/&gt;and properties of .uctuations as potential observables of the phase transitions, iii) astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;processes that lead to observational signals of quark matter in strongly magnetized neutron stars&lt;br/&gt;and quark stars: photon and neutrino emissions.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual challenge: This is a truly interdisciplinary programat the forefront of nuclear&lt;br/&gt;and particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology. Many of the methods, in particular transport&lt;br/&gt;phenomena strongly out of equilibrium also overlaps with timely problems in condensed matter&lt;br/&gt;physics: femtosecond relaxation in semiconductors. Thus we expect that the program will also&lt;br/&gt;have a broad impact in many areas. The possibility of opening a window to the Early Universe&lt;br/&gt;with earth-bound accelerators and studying the densest stars, the remnants of the most energetic&lt;br/&gt;events in the Universe-Supernovae explosions-is clearly one of the most fascinating endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;Broad interest: The appeal of studying the Early Universe and some of the most exotic&lt;br/&gt;objects in the present Universe goes beyond the scientists working in these areas, and reaches to&lt;br/&gt;the broad audience. The general public is fascinated about the latest discoveries in cosmology and&lt;br/&gt;particle physics, and eager to listen and learn more. The symbiosis between cosmology, astrophysics&lt;br/&gt;and nuclear and particle physics lends itself to being an e.ective vehicle to transmit the new and&lt;br/&gt;fascinating discoveries and to highlight the importance of the di.erent areas to unravel the ultimate&lt;br/&gt;mysteries of the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;The projects described in this proposal are a continuation of the research done under the&lt;br/&gt;previous Grant: N.S.F. PHY-9988720 (5/31/00-5/31/03) and is estimated for a period of three&lt;br/&gt;years.</AbstractNarration>
