    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS 0212998 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Haim Bau&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: The Use of Arrays of Sensors and Actuators to Control Convective Flows&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his students will undertake a theoretical and experimental study of active control of thermally induced convective flows. Because such flows are nonlinear with many degrees of freedom, effective control is quite difficult. The research will extend previous work to develop means by which all sensors can interact with all the actuators simultaneously. Numerical simulations will be carried out to study the dynamics of the controlled system, and experiments will be conducted in upright circular cylinders with different aspect ratios, using different liquids having a wide range of Prandtl numbers, while employing arrays of micro-fabricated sensors and actuators. This is a fundamental study that has the potential of enabling control strategies for modifying transport phenomena in significant industrial processes. The research should also facilitate the integration of active control strategies with thermal transport into new educational materials.</AbstractNarration>
