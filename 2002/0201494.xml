    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research project is concerned with three classes &lt;br/&gt;of problems of algebraic combinatorics. They are related to &lt;br/&gt;several aspects of Schubert calculus and its links with &lt;br/&gt;representation theory, inverse boundary problems, algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry, and physics. The first part is devoted to the inverse&lt;br/&gt;boundary problem for certain class of networks. This problem &lt;br/&gt;emerged in an attempt to explain, generalize, and simplify &lt;br/&gt;algebraic and combinatorial constructions related to &lt;br/&gt;representation theory of general linear groups and canonical &lt;br/&gt;bases. It is directly linked to the study of total positivity on&lt;br/&gt;Grassmann manifolds. The second part focuses on combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;and algebraic problems came up in quantum Schubert calculus, which &lt;br/&gt;deals with quantum cohomology of complex flag manifolds and &lt;br/&gt;corresponding Gromov-Witten invariants. The third part is devoted &lt;br/&gt;to a new approach to smoothness of Schubert varieties. The &lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleague suggest how to extend the notion &lt;br/&gt;of pattern avoidance in a general context of root systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the proposed research project is to investigate &lt;br/&gt;several problems that originally came from various areas, such as &lt;br/&gt;geometry and physics, and all share a discrete nature. The &lt;br/&gt;investigator suggests an approach to the problem of identification &lt;br/&gt;of networks by boundary measurements. These networks present a &lt;br/&gt;simple model for computer microchips. The problem can be rephrased&lt;br/&gt;as follows: "How to identify a microchip by external examination?" &lt;br/&gt;Another problem is related to certain geometric invariants that play &lt;br/&gt;a role in mathematical physics and algebraic geometry. These &lt;br/&gt;invariants are usually extremely hard to calculate. The &lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleagues suggest a new efficient technique &lt;br/&gt;for computing invariants of this kind. The last part concerns &lt;br/&gt;with a new approach to the classical problem of smoothness.</AbstractNarration>
