    <AbstractNarration>This collections project builds on the earlier successes of the web site, www.eskeletons.org, and&lt;br/&gt;dramatically expands the range of content at the site, the degree of student interactivity with the&lt;br/&gt;materials, and the amount of student interaction with each other. New laser scanning equipment&lt;br/&gt;along with dramatic improvements in existing high resolution X-ray computed tomography technologies allows the inclusion of species of a much smaller body size than those initially posted at the site, with the completion of the scans accomplished on a much faster timetable. This site provides students with a more complete understanding of the range of primate diversity and facilitates a great diversity of lab exercises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additions to the site include: 1) an expansion of the range of content including additional species, larger samples of particular species, and case studies that illustrate specific points, including forensic studies, and the option for researchers to post their datasets, 2) multiple entry portals that are age-specific and include separate portals for grade, college, and Gray learners, a "collaboratorium" link to serve as a clearinghouse for bringing together classrooms and instructors from different parts of the country, a series of tools and exercises that examine a variety of biological concepts and topics, 3) expansion of the current self-quizzing&lt;br/&gt;feature and the incorporation of prepared curriculum materials, PowerPoint presentations, and&lt;br/&gt;classroom exercises that can be downloaded by instructors for use in the classroom, 4) 3-D hard copy printouts to explore the use of anatomically accurate models at various scales as teaching tools, with a special emphasis on identification kits and comparative anatomy, 5) versions of the web site that can be downloaded&lt;br/&gt;for remote use on laptops and handheld PDAs, and 6) conformity with the NSDL Core Integration effort.</AbstractNarration>
