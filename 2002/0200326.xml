    <AbstractNarration>PI: Vladimir Sverak, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities &lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200326&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***************&lt;br/&gt;Proposal "Regularity Theory for Partial Differential Equations with&lt;br/&gt;Super-critical Nonlinearities" by V. Sverak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this proposal we suggest to study open problems in regularity&lt;br/&gt;theory of the following partial differential equations:&lt;br/&gt;1. strongly elliptic systems arising as Euler-Lagrange equations&lt;br/&gt; for multiple integrals in the Calculus of Variations;&lt;br/&gt;2. three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and some related&lt;br/&gt; model equations; and&lt;br/&gt;3. Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equations and Landau-Lifschitz equations.&lt;br/&gt;The regularity theory for these equations is mainly governed by two&lt;br/&gt;factors: the smoothing properties of the linearized operator,&lt;br/&gt;and the tendency of the non-linear part to produce singularities.&lt;br/&gt;In all the cases above there is a certain critical dimension&lt;br/&gt;below which (and, in many cases, at which) the natural energy&lt;br/&gt;estimates for the equations together with smoothing properties of the linearized operator&lt;br/&gt;are sufficient to guarantee regularity of solutions. For most&lt;br/&gt;of the equations above the critical dimension is two. The situation&lt;br/&gt;is more complicated above the critical dimension, when the specifics&lt;br/&gt;of each equation come much more into play, and not many results&lt;br/&gt;are known. The research will concentrate on problems in this&lt;br/&gt;relatively unmapped area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The study of regularity theory for Partial Differential Equations&lt;br/&gt;(PDE) is usually motivated by the following factors:&lt;br/&gt;(1) A good regularity theory can serve as an important check that&lt;br/&gt; a PDE is appropriate for modeling a given phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;(2) The more information we have about regularity of solutions of&lt;br/&gt; a given PDE, the better chance we have to design a good numerical&lt;br/&gt; method for calculating its solutions on a computer. It is no&lt;br/&gt; coincidence that the equations for which we can calculate solutions accurately are more or less exactly those for which we have a good regularity theory. (Confirming that "There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory".) Roughly speaking, the more we know about solutions, the easier it is the avoid some of the many pitfalls into which numerical simulations can fall.&lt;br/&gt;The work suggested in this proposal will address basic open problems&lt;br/&gt;in regularity theory for important classes of equations with strong&lt;br/&gt;non-linearities. Many of these equations (such as the&lt;br/&gt;Navier-Stokes equations, or the Landau-Lifschitz equations) are of&lt;br/&gt;considerable practical interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***************************************</AbstractNarration>
