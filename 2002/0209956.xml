    <AbstractNarration>0209956&lt;br/&gt;French&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award supports US-UK cooperative research and undergraduate research experiences in organic chemistry. The investigators are Andrew N. French at Albion College and Thomas Wirth at Cardiff University in Wales. The project involves the synthesis of chiral hypervalent iodine compounds. The goals are to design new chiral hypervalent iodine reagents, to determine their scope and limitations, and to investigate the possibility of catalysis. Undergraduate students will perform both synthesis and evaluation of the compounds, first during a semester in the US laboratory, then followed by a summer in Wales with the Wirth group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US researcher brings to this project expertise in synthesis and evaluation of chiral hypervalent iodine compounds. This is complemented by the similar UK's expertise in organoselenium chemistry and reagents. This research partnership will advance the chemistry of new reagents and their possible uses. It will also integrate education and research in an international environment. The US undergraduates will have an opportunity to conduct research in a laboratory at a major graduate institution and university in the United Kingdom.</AbstractNarration>
