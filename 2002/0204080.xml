    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204080&lt;br/&gt;Po Hu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigator intends to consider a &lt;br/&gt;circle of ideas in algebraic topology and its interactions &lt;br/&gt;with other areas of mathematics. One point of entry to &lt;br/&gt;these ideas is Real-oriented homotopy theory, which uses &lt;br/&gt;the complex conjugation action on the complex cobordism &lt;br/&gt;spectrum to approach homotopy groups of spheres. The method &lt;br/&gt;used here is a case of descent, which appears also in &lt;br/&gt;Voevodsky's homotopy theory of algebraic varieties. In this &lt;br/&gt;direction, the investigator is interested in algebraic &lt;br/&gt;cobordism, the algebro-geometric analogue of complex &lt;br/&gt;cobordism. Another closely related idea is that of Verdier &lt;br/&gt;and Grothendieck dualities, both in algebraic geometry and &lt;br/&gt;in equivariant homotopy theory. Yet another related but &lt;br/&gt;different kind of duality is Koszul duality. Using this &lt;br/&gt;duality, the investigator, jointly with collaborators, &lt;br/&gt;proved a version of Kontsevich's conjecture on Hochschild &lt;br/&gt;cohomology of k-algebras. This in turn is related to the &lt;br/&gt;question of deformation quantazation in mathematcial &lt;br/&gt;physics. Another area into which Koszul duality enters is &lt;br/&gt;the string topology of Chas and Sullivan, which gives &lt;br/&gt;another connection between algebra and homotopy theory. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator is also involved with another project &lt;br/&gt;related to physics, namely constructing geometric models &lt;br/&gt;of elliptic cohomology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of spaces that can be deformed&lt;br/&gt;continuously. In part, this proposal seeks to better &lt;br/&gt;understand maps between such objects by ``stable'' &lt;br/&gt;methods, i. e. considering a sequence of objects of &lt;br/&gt;all higher dimensions at once, and by using certain &lt;br/&gt;summetries upon them. Similar methods can also be used &lt;br/&gt;to study more rigid geometric objects, for example in &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry the solution sets of systems of &lt;br/&gt;algebraic equations. This leads in turn to the &lt;br/&gt;study of algebraic structures on an abstract level.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the related idea of string topology considers &lt;br/&gt;not just a space itself, but structures on the space &lt;br/&gt;consisting of loops in it. In particular, this is &lt;br/&gt;important to string theory in physics, which sees &lt;br/&gt;the universe as composed not of point-like particles &lt;br/&gt;but of loop-like ``strings''.</AbstractNarration>
