    <AbstractNarration>The mission of this CAREER program is (1) the creation of &lt;br/&gt;electrode structures that enhance the reactivity and stability of &lt;br/&gt;enzyme bioelectrocatalysts as implemented in high power-density &lt;br/&gt;biofuel cells, and (2) the integration of these and other fuel-cell &lt;br/&gt;devices into a broad spectrum of education and outreach to promote &lt;br/&gt;concepts of engineering product design and new energy systems in &lt;br/&gt;communities, schools, and universities.&lt;br/&gt; Biocatalytic fuel cell technology has the potential to &lt;br/&gt;provide electrical power in conditions where conventional fuel cell &lt;br/&gt;and battery technologies fail. While key characteristics of redox &lt;br/&gt;enzymes, including selectivity and room temperature activity can be &lt;br/&gt;exploited in, for example, physiologically implantable fuel cells, &lt;br/&gt;implementation of current biofuel cells is hindered by low catalytic &lt;br/&gt;activity and low stability of biocatalytic electrodes. This program &lt;br/&gt;addresses both of these issues. &lt;br/&gt; The model system to be studied is an oxygen-reducing &lt;br/&gt;electrode comprised of porous carbon coated with a crosslinked &lt;br/&gt;electrostatic adduct of laccase, an oxygen-reducing enzyme, and an &lt;br/&gt;electron-conducting redox polymer hydrogel. Engineering the porous &lt;br/&gt;support and its interface with the mediator/enzyme hydrogel to &lt;br/&gt;maximize gel distribution will improve enzyme utilization and &lt;br/&gt;increase current density. Support structures with porosities near &lt;br/&gt;95% and fiber diameter of order 1 micron or less, consisting of &lt;br/&gt;carbon nanotubes or electrospun carbon nanofibers, will be evaluated &lt;br/&gt;for impact on catalytic activity of the enzyme-hydrogel adduct. &lt;br/&gt;Gas-diffusion electrodes will be developed which take advantage of &lt;br/&gt;high-rate oxygen mass transfer in the gas phase to further increase &lt;br/&gt;electrode catalytic activity. The issue of stability will be &lt;br/&gt;addressed by encapsulation of the biocatalysts in porous silica or &lt;br/&gt;other metal oxide by means of sol-gel, aerogel, and wet gel &lt;br/&gt;processing. Through-film electron mediation will be enabled using &lt;br/&gt;carbon nanotubes and redox polymer mediators.&lt;br/&gt; Successful introduction of fuel cells to the marketplace &lt;br/&gt;depends on an available workforce of qualified scientists and &lt;br/&gt;engineers, and the acceptance of fuel cells by energy consumers. &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the chemical engineering discipline as a whole is currently &lt;br/&gt;undergoing a transition from process-oriented design to design of &lt;br/&gt;chemical products, of which fuel cells are an excellent example. &lt;br/&gt;This CAREER program addresses these needs through educational &lt;br/&gt;activities emphasizing new energy systems and engineering product &lt;br/&gt;design. Educational programs will include (a) A community-based, &lt;br/&gt;hands-on after school program in Energy Systems for disadvantaged &lt;br/&gt;high-school students; (b) An enhanced introductory Chemical &lt;br/&gt;Engineering course for first-year engineering students presenting the &lt;br/&gt;concepts of product design through reverse-engineering and team-based &lt;br/&gt;design projects; (c) An advanced Electrochemical Energy Systems &lt;br/&gt;course for graduates and senior undergraduates; (d) Immersive &lt;br/&gt;research training for secondary, undergraduate, and graduate &lt;br/&gt;students. &lt;br/&gt; This program advances the knowledge and understanding of &lt;br/&gt;biofuel cell design while promoting training and learning of chemical &lt;br/&gt;product engineering in the context of energy systems.</AbstractNarration>
