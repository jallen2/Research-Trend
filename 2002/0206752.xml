    <AbstractNarration>This project involves research in computed tomography, &lt;br/&gt;advanced Shannon sampling theory, and applications of sampling &lt;br/&gt;theory in tomography. It combines theoretical investigations, &lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis, and computational experiments with real world data. &lt;br/&gt;Computed tomography is a technique which produces &lt;br/&gt;images of the interiors of opaque objects. It is widely used &lt;br/&gt;in applications ranging from diagnostic radiology to research &lt;br/&gt;in quantum optics. Mathematically it requires the reconstruction &lt;br/&gt;of a certain density function from its line integrals. Ordinary &lt;br/&gt;tomography is not local: reconstruction at a point requires integrals &lt;br/&gt;over lines far from that point. For a number of applications it is highly &lt;br/&gt;desirable if only integrals over lines intersecting some region of interest &lt;br/&gt;need to be used ("region-of-interest tomography" or "local tomography"). &lt;br/&gt;Shannon sampling theory plays a fundamental role in signal processing. &lt;br/&gt;In tomography sampling theorems are used to identify efficient data &lt;br/&gt;collection schemes allowing for maximum resolution in the reconstructed &lt;br/&gt;image, as well as for error analysis of reconstruction algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's research in tomography involves interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;collaboration and is inspired by the question &lt;br/&gt;"What features of the density function can be stably recovered &lt;br/&gt;from a given collection of its line integrals?". Specific goals include &lt;br/&gt;the identification and analysis of optimal sampling schemes in &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional tomography; the analysis of reconstruction algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for three-dimensional local tomography with sources on a curve; &lt;br/&gt;further development and numerical analysis of high-resolution reconstruction &lt;br/&gt;algorithms in two dimensions, and development &lt;br/&gt;of a software package for region-of-interest tomography. &lt;br/&gt;The research in sampling theory is stimulated by applications in &lt;br/&gt;tomography and involves the development and application of new &lt;br/&gt;sampling theorems for non-equidistant data;&lt;br/&gt;estimates for the aliasing error in various settings; &lt;br/&gt;and further exploration of a generalization of the &lt;br/&gt;sampling concept in the framework of locally compact abelian groups which &lt;br/&gt;provides a unified view of a number of diverse applications.</AbstractNarration>
