    <AbstractNarration>The investigator proposes to use Kontsevich's space of "stable maps"&lt;br/&gt;(originally motivated by mathematical physics last decade) and related&lt;br/&gt;objects to tackle problems in a variety of fields. Traditionally, the&lt;br/&gt;space of stable maps has been studied using facts about the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;"moduli space of curves" defined by Deligne and Mumford. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;proposes to conversely study the moduli space of curves by studying maps&lt;br/&gt;from curves to varieties. Some of the proposed work will likely rely on&lt;br/&gt;Jun Li's recent extension of Kontsevich's work, the definition of a space&lt;br/&gt;of "relative stable maps" in the algebraic category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has long been known that nodal algebraic curves are a powerful tool in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. They can be thought of as surfaces with holes&lt;br/&gt;(picture a ball, a donut, or a french cruller) with pairs of points "glued&lt;br/&gt;together". Earlier this decade, ideas from string theory in physics led&lt;br/&gt;to the introduction of "stable maps", parametrizing certain kinds of maps&lt;br/&gt;of nodal curves into another space. This development has proved to be&lt;br/&gt;incredibly fruitful, sparking advances in a variety of fields. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator's area of research is the use of these ideas in the field of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, in particular with applications to many other fields&lt;br/&gt;(such as enumerative geometry, arithmetic geometry, combinatorics, and&lt;br/&gt;physics).</AbstractNarration>
