    <AbstractNarration>NSF Grant DMS-0204496&lt;br/&gt;Title: Geometric Analysis with Applications in Low Dimensions&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Richard A. Wentworth (Johns Hopkins University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes three research projects in the area of geometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;This work will produce new results on rigidity problems in low dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology, a better understanding of certain geometric structures on&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds arising from complex analysis, and a new approach to regularity&lt;br/&gt;issues for a type of minimizing subvariety. The first project deals with&lt;br/&gt;homomorphisms from fundamental groups of Riemannian manifolds to the mapping&lt;br/&gt;class group of a compact oriented surface. Examples arise as monodromy&lt;br/&gt;representations of surface bundles. Building on previous work in this area,&lt;br/&gt;the PI will use harmonic map theory to give a new proof of the finiteness&lt;br/&gt;theorem of Farb-Kaimanovich-Masur for lattices in higher rank Lie groups.&lt;br/&gt;New results for lattices in rank one groups will be obtained from these&lt;br/&gt;techniques. Symplectic Lefschetz pencils also provide especially&lt;br/&gt;interesting examples to which this method may be applied. The second project&lt;br/&gt;studies spherical CR structures on 3-manifolds. The PI will consider three&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the subject: uniformizability, rigidity, and compactness. The&lt;br/&gt;research will develop a new approach to these problems based on subelliptic&lt;br/&gt;analogs of harmonic map equations. A goal of the work will be to prove a&lt;br/&gt;compactness theorem which will have implications for new 3-manifold&lt;br/&gt;invariants. The third part of the proposal seeks to extend the method of&lt;br/&gt;Taubes to prove regularity results for certain calibrated rectifiable&lt;br/&gt;currents. This will provide a clarifying framework for a variety of&lt;br/&gt;geometric constructions that are of current interest. In addition to these&lt;br/&gt;new projects the PI will complete previous work on a conjecture of Bando-Siu&lt;br/&gt;concerning the Yang-Mills flow on higher dimensional Kaehler manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most fascinating subjects in contemporary mathematics is the&lt;br/&gt;study of spaces of dimensions three and four. These are also the most&lt;br/&gt;important from a physical point of view, since we live in three dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space, and dynamical behavior takes place in four dimensional space-time.&lt;br/&gt;The use of analytic techniques to understand the geometry and topology of&lt;br/&gt;low dimensional spaces continues to be a fruitful avenue of research, but&lt;br/&gt;there is much work still to be done. The focus of the PI's research in the&lt;br/&gt;area of the geometry of low dimensions and mathematical applications of new&lt;br/&gt;ideas in physics. &lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>
