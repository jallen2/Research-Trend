    <AbstractNarration>The Pacific Resources for Education and Learning (PREL) is requesting a planning grant for the development of a Masters of Science degree program in Program Evaluation as a distance learning program. The two-year program will offer approximately 36-semester credits for courses focused on program evaluation theory and techniques, research methods and statistics. The program will be modeled after PREL's distance learning MS degree program in Instructional Technology and Telecommunications. Courses will be offered in an asynchronous online format. Instruction will be self-paced and students will interact with faculty and each other through e-mail, videoconferencing and web boards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI believes that training in evaluation for personnel in educational settings will increase organizational capacity to assess the effectiveness of their educational efforts in STEM and lead to improved educational outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
