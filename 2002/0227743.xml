    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide partial support for the Conference on Quantum Phases at the Nanoscale (NANOPHASE) which will take place in Erice, Sicily, Italy, July 15-20, 2002. The Conference will consider recent advances in the study and applications of novel states in systems of nanoscale dimensions. Main goals are to bring together scientists that are playing key roles in this research field, along with young researchers, in order to evaluate recent developments, and to create visions that will guide future interdisciplinary research in nanoscale science and technology. The Conference will include approximately 30 plenary lectures and 100 participants. The core funding for this project is from the European Community. US support is provided by the Office of Naval Research and the National Science Foundation. The NSF support will provide travel expenses for young US scientists to attend the Conference, and later to visit selected European laboratories to explore and develop international collaborations in the area of nanoscience. The project is supported by the Western Europe Program of the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
