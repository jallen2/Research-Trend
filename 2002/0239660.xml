    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to perform exploratory research to assess the potential capability of wide-band radar in imaging FRP-confined concrete systems. The proposed work will scientifically test a novel idea of focusing through data processing of multiple scattering microwave signals in distinguishing different damage levels under the FRP layers. Capabilities including the optimization of resolution, penetration, and computing time will be tested. Owing to the novelty of the study, we will bring together the expertise from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Research Laboratory of Electronics, and Lincoln Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project would lead to an enormous scientific impact and lead us to the next phase of developing new imaging technologies for FRP-confined concrete systems. Such technologies are urgently needed, and would revolutionize industrial practices and better help ensure public safety. In view of the novelty and impacts of the subject, this proposal is considered suitable for an SGER grant.</AbstractNarration>
