    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies combinatorial problems which arise&lt;br/&gt;in various areas of mathematics. In joint work with R. Guralnick,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator examines branched coverings of Riemann surfaces&lt;br/&gt;whose monodromy groups are the symmetric and alternating groups&lt;br/&gt;S_n and A_n acting on subsets of a fixed size from the n-set. The&lt;br/&gt;main goals of this project are 1) to show that with a small and known list of exceptions, the genus of the covering surface must grow with both the number of sheets of the covering and the number of branch points, and &lt;br/&gt;2) to determine all such coverings for which the genus of the covering&lt;br/&gt;space is at most one.&lt;br/&gt;This project is one of the final steps in a program initiated by&lt;br/&gt;Guralnick and J. Thompson. In addition, the investigator continues his&lt;br/&gt;study of monotone graph and hypergraph properties which arise in V.&lt;br/&gt;Vassiliev's theory of finite type invariants of knots and ornaments.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the investigator continues his examination of order complexes&lt;br/&gt;of subgroup lattices of finite groups. He attempts to use topological&lt;br/&gt;methods to distinguish intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups&lt;br/&gt;from arbitrary finite lattices. With V. Welker, he investigates the&lt;br/&gt;topology of the order complexes of subgroup lattices of finite simple&lt;br/&gt;groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's main interests are in combinatorics, which is the&lt;br/&gt;study of discrete, usually finite mathematical objects. Combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;objects arise in various areas of applied mathematics and computer&lt;br/&gt;science, including communications and the theory of algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;complexity. Also, there are complicated nondiscrete mathematical&lt;br/&gt;objects which can be better understood by examining associated&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial objects. The investigator studies combinatorial objects&lt;br/&gt;which arise in this manner.</AbstractNarration>
