    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0207030&lt;br/&gt;Charles D. Frohman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will work on a number of projects in low dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology and its applications. These projects include &lt;br/&gt;investigating various properties of the Turaev-Viro&lt;br/&gt;invariants including the construction of universal &lt;br/&gt;polynomials relating the representation theory of the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental groups of manifolds to these invariants and the &lt;br/&gt;extension of these invariants away from the unit circle. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, the PI will consider, given a tetrahedral &lt;br/&gt;decomposition of a knot, how one may define a rigorous&lt;br/&gt;path integral over the space of cross ratios of the tetrahedra &lt;br/&gt;to compute the Turaev-Viro invariant of an integral surgery &lt;br/&gt;on the knot. The PI will also investigate the structure of &lt;br/&gt;the Kauffman bracket skein module in terms of the geometry &lt;br/&gt;of character varieties,and, more generally, use quantum &lt;br/&gt;invariants in the study of Dehn surgery on knots. Finally, &lt;br/&gt;this award provides support for the PI's graduate students &lt;br/&gt;to assist him in this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is a kind of geometry where the congruence &lt;br/&gt;transformations do not preserve metric properties such &lt;br/&gt;as distance and angle. The objects the PI studies are &lt;br/&gt;given as the result of gluing together polyhedra along faces. &lt;br/&gt;To know when two such objects are different topologically one &lt;br/&gt;needs to make measurements that are unchanged by &lt;br/&gt;topological congruence transformations. An example of &lt;br/&gt;such a measurement is the Euler characteristic of a &lt;br/&gt;surface, which is the number of vertices minus the&lt;br/&gt;number of edges plus the number of faces. If two surfaces &lt;br/&gt;are topologically equivalent they have the same Euler &lt;br/&gt;characteristic. One of the most celebrated theorems of &lt;br/&gt;geometry is the Gauss-Bonnet theorem which relates the &lt;br/&gt;Euler characteristic of any surface to a quantity &lt;br/&gt;computed metrically. Quantum invariants of three manifolds &lt;br/&gt;are like Euler characteristic, but more delicate. They &lt;br/&gt;are constructed statistically from a probability space &lt;br/&gt;made up of "states" which come from the description &lt;br/&gt;of how polyhedra are glued together to form the object. &lt;br/&gt;The PI's work is about relating these invariants to &lt;br/&gt;metric quantities derived from the geometry of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying object. To this end, the PI shows that &lt;br/&gt;the space of states can be replaced by spaces of &lt;br/&gt;geometric measurements made on the object. The goal &lt;br/&gt;of the project is to see how the geometry and topology &lt;br/&gt;of the object are determined by its combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;description in terms of polyhedra.</AbstractNarration>
