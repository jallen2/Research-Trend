    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a new biopolymer for primary metal removal and a poly-g-glutamic acid (g-PGA)diafiltration system for recovery of metals from dilute solutions. Preliminary results obtained to date indicate that this process holds considerable promise in effectively removing metals from dilute aqueous streams to within EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) acceptable limits. The research planned in Phase I is expected to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed g-PGA-PEDF(polymer enhanced diafiltration) system. It is also expected to show that g-PGA will achieve satisfactory metal uptake, that it will reduce representative metal concentrations to EPA mandated levels, and that it is amenable to suitable regeneration cycles. Finally, it is expected that the proposed process will satisfactorily treat the representative industrial wastewaters. These results will set the stage for the development efforts in Phase II that will further consolidate the efficacy of the process, and address scale-up and commercialization issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are in the processing of industrial wastewaters within established EPA guidelines.</AbstractNarration>
