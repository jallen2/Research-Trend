    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for renovation of small research/teaching laboratories at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL). The Laboratory has a history of accommodating NSF-funded research and training programs, but is increasingly limited by the deteriorating quality and poor insulation of its older buildings. The three aging laboratories to be improved have been in service since 1929 (Kidney Shed), 1938 (Halsey Laboratory) and 1963 (Rappaport Laboratory). The planned improvements and renovations include restoration of exterior surfaces and roofing, improved insulation, replacement of bench tops, cabinetry, plumbing and installation of seamless flooring. These renovations will maintain the informal seaside appearance of the buildings. MDIBL provides facilities for visiting investigators who use marine species for investigating the mechanisms of basic biological processes such as osmoregulation, reproduction and cell division, and offers educational programs for students at all levels from high school through postdoctoral. The recent initiation of the Center for Marine Functional Genomic Studies at MDIBL, which includes modern genomics and bioinformatics capabilities, has increased the demand for laboratory space and made the planned improvements a high priority for the Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
