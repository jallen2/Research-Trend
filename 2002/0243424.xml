    <AbstractNarration>Jay Switzer, Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri-Rolla, is jointly supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Solid State Chemistry Program for studies of nanostructured metal oxide semiconductors. Using various electrodeposition techniques, Switzer will prepare magnetic metal oxide superlattices, size-and shape-focused metal oxide nanostructures and epitaxial metal oxide layers on single-crystal silicon, gold, copper and indium phosphide. The metal oxides of interest include copper oxide, zinc oxide and iron oxide. Electrodeposition allows control of the applied potential, current and solution pH during electrodeposition, leading to control of the composition as well as the size and shape of the growing crystalline nanostructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These nanostructured crystalline metal oxides have widespread potential applications in electronics, specifically giant magnetoresistance, spintronics and anisotropic electronic components. This interdisciplinary research area will also provide training for students and research associates in the important area of nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>
