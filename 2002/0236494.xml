    <AbstractNarration>Many aquatic environments are characterized by episodes of low oxygen availability, or hypoxia. In some cases, hypoxia is part of natural cycles in oxygen; in other cases, the decrease in oxygen is a result of human activities. The effects of hypoxia on biological organisms are diverse and frequently dramatic. Severe hypoxia can lead to mass mortality of hypoxia-sensitive species or cause them to migrate to areas of higher oxygen. Other species are capable of surviving hypoxia due to a suite of morphological, behavioral, or physiological adaptations. At the biochemical level, one potential response is a change in gene expression that increases the organism's tolerance to hypoxia.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to examine hypoxia-inducible gene expression in the Gulf Killifish, Fundulus grandis, a common inhabitant of the estuaries along the Gulf of Mexico. The proposed research will identify targets of hypoxia-inducible gene expression and examine possible mechanisms that account for compensatory changes in gene expression. These measures are expected to reveal novel targets of hypoxia-inducible gene expression, thereby providing greater insight into the hypoxic response of fish and other organisms. By elucidating the biochemical and cellular response to low oxygen through basic research, it may be possible to better predict, and potentially mitigate, the adverse effects of hypoxia on aquatic organisms.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its scientific contributions, the proposed work will provide research training for students at all levels, from undergraduate through post-doctoral, including students from groups traditionally under-represented in the sciences. Such training will better position these individuals for careers in a variety of disciplines, including science education, biotechnology, and medicine. This award will also will help to build the educational capacity and research infrastructure at a major urban university (University of New Orleans), and synergies between the lead institution and collaborators may lead to unexpected advances in integrative biology.</AbstractNarration>
