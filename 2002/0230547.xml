    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230547&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Colgate, J. Edward&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Institute for Design Engineering and Applications: Fostering Creative Synthesis Across the Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science of Northwestern University plan to build a curriculum centered on engineering design. They will engage students in a series of meaningful and increasingly sophiscated design experiences throughout their undergraduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design curriculum draws faculty and students together from a variety of engineering disciplines, as well as the fine arts and social sciences. To facilitate this sort of cross-disciplinary effort, and to provide the necessary infrastructure for a large-scale collaborative design program, they plan to create a new entity, the Institute for Design Engineering and Applications (IDEA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IDEA will offer a variety of programs and courses in engineering design. These will include a Manufacturing Engineering degree program; large-scale, cross-disciplinary courses in new, more advanced area; and smaller, more focused offerings, such as courses based on national design competitions. It will also actively pursue a research agenda focused on product and process innovation. All research projects will be tied to the design&lt;br/&gt;curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
