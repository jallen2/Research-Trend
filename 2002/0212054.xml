    <AbstractNarration>0212054&lt;br/&gt;Carson&lt;br/&gt;LTREB&lt;br/&gt;We have underway a long-term, large-scale experiment that is addressing one of the primary&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses proposed to explain the maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical forests, namely,&lt;br/&gt;that mammals acting as herbivores, seed predators, and dispersers, are critical determinants of tropical&lt;br/&gt;tree diversity and abundance. This experiment is essentially a community-level test of the Janzen-Connell&lt;br/&gt;Hypothesis that predicts that the removal of ground-dwelling mammals will ultimately cause a&lt;br/&gt;decline in tropical tree diversity. Under this scenario, mammals preferentially prey on the juveniles of&lt;br/&gt;tree species that are abundant and ultimately keep these tree species in check.&lt;br/&gt;The study system is mature-phase tropical moist forest in central Panama on Barro Colorado&lt;br/&gt;Island (BCI) and the adjacent mainland (Gigante Peninsula). Since1994, we have monitored the&lt;br/&gt;consequences of excluding ground-dwelling mammals in 8 large (1355m&lt;br/&gt;2&lt;br/&gt;) fenced exclosures and&lt;br/&gt;adjacent unfenced control plots. Four pairs of treatment and control plots were established on BCI and&lt;br/&gt;4 pairs were located on Gigante in similar mature forest. Prior to initiating any treatments, we&lt;br/&gt;censused, measured, identified, and tagged all woody plants &gt; 50 cm in height in all plots. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, we quantified newly recruited seedlings in 28 smaller subplots in each large plot. In total,&lt;br/&gt;we have now followed the fate of more than 60,000 individual seedlings and saplings. Overall, the&lt;br/&gt;exclusion of mammals led to a substantial and sustained increase in seedling density.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this experiment to date suggest that excluding mammals may significantly&lt;br/&gt;increase woody species diversity of the seedling layer at least in the short-term (~10 yrs). Thus, our&lt;br/&gt;results contrast sharply with the community-level predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. We&lt;br/&gt;propose a new conceptual model that suggests that the consequences of the short term removal of&lt;br/&gt;mammals (2-25 yrs) from tropical forests, whether by experimental exclusion or more broadly via&lt;br/&gt;over hunting, will cause first an increase in woody species diversity and thereafter potentially a&lt;br/&gt;decrease (see Fig. 1). This result will first appear in the seedling layer (1-50 cm in height) and then&lt;br/&gt;move as a wave through larger size classes. The data to date, however, even after 7-years, remain&lt;br/&gt;equivocal. The short term increase in diversity clearly documented inside exclosure plots may be a&lt;br/&gt;transient effect of the 1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Specifically, the ENSO event&lt;br/&gt;caused a severe and extended dry season that increased seedling mortality. Because there was a higher&lt;br/&gt;seedling density inside the exclosures, these sites may have been buffered from the drought. We&lt;br/&gt;believe that it is imperative that we continue this experiment and monitor the next phase as the seedling&lt;br/&gt;layer moves into the small sapling size class. The conservation implications of this work are clear; the&lt;br/&gt;overexploitation of the mammalian fauna in many tropical forest reserves, parks, and fragments may&lt;br/&gt;have long-term negative consequences for forest diversity that may not become apparent for decades.&lt;br/&gt;It is only through long-term experiments that we can unequivocally separate out short-term dynamics&lt;br/&gt;from long-term forest trajectories.</AbstractNarration>
