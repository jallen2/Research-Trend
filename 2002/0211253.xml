    <AbstractNarration>0211253&lt;br/&gt;Elshall&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. Hassan El-Shall and Dr. Charles Beatty, both at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida and Dr. Mervat Hassan, the Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute, Cairo, Egypt. The three investigators plan to perform a systematic study of the factors and conditions that will lead to a significant improvement in the mechanical, thermal and solvent resistant properties of epoxy/clay nanocomposite used to manufacture tubesheet for high temperatures and chemically aggressive environments. Clay nanolayers are more effective in improving mechanical properties, thermal stability, dimensional stability and solvent resistance of the epoxy glassy matrix. Basic understanding of the mechanisms involved and role of clay properties are relatively unexplored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: &lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will benefit researchers in academic and industrial organizations in both countries. Polymers reinforced by low weight percentages (1-10 wt.%) of nanoscopically dispersed organically modified layered silicates are attracting the attention of researchers because of the unprecedented suite of new and enhanced properties relative to the unfilled resin. The PIs have considerable experience in studying minerals and have the appropriate background to carry out this research. The subject is of particular interest to Egypt where high value added products derived from inexpensive starting materials are in great demand. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
