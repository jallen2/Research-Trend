    <AbstractNarration>This small grant for exploratory research supports a geochemistry summer program for underrepresented minority students to be based at Colby College. The goal is to expose two high school juniors to the excitement of geoscience research while building their formal mathematics, chemistry, and earth science skills. The program is unique from past programs in that the students and their high school teacher are all participants in the program. Students will be selected from the High School for Engineering Professions program or the College preparatory Magnet program at Scotlandville Magnet High School in Baton Rouge, LA. The students will be part of ongoing research at Colby investigating the geochemistry of the Belgrade lakes watershed. The summer program will be the launching point for the students senior-year advanced science courses. This experimental program may serve as a model for other partnerships between under resourced high schools and four-year colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>
