    <AbstractNarration>This project will organize and host a Workshop for all Principal Investigators on NSF-supported network research and infrastructure projects. The ultimate goal of the Workshop is to foster a sense of community and collaboration among NSF-supported network research and infrastructure development Principal Investigators (PI-participants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will be held in Washington D.C. during the fourth quarter of 2002 and will feature three main components: plenary session presentations on current issues and topics in network research, discussion groups on these same topics and poster session presentations. The PI will develop and maintain a Workshop website to provide attendees with up-to-date information about the Workshop and to also serve as the final presentation archive for all talks and papers presented at the Workshop. This PI will also be responsible for handling all aspects of setting up the workshop, communicating with the PI-participants, and reimbursing the PI-participants.</AbstractNarration>
