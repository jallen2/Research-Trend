    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research studies the interaction between dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems and geometry. Work of Furstenberg, Mostow and Margulis&lt;br/&gt;shows that understanding certain dynamical systems is an&lt;br/&gt;important tool in the study geometric properties of symmetric and&lt;br/&gt;locally symmetric spaces. . One important property of symmetric&lt;br/&gt;spaces is that they have non-positive curvature. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator plans to extend this work in several inter-related&lt;br/&gt;directions. The study of symmetric spaces will be generalized to&lt;br/&gt;include more general spaces of non-positive curvature as well as&lt;br/&gt;more general maps between symmetric spaces. This raises the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of purely dynamical applications. The group of&lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold acts on the space of&lt;br/&gt;square-integrable Riemannian metrics, which is naturally an&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional space of non-positive curvature. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator will attempt to exploit these relationships to prove&lt;br/&gt;long-standing conjectures of Zimmer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems is an important and relatively young field of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics that investigates the evolution of physical or&lt;br/&gt;mathematical systems over time (e.g. fluid flow). New ideas from&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems theory such as chaos and fractals have had a&lt;br/&gt;profound impact on our perception of the world. One of the&lt;br/&gt;deepest and most influential mathematical applications of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems has been the study of geometric properties of&lt;br/&gt;spaces with "many symmetries". The proposed research will extend&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of this deep connection between geometry and&lt;br/&gt;dynamics.</AbstractNarration>
