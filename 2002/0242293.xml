    <AbstractNarration>Institution: DePauw University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EIA - 0242293&lt;br/&gt;PI: David A. Berque&lt;br/&gt;Title: REU Site - Research Experiences in Computer Science for Students at Undergraduate Institutions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project directly impacts twenty-four students (eight during each of three summers) by giving them first-hand experience with several of the most rewarding activities that characterize graduate study and research careers. These activities include: conducting research as part of a team, disseminating results, and participating in a community of scholars. Students have access to DePauw University's computing facilities, including a pen-based computing collaboratory that facilitates the study of multiple machine interfaces. This Collaboratory was recently enhanced with a NSF MRI grant and houses a 72" diagonal touch-sensitive electronic whiteboard, four 61" diagonal touch-sensitive plasma displays, and twenty Pentium student stations that use pen-based video tablets as their primary input device. The grant is also funding a display server, six handheld Windows-CE computers, and a database server for experimentation with wireless database access. The program is geared toward students enrolled at undergraduate institutions who have had little exposure to graduate departments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects are drawn from a number of fields of Computer Science including Text Summarization, Wireless Database Access, Multiple Machine Interfaces, Programming Language Pedagogy, and Assistive Technology.</AbstractNarration>
