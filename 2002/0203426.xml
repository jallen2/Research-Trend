    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0203113/0203426&lt;br/&gt;Burer, Samuel&lt;br/&gt;Iowa State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, a linear function of a symmetric matrix variable X is minimized subject to linear equality constraints on X and the essential constraint that X be positive semidefinite. Many mathematical optimization problems can be cast as SDP problems including linear programs, convex quadratic problems with convex quadratic inequality constraints, matrix norm minimization problems, and a variety of maximum and minimum eigenvalue problems. In addition, SDP has many applications in combinatorial optimization, engineering, statistics, and robust optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, there are numerous algorithms and codes available for solving SDPs, and these methods can be loosely grouped into two classes: second-order interior-point (IP) methods and first-order nonlinear programming (NLP) methods. The choice of which class to use for a particular application is determined primarily by&lt;br/&gt;problem size --- second-order IP methods are more efficient on small- to medium-scale problems while first-order NLP methods are better for large-scale problems.</AbstractNarration>
