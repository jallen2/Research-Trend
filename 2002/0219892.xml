    <AbstractNarration>We are in the midst of a new wireless revolution, brought on by&lt;br/&gt;the adoption of wireless networks for consumer, military,&lt;br/&gt;scientific and other applications. Wireless networks are a&lt;br/&gt;collection of terminals, or nodes, that are capable of&lt;br/&gt;transmitting and receiving information to nearby nodes using&lt;br/&gt;wireless access methods. The harsh characteristics of the wireless channel provide the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental challenge for communication between wireless network&lt;br/&gt;nodes. The key to reliable communication over wireless links is the&lt;br/&gt;exploitation of diversity, i.e., observation of the same&lt;br/&gt;information through different fading conditions. While it is&lt;br/&gt;possible to harness diversity by transmitting the same signal at&lt;br/&gt;different times or frequencies, the implied redundancy is costly&lt;br/&gt;from a bandwidth perspective. It has been shown, however, that&lt;br/&gt;introducing additional antennas at the source and/or&lt;br/&gt;destination enables diversity gain without compromise in&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth efficiency. Wireless network nodes may or may not be equipped with multiple&lt;br/&gt;antennas. How then, can they ensure reliable and&lt;br/&gt;efficient communication over the fading wireless channel? In this research, we investigate&lt;br/&gt;novel strategies by which nodes&lt;br/&gt;transmit and receive cooperatively, allowing&lt;br/&gt;exploitation of spatial diversity gain that would otherwise be&lt;br/&gt;unavailable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of structure in ``ad-hoc'' wireless networks is&lt;br/&gt;advantageous from the viewpoint of flexibility,&lt;br/&gt;re-configurability, and low management cost. The same lack of&lt;br/&gt;structure, however, makes the implementation of cooperative&lt;br/&gt;strategies challenging. It may be difficult, for example, to know&lt;br/&gt;which of the helper nodes have correctly received the message. In&lt;br/&gt;fact, it may be difficult to know which, if any, of the nodes can&lt;br/&gt;be enlisted as helpers. In this research, we solve these problems&lt;br/&gt;through the combination of distributed cooperative coding&lt;br/&gt;strategies, clever protocols, and sophisticated signal&lt;br/&gt;processing techniques. The PIs are leveraging their respective expertise in&lt;br/&gt;space-time coding and blind signal processing to devise&lt;br/&gt;practical strategies for cooperative communication in&lt;br/&gt;wireless networks. In addition, this research investigates the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental limits on the capacity of cooperative wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks through a study of information-theoretic bounds.</AbstractNarration>
