    <AbstractNarration>This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to Ohio State University is supported by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and Physics (MPS), and this proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 01-157). With this award, Professors Subramaniam and Lempert will synthesize, separate and manipulate single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using Coulomb crystals in plasmas. Coulomb crystals will be formed with SWNTs (or aggregates thereof) at the lattice centers either by introducing these into a striated DC glow discharge plasma or by synthesizing them in-situ, the latter being accomplished using carbon monoxide and a nickel catalyst. Because of the large aspect ratios, Coulomb crystals formed with SWNTs are expected to have unusual structure and properties, and they will provide a unique environment in which fundamental understanding of nanotube formation and growth processes may be studied non-intrusively using spectroscopic methods. The SWNTs suspended in the Coulomb crystal will be separated and manipulated depending on their electrical characteristics and size using Scanning Tunneling Microscope conducting tips. With this award, students will be trained in the synthesis and modification of carbon nanotubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single-walled carbon nanotubes suspended in Coulomb crystals will be prepared using an electric glow discharge plasma or by chemical methods from carbon monoxide in the presence of a nickel catalyst. Carbon nanotubes formed will be separated and manipulated based on their electrical properties and size using Scanning Tunneling Microscope conducting tips.</AbstractNarration>
