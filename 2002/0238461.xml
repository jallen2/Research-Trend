    <AbstractNarration>The use of multiple vehicles for the achievement of a joint task&lt;br/&gt;produces an operational setting with greater flexibility, robustness&lt;br/&gt;and coverage for a lower cost than is possible with single vehicles or&lt;br/&gt;stationary sensing networks. When the operational environment for&lt;br/&gt;such vehicles is complex, dynamic or contains operational hazards,&lt;br/&gt;individual vehicles must have the ability to respond quickly and with&lt;br/&gt;a high level of maneuverability. The focus of the work in this&lt;br/&gt;project is the development and implementation of control theoretic&lt;br/&gt;methods for coordination of groups of agile vehicles coupled through&lt;br/&gt;communication and operating in dynamic environments. The need for&lt;br/&gt;development of these methods arises when traditional design&lt;br/&gt;methodologies fail due to the operation of autonomous systems in the&lt;br/&gt;presence of a strong coupling between dynamic information flow and&lt;br/&gt;underlying system dynamics. The work will be primarily driven by&lt;br/&gt;challenges arising in the coordinated control of agile underwater&lt;br/&gt;vehicles, however, the results will also have high impact for tasks&lt;br/&gt;such as vision-based reconnaissance with aircraft in hazardous urban&lt;br/&gt;environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular combination of agility, dynamic communication and&lt;br/&gt;operational uncertainty requires that the communication and&lt;br/&gt;coordination elements of coordinated control be considered jointly&lt;br/&gt;rather than independently. The objectives of this project are (1)&lt;br/&gt;develop a deformable virtual structures approach to cooperative&lt;br/&gt;control which simultaneously captures the constraints imposed by&lt;br/&gt;limited communication and by vehicle constraints, and (2) develop&lt;br/&gt;dynamic communication structures that are sufficient to guarantee&lt;br/&gt;stability and coherence of the virtual structure. The group of&lt;br/&gt;vehicles is treated as a virtual, deformable body which is effectively&lt;br/&gt;underactuated due to velocity and motion constraints on the&lt;br/&gt;constituent vehicles and the physical constraints necessary to&lt;br/&gt;maintain communication between the vehicles. The constituent vehicles&lt;br/&gt;then become shape actuators for the evolution and motion planning for &lt;br/&gt;this new class of virtual mechanical systems with lumped, dynamic mass&lt;br/&gt;properties. The communication structure of the vehicles is assumed to&lt;br/&gt;be dynamic with the transmission connections treated as control&lt;br/&gt;variables. Construction of communication patterns is addressed via&lt;br/&gt;periodic sequences chosen using geometric and graph theoretic tools.&lt;br/&gt;The governing equations for the resulting virtual structure then&lt;br/&gt;describe an underactuated mechanical system with both discrete time&lt;br/&gt;actuation and oscillatory dynamics. Analysis and construction of&lt;br/&gt;feedback control for such systems is addressed by developing a new&lt;br/&gt;notion of averaging and state feedback. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research targeted to applications and implementation in underwater&lt;br/&gt;autonomous vehicles provides a captivating venue for education at all&lt;br/&gt;levels. The issues arising in such settings have broad theoretical&lt;br/&gt;implications as well as the appeal of hands-on experience. To&lt;br/&gt;strengthen and broaden interaction between control theory and fields&lt;br/&gt;such as biology and computer science, undergraduate courses in control&lt;br/&gt;theory will be redesigned to make the tools of control theory&lt;br/&gt;material accessible to students with non-traditional engineering&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds. Additional graduate courses will also be developed that&lt;br/&gt;provide not only a rigorous theoretical background in individual&lt;br/&gt;elements of control theory or communications but that also provide &lt;br/&gt;tools for developing interdisciplinary methods and application of&lt;br/&gt;those methods. Closely integrated with the research and educational&lt;br/&gt;components of the project are mentoring and outreach activities based&lt;br/&gt;around the construction of an interactive web site. This component&lt;br/&gt;involves not only undergraduate and graduate students as developers,&lt;br/&gt;but K-12 students and educators as active users and participants in&lt;br/&gt;the research lab. The site will contain scientific information about&lt;br/&gt;the different components of autonomous vehicle design and control as&lt;br/&gt;well as interactive tools for exploring application of control and&lt;br/&gt;communication methodologies to lab vehicles.</AbstractNarration>
