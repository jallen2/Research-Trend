    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to provide opportunities for undergraduates to participate in research in cellular immunology at a small liberal arts college. Students will be mentored by the Principal Investigator, a faculty member with dual training in immunology and science education, through the NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology Education Program (PFSMETE).&lt;br/&gt;Independent research is a powerful learning experience for undergraduates. Students are motivated to think creatively. They are given the chance to develop skills in experimental design, data analysis and interpretation, communication of findings and ideas with others, and to feel the sheer excitement of discovery. Undergraduate research can inspire students to pursue careers in science, and those who have the chance to work closely with a dedicated teacher and mentor may be more likely to include education as part of their future paths. Thus, the benefit of such experience goes well beyond the individuals involved.&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed will focus on the immune system of fish, a model well?suited for study in a small college setting. The adaptive immune system of fish is particularly interesting because it has many of the same cell types and functions as the mouse and human immune systems, yet is simpler and largely unexplored. Support will allow up to four students (during the academic year as well as summers) to work on characterizing the kinetics of zebrafish B cell (antibody?producing white blood cells) responses to immunization with innocuous proteins. For example, at various times after immunization with different proteins, students will determine the number and location of antibody producing cells in the main lymphoid organs, spleen and head kidney. This work has the distinct advantage of being easily divided into well?defined projects that will accommodate students of different levels of experience and knowledge. Students will communicate their findings the yearly college?wide research symposiums, as well as regional and/or national scientific meetings.&lt;br/&gt;Information on where and when B cell activation occurs during the primary immune response will provide a basis on which to begin to study secondary, memory cell mediated responses, those which are responsible for providing long?term immunity to pathogens. Learning how immune memory is developed and maintained in fish will be beneficial both to understanding the evolution of higher vertebrate immune systems, and to efforts in developing more effective vaccines for aquaculture. Having undergraduates be empowered contributors to this field of knowledge will be invaluable.</AbstractNarration>
