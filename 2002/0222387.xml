    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0071862&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Sumio Yamada&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two main subjects of the proposed research are Teichmueller&lt;br/&gt;spaces of compact Riemann surfaces of genus greater than one and&lt;br/&gt;the universal Teichmueller space, which can be identified with&lt;br/&gt;the diffeomorphism group of the circle. There is a natural&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian metric on both classical and universal Teichmueller&lt;br/&gt;spaces, called the Weil-Petersson metric. Although those spaces&lt;br/&gt;are not symmetric spaces, and there are no classical Lie groups&lt;br/&gt;acting on them isometrically (unlike the hyperbolic spaces with&lt;br/&gt;the special linear group), one notes that on the classical&lt;br/&gt;Teichmueller spaces the mapping class group of the Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surfaces acts isometrically, and that on the universal&lt;br/&gt;Teichmueller space the diffeomorphism group of the circle acts&lt;br/&gt;isometrically. These group actions on Teichmueller spaces can be&lt;br/&gt;utilized to construct flat bundles over various manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;its fibers being copies of Teichmueller spaces, which leads to&lt;br/&gt;the questions of strong/super rigidity. It is in this context&lt;br/&gt;that the investigator intends to use the Weil-Petersson geometry&lt;br/&gt;of Teichmueller spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of Riemann surfaces has been one of the central&lt;br/&gt;themes of modern mathematics over the last two centuries. In&lt;br/&gt;recent years, it has received renewed attention due to the&lt;br/&gt;interest created by the so-called super-string theory, with which&lt;br/&gt;physicists hope to construct the grand unifying theory (GMT) of&lt;br/&gt;graviation and quantum physics. The Teichmueller space, which is&lt;br/&gt;the subject of this investigation, plays an important role since&lt;br/&gt;it is known to parametrizes the "shapes of the string."&lt;br/&gt;Interactions between mathematics and theoretical physics have&lt;br/&gt;proved to be fruitful for both sides, and it is the&lt;br/&gt;investigator's belief that the proposed research may offer some&lt;br/&gt;new way of understanding the outstanding issues in the relevant&lt;br/&gt;scientific fields.</AbstractNarration>
