    <AbstractNarration>This grant explores how alloying additions and crystal structure influence magnetostriction in Fe and Fe-Ga based alloys. The influences of selected alloying elements with no d-shell electrons, with filled d-shells, and with partially filled d-shells are examined using single crystals and directionally solidified polycrystalline alloys. The influence of crystal structure is examined using a Fe-27.5 a% Ga alloy that can exist in a"-ordered (bcc), DO19-ordered (hexagonal), L12-ordered (fcc), and disordered-bcc structures. Another principal goal of this work is to examine a low cost thermomechanical processing approach to produce [001] textured Fe-Ga based polycrystalline alloys at low cost. The processing approach involves cold/warm deformation and recrystallization. An assessment of the influence of the amount of different process parameters on the nature of texture obtained in selected Fe-Ga alloys, and the mechanisms controlling the evolution of texture will be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The processing conditions that result in [001] texture are identified through a study of texture evolution during processing using Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM) in an SEM. The grant will result in an improved understanding of magnetostriction in Fe based alloys, and low cost and highly magnetostrictive alloys for use in sensor and actuator applications. The grant will also enhance the graduate and undergraduate educational, training, and recruitment activities.</AbstractNarration>
