    <AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to provide 25 experienced Massachusetts computer science teachers with the foundation needed to teach Java-based courses. This is done in anticipation of the shift in the Advance Placement as well as other courses, which should ultimately change many related offerings. Teachers attend a two-week workshop, followed by several school-year meetings, and then a culminating in a one-week summer workshop. During these, they will learn enough Java and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Design so as to feel comfortable and competent in teaching an introductory course using Java and OOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funded activities include creating a local peer group of computer science teachers and providing local computer science teachers with access to computing facilities, network connections and faculty expertise. In addition to addressing the local need, the project staff and participants develop materials and resources for dissemination to other secondary school computer science teachers. A nationally publicized conference is scheduled near the end of the project, during which experienced OOP teachers present their experiences, lesson plans and student work. Through the web page development, an Internet News Group and the regional conference, the project will reach a much needed national audience of secondary school computer science teachers.</AbstractNarration>
