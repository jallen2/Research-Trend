    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, Efficient Software Implementation of NPP Communications Processor, tests and analyses a prototype of a software implementation of a New Peer-to-Peer (NPP) asynchronous communication processor, which performs communications coordination in parallel with computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three areas of commercial applications for NPP are; Massively parallel High Performance Cluster Computing for real-time and non-real-time computations, Self-scheduling Parallel Programming with data distribution based on data availability, and Network-Oriented applications in finance, health, education, business and manufacturing. Efficient software implementation of NPP communications processor can dramatically decrease asynchronous communication latencies by several orders of magnitude, provide tools to dynamically debug and schedule portable parallel software systems, and provide infrastructure to produce robust software systems that can evolve dynamically. The size of this market opportunity is at least 1.2 trillion dollars over the next 10 years. NPP communications processor deployed through an API will dramatically impact this market.</AbstractNarration>
