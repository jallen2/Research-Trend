    <AbstractNarration>0209583&lt;br/&gt;Malik&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: &lt;br/&gt;This award is for support of a joint research project by Dr. F. Bary Malik, Department of Physics, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois and Drs. Mahmoud Hasan and Zuhair Shehadeh, both of the Physics Department at the Applied Science University, Amman, Jordan. Many large angle elastic scattering pion-nucleus data have remained unexplained for decades. Preliminary calculations done using Klein-Gordon equation (KG) indicate that these data could probably be explained provided one uses KG, rather than Schrodinger equation. The investigators will attempt to analyze many of these unexplained anomalous data using full KG equation. To facilitate such analyses, they propose to determine some of these potentials using an inverse scattering theory at a fixed energy developed by Shehadeh, Malik and others for cases where phase shift analyses are available. A detailed study of the solution of the KG equation in the presence of an external Coulomb potential will also be done. Additionally the underlying cause for the difference in p +- cross section and some inelastic scattering cross sections will be investigated. Concurrent to this investigation actual and virtual -excitation possibilities will be investigated. The inverse scattering theory at a fixed energy will also be applied to determine some alpha-nucleus potentials, which will then be used to analyze relevant data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring two senior and well-established scientists and a young scientist (Shehadeh) to collaborate on the problem of large angle anomalies of pion-nucleous and alpha-nucleus scattering. Each of these investigators have special expertise and analytical skill, thus the collaboration is likely to be beneficial for the scientific research and to the United States and to Jordan.</AbstractNarration>
