    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0204398&lt;br/&gt;Lambert,Katherine&lt;br/&gt;Songer,Tim&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Girl Scouts Hornets' Nest Council&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Girls Are IT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Girl Scouts, Hornets' Nest Council has been extremely active in &lt;br/&gt;the lives of adolescent girls in the Charlotte regional community for &lt;br/&gt;over 65 years. In the 21st century, this involves reaching out to &lt;br/&gt;widely diverse populations including recent immigrants from Asia, &lt;br/&gt;Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe. The success of these &lt;br/&gt;outreach programs depends on understanding the language and culture &lt;br/&gt;of the families in these communities and providing activities, &lt;br/&gt;support, and education that is deemed appropriate and relevant for &lt;br/&gt;all of the girls and adults involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Girls all over the country are faced with a range of opportunities &lt;br/&gt;that were not available to previous generations. Part of the Girl &lt;br/&gt;Scout mission is to help "girls gain insight into coping with &lt;br/&gt;contemporary moral and social dilemmas." Through a series of &lt;br/&gt;Girl-Scout-sponsored series of innovative and engaging programs, &lt;br/&gt;girls learn about preventing teen pregnancy, avoiding substance &lt;br/&gt;abuse, and understanding the influence of popular culture on creating &lt;br/&gt;faulty self-images regarding one's body and mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from ITWF, the Hornets' Nest Council will deliver this &lt;br/&gt;content in a new and innovative way - through a custom &lt;br/&gt;technology-based simulation entitled, "Making Choices." "Making &lt;br/&gt;Choices" will use a variety of technologies including wireless &lt;br/&gt;networked laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), &lt;br/&gt;printers, scanner and digital cameras to deliver a series of &lt;br/&gt;simulation activities (totaling 3-5 hours of instructions). A &lt;br/&gt;research evaluation study will assess attitudes of girls and women &lt;br/&gt;volunteers who participate in the standard programs versus the &lt;br/&gt;technology-based programs.</AbstractNarration>
