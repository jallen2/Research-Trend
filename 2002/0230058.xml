    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230058&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Crimp (Baumann) Melissa J.&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Enhancing Bioengineering Opportunities for Engineering Majors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University will plan a systemically reform of its undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;engineering programs and to enhance undergraduate student learning in the field &lt;br/&gt;of bioengineering. This project will be undertaken by an interdisciplinary team composed of faculty from the College of Engineering and the College of Education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will address the following factors that affect the sustainability of curricular-change initiatives: &lt;br/&gt; the role of strategic planning within the academic unit and at the institutional level; &lt;br/&gt; the leadership role of department chairs/heads and college deans; &lt;br/&gt; the role of faculty planning, faculty assessment and faculty autonomy; &lt;br/&gt; the system of values and rewards for individual faculty and for their academic units; and &lt;br/&gt; the role of constituent groups in establishing and evaluating educational program objectives and curricular outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bioengineering was selected as the focus for this reform effort because the State of Michigan recently announced a $1B.i.e., $50M/year, twenty-year. commitment to developing "A Michigan Life Sciences Corridor."</AbstractNarration>
