    <AbstractNarration>A collaborative grant has been awarded to Colorado State University under the direction&lt;br/&gt;of Dr. Mark Simmons; University of Colorado at Boulder under the direction of Drs.&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Ranker and Robert Guralnick; University of Northern Colorado under the&lt;br/&gt;direction of Dr. Neil Snow; and University of Wyoming under the direction of Dr. Ronald&lt;br/&gt;Hartman to produce an online distributed database of collections of vascular plants from&lt;br/&gt;the Southern Rocky Mountain Region (SRMR) and create an online, interactive&lt;br/&gt;identification key for vascular plants from the SRMR. The region covered by this project&lt;br/&gt;includes the entire State of Colorado, nine counties from southern Wyoming, and eight&lt;br/&gt;counties from northcentral New Mexico. The SRMR as defined here is a reasonably&lt;br/&gt;coherent ecoregion based on many shared geological and biological features, such as a&lt;br/&gt;number of mountain chains of Laramide orogeny, and many vascular plant species are&lt;br/&gt;restricted to this region. The SRMR is characterized by a rich diversity of ecosystems,&lt;br/&gt;ranging from semi-arid grasslands to the east, through montane pine, subalpine&lt;br/&gt;spruce-fir forests, and alpine tundra in the center, to canyons and mesas in the west.&lt;br/&gt;Unique wetland and riparian ecosystems exist on the plains, and nutrient-poor streams&lt;br/&gt;and lakes are frequent in the mountains. This broad range of ecosystems fosters a&lt;br/&gt;diverse flora, and is reflective of strong topographic forcings and steep climatic&lt;br/&gt;gradients. In addition to herbarium specimens at the Colorado State University&lt;br/&gt;Herbarium, the Rocky Mountain Herbarium, the University of Colorado Herbarium, and&lt;br/&gt;the University of Northern Colorado Herbarium, the distributed database will incorporate&lt;br/&gt;specimens from the SRMR that have been databased at other regional and national&lt;br/&gt;herbaria.&lt;br/&gt;The interactive key will be produced using Lucid Professional version 2.1, which is&lt;br/&gt;intended primarily for use online. Each of the approximately 4,000 species treated in&lt;br/&gt;the key will have associated windows describing its associated names, distribution,&lt;br/&gt;voucher specimens, and images. For the specimen database, a Federation of&lt;br/&gt;Databases that communicate with each other will be created. The Federation of&lt;br/&gt;Databases will be implemented by following the specifications suggested by the Digital&lt;br/&gt;Generic Information Retrieval group. Georeferencing is crucial for the production of&lt;br/&gt;static or dynamic species maps or atlases and for the import of data into Geographic&lt;br/&gt;Information Systems. All specimens will be georeferenced as part of this project. Each&lt;br/&gt;step in the process of creating linked databases and the interactive key will be&lt;br/&gt;documented. Clear documentation will also be provided for becoming part of the initial&lt;br/&gt;database federation to future investigators.&lt;br/&gt;The specimen database established by this project will document and locate the&lt;br/&gt;vascular plant diversity that currently exists in this region, and help track the rate and&lt;br/&gt;magnitude of change in biodiversity patterns caused by urban development over the&lt;br/&gt;next several decades. It will be useful for discerning areas of high biodiversity,&lt;br/&gt;determining the point of introduction and the spread of invasive species, locating&lt;br/&gt;voucher specimens, and as a coverage in geographic-information-systems applications.&lt;br/&gt;The educational implications of the proposal will extend the usefulness of this project.</AbstractNarration>
