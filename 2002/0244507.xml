    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research covers the fields of Cosmic Ray Physics, Black Hole Physics and Cosmology. The arrival and detection at Earth of cosmic rays with energies above 1018 eV will afford researchers an outstanding opportunity to study high energy physics in a new regime. New detectors such as HiRes and Auger and OWL will allow one to study physics at ultra- high energy. The PI proposes to use cosmic ray data that will soon be available to see if TeV scale gravity is a viable theory. These extra dimensional theories lead to enhanced rates for quasi horizontal showers as well as predictions for black hole production at the LHC. If such effects are seen, the PI intends to extract information about the extra dimensions, as well as the Hawking temperature from the data. The degree of correlation of the cosmic ray directions with candidate sources will reveal information about the intergalactic magnetic field and thus constrain the physics of the early universe. The PI also intends to study whether recent observations of line shifts in the quasar absorption spectra are due to possible time variation of the fine structure constant a.</AbstractNarration>
