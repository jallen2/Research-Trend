    <AbstractNarration>Hope College will host an REU program for six undergraduates in mathematics. Students will work in groups with one or two faculty members. Projects will be chosen from topics in algebra, probability and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary goals are to help talented and motivated students develop as mathematical researchers, to promote mathematics research as a career, and to have the participants achieve significant mathematical results in partnership with a faculty mentor. In particular, students will 1) learn new mathematics, 2) gain mathematical independence by learning to read math texts and journals, 3) solve an original mathematical problem, 4) learn to communicate mathematics verbally through presentation of problems and papers, and 5) write a mathematical paper suitable for submission to a journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will be eight weeks. Students will initially learn about their own projects and those of other students through introductory lectures given by the faculty researchers. Student research begins by reading background material either provided by the mentor or found through library research. The student pairs will then be given their own project or problem to solve. The mentors will be actively involved both in helping the students obtain the requisite background understanding, and as consultants and partners on the problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will present results at seminars during the last portion of the program. Students will be encouraged to present their work at professional meetings and in published form. Funds will be provided for travel to professional meetings. In each year of the program, at least four of the student participants will be recruited from outside Hope College. A significant effort will be made to recruit women and members of minority groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As indicated in the above description, the intellectual merit of this program consists in discovering new mathematics and developing viable mathematical models consistent with the constraints of collaborating with undergraduate students. The broader impacts, which is the main focus of this program, is to expose and engage undergraduate students to mathematical research and a stimulating environment so as to motivate them towards and prepare them for graduate school and a professional career in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
