    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on two areas of nuclear physics&lt;br/&gt;research. The first area is the realization of the basic&lt;br/&gt;symmetries of the strong interaction in the low energy&lt;br/&gt;interactions of the nucleon. The second topic is the&lt;br/&gt;determination of the Fermi coupling, a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;constant in electroweak theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encoded in quantum chromodynamics are various symmetries.&lt;br/&gt;In general these internal symmetries yield conserved currents&lt;br/&gt;that constrain the interactions of pions and nucleons.&lt;br/&gt;Our experiments address the signatures of chiral&lt;br/&gt;symmetry and isospin symmetry in low energy&lt;br/&gt;processes. The manifestation of chiral symmetry and&lt;br/&gt;isospin symmetry is rich and complex, and involves&lt;br/&gt;spontaneous symmetry breaking and explicit symmetry&lt;br/&gt;breaking. Further their realization is deeply connected with&lt;br/&gt;the origins of hadron masses, the effects of quark masses,&lt;br/&gt;and the special nature of the pion. Our proposed experiments&lt;br/&gt;on muon--nucleon interactions and pion-nucleon interactions&lt;br/&gt;will address two puzzles in our current understanding&lt;br/&gt;of how both chiral symmetry and isospin symmetry are realized&lt;br/&gt;in low-energy interactions of pions and nucleons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electroweak theory is the fundamental theory&lt;br/&gt;of electromagnetic interactions and weak interactions.&lt;br/&gt;The theory is based on two local symmetries which&lt;br/&gt;generate two gauge forces. Through the interaction&lt;br/&gt;between these gauge fields and the Higg's field the&lt;br/&gt;bosons mix and acquire mass, thus yielding the massive&lt;br/&gt;W, Z bosons that mediate weak interactions, and the&lt;br/&gt;massless photon the mediates electromagnetic interactions.&lt;br/&gt;The interactions are determined by three parameters,&lt;br/&gt;which themselves are fixed by measurements of the fine&lt;br/&gt;structure constant, the Z boson mass, and the Fermi coupling&lt;br/&gt;constant. We are undertaking a new measurement of the&lt;br/&gt;positive muon lifetime to obtain an improved determination&lt;br/&gt;of the Fermi coupling constant. The Fermi coupling constant&lt;br/&gt;is an input parameter in all electroweak calculations,&lt;br/&gt;and combined with other quantities it permits&lt;br/&gt;both important tests of the standard model and key constraints&lt;br/&gt;on the physics beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experimental research is conducted with beams&lt;br/&gt;of pions and muons at the TRIUMF Laboratory in Vancouver,&lt;br/&gt;Canada, and the Paul Scherrer Institute near Zurich, Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;The relatively small-scale of our experiments offers both broad&lt;br/&gt;opportunities and excellent training for undergraduate students,&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>
