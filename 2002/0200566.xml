    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0200566&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mario Bonk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigation of non-smooth phenomena is one of the &lt;br/&gt;main subjects of contemporary Geometric Function Theory.&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to study metric structures &lt;br/&gt;on spaces and appropriate nonsmooth classes of mappings&lt;br/&gt;between these spaces such as bilipschitz, quasisymmetric,&lt;br/&gt;quasiconformal, and quasiregular mappings. Many basic &lt;br/&gt;questions in this area are open. For example, a &lt;br/&gt;satisfactory characterization of two-dimensional metric &lt;br/&gt;spheres that are quasisymmetric to the standard&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional sphere is unknown. This problem is relevant&lt;br/&gt;in connection to Thurston's hyperbolization conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;Progress in the field relies on a combination of &lt;br/&gt;geometric and analytic methods that were recently &lt;br/&gt;established in the analysis of metric spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular question of how to map surfaces has a &lt;br/&gt;long history. Cartography aims to preserve particular &lt;br/&gt;features of a surface under suitable mappings. This &lt;br/&gt;has lead to major mathematical developments. In the &lt;br/&gt;nineteenth century basic problems of surveying and &lt;br/&gt;geodesy motivated Gauss to build up a systematic theory&lt;br/&gt;of curved surfaces which laid the foundation of modern &lt;br/&gt;differential geometry. For the investigation of wrinkled&lt;br/&gt;and fractal objects new mathematical tools are&lt;br/&gt;required. A clear understanding of the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;concepts for describing nonsmooth phenomena will benefit&lt;br/&gt;research in other areas and lead to practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;For example, methods for attacking the theoretical &lt;br/&gt;questions of quasiconformal parametrizations of spheres&lt;br/&gt;were also used for finding algorithms for mapping the &lt;br/&gt;surface of the human brain. One of the aims of the project &lt;br/&gt;is to involve graduate students in this promising and &lt;br/&gt;important area of mathematical research.</AbstractNarration>
