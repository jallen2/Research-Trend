    <AbstractNarration>The long term goal of this project is to develop a dynamical&lt;br/&gt;theory of how neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) generate a&lt;br/&gt;tuned response to multiple (rather than single) features of a&lt;br/&gt;visual stimulus, and how these responses are spatially integrated&lt;br/&gt;across the cortex to generate more global information about a&lt;br/&gt;visual scene. A primary focus of the work is to extend current&lt;br/&gt;network models of orientation tuning to incorporate the fact that&lt;br/&gt;V1 cells are also selective for spatial frequency. This is&lt;br/&gt;motivated by the considerable physiological and psychophysical&lt;br/&gt;evidence suggesting that cortical circuits carry out a localized&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional Fourier decomposition of a stimulus rather than&lt;br/&gt;simply performing local edge detection. Optical imaging of the&lt;br/&gt;surface of cortex has revealed an intricate relationship between&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of orientation and spatial frequency preferences&lt;br/&gt;across cortex. How correlations between these two feature&lt;br/&gt;preference maps is manifested by the local and long-range&lt;br/&gt;circuitry of V1, and the consequences for the large-scale&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of V1 is also investigated.&lt;br/&gt; The primary visual cortex (V1) located at the back of the&lt;br/&gt;brain is the first cortical area to process visual information&lt;br/&gt;received from the eyes. One of the classical results regarding&lt;br/&gt;the function of neurons (brain cells) in V1 is that they analyze&lt;br/&gt;very local features of a visual image, that is, they carry out&lt;br/&gt;image decomposition. (For example, V1 cells are sensitive to the&lt;br/&gt;orientation of an edge representing the boundary between a light&lt;br/&gt;and dark region of the image. This discovery by Hubel and Wiesel&lt;br/&gt;led to the Nobel prize in medicine). A very important question&lt;br/&gt;that follows from this is how our coherent perception of the&lt;br/&gt;world is reconstructed. Until recently, it was thought that the&lt;br/&gt;local information from cells in V1 was passed through higher&lt;br/&gt;order processing stages in the brain where cognition occurs.&lt;br/&gt;However, it is becoming clear that long-range circuitry within V1&lt;br/&gt;could itself contribute to the process of reconstruction. The&lt;br/&gt;basic aim of the proposal is to investigate this process by&lt;br/&gt;developing a large-scale mathematical model of primary visual&lt;br/&gt;cortex that incorporates the latest anatomical data regarding its&lt;br/&gt;internal circuitry. Understanding how early stages in the visual&lt;br/&gt;brain encode images has important applications to information&lt;br/&gt;technology (such as the development of artificial vision systems)&lt;br/&gt;and biotechnology (such as the development of an artificial&lt;br/&gt;prosthesis for the visually impaired). In the latter case it&lt;br/&gt;might be possible one day to artificially stimulate primary&lt;br/&gt;visual cortex to induce a visual sensation, rather like a&lt;br/&gt;controlled visual hallucination.</AbstractNarration>
