    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to establish the&lt;br/&gt;technical and economic feasibility of a novel technology to utilize reactive distillation to&lt;br/&gt;produce vinyl ethers, the production of which is otherwise plagued by equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;limitations and side reactions. The program will combine the catalysis expertise of KSE,&lt;br/&gt;Inc. with the reactive distillation strengths of the Department of Chemical Engineering of&lt;br/&gt;the University of Massachusetts, to develop the new technology. The resulting work&lt;br/&gt;product will not only advance the practice of the field of organic synthesis, but also will&lt;br/&gt;provide useful case study examples for academic teaching and research.&lt;br/&gt;The Phase I program requires completion of three tasks. First, research is needed&lt;br/&gt;to improve the catalyst compositions to promote vinyl ether synthesis, to match distillation&lt;br/&gt;requirements. Second, laboratory reactor tests, including reactive distillation, must be&lt;br/&gt;performed to guide catalyst improvement and to demonstrate success of the technology.&lt;br/&gt;Third, design and competitive economic analyses are required to complete the feasibility&lt;br/&gt;assessment. The proposed research will solve a major problem in vinyl ether synthesis,&lt;br/&gt;reducing byproducts and eliminating solvents. It will also provide valuable teaching and&lt;br/&gt;research tools for the practice of reactive distillation.&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications of the reactive distillation technology will allow&lt;br/&gt;production of vinyl ethers as an important building block in organic synthesis,&lt;br/&gt;eliminating the energy intensive acetylene route based on World War II technology. It&lt;br/&gt;allows new synthesis methods to be used, by eliminating critical equilibrium and&lt;br/&gt;byproduct constraints.</AbstractNarration>
