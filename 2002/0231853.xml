    <AbstractNarration>Teams consisting of a cooperating teacher, a Fellow and a mathematics or natural sciences faculty member are working to introduce hands on inquiry science curriculum materials into four school districts that vary widely in the demographics of their student body and in their environment, ranging from a high needs urban district with a very high percentage of students on free or subsidized lunches to rural schools, to schools in affluent suburbs. Collaborative professional development is being provided during an intense six week summer session with follow-up during the academic year. GK-12 Fellows and their cooperating K-12 teachers are learning hands-on inquiry teaching strategies and how to engage K-12 students in long-term research projects. They are working together to use these strategies in the classroom. The broad impacts of these activities include benefits to the students, the teachers and the institutions involved. The Fellows are developing skills, such as improved teaching abilities, useful in their role as future faculty. They are gaining an appreciation of their ability to contribute to improving K-12 math and science education and the benefits of doing so; establishing patterns of behavior that will result in their future support of K-12 math and science education throughout their professional careers. The university is building strong connections between graduate training in mathematics and the natural sciences with K-12 and undergraduate math and science education. It is strengthening existing ties with local school districts. The K-12 students are beginning to realize their own potential to follow a career in science by working with graduate student scientists who provide strong role models. Other benefits include improved K-12 student understanding of mathematics and science and of scientific methods of inquiry. Part of the support for this project comes from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Graduate Math and Science Teaching Education Reform&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Bowling Green State University&lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PI: William Midden, Lena Ballone, Stephen Van Hook&lt;br/&gt;Partner School Districts: Springfield Local, Toledo Public, Wood County, Bowling Green City&lt;br/&gt;Funding: $1,359,290 total for 3 years&lt;br/&gt;# of Fellows/year: 5 Graduate year 1, 10 Graduate in years 2 &amp; 3&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Urban, suburban, rural&lt;br/&gt;Grade Band: K-12&lt;br/&gt;Disciplines Involved: mathematics, biology, physics, psychology, geology, chemistry</AbstractNarration>
