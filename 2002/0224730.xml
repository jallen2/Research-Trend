    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oak Lake Field Station is a 570 acre teaching and research facility operated by South Dakota State University in northeastern Brookings County, South Dakota. Utilization of Oak Lake Field Station for research activity by local and visiting faculty and students has increased over 400% over the past seven years. This increase has occurred in response to better advertisement of field station facilities and greater local funding for faculty and student research. The station recently underwent a facility review, funded by the National Science Foundation. Visiting reviewers recommended expansion and improvement of existing laboratory and classroom facilities to meet future needs. The objective of this effort is to improve research laboratory, classroom and computer room facilities at Oak Lake Field Station, South Dakota. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds provided by the National Science Foundation will be supplemented with matching dollars by local sources to remodel and expand the existing classroom and laboratory building of Oak Lake Field Station. This construction will provide a 637 sq. ft. laboratory, 918 sq. ft. classroom and 294 sq. ft. office/computer room facility. Lab space will increase 445%, classroom space will increase 266% and office/computer space will increase 188% relative to existing facilities. Overall, building square footage will increase from 1935 ft2 to 2679 ft2. Building renovations will include total enclosure of the existing field laboratory and classroom, furnace installation to allow four-season use, new lab countertops, storage cabinets, chemical shower and eyewash station, telecommunications wiring, sinks, accommodations for digital projection, classroom to seat 32 students, expanded field library shelving, storage area and expanded office/computer room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oak Lake Field Station provides a unique site to study native tallgrass prairie and pothole environments within the northern plains. Located within two hours of several regional universities, colleges and public schools, this remodeled facility will provide a location for field courses, field trips, student field projects, graduate and faculty research, symposia, professional meetings and retreats. Field Station staff conservatively estimate a tripling of field station instruction and research utilization as a result of this remodeling effort. Instruction and research efforts will now be possible throughout the year. Expanded classroom and laboratory facilities will allow simultaneous use by larger groups of students and researchers. Telecommunications capabilities will be improved, allowing more efficient communication of field station programs and data to other academic institutions and organizations. These enhancements will greatly improve student learning opportunities and research productivity within a modest budget.</AbstractNarration>
