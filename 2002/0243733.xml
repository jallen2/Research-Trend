    <AbstractNarration>0243733 Chandrasekar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a five-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Colorado State University-CHILL National Radar Facility (CSU-CHILL). The program will support 6 students each summer and will provide research opportunities in areas such as high power transmitters and power modulators; microwave devices; low power Doppler receivers; IF systems; radar control systems; and ASIC design. Students that have completed their junior year will be recruited nationwide. Extensive support in terms of radar experiments, data, and computer links will be provided for the students to continue their work at their home institution as part of their senior projects if desired. At the end of the program students will write a formal report and present their results in a seminar series. CSU-CHILL staff along with faculty participants will enable the students to acquire a strong theoretical and experimental background while participating in team-oriented and individual research projects.</AbstractNarration>
