    <AbstractNarration>Communication protocols form an integral part of many complex &lt;br/&gt;software systems. In many such systems, protocols' impact on&lt;br/&gt;system dependability far exceeds the fraction of the total &lt;br/&gt;number of lines of code devoted to their implementation. &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, there exists virtually no systematic approach for &lt;br/&gt;design and evaluation of protocols that considers dependability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previously, we have developed a systematic, semi-automatic &lt;br/&gt;approach for validation of communication protocols. Our approach &lt;br/&gt;uses semi-formal representations of protocols and efficient search &lt;br/&gt;(forward search as well as fault-oriented test generation) to &lt;br/&gt;analyze protocols over the entire range of scenarios, including &lt;br/&gt;external events, faults (such as loss of packets, communication &lt;br/&gt;link failures, loss of state in communication nodes, and so on), &lt;br/&gt;as well as network topologies. The effectiveness of our approach &lt;br/&gt;has been demonstrated via its application to a varied range of &lt;br/&gt;protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we will undertake three main tasks. First, we &lt;br/&gt;will extend our previously developed framework to compute values &lt;br/&gt;of appropriate dependability metrics for existing protocols of &lt;br/&gt;interest to the NASA and the HDCCSR community. Second, we will &lt;br/&gt;develop the first systematic approach to design new protocols that &lt;br/&gt;satisfy desired dependability criteria. Finally, we will use &lt;br/&gt;the testbed provided by NASA in conjunction with the expertise &lt;br/&gt;and software made available by NASA and other HDCCSR researchers &lt;br/&gt;to fine-tune our approaches and to demonstrate that: (i) accurate &lt;br/&gt;values of dependability metrics can indeed be computed for &lt;br/&gt;existing communication protocols using a systematic, semi-&lt;br/&gt;automatic approach, (ii) new protocols can be designed in a &lt;br/&gt;systematic, semi-automated manner to meet desired dependability &lt;br/&gt;criteria, and (iii) enhancements in the dependability of &lt;br/&gt;communication protocols can indeed significantly enhance the &lt;br/&gt;dependabilities of many software-hardware systems of interest to &lt;br/&gt;NASA and the HDCCSR community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to above technical contributions, the proposed &lt;br/&gt;research will have broader impact on society. First, results of &lt;br/&gt;the proposed research will enable improvements in dependability &lt;br/&gt;of critical infrastructure, such as the air-traffic control &lt;br/&gt;system. Second, the research will develop new approaches and &lt;br/&gt;practical case studies that will provide us with a unique &lt;br/&gt;opportunity to educate a large and diverse student body in &lt;br/&gt;techniques for development of dependable protocols and systems.</AbstractNarration>
