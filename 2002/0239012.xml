    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0239012&lt;br/&gt;P. DOYLE, MIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is an integrated approach to education and research of transport phenomena with an emphasis on polymer dynamics. The research portion focuses on a fundamental understanding of polymer collisions. DNA will be used as a model polymer to directly observe the collision dynamics of polymers with obstacles. A novel approach to producing dynamic obstacles will make use of self- assembling magnetic colloids, in addition to added polymers. This will allow for a wide variety of collision dynamics to be explored. Stochastic simulations will be developed which take into account the microstructure and dynamics of the obstacles themselves, in addition to the DNA. Multiscale simulations will be developed for simultaneous simulation of DNA-polymer-colloidal collisions. This work will have direct impact on the fields of DNA separations in lab-on-chip devices where collisions ultimately lead to size separation and also understanding the rheology of complex liquids where collisions can take the form of transient entanglements. &lt;br/&gt;In parallel to the research portion of this project, an integrated education plan will be developed. Undergraduates will participate in micro research projects that will produce modules which will be used to enhance graduate courses taught by the PI. These modules will stress molecular aspects of transport phenomena. A new graduate course covering topics in biology, polymers and engineering will be developed. A new undergraduate Hands on ChE workshop recently introduced by the PI will be further developed. Science teachers from the KIPP Academy (for at-risk grade school children) will be mentored and an annual workshop for them.</AbstractNarration>
