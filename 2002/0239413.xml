    <AbstractNarration>0239413&lt;br/&gt;Sukow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of this NSF CAREER proposal is to strengthen the undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;physics program at Washington &amp; Lee University through an integrated program of research and education emphasizing optics and lasers. The main objective is to develop and support a stronger research culture through enhancing the experimental research program in semiconductor laser dynamics. This research program will consider current and exciting topics involving dynamical instabilities and synchronization in diode lasers due to delayed optical feedback, a subject of fundamental interest and technological importance. All research projects will be undertaken with undergraduate research assistants and a high school student intern. This environment will produce significant scientific advances while taking advantage of the special strengths of a liberal arts institution as a venue for mentoring undergraduates. Enriching the research environment is a substantial program of visitors and collaborations. Supplementing the research program will be the development of a new Advanced Research Methods course, designed to create a bridge between the classroom and the research lab. Existing classes will be enhanced with new laboratory exercises and real-time demonstrations, to help create interest in lasers and optics while enriching those courses for all students. Finally, the impact of the lab exercises, demos, and student expertise developed in the undergraduate setting will be extended to the local educational community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Intellectual merit: The proposed research addresses current and important questions in laser physics and nonlinear dynamics. The research is organized around realistic experimental issues in dynamics and synchronization of semiconductor lasers, and emphasizes a novel approach based on simultaneous time-domain measurements of two optical signals. The results of the proposed research will advance knowledge in laser dynamics with application to communications, and also in the broader area of time-delayed feedback systems. The PI has significant experience and an established record of accomplishment in this research area. Washington and Lee University has provided and continues to provide excellent support, adding to the feasibility of the proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts: This CAREER proposal thoroughly integrates research and education. Undergraduate and high school student participation in research every year provides scholarly activity in a close, mentoring environment. Students will be exposed to the greater scientific community through attendance and presentations at conferences, as well as an on-site schedule of collaborators, visitors, and international experts from academia, government, and industry. The research and education infrastructure at Washington and Lee will be strengthened through curricular development, which will increase crossover between the classroom and the laboratory, and will reform existing courses by infusing them with hands-on laboratory work emphasizing real applications. Traditionally underrepresented groups will be actively engaged through on-campus programs and outreach to the local educational community, activities that will be used as teacher training opportunities as well. Societal benefit may be realized through the application of research results applied to faster and more efficient optical communication systems, a well-trained technical workforce, and a more scientifically literate public. All outcomes will receive wide dissemination at appropriate meetings and by electronic means.</AbstractNarration>
