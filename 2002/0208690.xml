    <AbstractNarration>The field of Ichthyology (fishes) through previous NSF funding has accumulated a database of fish names and related information as the Catalog of Fishes (published in 1998 and on-line at http:www.calacademy.org/research); it is the most comprehensive informational database for any animal group. This database summarizes the information known for about 50,000 described species of fishes (more than all other vertebrates combined), of which about 30,000 are valid species. However, there are still many described species for which we do not know the status (valid species or a synonym or duplicate name), and new species of fishes continue to be described at a rate of about 300 per year. Ichthyology is changing, and many of the scientists of the 1950s-1980s are nearing the end of active careers. They have much information in files and accumulated unpublished data that can be published in annotated checklists - a summary of the knowledge for the groups of fishes that they have spent their career studying. Also, the naming of animal groups is directed by a "Code" to which all scientists worldwide use, and a new edition of the code taking effect in 2000 allows for the creation of a list of available names for a discipline and the purging of other names from further consideration. The present project has two goals: it will allow the Catalog of Fishes staff to work directly with specialists so that they can author annotated checklists for the groups for which they are the world specialist, and these will be published by the California Academy of Sciences and place on the www. Following this, the List of Available Names in Fishes will be assembled and placed on the www, and steps will be taken to have this list approved by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. The Catalog of Fishes staff will prepare the manuscripts for the specialists - the specialist's role will primarily be to edit and add information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The primary way information about animals and plants is organized is around scientific names provided by taxonomists. Traditional taxonomists, the monographers and revisers responsible for the major taxonomic advances over the past half-century are an aged group, many over 60 years of age. Many of them harbor a wealth of information in their heads and personal files on status of species, on type specimens (the original specimens used by the first author to describe the species), and related information. This project is therefore opportunistic. A preliminary survey of specialists revealed a strong and enthusiastic willingness to participate. The present project will be the first test cast of preparing a "List of Available Names" under provisions of the Code. Such lists will add stability to names. The checklists will consolidate our level of knowledge and at the same time reveal taxonomic and geographic areas in need of further investigation. This information on fishes is important for biodiversity studies, for molecular studies, for conservation needs, for commerce, and for a framework to house the accumulated knowledge about fishes.</AbstractNarration>
