    <AbstractNarration>Mississippi State University (MSU), an NSA Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education (COE/IAE), will work with Jackson State University (JSU) and the University of Kansas (KU) though a collaborative and cooperative effort to increase these two institutions capacity in information assurance and to strengthen the COE/IAE program at MSU. The faculty from all three institutions will work to develop an IA curriculum at JSU and KU with an expectation that both schools will apply for COE/IAE status during academic year 2004-2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These collaboration efforts are intended to be beneficial to all three parties in not only developing an IA program at two universities that currently do not have one but also in strengthening the program at MSU by broadening its research effort, increasing minority representation in its PhD program, and by enhancing its instructional course content. MSU will additionally expand its IA offerings by involving the College of Business and the College of Arts and Sciences in our research. This proposal initiates an innovative programs that will promote student research and publication in this area.</AbstractNarration>
