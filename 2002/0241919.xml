    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;0241919&lt;br/&gt;Paulraj, Arogyaswami&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work in multiple antenna communications (MIMO systems) has cleverly exploited rich scattering in the environment to build wireless links with multiple antennas that offer huge capacity gains. Systems studied so far are narrowband systems. Use of very wideband signals offers new ways to exploit rich scattering. Also, sensor systems that exploit rich scattering have attracted little attention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will explore multiple antenna signal processing applications for wireless communications and sensor systems that use wideband signaling in a rich scattering channel. Multiple antennas, wideband transmission and rich scattering, each provide a number of leverages, which must be carefully exploited. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While multiple antenna systems and rich scattering provide increased capacity, diversity and sensitivity, wideband transmission offers increased diversity, and, in the case of sensors, better resolution. The proposed research will study: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Signal processing in wireless communications and sensor systems. &lt;br/&gt;2. Fundamental performance limits (ergodic/outage capacity, etc), space-time coding and receiver design for multiple antenna communication systems with wideband signaling in rich scattering environments. &lt;br/&gt;3. Fundamental limits to resolution in sensor systems exploiting rich scattering and wideband signaling</AbstractNarration>
