    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0204193&lt;br/&gt;Kreitz, Christoph&lt;br/&gt;Cornell U &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactively guided proof assistants have been successfully used in the formal design, verification,&lt;br/&gt;and optimization of software and hardware systems. Because of their expressive logics, they are&lt;br/&gt;more generally applicable than fully automated tools, yet at a much lesser degree of automation.&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to combine the expressive power of proof assistants with the&lt;br/&gt;automatic reasoning capabilities of proof search procedures, proof planners, decision procedures,&lt;br/&gt;model checkers, etc. and to use the enhanced system in the formal design of reliable software.&lt;br/&gt;In particular we aim at providing proof automation for the Nuprl proof development system,&lt;br/&gt;a tactical proof environment that has been used in numerous applications. It offers a proven basis&lt;br/&gt;for solving mathematical problems and for designing reliable hardware and software systems. The&lt;br/&gt;newest release of Nuprl features one of the most exible architectures for interacting with external&lt;br/&gt;problem solving devices. Our experience with connecting Nuprl with JProver, a theorem prover&lt;br/&gt;for first-order intuitionistic logic, has shown that Nuprl supports interoperability between formalsystems in a way that makes our goal feasible.</AbstractNarration>
