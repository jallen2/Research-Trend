    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Washington (UW) requests funding for the Northwest Alliance for Access&lt;br/&gt;to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to increase the quantity and&lt;br/&gt;quality of people with disabilities in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit and Qualifications of Partners&lt;br/&gt;The lead agency is the UW's award-winning DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking&lt;br/&gt;and Technology) program, which has conducted successful NSF PPD projects since 1992.&lt;br/&gt;Regional site teams at the two largest STEM research institutions in the State of Washington, the&lt;br/&gt;UW and Washington State University (WSU), will collaborate with K-12 and postsecondary&lt;br/&gt;schools, employers, and leading STEM research institutions in neighboring states - the&lt;br/&gt;University of Idaho, the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, and the University of&lt;br/&gt;Alaska in Anchorage and Fairbanks. The project will partner with ENTRY POINT! to place STEM&lt;br/&gt;postsecondary students with disabilities in paid internships. It will collaborate with MESA&lt;br/&gt;(Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) adapting for students with disabilities the&lt;br/&gt;hands-on science activities and teacher training strategies it uses with racial/ethnic minority and&lt;br/&gt;female students. The Alliance builds on established collaborations and brings together practices&lt;br/&gt;that have proven successful individually, to create a unique, comprehensive set of interventions.&lt;br/&gt;Objectives and examples of interventions include:&lt;br/&gt;1. The Northwest Alliance will increase the number of students with disabilities pursuing&lt;br/&gt;STEM academic programs and careers. Interventions: Motivational college/career transition&lt;br/&gt;and STEM fairs for precollege students and STEM academic/career activities for college&lt;br/&gt;students that identify participants for the AccessSTEM Team in objective 2 interventions.&lt;br/&gt;2. The Alliance will provide on-going support and encourage high school and college&lt;br/&gt;students with disabilities who show interest and aptitude in STEM with peer and&lt;br/&gt;mentor interaction, work experiences, and other activities as they transition to college,&lt;br/&gt;graduate school, and employment. Interventions: Students join the AccessSTEM Team to&lt;br/&gt;engage in an on-line community, mentoring, fields trips, research, paid internships, and other&lt;br/&gt;activities to assure their success in STEM careers and promote the success of others.&lt;br/&gt;3. The Alliance will provide precollege educators and staff with strategies, tools and&lt;br/&gt;support to create more inclusive programs for students with disabilities, where they are&lt;br/&gt;encouraged to pursue STEM studies and careers. Interventions: Training and curriculum&lt;br/&gt;materials through established networks of MESA, Educational Services Districts, teacher&lt;br/&gt;training programs, and professional organizations; provide educators with opportunities to&lt;br/&gt;work with students who have disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;4. The Alliance will help STEM postsecondary faculty, support staff, counselors, and&lt;br/&gt;employers fully include students with disabilities in their courses and programs and create&lt;br/&gt;accessible facilities and electronic resources. Interventions: Opportunities for faculty to&lt;br/&gt;receive training and work with students with disabilities in research; assistance in making&lt;br/&gt;facilities, equipment, distance learning, and Web pages accessible.&lt;br/&gt;Each intervention is associated with measurables that provide evidence of effectiveness. The&lt;br/&gt;National Center on Postsecondary Educational Supports (NCSPES) will evaluate project&lt;br/&gt;outcomes and impacts, conduct research on factors that promote success for students with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities, describe replication models, and help disseminate results.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Resulting from the Northwest Alliance&lt;br/&gt;Collaborations with MESA and other programs will broaden the participation of racial/ethnic&lt;br/&gt;minorities and females with disabilities in STEM. Wide distribution of a replication model, curriculum&lt;br/&gt;materials, and other project products and creation of a searchable Knowledge Base on the project&lt;br/&gt;Web site will enhance scientific and technological understanding and maximize project impact.&lt;br/&gt;Project outcomes will benefit society by making STEM opportunities available to all citizens and&lt;br/&gt;increasing the number of STEM professionals and leaders who have disabilities.</AbstractNarration>
