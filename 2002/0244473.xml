    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FRG: Multi-Dimensional Problems for the Euler Equations&lt;br/&gt; of Compressible Fluid Flow and Related Problems&lt;br/&gt; in Hyperbolic Conservation Laws&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, fluid and solid mechanics study the motion of&lt;br/&gt;incompressible and compressible materials, with or without internal&lt;br/&gt;dissipation. For gases and solids with internal dissipation as a&lt;br/&gt;secondary effect, the gross wave dynamics is governed by inviscid,&lt;br/&gt;thermal diffusionless, dynamics. Within these categories, compressible&lt;br/&gt;motion for solids corresponds to the study of elastic waves and their&lt;br/&gt;propagation; compressible motion for fluids is usually associated with&lt;br/&gt;inviscid gas dynamics. Furthermore both compressible solids and &lt;br/&gt;fluids exhibit shock waves and hence we must search for discontinous &lt;br/&gt;solutions to the underlying equations of motion.&lt;br/&gt;Incompressible motion on the other hand concerns&lt;br/&gt;itself with the motion of denser fluids where the idealization of&lt;br/&gt;incompressibility is useful, e.g. water or oil, as well as the motion of&lt;br/&gt;certain solids like rubber. While there are still many important&lt;br/&gt;mathematical issues to be resolved for incompressible fluids, for example,&lt;br/&gt;the well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations in three space&lt;br/&gt;dimensions, the mathematical study of compressible&lt;br/&gt;solids (as represented by the equations of nonlinear elastodynamics) and&lt;br/&gt;fluids (as represented by the Euler equations of inviscid flows)&lt;br/&gt;in two and three space dimensions is even less developed.&lt;br/&gt;This provides the motivation to the proposers to collaborate in a&lt;br/&gt;three year effort to advance the mathematical understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional equations of inviscid compressible fluid dynamics&lt;br/&gt;and related problems in elastodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;The core of our plan is to arrange a sustained interaction between and&lt;br/&gt;around the members of the group, who will&lt;br/&gt;(1) collaborate scientifically, focusing on the advancement of the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of multi-dimensional compressible flows by developing new&lt;br/&gt;theoretical techniques and by using and designing effective, robust and&lt;br/&gt;reliable numerical methods;&lt;br/&gt;(2) work together over the next several years to create the environment&lt;br/&gt;and manpower necessary for the research on multi-dimensional compressible&lt;br/&gt;Euler equations and related problems to flourish; and in the meantime,&lt;br/&gt;(3) share the responsibility of training graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is devoted to a mathematical study of the Euler equations&lt;br/&gt;governing the motion of an inviscid compressible fluid and related&lt;br/&gt;problems. Compressible fluids occur all around us in nature, e.g. gases&lt;br/&gt;and plasmas, whose study is crucial to understanding aerodyanmics,&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric sciences, thermodynamics, etc.&lt;br/&gt;While the one-dimensional fluid flows are rather well understood, the&lt;br/&gt;general theory for multi-dimensional flows is comparatively mathematically&lt;br/&gt;underdeveloped. The proposers will collaborate in a three&lt;br/&gt;year effort to advance the mathematical understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;multi-dimensional equations of inviscid compressible fluid dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Success in this project will advance knowledge of this fundamental area of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and mechanics and will introduce a new generation of&lt;br/&gt;researchers to the outstanding problems in the field.</AbstractNarration>
