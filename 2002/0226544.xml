    <AbstractNarration>A novel laser-ablation deposition technique will be used to deposit high quality multiplayers of magnetic oxides at the atomic scale. The purpose is to synthesize single crystal films of the spinel structure in which one layer consists solely of Mn2+ ions and the other alternating layer of only Fe3+ ions. Although the average chemical composition is that of MnFe2O4, the magnetic structure is that of a normal ferrite in a spinel structure. The magnetic structure of MnFe2O4 grown by the natural process is that of an inverse magnetic structure, in which both Fe3+ and Mn2+ can be found in the same layer, for example. Thus, this technique allows for the growth of ferrites by artificial control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implication of the success of this technique is enormous. Scientifically, we will be able to test fundamental theories of magnetism directly instead of depending what natural process allows. It also means that one can engineer ferrites for various applications and technical needs. Magnetic sensors will be improved to the point that it will impact medical imaging techniques, computer memories (speed and size), and the wireless communication components. In summary, a new generation of ferrite materials will be established, which will have impact in all phases of technology.</AbstractNarration>
