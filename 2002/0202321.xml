    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his collaborator work on&lt;br/&gt;the topology of complex algebraic maps, with applications&lt;br/&gt;to algebraic cycles&lt;br/&gt;and to non-algebraic maps.&lt;br/&gt;The study of the relations between the topology&lt;br/&gt;of the domain and target of a map&lt;br/&gt;is interesting and has broad applications&lt;br/&gt;in the fields of geometry and topology.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator works on:&lt;br/&gt;1) a topological and Hodge-theoretic proof of the so-called &lt;br/&gt;Decomposition Theorem for algebraic maps, &lt;br/&gt;2) finding the topological obstructions to the &lt;br/&gt;validity of the theorem for other maps, &lt;br/&gt;3) computing intersection forms arising from maps in significant &lt;br/&gt;cases, and &lt;br/&gt;4) applications of the Decomposition&lt;br/&gt;Theorem to algebraic cycles.&lt;br/&gt;Several new methods are being introduced &lt;br/&gt;as a result of these studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term ``algebraic maps" above is a technical term&lt;br/&gt;for polynomial equations. &lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is the discipline devoted to their study.&lt;br/&gt;It is an ancient subject rooted in the early achievements of &lt;br/&gt;humanity, like the wheel, the Egyptians' elliptical flowers &lt;br/&gt;arrangements and Archimedes' burning parabolic mirrors.&lt;br/&gt;Circles, ellipses and parabolas arise from the polynomial &lt;br/&gt;equations we study in high school. They are both beautiful&lt;br/&gt;and ubiquitous in nature as they describe many natural &lt;br/&gt;phenomena, from the motion of planets to the shape of leaves &lt;br/&gt;and flowers, to the behavior of microscopic particles.&lt;br/&gt;The funded project is strongly inclined towards pure research&lt;br/&gt;and proposes to study the deeper properties&lt;br/&gt;of the solutions to more complicated algebraic equations.&lt;br/&gt;As it has always been the case, pure and applied mathematics&lt;br/&gt;will influence each other and new abstract ideas will fuel the &lt;br/&gt;progress of applications.</AbstractNarration>
