    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Drs. Wiegel, Crowe, and Romanek (University of Georgia Research Foundation), Robb (University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute) and Cady (Portland State University) to establish a unique interdisciplinary, international microbial observatory to explore the exciting microbial world in remote volcanic and geothermal areas of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Siberia (Russia). The geological situation is unique, due to the unusual concentration of active volcanoes and geothermal areas at a low altitude, features that are different from the geothermal features at Yellowstone National Park. The pristine location allows performing work that cannot be done in the Yellowstone National Park. The primary goal of this observatory is to find novel microorganisms, to elucidate the microbial communities and subsequently characterize their phylogeny, biochemical, microbiological, and biotechnological properties. Unusual biogeochemical processes have been described in the Uzon Caldera, and the microbial communities may be different from other geothermal areas. The presence of many novel microorganisms is indicated by preliminary results. This will extend our knowledge about the diversity of microorganisms in extreme conditions, and how nutrients are cycled through the different microbial communities along temperature and nutrient gradients. Microbiological and geochemical research will combine in addressing some of the most rigorous terrestrial conditions under which novel microbial communities exist, which may give insights into extraterrestrial life.&lt;br/&gt; In addition to producing academically important data, this grant will contribute significantly to the interdisciplinary training of students contributing to the cadre of future researchers who will address the new field of biogeochemistry. The project will increase international cooperation and understanding between people from different cultural and political systems, and will lead to the discovery of microorganisms with high potential for various industrial applications. Furthermore the strong outreach component of this project will inform the general public about the existence and importance of unique regions such as Kamchatka.</AbstractNarration>
