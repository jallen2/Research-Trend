    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "The effect of winter variability on biodiversity and community dynamics: analysis of long-term lake data." Strong contrast between winter and summer abiotic conditions annually provides distinctly different habitat within one location, promoting biodiversity. To determine effects of reducing this environmental heterogeneity, this research uses multispecies autoregressive analysis (MARs) to analyze complex seasonal community transitions, discerning biotic pathways through which winter conditions affect both summer and winter communities.</AbstractNarration>
