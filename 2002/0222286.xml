    <AbstractNarration>Nonlinear problems with multiple scales, heterogeneity, and&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty are pervasive in science and engineering. In this&lt;br/&gt;context, analytical theories are limited by unrealistic modeling&lt;br/&gt;assumptions, and extensive large-scale physical experiments are&lt;br/&gt;impractical. Computational modeling and experimentation, the&lt;br/&gt;"third methodology" of science, has a critical role to play in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with theory and physical experiments. This project&lt;br/&gt;combines the three methodologies to study multiphase flow in&lt;br/&gt;porous media, specifically the remediation of groundwater&lt;br/&gt;contaminated by dense nonaqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs). Field&lt;br/&gt;scales are much too large for small-scale effects to be directly&lt;br/&gt;representable in practical computations. Multiphase flow in&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous subsurface formations involves local phenomena at&lt;br/&gt;material interfaces whose valid effective representation at&lt;br/&gt;larger scales is not understood. Uncertainty is central, because&lt;br/&gt;of the lack of complete or precise data, and because of the&lt;br/&gt;randomness of small-scale properties and flows when viewed from a&lt;br/&gt;larger scale. The project develops a nonlinear upscaling&lt;br/&gt;methodology based on a macro-scale stochastic theory of multiphase&lt;br/&gt;flow and transport that accounts for local phenomena at&lt;br/&gt;micro-scale material interfaces. The theory is applied&lt;br/&gt;numerically, so that limiting theoretical assumptions are local&lt;br/&gt;in space and time. The model is validated by multiple-scale&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous laboratory experiments, using realistic chemicals&lt;br/&gt;and soil properties, that creates a "physical Monte Carlo"&lt;br/&gt;database for comparison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental restoration is important to society. Remediation&lt;br/&gt;of contaminated groundwater often requires the study of the&lt;br/&gt;simultaneous flow of multiple non-mixing fluids through porous&lt;br/&gt;subsurface soils and rocks. These aquifers consist of many&lt;br/&gt;different materials and exhibit features such as layers and&lt;br/&gt;faults on a multitude of scales, all of which affect the fluid&lt;br/&gt;flow. In small-scale detail, these effects are uncertain in&lt;br/&gt;practical situations, because available data are insufficient&lt;br/&gt;to describe the subsurface precisely, and because these details&lt;br/&gt;are quite random from the standpoint of the larger field scale&lt;br/&gt;at which a hydrologist wants to analyze the appropriate strategy&lt;br/&gt;for a remediation project. This project develops a methodology&lt;br/&gt;that enables a scientist to describe the aquifer at the field&lt;br/&gt;scale, so that strategies can be formulated and tested in the&lt;br/&gt;setting where they will be applied. This "upscaling" methodology&lt;br/&gt;based on probabilistic concepts is an advance with wide&lt;br/&gt;implications beyond environmental restoration itself, important as&lt;br/&gt;it is, because similar issues arise throughout science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. The project's combination of theory, computation,&lt;br/&gt;and physical experiments requires the close interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;collaboration of a mathematician and a geoscientist.</AbstractNarration>
