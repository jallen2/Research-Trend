    <AbstractNarration>This GK-12 project supports fellows at Columbia University, from the departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics, and undergraduate fellows at Barnard College, from the Department of Environmental Science. The fellows engage in educational activities with middle school students in an urban New York City school district. Nine graduate students and three advanced undergraduates are supported per year. Teams of fellows and science teachers utilize inquiry-based projects in an effort to develop novel curricula based on issues that connect with the everyday lives of the students. The science is presented with other areas of instruction such as social studies, art and literature to enhance the students' appreciation for the social context of science. The Institute for Learning Technologies at Teachers College of Columbia University is a partner in this project. The intellectual merit is evidenced by the unique inclusion of literature and history in the presentation of science in the middle school context, e.g. including reading and writing skills. Broader impacts relate to the relevance of the subjects targeted, e.g. environmental issues. This project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project title: Implementation of Inquiry-Based Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics in New York City Middle Schools&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PI: Leonard Fine, Bhawani Venkataraman&lt;br/&gt;Partner School Districts: New York City School District Two, &lt;br/&gt;Funding: $1,406,400 &lt;br/&gt;Number of fellows/year: 9 graduate, 3 undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Urban&lt;br/&gt;Target audience: Middle School &lt;br/&gt;NSF supported disciplines involved: Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics</AbstractNarration>
