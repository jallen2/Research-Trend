    <AbstractNarration>0202851&lt;br/&gt;Bielecki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be organized into two principal &lt;br/&gt;research areas: 1) Development of mathematical theory for risk &lt;br/&gt;adjusted portfolio optimization and fixed income investment &lt;br/&gt;management, incorporating factor modeling of security returns, &lt;br/&gt;and 2) Development of mathematical theory for credit risk &lt;br/&gt;valuation and hedging. There are three fundamental aspects of the &lt;br/&gt;first research area: 1A) The concept of risk adjusted control &lt;br/&gt;(optimization) criteria for investment problems with finite and &lt;br/&gt;infinite planning horizons. More specifically, we shall continue to &lt;br/&gt;develop theory and applications for mean-variance stochastic &lt;br/&gt;control. This kind of control problems is appealing to financial &lt;br/&gt;industry as it extends to more realistic dynamic framework the &lt;br/&gt;classical approach of Harry Markowitz (1990 Nobel Prize in &lt;br/&gt;Economics). 1B) Development of control methodologies for the &lt;br/&gt;fixed income investment problems with finite planning horizon &lt;br/&gt;coinciding with the maturity of the underlying bond. We shall &lt;br/&gt;attempt to overcome certain singularity problems arising in this &lt;br/&gt;context, which will lead to derivation of applicable fixed income &lt;br/&gt;investment strategies. 1C) Explicit consideration given to statistical &lt;br/&gt;estimation issues. Optimal control methodologies are rarely used in &lt;br/&gt;the financial industry, largely because of statistical difficulties &lt;br/&gt;associated with the estimation of constant drift coefficients in &lt;br/&gt;diffusion process models of individual securities. Practitioners &lt;br/&gt;typically channel their energies into forecasting security returns &lt;br/&gt;based upon exogenous factors such as interest rates and firm-&lt;br/&gt;specific accounting measures. The proposed research will serve to &lt;br/&gt;reduce the gap between theory and practice by developing &lt;br/&gt;optimization models, which explicitly incorporate exogenous &lt;br/&gt;factors. By explicitly modeling the dependence of the assets on &lt;br/&gt;factors, it will be possible to obtain more realistic models, to better &lt;br/&gt;understand the statistical estimation difficulties, and to be in a &lt;br/&gt;position to apply adaptive control methods. The fundamental &lt;br/&gt;aspects of the second research area are: 2A) Explicit consideration &lt;br/&gt;given to possibility of credit migrations of defaultable contingent &lt;br/&gt;claims. This will be done in the context of conditionally Markov &lt;br/&gt;chains both with regard to a single defaultable claim as well as &lt;br/&gt;with regard to several such claims. The latter situation is very &lt;br/&gt;important for applications to basket credit derivatives. 2B) &lt;br/&gt;Development of mathematical theory for hedging of certain classes &lt;br/&gt;of credit derivatives that are vital for financial industry. This will &lt;br/&gt;be done in the context of martingale representations associated &lt;br/&gt;with conditionally Markov chains. 2C) Development of analytical &lt;br/&gt;tools for computation of certain class of functionals of conditional &lt;br/&gt;Markov processes. This will build upon the classical Feynman-Kac &lt;br/&gt;characterizations, and will find applications for valuation and &lt;br/&gt;hedging of some fundamental (basket) credit derivatives such as &lt;br/&gt;default swaps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the proposed research will require fundamental advances &lt;br/&gt;within the areas of applied mathematics, probability, and financial &lt;br/&gt;economics, it is anticipated that the proposed research will lead to &lt;br/&gt;new and practical tools that eventually become widely used in the &lt;br/&gt;financial industry, and possibly in the insurance industry as well. &lt;br/&gt;The main reason for this expectation is that the proposed research &lt;br/&gt;addresses the need of the two industries for quantitative &lt;br/&gt;methodologies that would enable financial and insurance decision &lt;br/&gt;makers to properly manage certain categories of risks. The major &lt;br/&gt;implication of incidence of risks in financial/insurance decision-&lt;br/&gt;making is the possibility of financial losses. In general, neither the &lt;br/&gt;possibility of financial losses, nor their occasional severity, can be &lt;br/&gt;completely eliminated. However, workable tools, such as pricing &lt;br/&gt;and hedging strategies, are sought for controlling some of the risks &lt;br/&gt;underlying financial and insurance industries, so that both the &lt;br/&gt;possibility and severity of losses are kept to minimum. The &lt;br/&gt;proposed research will provide mathematical basis for &lt;br/&gt;development of such tools.</AbstractNarration>
