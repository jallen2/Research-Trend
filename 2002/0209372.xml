    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed research is to identify and quantify the conditions that lead to carbide oxidation and to investigate the use of promoters and promoted supports to improve the stability of these catalysts. Because of its widespread use in other applications, the project will focus only on molybdenum carbide catalysts. Since it is likely that catalyst stability is highly dependent on redox chemistry, the first stage of the proposed research will focus on determining the effects of reactant/product compositions on the oxidation kinetics of bulk molybdenum carbide catalysts synthesized by various methods to produce relatively high surface areas per unit mass. Since excess synthesis carbon can lead to subsequent coking problems, the catalyst synthesis protocol will be carried out so that excess carbon can be controlled or eliminated. The methodology will consist of dynamic x-ray diffraction and TGA/MS experiments (at reforming conditions), combined with appropriate catalyst characterization techniques (FTIR, XPS, SEM/TEM). In the second stage of the proposed work, the PI will investigate methods to increase the range of catalyst stability through the use of supported molybdenum carbide catalysts, promoted with an in oxygen buffer (curia). Parameters to be investigated in this phase of the project will include the characteristics of the support (surface area, acidity), the catalyst synthesis methodology and the catalyst/promoter loading. This project has the potential to provide a more efficient route for making hydrogen for fuel cells.</AbstractNarration>
