    <AbstractNarration>This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Lawrence will pursue recent preliminary evidence of a novel nuclear "domain" or "body," which typically positions immediately adjacent to PML bodies and appears to form a "doublet" structure with the PML body. In recent years, there has been increasing appreciation for the complexity and importance of internal nuclear structures and growing evidence of their fundamental roles in diverse nuclear functions. At the forefront has been intense interest in PML bodies (also called ND10, PODs, or PML domains), because these structures are enriched for a collection of important gene regulatory proteins. Dr. Lawrence's laboratory has been studying the characterization of distinct nuclear compartments and their structural and functional relationship to gene expression. In the course of her very recent work she fortuitously uncovered evidence that there exists an essentially unknown and uncharacterized nuclear "body" that is structurally linked to PML bodies. The evidence for this is at a very preliminary state, and there are major questions to be sorted out in order to establish conclusively the existence of this as a bona fide nuclear body containing multiple nuclear factors and having defined structure. The potential significance of the work is that it may demonstrate a previously unknown part of cell structure, the equivalent of a nuclear "organelle" with an unexplored role in basic nuclear function. In addition, these bodies are structurally coupled with a body that is clearly implicated in cell cycle regulation. Dr. Lawrence and her colleagues initially discovered a regularly spaced pattern of ~10-20 very bright nuclear "dots" (immediately abutting but not overlapping PML bodies) using an antibody to the FLAG-epitope in cells engineered to express flag-tagged c-myc oncoprotein at physiological levels. However, recent evidence suggests that the antigen detected is probably not the myc oncoprotein but rather an endogenous protein, possibly induced as part of a cellular reaction to MuLV virus (murine leukemia virus). The first aim is to investigate the hypothesis that PML-associated bodies indeed exist and are found in a variety of cells, using both ultrastructural analysis and immunofluorescence to several other specific proteins that prior evidence suggests may co-localize to these bodies. Second, she will investigate the relationship between MuLV vectors or MuLV expression and the induction of the relevant protein and/or body. Depending on results, it would also be feasible to identify an unknown cellular protein detected by the anti-flag antibodies and localized to these structures.</AbstractNarration>
