    <AbstractNarration>This project is establishing the Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering (MACSER) Scholars program. The scholarships provide financial support to full-time students who have demonstrated need and are enrolled in or plan to enroll in our mathematics, computer science, engineering science and engineering technology programs. Both part-time and non-traditional students are being encouraged to apply for MACSER scholarships. Offering financial support to those students whose current economic situation prevents them from attending college on a full-time basis provides a mechanism that enables the student to shorten the amount of time required to complete his or her respective program. It also leads to an increase in the number of full time students enrolled in the mathematics, computer science, engineering science and engineering technology programs. By providing scholarship opportunities, the project is relieving some of the burden full-time employment places on them, and helping to ensure academic success. Extra efforts are being spent on increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in the targeted majors as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program provides a support network for scholarship recipients, which builds community and is the cornerstone and strength of the MACSER Scholars program. This network includes personal advising, academic support, mentoring, peer tutoring, a virtual community, and MACSER workshops. These serve to increase the academic success of students enrolled in the MACSER Scholars majors.</AbstractNarration>
