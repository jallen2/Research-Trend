    <AbstractNarration>This scholarship project provides funds for 30 computer science and information system (CSIS) students at Kennesaw State University (KSU). The amount of each award is $3000.00 annually. The support for the students in this program is leveraged on the experiences gained from existing programs within the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, for example, a summer program for high achieving underrepresented high school students from the local area of KSU. This program is called the Cybertech 2k. There are two existing and significant support and complementary programs to the CSEMS project at KSU: 1) Yamacrew program which is a Georgia economic development initiative intended to make Georgia a world leader in the design of broadband communications systems, devices and chips; and 2) Mentor-Protege program which was established to incorporate undergraduate research into the fabric of the College of Science and Mathematics degree programs. These programs support the educational quality of the course of instructions delivered to the students, and they aid in curbing the high attrition rate of the CSIS majors.</AbstractNarration>
