    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program to Cornell University will allow several teams of investigators to develop x-ray diffraction instrumentation that will provide unique experimental capabilities and powerful general use equipment for use at the G2 experimental station at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). A six-circle diffractometer, two CCD area detectors, and a temperature- and environment-controlled sample stage will be built. The diffractometer will allow for a very wide range of experimental configurations and will be the basic diffractometer for the G2 experimental station. The area detectors will be used at G2 for a variety of different experiments, but will also be made available to users at other experimental stations easing a current very high over demand for such detectors at CHESS and at Cornell. The stage will be able to hold samples at any temperature between 20 and 900 degrees C in a range of atmospheres during diffraction experiments and will also be used at different experimental stations. Together, this equipment will be optimized for high resolution and time-sensitive x-ray diffraction work. Initial work includes: 1) studies of mechanical deformation, relaxation, and anelastic recovery, as well as interactions among microstructure development, phase changes, and solid state reactions in thin films and nanopattened structures, 2) studies of the evolution of strain and magnetic and electronic properties as a function of controlled oxidation in magnetic oxide thin films and nanostructures, 3) studies of formation and structure of highly ordered arrays by metal initiated self-assembly of ligand modified den-drimers, and 4) studies of the kinetics of interface growth of metal mono- and multilayers. This equipment will be made available to outside users and to students, and will be used in outreach programs such as the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs sponsored by NSF through the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR).&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program to Cornell University will allow several teams of investigators to develop x-ray diffraction instrumentation that will provide unique experimental capabilities and powerful general use equipment for use at the G2 experimental station at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). This equipment will be optimized for high resolution and time-sensitive x-ray diffraction work. It will be used to obtain rapid high resolution measurements of thermally induced phenomena in nanostructured materials, including strain, deformation, phase transformations, magnetic and electronic properties, film formation, and solid state reactions. This equipment will benefit a large number of research groups at Cornell, and also external US and international collaborators. It will be made available to outside users, to students, and will be used in outreach programs such as the very successful Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs sponsored by NSF through the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR).</AbstractNarration>
