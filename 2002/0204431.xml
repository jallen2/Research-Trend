    <AbstractNarration>This small grant for exploratory research investigates the mechanisms by which people show resilient responses to the events surrounding the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The project focuses on how positive emotions allow for psychological resilience in the face of ongoing threat. Psychological resilience involves the ability to overcome stress and even thrive in the face of adversity. Much of the existing literature focuses on the predictors of resilience (e.g., individual, social protective factors) and their outcomes (e.g., positive mental and physical health). Remarkably, very little attention has been given to the underlying mechanisms that contribute to this capacity to fare well, especially in the face of ongoing stressful experiences. In light of the continuing threat and vulnerability associated with the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, including threats involving bioterrorism, war, and economic turbulence, it is important to examine the factors that protect individuals from developing negative psychological consequences associated with on-going stress of a serious nature. The continued threat associated with the ambiguity of future events could have dire consequences on an individual's decision-making strategies for future events in a host of life domains, possibly resulting in psychological and physical damage to the individual. This project examines three possible mechanisms that might begin to explain the process by which positive emotions are useful in achieving resilience, especially in the face of ongoing threat: emotional complexity, attention, and tolerance of ambiguity. The aim of the project is to conduct initial tests of a conceptual model, which illustrates how positive emotions promote psychological resilience.</AbstractNarration>
