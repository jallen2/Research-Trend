    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Numbers: 0200713 and 0200584&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Alexander Volberg, Fedor Nazarov, and Serguei Treil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted on non-homogeneous harmonic &lt;br/&gt;analysis and on weighted norm inequalities with&lt;br/&gt;matrix weights. In previous work by the PIs a technique&lt;br/&gt;for estimating Calderon-Zygmund operators on spaces with&lt;br/&gt;non-doubling measures was developed, and a novel &lt;br/&gt;method of Bellman functions was introduced for problems&lt;br/&gt;in Harmonic Analysis. These techniques will be applied to &lt;br/&gt;solve several open problems in harmonic analysis and &lt;br/&gt;operator theory and to investigate new directions,&lt;br/&gt;which previously were deemed untractable because of the &lt;br/&gt;lack of technical tools. Special attention will be paid &lt;br/&gt;to uncovering new relations between Operator Theory, &lt;br/&gt;Harmonic Analysis and Stochastic Control. Among&lt;br/&gt;the main directions of the proposed research are:&lt;br/&gt;- Spectral theory for perturbations of normal operators &lt;br/&gt;and related problems in Harmonic Analysis: two weight &lt;br/&gt;estimates for Hilbert Transform and embedding theorems for &lt;br/&gt;the co-invariant subspaces.&lt;br/&gt;- Non-homogeneous T(b) theorems and their applications to &lt;br/&gt;generalizations of analytic capacity (electric intensity &lt;br/&gt;capacity); the role of curvature in higher dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;- Bellman function method in stochastic optimal control&lt;br/&gt;and in harmonic analysis; functions with matrix arguments&lt;br/&gt;and their applications to non-commutative problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harmonic analysis investigates complex processes by &lt;br/&gt;representing them as a sum of elementary ones (sinusoidal &lt;br/&gt;waves, wavelets) with well understood behavior. A central&lt;br/&gt;part of modern harmonic analysis deals with "singular&lt;br/&gt;operators" of one type or another. Such operators are &lt;br/&gt;pervasive in the scientific landscape: they turn up in &lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics, probability, engineering, image &lt;br/&gt;processing, etc. A new way to treat multivariate signals&lt;br/&gt;will be discussed. The main difficulty here is that the &lt;br/&gt;mathematical objects arising in such problems are &lt;br/&gt;non-commutative: the product depends on the order of terms,&lt;br/&gt;and that complicates things immensely. A new method based&lt;br/&gt;on Bellman functions, which originating in the stochastic &lt;br/&gt;optimal control, will be exploited in harmonic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;One important direction of research is the spectral theory &lt;br/&gt;for the perturbation of normal operators: results in this &lt;br/&gt;direction would have important consequences in mathematical &lt;br/&gt;physics. Another direction deals with non-commutative &lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis, i.e. with treating multivariate&lt;br/&gt;signals.</AbstractNarration>
