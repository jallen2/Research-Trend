    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research will investigate the morphology of ion-containing polymers, in particular ionomers, using model materials and a variety of analytical electron microscopy (AEM) methods. Ionomers are random copolymers with a majority of non-polar monomeric units and a minority (~5-10 mol%) of polar monomeric units, typically acids such as -COOH. The acid groups can be neutralized with cations to create ionic species such as -COO-Na+ in the case of a Na-neutralized carboxylic acid. Because these ionic species are considerably more polar that the surrounding matrix, there is a driving force for the ionic species to microphase separate and form ionic aggregates although the resulting morphologies of ionic aggregates are not well understood. Controlling the morphologies of ionomers is the primary goal of the proposed research and the first step to developing both a predictive theoretical model of these materials and a robust understanding of their structure-property relationships. These ionic aggregates act as physical crosslinks to toughen the polymer and lead to both current industrial applications (chemically resistant thermoplastics, tough coatings, permselective membranes for fuel cells, and food packaging materials) and a variety of potential technological applications (e.g. protection against chemical warfare). These complex polymeric materials spur scientific interest, because (1) these amphiphilic materials have ionic interactions that mimic biological macromolecules, (2) ionomers are readily available with a wealth of chemistries that includes amorphous and semicrystalline polymers and a range of cations, and (3) high-resolution analytical tools are now available to investigate the interdependencies of chemistry, processing, morphology and properties. Winey's scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies of ionomers since 1998 provide a valuable foundation to the proposed research in which Winey endeavors to identify the materials parameters and processing conditions that have the most substantial influence on the ionomer morphologies. The proposed work seeks to uncover reliable trends in the ionomer morphology in order to provide fundamental understanding of these complex materials. As Winey determines how the various materials and processing parameters influence the ionomer morphology they will be able to control the ionomer morphology. Two hallmarks of the proposed experimental plan are (1) the use of model materials, that is materials designed to address specific scientific questions, and (2) the use of multiple characterization tools including SAXS, FT-IR, and, in particular, a range of analytical electron microscopy (AEM) methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Industrial, academic and military scientists have scientific interest in both the proposed research about ion-containing polymers and the development of AEM characterization tools for polymers. Winey will collaborate with the Lehigh Microscopy School to ensure that electron microscopists take full advantage of the AEM methods that are used within the proposed work to investigate complex, chemically heterogeneous polymeric materials. In addition, Winey will continue to both serve as a faculty co-advisor to the Society of Women Engineers on Penn's campus and hold an annual panel about opportunities for graduate studies and academic careers in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
