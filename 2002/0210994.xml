    <AbstractNarration>The award is to conduct the annual National Science Foundation Design, Service and Manufacturing Research Conference. The conference will involve researchers in all program areas within the Division of Design, Manufacture and Industrial Innovation (DMII), the manufacturing researchers in the Divisions of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), Electrical and Communication Systems (ECS), Civil and Mechanical Structures (CMS), located within the Directorate for Engineering, Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS), located within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Materials Research (DMR), located within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, International Programs (INT), Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research, specifically the Innovation and Organizational Change Program (IOC), located in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences who are in manufacturing related research will present ongoing activities in their current research and attend sessions which will extend beyond their immediate area of research. Ongoing research in manufacturing related research activities are presented by the grantees from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT), from locations within Mexico, and grantees from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the National Research Council (NRC), from locations within Canada. The conference ensures that the individual researchers are informed about the ongoing activities of their colleagues. An elimination of duplication of their efforts may be achieved and a degree of cooperation may result from this activity. An overall improvement of efficiency of the research activity could be expected. In addition, the conference program organization allows for ample time to discuss manufacturing research in detail with the collective research community at the meeting, with feedback to and input from the National Science Foundation. Finally, personal contacts between the grantees and program directors in the Divisions should contribute to clarify many current issues in their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of the conference are: (1) to broaden the outlook of all participants; (2) promote transfer of ideas and technology from one area of research to another; (3) to allow those working in a related area of research to get to know their peers so as to avoid duplication of research and to encourage cooperation, and (4) to allow personal contacts from the collective research community, the NSF, CONACyT, NSERC, and NRC program staff to discuss manufacturing research in detail (this should contribute to clarifying many current problems in ongoing projects). Attendees to the conference gain an early access to the information disseminated.</AbstractNarration>
