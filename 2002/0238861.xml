    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: PECASE: Development of Advanced MEMS Actuator Technology for Microrobotics&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Maryland College Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This PECASE proposal addresses the development of a new actuator technology based on dielectric elastomers for microrobotics, flying microdevices, and micromanipulation. This will require the development of new fabrication processes. I shall: The processing advances will permit us to design and fabricate three types of elementary micro- actuation components: 1. Out-of-plane actuators, which will also allow the measurement of actuator metrics that provide data essential for device modeling. 2. Bending actuators, which will be used to realize novel articulated structures with 6 degree-of-freedom movement. 3. In-plane actuators that can be effectively coupled with Si MEMS devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Research: The motivation for using dielectric elastomers actuators is that they are tough and compliant and have an extraordinarily high efficiency, whereas existing microactuators are either too brittle to transmit contact loads or consume too much power to carry their own power supplies. Dielectric elastomer actuators also inherently function as sensors. The proposed research will therefore make possible the realization of robust, autonomous actuators that MEMS devices can use for walking, manipulating, and perhaps flying, which will impact diverse fields.&lt;br/&gt;Education: I will adopt inquiry-based teaching methods in order to improve learning outcomes. Students will formulate their own projects and use knowledge gained during the course to accomplish their objectives. These projects will expose students to actual research experiences. This approach will first be implemented in a 2-part undergraduate MEMS course in which students design and fabricate original building blocks of an ant-like, walking microdevice. These components will be the actuators, including legs, manipulating arms, and chemical-squirting self-defense system. The dielectric elastomer research will be utilized in the course, and the student's devices will advance the research, closely integrating the research and education. A broader curriculum development effort will establish a comprehensive MEMS core program at UMD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.</AbstractNarration>
