    <AbstractNarration>This project concerns the development of efficient numerical&lt;br/&gt;methods for problems related to material science. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator studies computational issues concerning the&lt;br/&gt;numerical solution of continuum models for thin film growth. Many&lt;br/&gt;of these models include effects for surface diffusion, which is a&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear 4th order term. Consequently, these models are very&lt;br/&gt;stiff from a computational point of view. Because the surface&lt;br/&gt;diffusion term is nonlinear, it is difficult to use implicit&lt;br/&gt;methods. The investigator introduces a new semi-implicit level&lt;br/&gt;set method for solving motion by surface diffusion. He uses this&lt;br/&gt;new method to incorporate the effects of surface diffusion into&lt;br/&gt;models of polycrystalline thin films. He also develops a new&lt;br/&gt;approach for computing island dynamics, where the adatoms on the&lt;br/&gt;terraces are considered as a continuum field and the atoms on the&lt;br/&gt;edge of the island are treated discretely. This approach retains&lt;br/&gt;the potential advantage of continuum methods but at the same time&lt;br/&gt;preserves the discrete and stochastic effects present in island&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. The investigator includes effects of edge diffusion,&lt;br/&gt;surface tension, nucleation, and elasticity. An important&lt;br/&gt;computational aspect of this problem is the numerical solution of&lt;br/&gt;the diffusion equation in a complex domain. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;examines new methods for the efficient solution of this problem.&lt;br/&gt; Thin films occur in a large number of applications, from&lt;br/&gt;coatings on bearings to semi-conductor devices. In many cases&lt;br/&gt;these films are not single crystals but instead are&lt;br/&gt;polycrystalline and the quality of the film can depend on its&lt;br/&gt;texture. Films with good biaxial texture are close to being a&lt;br/&gt;single crystal and have applications in the manufacture of&lt;br/&gt;super-conducting tapes, for example. One important physical&lt;br/&gt;effect in determining the evolution of the texture is surface&lt;br/&gt;diffusion, but this is difficult to implement numerically and the&lt;br/&gt;investigator plans to develop a semi-implicit level set method to&lt;br/&gt;study the growth of polycrystalline thin films. The work here&lt;br/&gt;could help improve the fundamental understanding of these films.&lt;br/&gt;Another important process by which thin films are made is&lt;br/&gt;molecular beam epitaxy. The standard method for accurate&lt;br/&gt;simulation of this process is kinetic Monte Carlo. In many&lt;br/&gt;situations this method can be slow, and continuum models have the&lt;br/&gt;potential to greatly increase the speed of such computations.&lt;br/&gt;However, continuum models ignore discrete and stochastic effects.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator develops hybrid models that have good physical&lt;br/&gt;fidelity but offer considerable computational speed.</AbstractNarration>
