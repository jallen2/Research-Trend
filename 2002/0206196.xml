    <AbstractNarration>Tropical forests include a diversity of habitats, which has lead to specialization in&lt;br/&gt;plants. Near Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, nutrient-poor white sand forests are found&lt;br/&gt;immediately adjacent to nutrient-rich clay forests, each harboring a unique composition&lt;br/&gt;of habitat specialist trees. Why does habitat specialization occur? Our hypothesis is that&lt;br/&gt;the combination of impoverished soils and herbivory creates strong selective pressure for&lt;br/&gt;plant defenses in white sand forest. Species that have not evolved high levels of&lt;br/&gt;antiherbivore defense are therefore at a disadvantage in white sand forests and excluded&lt;br/&gt;by herbivores.&lt;br/&gt;To test whether herbivores select for higher optimal antiherbivore defense in&lt;br/&gt;white sand plants, we are comparing defense investment in 33 species from 6 genera that&lt;br/&gt;include several phylogenetically independent pairs of closely-related white sand and clay&lt;br/&gt;specialists. In addition, we have established a reciprocal transplant experiment to&lt;br/&gt;manipulate the presence of herbivores and directly test to what degree herbivores&lt;br/&gt;maintain the low overlap in species composition between the two forest types. If&lt;br/&gt;herbivory has a significant effect on habitat specialization, it will suggest a new way that&lt;br/&gt;herbivores may influence plant evolution: by sharpening habitat boundaries due to abiotic&lt;br/&gt;factors and thereby increasing the potential for habitat specialization.</AbstractNarration>
