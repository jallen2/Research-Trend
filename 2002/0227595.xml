    <AbstractNarration>We propose to organize a joint COST-IST (EU) / NSF (USA) workshop on Networking in September/October 2002, in Crete, Greece. There are two main objectives for the proposed workshop. The first is to discuss and try to shed some more light into key, new and upcoming networking technologies by focusing on the driving fundamental aspects and principles. A better understanding could help better steer the upcoming advancements with the expected benefits in reduced complexity, improved performance and enhanced services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second main objective is to give the opportunity to the networking communities in Europe and USA to get together and have a first-hand exposure to the advancements and strengths in the other side of the Atlantic. The targeted balance in the participation of researchers from the two sides of the Atlantic will help achieve this cross-fertilization objective, bring the benefits to both communities and help advance the technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As funding is a major driving force, another objective of this workshop is to provide a forum that could help the workshop-sponsoring funding agencies from the EU and USA identify the key and required networking technologies and direct their funding accordingly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key networking areas represented by the best researchers from EU and USA will be targeted. The focus of the proposed workshop may be divided into three broad themes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Internet Modeling and Control &lt;br/&gt; Overlay Networks, Content Distribution Networks, Peer-to-Peer &lt;br/&gt; Broadband Wireless, Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks, Hybrid Networks &lt;br/&gt;The precise focus will be determined by the makeup of the participants. Program officers from COST-IST and ANIR-NSF are expected to attend the workshop. The General Workshop Chair is Ioannis Stavrakakis, University of Athens. The Program Co-chairs are Ioannis Stavrakakis, Ibrahim Matta (the PI) and Michael Smirnov (Fraunhofer FOKUS, Germany). Ibrahim Matta will handle the NSF funding and Michael Smirnov will handle the COST funding for the workshop. After the conclusion of the workshop, the organizing committee will furnish a report to the &lt;br/&gt;COST-IST (EU) and ANIR-NSF (USA), and will make it publicly available to participants an others via the workshop site.</AbstractNarration>
