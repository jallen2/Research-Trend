    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project features as the main&lt;br/&gt;goal, the development of a simulator of nanoscale electronic devices, and circuits.&lt;br/&gt;Emphasis will be placed on devices and circuits that are based on carbon nanotubes, or&lt;br/&gt;tunneling in lithographically defined junctions. The simulator will be based partly on&lt;br/&gt;the extensive collection of theoretical and numerical techniques that have been developed by the firm to describe charge transport in single electron devices. A diagrammatic technique and non-interacting Green's functions were used to obtain the tunneling rates in such junctions. Those techniques will be extended to describe the nanotubes. A graphical user interface will be developed, as well as a module that provides movies of the dynamics of charge flow. A package that enables the visualization of charge transport in these ultrasmall devices is expected to be a stimulating teaching and learning tool. with the standard SPICE package.&lt;br/&gt; Powerful simulation tools are essential for the evaluation and development of&lt;br/&gt;nanoelectronic devices and systems. The primary customers of the proposed nanosystems&lt;br/&gt;simulator is expected to be chip manufacturers, manufacturers of high sensitivity electrical measuring instruments and academic researchers.</AbstractNarration>
