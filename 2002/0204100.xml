    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204100&lt;br/&gt;Alan Weinstein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, for reasons arising from mathematical physics (string and&lt;br/&gt;membrane theory) as well as from deformation theory, increased&lt;br/&gt;attention is being paid to nonassociative algebraic structures and,&lt;br/&gt;along with them, bracket operations which do not satisfy the Jacobi&lt;br/&gt;identity. Weinstein applies his previously developed theory of&lt;br/&gt;Courant algebroids and Dirac structures to investigate geometric&lt;br/&gt;models for some of these nonassociative structures, generalizing&lt;br/&gt;Poisson structures. A second part of the research concerns&lt;br/&gt;convexity theorems for momentum mappings of hamiltonian symmetry&lt;br/&gt;groups and related questions about the linearization of proper Lie&lt;br/&gt;groupoids. The search for the ``optimal'' convexity theorem in&lt;br/&gt;Poisson geometry is related to the problem of describing the local&lt;br/&gt;structure of proper groupoids in terms of group actions. The analysis&lt;br/&gt;of proper groupoids leads in turn to the problem of averaging families&lt;br/&gt;of submanifolds in riemannian geometry. Previous results on this&lt;br/&gt;problem are being extended and improved, with one goal being an&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the metric geometry of infinite dimensional spaces of&lt;br/&gt;unparametrized submanifolds. Finally, applications to mechanics are&lt;br/&gt;be investigated: groupoids applied to discretized lagrangian systems,&lt;br/&gt;and generalized Poisson structures applied to nonholonomic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weinstein's research concerns symmetry in geometry, with applications&lt;br/&gt;to physics. Traditionally, symmetry has been described mathematically&lt;br/&gt;in terms of the operation of groups, and the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;infinitesimal operation of Lie algebras. Recently, for reasons&lt;br/&gt;arising from mathematical physics (string and membrane theory) as well&lt;br/&gt;as from deformation theory in mathematics, increased attention is&lt;br/&gt;being paid to more general notions of symmetry, involving algebraic&lt;br/&gt;structures lacking the associativity of a group operation and, along&lt;br/&gt;with them, bracket operations which do not satisfy the Jacobi identity&lt;br/&gt;essential to the notion of Lie algebra. The study of these (and more&lt;br/&gt;traditional) symmetries also involves the use of ``groupoids,'' where&lt;br/&gt;different groups are operating on different parts of a space with&lt;br/&gt;symmetry. Weinstein's study of these symmetries involves a&lt;br/&gt;combination of algebra and differential geometry, as well as some very&lt;br/&gt;concrete geometric questions, a simple form of which is ``what is the&lt;br/&gt;average of two nearby unparametrized curves in space?'' This question&lt;br/&gt;is easy to pose and may have applications in computer&lt;br/&gt;graphics, but it is surprisingly difficult to solve. Finally, &lt;br/&gt;Weinstein is using groupoids in the analysis of discrete lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;systems used to create numerical algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
