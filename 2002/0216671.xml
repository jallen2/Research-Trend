    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project builds on algorithms developed for simulating turbulent incompressible flows in and around time-varying geometries. The Phase II project proposes to develop and commercialize a state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package utilizing the algorithms developed. The computational engine is based upon an advanced parallel, adaptive fast multipole (FMM) implementation of a 3-D Lagrangian vortex-boundary element method. Turbulence is accounted for via Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using a dynamic Smagorinsky sub-grid scale model. The method is (1) grid-free in the fluid domain, (2) virtually free of numerical diffusion, (3) inherently solution-adaptive, and (4) capable of modeling inhomogeneous unsteady wall-bounded turbulent flow. During Phase II additional innovative algorithms will be developed for FMM to substantially increase it computational speed as well as accuracy. Additionally, an LES model for unsteady inhomogeneous flows will be implemented and tested rigorously using problems of potential interest to industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The software is ideal for simulation and analysis of complex laminar-through-turbulent flow phenomena involving massive flow separation, unsteady vortex shedding, transient jets in cross-stream, and wake-body interaction. Examples of interest to industry are flow over bluff bodies such as ground vehicles or buildings, in data storage units with rotating and moving parts; in internal combustion engines; and in and around rotating machinery such as pumps and fans.</AbstractNarration>
