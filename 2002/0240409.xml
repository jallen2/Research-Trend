    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by James Espenson and Andreja Bakac, Department of Chemistry, Iowa State University. The project will explore the chemistry of transient and metastable oxyl radicals, their interactions with transition metal complexes and their role in organic oxidation reactions. More specifically, the phthalimide-N-oxyl radical, PINO*, will be examined as a potential promoter in industially important reactions such as the oxidation of para-xylene and other aromatic compounds. PINO* could potentially replace the corrosive promoter bromide currently in use. Detailed mechanistic studies of these complicated oxidation reactions, including hydrogen atom abstractions and electron transfers, will help us better understand these fundamental processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has potential implications for the commodity and fine chemicals industries. The research will also include studies of a group of inorganic compounds that, in the process of oxygen activation, exhibit chemical transformations typically observed only in complicated enzymatic systems. Oxidation and free radical chemistry are involved in oxidative stress, aging, heart disease, cancer and inflammatory illnesses, so a better understanding of these very reactive species will benefit medicinal chemistry and toxicology. Chemists trained in free radical chemistry can contribute to both the chemical industry and medicine.</AbstractNarration>
