    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds for the purchase of a scanning electron microscope and a Fourier transformation infrared spectrometer. This equipment will be used to support research on development of three-dimensional nanomanufacturing technologies and on those technologies' applications in nanophotonic structures and devices. Most nanophotonic structures with designed functionalities are complicated and three-dimensional, therefore three-dimensional nanomanufacturing technologies are essential. The scanning electron microscope can provide images with high resolution, and the Fourier transformation infrared spectrometer can measure the essential optical properties of photonic structures and devices. These structural and optical properties will provide important information and guidance for the development and optimization of nanomanufacturing processes. &lt;br/&gt; The research conducted using this equipment is interdisciplinary and involves the collaborative efforts of researchers from various departments. This will likely lead to advances in the sciences and technologies of nanomanufacturing, photonic material, and devices. By creating a tight-nit environment of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and chemists, a new generation of engineers with interdisciplinary knowledge and research experience will be trained through participating in these research activities. The advances in nanomanufacturing and education will benefit society by helping the United States maintain a competitive edge in this high technology industry and prepare a high quality workforce for the nation's economy and security.</AbstractNarration>
