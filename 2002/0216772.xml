    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the acquisition of a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 Scanned Probe Microscope (SPM) System with a NanoScope IV Controller. This instrument will be placed in a central facility to be employed in the research of dozens of undergraduate and graduate students from many departments at Cornell. It will also be used by Cornell nanotechnology classes, K-12 tours, and outside users. The microscope will enable new research directions dealing with nanoscale electrical devices, nanoscale chemical modification, polymer dynamics near surfaces, the development of new types of scanning microscopy, and biomaterials characterization. It will take the place of an older SPM that will be relocated to Simmons College, a women's college in Boston, to be used in undergraduate research aimed at developing polymer materials for organic light-emitting diodes. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the acquisition of a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 Scanned Probe Microscope (SPM) System, which will be placed in a central facility for use by dozens of undergraduate and graduate students in projects that require imaging samples with nanometer-scale resolution. For example, it will be used to examine molecular-scale electronic devices while they are in operation, the atom-by-atom processes by which chemicals can sculpt surfaces, and the self-assembly of biological materials. The microscope will also be employed by Cornell nanotechnology classes, visiting high-school teachers and students, and outside users. It will take the place of an older scanned-probe microscope that will be relocated to Simmons College, a women's college in Boston, Massachusetts. This will provide students at Simmons and nearby colleges the opportunity to work with a research-quality instrument as they are encouraged to consider technical careers.</AbstractNarration>
