    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR)Phase II project will develop full waveform models and minimal sensor algorithms for the General Dynamics - Advanced Technology Systems (GDATS) eddy current sensor (ECS). These algorithms will enable the practical real-time high performance health monitoring for turbine engines. Current processing techniques could require four or more sensors; however, these approaches do not make use of all the information made available by the ESC. Using the full ECS signature, it is possible, in theory, to estimate integral vibration frequency, phase and amplitude using only a single sensor. The reduction of the number of sensors required in each engine stage could potentially save millions of dollars over the life of the engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no systems commercially available today for continuous health monitoring of gas turbine engines. Once in use, this system will allow pilots to react immediately to critical engine health problems thus avoiding potentially catastrophic engine failures and loss of lives. The minimal sensor algorithms for continuous health monitoring have a large market spanning the aviation industry, as well as the rapidly expanding power industry.</AbstractNarration>
