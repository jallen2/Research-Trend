    <AbstractNarration>ITR: Information Representation for Cooperation Across Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We define cooperation among the nodes of a network to include any activity &lt;br/&gt;where the action of a single individual relies on information from other &lt;br/&gt;individuals in a shared environment. Using this broad definition, &lt;br/&gt;information aggregation in sensor networks, group activities performed by &lt;br/&gt;autonomous robotic devices, internet exploration and modeling, and &lt;br/&gt;establishment of ad hoc networks are all examples of tasks involving &lt;br/&gt;cooperation among the nodes of a network. An essential feature common to &lt;br/&gt;cooperative tasks is the need to share information across a distributed &lt;br/&gt;system. Thus cooperation requires the flow of information. In environments &lt;br/&gt;limited by constraints on power, bandwidth, time, or memory, efficient &lt;br/&gt;information flow requires efficient data representation. We are currently &lt;br/&gt;studying strategies for efficient information representation in network &lt;br/&gt;systems. When we speak of information representation for a network, &lt;br/&gt;we consider the network as a whole, asking questions about where information &lt;br/&gt;resides in the network, where it is needed, and how to most efficiently &lt;br/&gt;represent the information to make it accessible where it is needed. &lt;br/&gt;Current topics of investigation include network data compression, functional &lt;br/&gt;source coding for networks, and joint source-channel coding for networks.</AbstractNarration>
