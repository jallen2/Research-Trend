    <AbstractNarration>Smirnova&lt;br/&gt;0207050&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and her colleague aim to develop&lt;br/&gt;theoretically a novel method, the DSM-dynamical system method,&lt;br/&gt;for solving a wide variety of linear and nonlinear ill-posed&lt;br/&gt;problems, to implement algorithms based on this method, and to&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate the advantages of this method in efficiency and&lt;br/&gt;accuracy. The DSM method is used as a general approach to the&lt;br/&gt;construction of regularizing algorithms for solving ill-posed&lt;br/&gt;problems, i.e. a stopping rule is developed: a rule for choosing&lt;br/&gt;that moment of time at which the value of the solution to the&lt;br/&gt;basic evolution equation stably approximates the solution to the&lt;br/&gt;original ill-posed equation in the case when the data are given&lt;br/&gt;with some error. Applications of different versions of the DSM&lt;br/&gt;are considered to classical ill-posed problems of computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, such as stable differentiation of noisy data, stable&lt;br/&gt;inversion of ill-conditioned matrices, and to nonlinear inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in geophysics, quantum physics, medicine, remote&lt;br/&gt;sensing in technology, and other applied areas. The DSM with&lt;br/&gt;simultaneous updates of the inverse derivative operator without&lt;br/&gt;actual inverting of this operator is developed for solving&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear ill-posed problems. The DSM is used as a general method&lt;br/&gt;for constructing convergent iterative processes for solving&lt;br/&gt;ill-posed operator equations. Namely, convergent discretization&lt;br/&gt;schemes for solving the basic evolution equation of the DSM&lt;br/&gt;provide convergent iterative methods for solving the original&lt;br/&gt;equation. The DSM is developed for unbounded operators, which do&lt;br/&gt;not have continuous inverse operators, and also for a nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;operators whose derivative is a Fredholm operator with nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;null-space.&lt;br/&gt; The area of ill-posed (unstable) problems is extremely&lt;br/&gt;difficult, because solutions to ill-posed problems are very&lt;br/&gt;sensitive to small variation in input data. For that reason&lt;br/&gt;ill-posed problems cannot be solved by classical methods: the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding numerical procedures for them turn out to be&lt;br/&gt;divergent. However, ill-posed problems are frequently encountered&lt;br/&gt;in many branches of natural sciences and engineering:&lt;br/&gt;astrophysics, geophysics, spectroscopy, plasma diagnostics,&lt;br/&gt;computerized tomography, antenna design, optimal design of&lt;br/&gt;technical systems and engineering constructions, optimal&lt;br/&gt;planning, optimal control over various processes, and many other&lt;br/&gt;fields. Mathematical statements of these problems are given in&lt;br/&gt;the form of operator equations of the first kind, problems of&lt;br/&gt;functional minimization, problems of determining values of&lt;br/&gt;unbounded operators, variational inequalities, and so on. The&lt;br/&gt;project develops computational methods that provide more accurate&lt;br/&gt;solutions to a wide range of ill-posed problems. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;also uses the results in the graduate courses on ill-posed and&lt;br/&gt;inverse problems she teaches at Georgia State University.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, because ill-posed problems are of basic importance in&lt;br/&gt;applications, the results are of wide use in engineering and&lt;br/&gt;applied sciences.</AbstractNarration>
