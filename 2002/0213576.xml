    <AbstractNarration>The First U.S.-Italy Workshop on Frontiers in Materials Research, Nanoscience and Nanotechnology will be held on March 14-15, 2002 at the National Science Foundation, Arlington, Virginia. In addition to key note talks that will address the core topics of the workshop, six breakout groups will meet in parallel sessions to hold discussions and write a report that outlines issues and identifies opportunities for collaborative research in each of the respective fields. Three major areas will be explored, each having two sub-areas. (1) Frontiers in Characterization of Nanoscale Systems: Low dimensional systems, nanostructures and devices; Studies of single-molecule and few electron systems and devices. (2) Advances in Self-assembly and Novel Materials: self-assembled systems and devices; synthesis of novel organic and inorganic systems and their devices. (3) Interfaces between Materials Research and Biology: self-assembly of biomolecular materials; novel biomolecular devices. A goal of the workshop is to foster bilateral collaborations between leading groups in materials research, nanoscience, and nanotechnology in the U.S. and Italy. The research initiated through these direct bilateral collaborations will complement research that is presently sponsored under the U.S. National Science Foundation - European Commission implementation agreements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials research is a huge driving force for innovations that serve to educate and train future scientists and engineers, while advancing economic growth and social progress. Frontier areas of nanoscience and technology are generating scientific breakthroughs that revolutionize existing technologies as well a create new ones in areas that include health and medical services, transportation, environmental protection, energy efficiency, civil infrastructure, information technology, and homeland security.</AbstractNarration>
