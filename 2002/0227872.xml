    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Sara Wadia-Fascetti is an Associate Professor of Civil Engineering at Northeastern University, and has served as a mentor to undergraduate and graduate female and male engineering students since 1994. She developed the e-mentoring program to give students a mechanism for communication with their mentors and mentees between meetings. The program links female pre-college students, college students, and professionals in discussion groups with two to five additional women. Professional women are recruited from the college of Engineering alumni as well as local companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Wadia-Fascetti has also created a program, Connections, that offers weekly after-school activities for Boston girls, including a computer clubhouse for middle- and high-school girls to work alongside college women, an "introduction to college" series for female high-school students so they learn how the higher education system works, and a number of other programs for college women.</AbstractNarration>
