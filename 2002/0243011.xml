    <AbstractNarration>0243011&lt;br/&gt;Kumar &lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports the US-India Cooperative Research: Development and Characterization of Conjugated Polymer Films Suitable for Photovoltaic Devices. &lt;br/&gt;US PI Jayant Kumar, University of Massachusetts Lowell and P.K. Bhatnagar, University of Delhi will study conjugated polymeric thin film solar cells with particular emphasis on material properties and material issues in device performance. Polymer-Polymer, Polymer-Fullerene and Inorganic-Polymer solar cells will be developed using spin casting, electrostatic deposition and vacuum evaporation techniques. The objective is to obtain interpenetrating homogenous nanostructure to improve the quality of the photovoltaic devices. &lt;br/&gt;Scope: The collaboration brings together the combined expertise of two active research groups in the area of photovoltaics. The Indian group has expertise in design, fabrication and characterization in organic semiconductor solar cells; the US group has considerable experience in organic and conjugated polymer devices. The interaction is expected to lead to synergistic advances in the development and application in environmentally attractive solar energy solutions with potential global benefits. This research has a strong educational component in so far as it includes broad student participation. This activity is funded by the Indian Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.</AbstractNarration>
