    <AbstractNarration>This dissertation research project, Fighting Engineers: The U.S. Navy and Professional&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical Engineering, 1842-1900, investigates nineteenth century Navy social&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy, engineering style, and engineers. Navy engineers were few in number before&lt;br/&gt;the Civil War, but the engineering corps expanded several fold during the war. Social&lt;br/&gt;conflict developed between combat and engineering officers, known throughout the&lt;br/&gt;second half of the century as the line-staff dispute. At stake was authority and prestige;&lt;br/&gt;line officers were unwilling to share either with shipboard engineers and fought against&lt;br/&gt;any encroachment on their traditional privileges. For their part, engineers rallied support&lt;br/&gt;in Congress, academia, and industry to gain the respect they felt they deserved.&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation connects to a broader historical theme: government sponsorship&lt;br/&gt;of technology, an American phenomenon that often has a military genesis. From 1865 to&lt;br/&gt;1890, the U.S. Navy created modern mechanical engineering at the Naval Academy. The&lt;br/&gt;formation of this new body of technical knowledge had dramatic and unforeseen&lt;br/&gt;multiplier effects for the nation. By century's end, Navy engineer veterans directed the&lt;br/&gt;largest industrial corporations in the country and taught at its finest universities. They&lt;br/&gt;were one critical but overlooked factor in nineteenth century American economic&lt;br/&gt;development. Funds for this project support research at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.</AbstractNarration>
