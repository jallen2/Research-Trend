    <AbstractNarration>The adequate numerical treatment of nonlinear phenomena&lt;br/&gt;governed by partial differential equations with several disparate&lt;br/&gt;scales is a formidable computational challenge. Modern algorithms&lt;br/&gt;should be able to resolve fine scales for certain physical&lt;br/&gt;quantities without overresolving others, thereby optimizing the&lt;br/&gt;computational effort and making realistic 3d simulations&lt;br/&gt;feasible. Epitaxial and crystal growth in materials science, and&lt;br/&gt;viscous incompressible fluids are typical yet quite distinct&lt;br/&gt;examples addressed in this proposal. The goal of this project is&lt;br/&gt;to design, test, and analyze reliable and efficient adaptive&lt;br/&gt;finite element methods for such problems, with space-time error&lt;br/&gt;control and based on refinement/coarsening mesh modification.&lt;br/&gt;This project blends quite delicate analytical and computational&lt;br/&gt;issues, and applies them to free boundary problems, constrained&lt;br/&gt;problems, geometric PDE and the Navier-Stokes equations of&lt;br/&gt;incompressible fluids.&lt;br/&gt; Scientific computing has joined theory and experiment to&lt;br/&gt;form together the three central aspects of scientific inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;The current strengths in computational mathematics draw on the&lt;br/&gt;widespread acceptance of computational modeling as a complement&lt;br/&gt;to, and even a replacement for, physical tests in a broad number&lt;br/&gt;of fields. In this vein, the investigator develops reliable and&lt;br/&gt;efficient computational tools that may be useful in several areas&lt;br/&gt;of strategic importance such as nanotechnology, materials&lt;br/&gt;science, and high-performance computing. This project is a&lt;br/&gt;collaborative endeavor, involving a number of scientists in the&lt;br/&gt;US and abroad, as well as several students and postdocs. A&lt;br/&gt;substantial effort is devoted to education and human resource&lt;br/&gt;development.</AbstractNarration>
