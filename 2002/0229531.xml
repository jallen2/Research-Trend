    <AbstractNarration>Hidden from view by the human eye are literally millions of microscopic organisms that are essential for maintaining the health and integrity of all ecosystems. Indeed, the roles microbes play in basic functions such as photosynthesis, energy flow and nutrient recycling are necessary for maintaining life on Earth. Irrespective of their overwhelming importance in the biosphere, microbes remain poorly understood. Because little is known about the true number of microbes and their genetic diversity, it is especially troubling to realize that taxonomic expertise in this group is declining worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing an innovative, fun-to-use, and highly informative computerized guide for use in introductory courses that will ignite interest and understanding of microscopic biodiversity, and help attract young people to careers in the study of microbes. The project is focusing on the algae, a diverse array of colorful and fascinating organisms that catch the imagination of students. Each year in introductory courses throughout the country literally hundreds of students are asked to use a dichotomous key to identify algae supplied by commercial venders. Often, due to insufficient illustrations and the unforgiving nature of dichotomous keys, students leave these laboratory sessions frustrated. We are developing a highly illustrative key to be used with cultures from commercial suppliers that is fundamentally different from standard&lt;br/&gt;dichotomous keys in being nonhierarchical in design and inherently easier to use. Because the key is being widely distributed over the web it can potentially be used by thousands of students.</AbstractNarration>
