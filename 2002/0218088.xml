    <AbstractNarration>Harmon&lt;br/&gt;0218088&lt;br/&gt;The Andrews LTER program seeks to understand the long-term dynamics of forest and river&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest. The Central Question guiding Andrews LTER research is:&lt;br/&gt;How do land use, natural disturbances, and climate change affect three key sets of&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem services: carbon and nutrient dynamics, biodiversity, and hydrology? These&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem services represent scientifically and socially important, tractable variables, and their&lt;br/&gt;responses are posited to represent different classes of ecosystem behavior at the landscape scale.&lt;br/&gt;Climate, land use, and natural disturbances are the major drivers of change in the Pacific&lt;br/&gt;Northwest region. The approach used to address this question will be multi-faceted involving&lt;br/&gt;retrospective analysis, time series observations, experiments, and use of simulation models for&lt;br/&gt;synthesis, extrapolation in time, and interpolation in space. The principal spatial scale of&lt;br/&gt;inference for LTER studies is the Andrews Forest and adjacent upper Blue River watershed, an&lt;br/&gt;area of 16,000 ha. Work associated with the LTER will be coordinated with studies aimed at&lt;br/&gt;regional questions. The principal temporal extent of proposed LTER studies spans the past 500&lt;br/&gt;yr and to several centuries projected into the future. This proposal represents the strategic plan of&lt;br/&gt;activities designed to advance science for individual disciplines, integration, and cross-site&lt;br/&gt;comparisons. Thus, the Andrews LTER is used as the core of a larger set of integrated studies.&lt;br/&gt;Essential long-term studies will be continued and others added to increase spatial and&lt;br/&gt;temporal overlap of scales. The standard 5 LTER core activities will be addressed by work in&lt;br/&gt;seven component areas: (1) climate, (2) hydrology, (3) disturbance, (4) ecophysiology,&lt;br/&gt;(5) carbon and nutrient dynamics, (6) biodiversity, and (7) stream-forest interactions. In this&lt;br/&gt;grant cycle, studies continue to examine the interaction of the drivers of change and responding&lt;br/&gt;processes and taxa, but the conceptual emphasis will be on temporal behavior, its causes, and&lt;br/&gt;its consequences for ecosystem change. We will examine temporal behavior over time scales of&lt;br/&gt;days to hundreds of years focusing on: (1) modulation, (2) temporal lags, (3) spatial coherence,&lt;br/&gt;(4) path dependence, (5) hysteresis, and (6) alternative stable states. Exploring these aspects of&lt;br/&gt;temporal behavior help to address the Central Question by quantifying natural temporal&lt;br/&gt;variability and providing insights into mechanisms that control processes. A major goal will be&lt;br/&gt;to test predictive rules (i.e., hypotheses) regulating temporal behaviors. Another focus of&lt;br/&gt;synthesis will be small watersheds, an important landscape unit providing opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;integration of climatic, ecosystem, and hydrological processes as well as knowledge of temporal&lt;br/&gt;and spatial scaling. The ultimate goal in this integration is to create a spatially 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;(including subsurface and air flow) understanding of the temporal dynamics of the 3 states of&lt;br/&gt;matter involved in biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles within a watershed. Past experiments,&lt;br/&gt;long term records of climate, stream flow, nutrient exports, and vegetation change, as well as&lt;br/&gt;modeling will enhance this integration effort. By understanding this key landscape unit, future&lt;br/&gt;broader-scale efforts will be strengthened.&lt;br/&gt;Andrews science and scientists continue to advance understanding and management of&lt;br/&gt;forests and streams of the Pacific Northwest through communication with students, teachers,&lt;br/&gt;policy makers, land managers, and the general public. Information management, an essential&lt;br/&gt;activity for both research and education, emphasizes ease of use, increased accessibility, and&lt;br/&gt;portability of many forms of information.</AbstractNarration>
