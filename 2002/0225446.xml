    <AbstractNarration>The vision of this proposed work is to create more versatile information systems by using autonomous and distributed sensor networks: hundreds of small sensors, equipped with limited memory and actuation capabilities will autonomously organize themselves and move to track a source and convey information about its location to a human user, and to the rest of the team. Such distributed active sensor networks are pervasive computing systems, well-suited for tasks in extreme environments, especially when the environmental model and the task specifications are uncertain and the system has to adapt to it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To create active sensor networks capable of such applications, a fundamental goal of this research is to develop a science base for distributed sensor network control and information gathering and coordination.&lt;br/&gt;This is a considerable challenge, which we propose to meet by the synergistic integration of the following directions of work: (1) new ideas for communication in sensor networks; (2) new ideas for developing adaptive active control and coordination in sensor networks; (3) new ideas for information gathering and aggregation in sensor networks; and (4) experiments grounded on realistic scenarios that measure empirically the performance and scalability of the proposed communication and control algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the central challenges for this proposed work are focused on developing, implementing and evaluating a suite of scalable network protocols that (1) guarantee message delivery; (2) are fault tolerant; (3) maximize the network lifetime; and (4) are adaptive to the environment and to the task.</AbstractNarration>
