    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0203070.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to study three separate topics:&lt;br/&gt;i) Eigenvalue estimates for the Laplacian on Hermitian holomorphic line bundles, &lt;br/&gt;ii) Quantum Unique Ergodicity, and iii) Behavior of eigenfunctions near the ideal &lt;br/&gt;boundary of hyperbolic space. Consider the tensor powers of a Hermitian holomorphic &lt;br/&gt;line bundle, over a compact complex manifold. If the curvature form of the line bundle &lt;br/&gt;is strictly positive, then the first non--zero eigenvalue, of the Laplacian, acting on &lt;br/&gt;sections of the $k$th power, is bounded below uniformly in $k$. The proposal is to prove &lt;br/&gt;that the first non--zero eigenvalue is uniformly bounded below when the curvature is &lt;br/&gt;semipositive everywhere and positive for at least one point. The problem can be reformulated&lt;br/&gt;in terms of CR geometry. Microlocal analysis will be applied to the reformulated problem.&lt;br/&gt;The problem of quantum unique ergodicity concerns concentration of eigenfunctions on &lt;br/&gt;manifolds with ergodic geodesic flow. We propose to construct examples where sequences of &lt;br/&gt;eigenfunctions concentrate along isolated closed geodesics or on one parameter families of &lt;br/&gt;closed geodesics. The first step is to find quasimodes (approximate eigenfunctions). &lt;br/&gt;Next one must show that these quasimodes correspond to individual eigenfunctions rather &lt;br/&gt;than sums of several eigenfunctions. The hyperbolic space has essential spectrum which is &lt;br/&gt;a proper subset of the positive real line. There do exist eigenfunctions, defined on the &lt;br/&gt;complements of compact sets, whose eigenvalue lies below the start of the essential spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;The behavior of these eigenfunctions will be studied near the ideal boundary at infinity.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to understand the nodal set by means of a perturbation expansion. It appears &lt;br/&gt;that the case of surfaces is much more tractable than the higher dimensional cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop our understanding of the quantum phenomena, mathematicians are often inspired by &lt;br/&gt;the analogy with classical mechanics. The passage from the classical to the quantum level &lt;br/&gt;is called the semiclassical limit. If the classical motion is chaotic, one expects the &lt;br/&gt;probability distribution of the quantum particle to be dispersed. Exceptions to this pattern, &lt;br/&gt;where the particle concentrates, are of particular interest. Similarly, if an energy &lt;br/&gt;estimate holds under strict positivity conditions of a classical curvature form, one &lt;br/&gt;naturally investigates the borderline case where the curvature form is non--negative.&lt;br/&gt;One hopes that regularity properties will persevere in the more general situation.&lt;br/&gt;This type of question is interesting because non--negative objects often occur as the limits&lt;br/&gt;of positive objects. The nodal set of a quantum particle is the stationary set for the &lt;br/&gt;associated wave motion. Its distribution and shape are of fundamental interest, &lt;br/&gt;but poorly understood, especially in dimensions larger than two.</AbstractNarration>
