    <AbstractNarration>The research will focus on several problems concerning&lt;br/&gt;the boundary behavior of analytic functions and their&lt;br/&gt;applications in functional analysis and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physics. In analytic function theory the PI plans to&lt;br/&gt;study the interaction between singular and non-singular&lt;br/&gt;components of Cauchy integrals near the boundary of a&lt;br/&gt;complex domain. The results will then be applied to&lt;br/&gt;study the resolvent functions of linear operators in&lt;br/&gt;perturbation problems. This area has connections with&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models of solid state physics, which&lt;br/&gt;provides most of the motivation. Another part of the&lt;br/&gt;project is the study of the connections between the&lt;br/&gt;Beurling-Malliavin theory, inverse spectral problems&lt;br/&gt;for partial differential equations and properties of&lt;br/&gt;kernels of Toepliz operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analytic Function Theory is one of the classical yet&lt;br/&gt;rapidly developing parts of modern mathematics. The&lt;br/&gt;present stage of its development features many&lt;br/&gt;promising new applications in various parts of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics. One of the cornerstones of&lt;br/&gt;Analytic Function Theory is the integral formula&lt;br/&gt;named after the famous French mathematician Cauchy.&lt;br/&gt;The importance of this formula is due to the fact&lt;br/&gt;that most analytic functions in complex domains can&lt;br/&gt;be defined through Cauchy integrals. The PI plans&lt;br/&gt;to study various properties of Cauchy integrals near&lt;br/&gt;the boundaries of their domains. The results will&lt;br/&gt;then be applied in several areas of mathematics as&lt;br/&gt;well as in mathematical physics. The applications&lt;br/&gt;in mathematical physics will concern, among other&lt;br/&gt;things, mathematical models of wave propagation.&lt;br/&gt;The general question that will be considered is how&lt;br/&gt;to recover full information about a disordered&lt;br/&gt;environment from the spectrum of the wave operator and&lt;br/&gt;partial information on the potential field.</AbstractNarration>
