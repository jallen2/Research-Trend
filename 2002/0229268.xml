    <AbstractNarration>The New York Hall of Science will develop "Connections," a 3,500-sq. ft. interactive exhibition and related learning resources that will introduce visitors to the fundamental technology of networks. "Connections" will offer diverse audiences opportunities to explore networks, both natural and human-designed. The exhibition will highlight the fundamental characteristics of networks such as their structure, function and adaptability. The project will also produce supporting educational resources for families, after-school programs, community groups, students and teachers. Audio-tours will be produced for general visitors and for visitors with visual impairments. The Connections Discovery Lab, a 750-sq. ft. enclosed space adjacent to the exhibition, will offer scheduled workshops and drop-in programs.</AbstractNarration>
