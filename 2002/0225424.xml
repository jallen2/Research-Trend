    <AbstractNarration>0225424&lt;br/&gt;Brown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is being submitted under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER)&lt;br/&gt;program and it focuses on answering critical feasibility questions pertaining to a new&lt;br/&gt;technique for the detection and location of buried landmines and unexploded ordnance. The&lt;br/&gt;subject technique comprises a standoff, ground based, pulsed radar that launches&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic energy into the Norton surface wave mode of propagation. The Norton&lt;br/&gt;surface wave travels along the air-ground surface at the speed of light in a vacuum and&lt;br/&gt;exponentially decays into the ground due to the losses in the ground. By selecting the&lt;br/&gt;frequency properly, sufficient energy will be scattered by the landmine back along the&lt;br/&gt;same propagation path and then received by the radar. This energy is usually insufficient&lt;br/&gt;to be above the system noise level so return pulse averaging is carried out using coherent&lt;br/&gt;techniques. If N return pulses are averaged coherently the signal-to-noise power ratio&lt;br/&gt;will increase by a factor of N rendering the signal scattered from the landmine&lt;br/&gt;detectable. Location of the mine is achieved by using the pulse width to accomplish&lt;br/&gt;resolution in the range coordinate and the radar antenna to achieve resolution in the&lt;br/&gt;azimuth angle. In order to achieve area coverage and the best possible angular resolution&lt;br/&gt;close to the antenna, it is proposed to simultaneously employ both beam steering and near&lt;br/&gt;field focusing techniques. The critical study, to establish feasibility, is the&lt;br/&gt;determination of the highest operating frequency for which the Norton surface wave can&lt;br/&gt;propagate on the surface and penetrate sufficiently deep to detect antipersonnel and&lt;br/&gt;antitank mines. It is also proposed to develop the appropriate radar range equation for&lt;br/&gt;the Norton surface wave, investigate techniques for maximizing the coupling of the radar&lt;br/&gt;antenna to the Norton surface wave, determine the variation of soil conductivity and the&lt;br/&gt;radar cross section values for typical nonferrous landmines, and investigate the maximum&lt;br/&gt;range and angle resolution or the acceptable frequencies of operation. Having answered&lt;br/&gt;these questions, it should be possible to establish the viability of such a radar subject&lt;br/&gt;only to the need to compute the effects of surface roughness and buried debris on the mine&lt;br/&gt;scattered signal strength, i.e., the low signal-to-clutter ratio problem.</AbstractNarration>
