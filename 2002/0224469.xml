    <AbstractNarration>EIA 0224369&lt;br/&gt;Pandey, Raju&lt;br/&gt;Aksoy, Demet; Devanbu, Premkimar T.; Olsson, Ronald A.&lt;br/&gt;University of California - Davis &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE RR: Infrastructure for Research in Parallel and Distributed Computing &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, supporting parallel computing, distributed systems, ubiquitous (autonomous) systems, and satellite communication, aims at establishing a parallel and distributed computing laboratory within the center for software systems. The lab will include four clusters, each connected through high speed network. The parallel computing cluster will host several multiprocessor systems; the distributed system cluster will include workstations and PCs, the ubiquitous systems cluster will connect embedded devices (including handheld device sensors); and the satellite cluster will host equipment for initiating the downlink communication for disseminating the data. The sensor network will primarily be connected through an ad hoc wireless network that will be routed to the main high-speed backbone. The infrastructure will meet the needs of four research projects in&lt;br/&gt;1. Distributed Systems,&lt;br/&gt;2. Parallel Computing,&lt;br/&gt;3. Distributed Systems Software Engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;4. Wide Area Data Dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;The distributed systems cluster will enable the distributed systems group to develop highly efficient, scalable, robust, and secure distributed systems that adapt to changes underlying systems conditions. Further, the ubiquitous systems cluster will permit the group to develop new application-specific routing algorithms, novel programming models customizable middleware that seamlessly integrate sensor-based systems and scalable resource allocation, and conservation algorithms for large sensor-based systems. The satellite communication cluster, along with the distributed systems cluster, will enable the distributed data dissemination group to develop highly scalable, robust, and secure data-dissemination techniques with adaptable quality of service. The concurrent programming group will use the parallel computing cluster to evaluate their work on both concurrent programming languages and efficient runtime systems for parallel systems. On the educational side, the infrastructure will be used as experimental test-beds in several courses and will form the basis for providing research students with development and analysis skills in parallel and distributed systems.</AbstractNarration>
