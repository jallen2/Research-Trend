    <AbstractNarration>0228340&lt;br/&gt;Dangl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will impact several very diverse areas of plant science, from disease and disease resistance to various aspects of plant cell death control during normal development and response to plant hormones. As such, the meeting will attract a very diverse audience. Programmed cell deaths occur at many stages in normal plant growth and development, and is also induced during successful response to infection (the common hypersensitive response) and in response to abiotic stress, particularly those stress responses involving reactive oxygen intermediates. Yet, despite the physiological characterization of a variety of programmed cell deaths over the last 20 years, very little is know about the molecular control of either cell death signaling or cell execution. Moreover, analyses of the complete Arabidopsis and draft rice genomic sequences show that there are no obvious homologues of the common animal cell death control genes in plants. Nevertheless, several studies have shown that expression of animal anti- or pro-cell death control genes in plants can either block or exacerbate plant cell death, respectively. These data argue that some of the mechanisms may be shared between plant and animal cell death control. The meeting proposed will address these issues. This interdisciplinary meeting will result in much cross feeding of disciplines as diverse as plant hormone physiology and plant genomics. A broad participant portfolio with respect to organism studied and biological question asked is assured. The meeting will stress the notion that research in easily accessible models must be translated to scientists applying that basic knowledge to crop plant biology. Thus, the meeting will foster translational agriculture. In order to achieve this goal, the organizers will select participants with broad sets of educational and experiential backgrounds. As part of this aspect of designing the meeting, they will be particularly aware of increasing participation of women, under-represented ethnic groups, and under-represented institutions of higher learning. The speakers include nearly every relevant female principal investigator working in this arena today. The Keystone Symposia are very educationally and community oriented and the selection criteria will include the ideal of capturing the widest participant pool possible while maintaining scientific excellence. The Keystone Symposia are advertised by direct mailings to a huge number of higher educational institutions and the organizers have already received inquiries from potential participants from very "out of the way" universities and colleges. Finally, and perhaps most critically, the organizers have included as many early career scientists as possible. In fact, this NSF award will go exclusively to defraying the costs of doctoral students and non-tenured principal investigators. The organizers will prioritize these to fund as many participants as possible from non-standard research I universities, and will use the guidelines established above to guide our choices.</AbstractNarration>
