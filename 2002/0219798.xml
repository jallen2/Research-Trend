    <AbstractNarration>Abstract - A Quantitative Framework for Long-term Performance Assessment of Waste Management Infrastructure Using Hazard Analysis Method&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current and proposed Natural Hazard Loss Estimation Methodology (HAZUS) focuses on traditional structures such as buildings, utilities and transportation structures, e.g., roads and bridges. This project focuses on the development of methodologies to address damages to waste containment systems due to extreme events (human-induced or natural) for linkage with HAZUS. Damage to waste management facilities can result in the release of highly toxic contaminants into the environment. These issues here become even more important since the events of September 11, 2001. The design service lives of these facilities range from about 10 to 200 years, which is significant enough to warrant consideration of vulnerability when the facility is located in areas of significant seismic activity. Ironically, high population densities characterize most of the earthquake-prone areas and generate high volumes of waste through domestic and industrial activities. This may lead to high concentrations of waste management facilities nearby, which when damaged may pose health and environmental risks to residents of disaster-prone areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, quantitative methodologies will be developed to enable integration into HAZUS the capability to assess potential damage to waste containment facilities in the United States. The overriding objective is to enable the estimation of the vulnerabilities of such system to intentional and natural threats. Performance, described in terms of probable release volumes of contaminants and, in some cases, system structural stability, will be indexed using Weibull shape and scale parameters. Research elements include analyses of containment system configurations to establish the ranges of series and parallel linkages among components with respect to functions; development of a methodology for representing deterioration-time functions for materials that constitute the transport media within containment systems; coupling the occurrence and damage from earthquakes and other transient events; development of a screening system for significant stressors; formulation of a transport assessment sub-module with an architecture open enough to accommodate existing submodels; and establishment of quantitative linkages between probable release volumes of contaminants and ecosystem/human health exposure/risk assessment methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research includes the planned use of its results in technical assistance to local, state and federal agencies, and private firms on the design, siting, and operation of waste management facilities in sensitive environments. This project involves research, training of three students including women and minorities, development and engagement of practicing personnel in this composite natural disaster/environmental security program.</AbstractNarration>
