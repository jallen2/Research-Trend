    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number 0203876&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Smart Event Models and Architectures"&lt;br/&gt;Gail E. Kaiser, Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates wide-area publish/subscribe event system models and architectures. The focus is on two new models called Smart Events and Active Events, and an event bus architecture called Virtual Private Event Networks (VPENs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smart events are associated with a structural type model (a grammar or schema), and a semantic model that defines the processing to be performed on the structural subcomponents. Smart events are routed via content-based messaging, where subscriptions may specify complex patterns indicating the events of interest. Active events include their semantic model directly as mobile code. Active events operate as&lt;br/&gt;mobile agents transported (conceptually) under their own power point-to-point. Smart events may optionally include active event substructures, enabling content-based messaging to be applied to this subset of active events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VPENs extend multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) protocols and mechanisms to the application layer, to improve the performance of content-based routing by preplanning label switched paths when publisher advertisements as well as consumer subscriptions are available. VPENs also add encryption-based security and privacy in the style of virtual private networks (VPNs).</AbstractNarration>
