    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 0220631&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mahmoud Abd-allah&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Central State University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Scholarships for Academic Recruiting and Retention&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, called "Scholarships for Academic Recruiting and Retention (SARR)", provides scholarships to increase recruitment and retention, and graduation rates for computer science, engineering and mathematics students. The key elements of the project are: 1) a scholarship awards program; 2) intensified recruitment of community college students; 3) a broader base of student research and design experiences both on campus and in off campus internships; 4) a set of support services to help scholarship recipients succeed academically and facilitate the next steps toward achieving their career goals. The program initially accommodates 25 science, engineering and mathematics scholars in the first year and 28 scholars for each of the last three years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSU has a number of existing activities and resources that provide a sound foundation for the proposed program. These include a comprehensive tutoring program, a supplemental instruction program, a first- web-based course applicability system that allows community college students to quickly assess course equivalencies and academic ranking for CSU programs, and a learning communities program that facilitates student collaborative study to improve academic performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSU has established standards for the scholarship awards to provide entry to students who are just beginning to realize their potential, while strongly motivating them to push for and to sustain higher levels of academic achievement. SARR provides a network of support services for the scholarship recipients to assist them in overcoming any problems that might impede their progress, and to smooth the way to meet their academic and career objectives. The core of the support network is the assignment of faculty mentors to scholarship recipients. These mentors are charged with tracking and reporting on the progress of their students throughout their undergraduate residence, and for five years beyond. Mentors also counsel students on academic and aptitude matters, and guide them in maximizing their educational experiences and career opportunities. Other elements of the support network provide assistance in finding other sources of financial support if needed, facilitate student participation in internship opportunities, provide entry level career placement assistance, and provide graduate/professional school entry guidance and assistance.</AbstractNarration>
