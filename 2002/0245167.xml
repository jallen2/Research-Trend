    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0245167&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Peter A. Cholak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to study the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between definability and automorphisms in various structures&lt;br/&gt;arising in computability theory. Primarily, but not totally, he&lt;br/&gt;will focus on the collection of all computably enumerable sets.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will also consider the collection of&lt;br/&gt;all Pi01 classes and the computably enumerable degrees. A long&lt;br/&gt;range goal is to provide a complete understanding of these&lt;br/&gt;structures and their automorphisms and definable orbits. Some&lt;br/&gt;related projects in computable structure theory and models of&lt;br/&gt;second order arithmetic are also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of these projects is on definability and&lt;br/&gt;computability. These notions are both important in measuring the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of an answer to a mathematical problem. Problems such&lt;br/&gt;as "Is there a computer program which can solve all questions of&lt;br/&gt;this type?" One develops an intertwined hierarchy of&lt;br/&gt;definability and computability. Only answers which lay on the&lt;br/&gt;lowest level are computable and even then they are not always&lt;br/&gt;feasibly computable given today's computers. Answers of higher&lt;br/&gt;complexity provide useful mathematical information, allow one to&lt;br/&gt;test the limits of mathematical techniques, reveal whether the&lt;br/&gt;wrong techniques are being used, and, in some very rare cases,&lt;br/&gt;can be useful for encoding/decoding information.</AbstractNarration>
