    <AbstractNarration>The investigator continues work on the Kneser-Poulsen&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture that was started with Professor Karoly Bezdek. This&lt;br/&gt;conjecture says that if any finite collection of disks in the&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean plane is rearranged so that the distance between any&lt;br/&gt;pair of centers does not increase, then the area of the union&lt;br/&gt;does not increase and the area of the interesection does not&lt;br/&gt;decrease. They have solved the conjecture in the plane, but many&lt;br/&gt;higher-dimensional questions remain. For example, there is a&lt;br/&gt;candidate for a configuration that might be a counterexample for&lt;br/&gt;the analogous statement in three-space, and there are some&lt;br/&gt;interesting possible differences between the case for a union of&lt;br/&gt;disks and the intersection of disks. Another major topic is the&lt;br/&gt;study of linkages in the plane that are locked in the sense that&lt;br/&gt;they can only move a small amount without crossing. The theory&lt;br/&gt;of frameworks and tensegrities plays an important role here and&lt;br/&gt;can be applied to give reasonable criteria to detect when such a&lt;br/&gt;linkage is locked. This is continuing work of the investigator,&lt;br/&gt;Erik Demaine, and Gunter Rote, who originally solved the&lt;br/&gt;carpenter's rule problem, which states that any polygonal arc can&lt;br/&gt;be opened without creating any self-intersection.&lt;br/&gt; The investigator works on certain basic, fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions about the geometry of discrete objects. Just as&lt;br/&gt;physics asks fundamental questions about the nature of matter,&lt;br/&gt;space, and the universe, and the physical laws they must obey,&lt;br/&gt;geometry asks fundamental questions about how geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;interact and the implicit constraints they satisfy. How does the&lt;br/&gt;area of the union of round disks change as the centers are moved&lt;br/&gt;apart? The investigator (with Karoly Bezdek) has shown that the&lt;br/&gt;area behaves (it increases or stays the same) as expected in the&lt;br/&gt;plane, but the situation in space is not so clear. When is a&lt;br/&gt;robot arm in the plane rigid, and when can it be opened? The&lt;br/&gt;investigator (with Erik Demaine and Gunter Rote) has shown that&lt;br/&gt;arms open as expected in the plane, but what about more&lt;br/&gt;complicated linkages? What can be said about the rigidity of&lt;br/&gt;packings of round balls as a granular material? The investigator&lt;br/&gt;is an expert in such matters, but there are delicate questions&lt;br/&gt;about the rigidity in a container with a small number of disks.&lt;br/&gt;The volume enclosed by a flexible surface is constant, but what&lt;br/&gt;about other geometric invariants? These are concrete tangible&lt;br/&gt;objects, but accessible to the appropriate geometric insight.&lt;br/&gt;These questions are both relevant and potentially quite useful&lt;br/&gt;for subjects as wide-ranging as cell biology, protein folding,&lt;br/&gt;kinematics, and granular materials. For example, it is widely&lt;br/&gt;believed that the geometric structure of a cell has a great deal&lt;br/&gt;to do with its function. So the rigidity of appropriate discrete&lt;br/&gt;objects is relevant. As has been shown over and over again in&lt;br/&gt;physics and mathematics, if the questions are to the point,&lt;br/&gt;applications follow.</AbstractNarration>
