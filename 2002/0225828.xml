    <AbstractNarration>CMS-0225828&lt;br/&gt;PI: Sangchul Bang&lt;br/&gt;Institution: South Dakota School of Mines and Technology&lt;br/&gt;Title: SGER: "Suction Pile Retrieval"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; An Innovative underwater foundation system utilizing suction piles&lt;br/&gt;was introduced in the offshore industry recently. Since then, suction piles&lt;br/&gt;have been successfully used in numerous occasions on a variety of offshore&lt;br/&gt;structures. Suction piles have advantages over conventional underwater&lt;br/&gt;foundation systems due to their simplicity and efficiency. More obvious&lt;br/&gt;advantages of suction piles are easy installation, large bearing capacity,&lt;br/&gt;and retrievability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The retrieval of suction piles is achieved through careful&lt;br/&gt;application of increased water pressure inside the pile. The applied water&lt;br/&gt;pressure must be determined carefully so that the suction pile can be&lt;br/&gt;retrieved safely. The main objective of this study is to identify the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between the applied positive water pressure inside the pile and the&lt;br/&gt;resulting pile pull-out movement through full-scale field tests. These&lt;br/&gt;experiments will provide an invaluable insight for the future development of&lt;br/&gt;an analytical solution for safe suction pile retrieval. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The field retrieval and instrumentation will be designed and&lt;br/&gt;supervised by the principal investigator and performed by the Naval&lt;br/&gt;Facilities Engineering Service Center with three suction piles that were&lt;br/&gt;successfully installed by the principal investigator in 1999. Significant&lt;br/&gt;matching contribution commitment has already been made by the Naval&lt;br/&gt;Facilities Engineering Service Center as evidence of their interests and&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on the expanded use of suction piles.</AbstractNarration>
