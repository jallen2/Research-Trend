    <AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses fundamental physical issues impacting the growing area of integration &lt;br/&gt;of high-frequency electronics with optoelectronics and photonics. Our focus is the&lt;br/&gt;optical properties of semiconductors (quantum wells, wires, and dots) in the presence of strong&lt;br/&gt;dc and high-frequency (GHz-THz) electric fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, we will concentrate on cases where the high-frequency field is applied capacitively,&lt;br/&gt;i.e., it does not introduce additional carriers. The particular phenomena we will consider involve&lt;br/&gt;an interplay of ultrafast carrier dynamics in high-frequency fields, screening of the field by&lt;br/&gt;the spatial motions of the carrier distributions, propagation effects of the high-frequency field,&lt;br/&gt;and the interaction of the carrier distributions with light. Thus, the work will unite both micro&lt;br/&gt;and macroscopic length scales as well as dynamics on the femto to nanosecond timescales. Our effort will be primarily theoretical and computational. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together with our experimental collaborators, we will study the spatio-dynamics of carriers in &lt;br/&gt;photoconductors, semiconductor optical amplifier, and VCSEL's in the presence of the high-frequency fields. In the phenomena we will explore, the spatial aspects play a key role; on the one hand, we will be concerned with how such high-frequency fields adversely perturb the operation of optoelectronics and photonics, while on the other, we will explore potential phenomena for device applications. Potential applications include ultrahigh-bandwidth optical switching, enhanced photoconductive THz generation, ultrahigh-speed optical modulators, lateral mode control from semiconductor light emitters, and ultrahigh-speed beem steering.</AbstractNarration>
