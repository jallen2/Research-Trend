    <AbstractNarration>This project is increasing the pool of well-trained plastics technicians in eastern North Carolina by implementing a program at six community colleges that is improving educational opportunities for economically disadvantaged students, increasing retention of students transitioning from high school to the Plastics Engineering Technology (PET) associate degree level, and improving student services programs designed to recruit and assist PET students in the six county area. By involving plastics industry personnel and services, this project is also strengthening the partnerships of the consortium and helping to stimulate the depressed economy of the region. This project assists the Eastern North Carolina Plastics Technology Consortium, or ENCPTC (NSF grant DUE 0101468), in its efforts to provide well-trained plastics technicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the above goals, the specific objective of this project is to expand, refine, and refocus recruitment efforts to develop a target pool of 350 "interested" high school students; from which, 20% or 70 students are being selected to receive student support services, including financial assistance. This population of 70 economically disadvantaged or under-represented first year students are being provided student services and economic support in order to maintain an 80% retention rate for second year students. Ultimately, a 90% employment rate (in plastics technology) of all program completers will be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PETS Project Director, (who also serves as ENCPTC Site Director) and the Recruiter/Mentor work with the Financial Aid Directors of the six colleges to provide approximately 295 students with scholarships or stipends over a 4-year grant period. This program enables students to progressively increase their amount of assistance as they prove their potential and reach certain milestones.</AbstractNarration>
