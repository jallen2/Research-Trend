    <AbstractNarration>While universities have long served as a source of scientific and technical knowledge for industry, there has been a significant rise in both the level and the formalization of knowledge transfer activities at the university-industry interface. For the most part, however, recent research explores university-industry interactions from the perspective of the university. Few studies examine the firm's perspective. As a result, understanding of the motivations of firms in technology-transfer and the ways in which industry-university interaction fits into the larger U.S. system of innovation is limited. This study seeks to address this gap. Leveraging organizational theory and contract theory, hypotheses are developed to explore: How the firm's internal R&amp;D organization and innovation strategy affect its propensity to interact with universities; how the firm's internal R&amp;D organization and innovation strategy affect the mode of university-industry interactions selected. (Does the firm pursue limited transactions or long-term relationships?); and how the firm's internal R&amp;D organization and innovation strategy affect expectations for, and satisfaction with, the university interactions. To conduct this study, data will be collected through a survey of the large R&amp;D performers, both public and private, in the U.S. economy. Empirical testing of hypotheses will contribute an understanding of how university interaction fits within the firm's R&amp;D strategy and examine the effect of firm strategy and organizational structure on the types of technology-transfer mechanisms employed by the firm and the ultimate relationship the firm maintains with the university. Besides contributing to the existing knowledge base, the study will provide useful comparative information for industry R&amp;D managers. One or two PhD students will also be involved in this research, and outcomes will contribute to classes in entrepreneurship, strategy, and science policy.</AbstractNarration>
