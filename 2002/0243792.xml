    <AbstractNarration>The Association of American State Geologists will provide undergraduate students in geoscience with field-oriented research experiences. The objectives of the program are to train students in scientific field techniques (particularly geologic mapping) and to excite and encourage students to pursue careers in geoscience. This program will enable these students to work side by side with experienced geologic mappers, field geologists, and geophysicists conducting field investigations. The mentors serve as not only teachers and mentors but also as scientific collaborators. State geological surveys in all 50 states and Puerto Rico are eligible to hire students through this program; students contact state geological surveys directly to inquire about this and other mentoring and intern programs. Most student projects run during summer months, but some include field activities during other parts of the year.</AbstractNarration>
