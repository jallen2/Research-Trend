    <AbstractNarration>A workshop entitled NSF-EC: From Nanomaterials to Nanotechnology will provide an opportunity for U.S. scientists and engineers to address together with their European colleagues nanomaterials research activities in four thematic areas: Nano-Chemistry to include nanoparticle, nanotube and nanowire formation and properties; Nano-materials research activities to include atomic and molecular assembly into functional materials; Nano-biosystems research to include nanomaterials in bioengineering activities; and nano-devices to include nanomagnetics, nanoelectronics, nanophotonics and sensors. In addition to presentations by both National Science Foundation (NSF) and European Community (EC) participants in each of these four theme areas, two roundtable discussions will cover issues such as the differences between U.S. and European nanotechnology development, and the role of the academic lab in addressing priority areas such as nanomaterials scale-up challenges. The outcome for the workshop will be a report co-authored by participants highlighting opportunities in basic nanomaterials research for US-EC collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology research enables discoveries and innovations over a broad range of academic and industrial areas of high priority to the United States. This is the last in a series of five nanotechnology workshops jointly organized by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the European Commission to define the broader context for possible NSF-EC materials research collaborations. A significant emphasis on the societal impact of nanoscience and nanotechnology has been a focus of these workshops.</AbstractNarration>
