    <AbstractNarration>Animals make critical 'decisions' at all stages of their life cycles. These decisions are developmental, physiological and behavioral in nature, and represent a critical assessment of both external and internal factors. For example, the timing of metamorphosis, hatching, or birth may depend upon the tradeoffs between growth opportunity and mortality risk in the developmental habitat. Physiological sensors compute these tradeoffs as a function of energy balance and environmental stress, and effectors initiate physiological, developmental and behavioral responses to these determinations. The neuroendocrine stress axis provides a means for animals to integrate information from multiple sources (internal and external) and to respond accordingly (behaviorally, physiologically and developmentally). The objectives of the proposed studies are to provide a mechanistic basis for understanding signaling within the neuroendocrine stress system. These experiments will utilize a powerful model organism, the South African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. The proposed studies will use neuroanatomical, physiological and molecular approaches to understand 1) how central corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stress circuits are organized and regulated in response to environmental stress, and 2) how corticosteroid (adrenal stress hormone) feedback and a CRH binding protein modulate CRH expression and action. The basic components and organization of the vertebrate neuroendocrine stress axis arose early in evolution, and the structure and function of these pathways are conserved. Thus, findings in the frog are likely to be applicable to other vertebrate species. Results of these studies should provide a better understanding of how amphibians respond to environmental stress, and, given recent documented global declines in amphibian populations, can provide knowledge vital to wildlife conservation efforts. The broader impacts of these studies include opportunities for high school and undergraduate students to participate in cutting edge science, continued international collaborations, and further identification of the consequences of environmental stress for the health of natural amphibian populations.</AbstractNarration>
