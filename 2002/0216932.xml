    <AbstractNarration>A substantial literature explores various ways to estimate black-white wage gaps among men. Social scientists realize that it is difficult to measure black-white differences in labor market opportunities among men because large numbers of less-skilled black men do not work and therefore do not report wages. Thus, the sample of wages among black men is a highly select sample, and the resulting estimate of the average wage among black men is overstated because of this selection bias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While much progress has been made on statistical methods for addressing this important measurement problem, it is striking that the literature deals almost exclusively with the data on men. Many economists and demographers believe that selection bias is not a problem when measuring the black-white wage gap among women because black and white women have similar labor force participation rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research will explore how racial differences patterns of labor force participation among women may affect measured black-white wage gaps among women even though overall levels of participation are the same among black and white women. Preliminary results indicate that the relationship between labor force participation and family structure differs notably by race. Married women who are raising children account for a disproportionate share of white women who do not work in the market. Among black women, single mothers are over-represented in the sample of women who did not report any market work, and a significant fraction of black, single mothers who do not work in the market receive means tested government assistance in some form over long time periods. My initial results come from the 1979 cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). By using data on wages over the 1988-92 period, I construct a wage observation for at least ninety percent of black women and over 90 percent of white women in the NLSY79 sample. In addition, based on other data in the NLSY79 that describe family structures and income sources, I develop imputation rules that allow me to construct estimates of black-white gaps in both mean and median wages based on samples that include wage data for at least 95 percent of both the black and white samples. Thus far, my work with the NLSY79 data suggests that the measured black-white gap in wages among working women seriously understates the absolute magnitude of the black-white gap in potential wages among women. My findings are preliminary and apply only to one census year, 1990, for women born in the years 1957-64. Thus, much work remains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The research will address the following questions: (1) How robust are initial findings concerning selection bias and the measurement of black-white wage gaps among young adult women in 1990? (2) How have changes over time in racial differences in selection patterns affected the measurement of trends in the black-white wage gap among women? (3) How do racial differences in patterns of selection affect racial differences in wage growth over the life-cycle among women. (4) Has labor market discrimination against black women relative to white women increased, decreased, or remained constant during the past three decades? My research plan seeks to combine several of the NLS panel data sets as well as data from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics. These panels provide histories of work experience as well as histories of labor and non-labor income. By combining the information in various panels, I will be able to replicate the work I have done with the NLSY79 using a broad range of age groups over the census years 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Early results suggest that black women may not have made as much progress during the 1970s as previous studies suggest. Further, black women may not have experienced losses in relative labormarket status during the 1980s and 90s even though many studies argue that they have.</AbstractNarration>
