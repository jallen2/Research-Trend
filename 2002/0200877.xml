    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigators study the complex hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;geometry of the moduli spaces of cubic surfaces and cubic &lt;br/&gt;threefolds. For stable cubic surfaces over the complex numbers, &lt;br/&gt;previous work of D. Allcock and the investigators gives a period &lt;br/&gt;map from the moduli space to the quotient of the four-ball by a &lt;br/&gt;lattice defined over the Eisenstein integers, which is an &lt;br/&gt;isomorphism between these two spaces and which takes the subspace &lt;br/&gt;of moduli of singular surfaces to a configuration of hyperplanes &lt;br/&gt;in the ball. The investigators now study the arithmetic &lt;br/&gt;properties of cubic surfaces whose periods are Eisenstein rational &lt;br/&gt;points. For stable cubic threefolds over the complex numbers, &lt;br/&gt;there is a period map from their moduli space to the quotient of &lt;br/&gt;the ten-ball by a lattice also defined over the Eisenstein &lt;br/&gt;integers. The investigators study detailed properties of this &lt;br/&gt;period map in order to prove that this map is an isomorphism &lt;br/&gt;between the two spaces (after some blowing up and down) which &lt;br/&gt;carries the subspace of moduli of singular threefolds to a &lt;br/&gt;hyperplane configuration in the ball. The main technical point &lt;br/&gt;under study is the computation of the differential of the &lt;br/&gt;restriction of the period map to each stratum that parametrizes &lt;br/&gt;equisingular varieties. The extension of the Griffiths residue &lt;br/&gt;calculus to this situation turns out to be quite involved and to &lt;br/&gt;require new techniques in commutative algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of cubic equations has been a central theme in &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, whith deep implications for mathematics, science and &lt;br/&gt;engineering. In the sixteenth century cubic equations in one &lt;br/&gt;variable were solved by finding a formula for its solutions &lt;br/&gt;analogous to the well-known formula for the solutions of quadratic &lt;br/&gt;equations. This formula led to the introduction of complex &lt;br/&gt;numbers, which are now a standard tool in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was realized that &lt;br/&gt;quadratic equations in any number of variables could be &lt;br/&gt;understood, and that, for a fixed number of variables, all &lt;br/&gt;quadratic equations are essentially equivalent by a change of &lt;br/&gt;variables. It was also realized that cubic equations in two or &lt;br/&gt;more variables are not all equivalent by change of variables. &lt;br/&gt;The different equivalence classes are now called the moduli space. &lt;br/&gt;The moduli space of cubic equations in two variables is the &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic plane of non-Euclidean geometry. This connection has led to many&lt;br/&gt;discoveries, from special functions used to solve problems in physics and&lt;br/&gt;engineering, to advances in number theory and cryptography. The aim of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to study the special non-Euclidean geometry that has recently been&lt;br/&gt;discovered on the moduli spaces of cubic equations in three and four&lt;br/&gt;variables. The reason for carrying this study is not only the solution of&lt;br/&gt;the problems posed in the proposal, but also the expectation that this study&lt;br/&gt;of cubics in more variables will continue to be a point of departure for new&lt;br/&gt;ideas that will affect other areas of mathematics, science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
