    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Douglas Bartlett of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego to identify and characterize genes and proteins which enable some species of microorganisms to flourish in deep ocean environments where the pressure can be as great as one thousand times greater than that which exists on the surface of our planet and where the temperature is close to freezing. Most of the proposed work will be performed on a deep-sea bacterial species whose entire genome sequence will soon be completely known. In order to accomplish the research goals mutant cells unable to grow at high pressure will be isolated and the basis of their pressure sensitivity will be ascertained using state of the art bacterial genetic and molecular biology techniques. Proteins whose abundance is controlled by pressure will be identified using a semi-automated biochemical process. The properties of genetically engineered mutants that cannot make certain pressure-regulated proteins will be examined so that the role of these proteins in microbial growth at high pressure can be better understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bacteria possess a greater variety of genes than any other life forms and many of these genes have value in medicine and biotechnology. Microbes from the extreme environment of the deep ocean will undoubtedly possess novel genes of practical value. For example, it is already known that many deep-sea bacteria have genes for the production of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and these molecules are useful for human cardiovascular health and the prevention of certain diseases. Characterizing the genes and proteins which enable life in the abyss, which represents the largest part of Earth where life is found, provides the opportunity for learning fundamental details of how life can exist under dramatically different physical constraints. In addition, the work performed as a part of this grant may provide details on how life could exist outside of our planet where low temperatures and high pressures exist, such as within the aquatic environment of Jupiter's moon Europa.</AbstractNarration>
