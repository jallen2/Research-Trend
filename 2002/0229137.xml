    <AbstractNarration>The Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA) is a crosscutting activity of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project, a core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). Since 1990, GEIA has been providing quality assured emission inventories for global studies of past, present and future atmospheric chemistry, air quality and climate change. The GEIA Center is responsible for long-term coordination, outreach and planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, GEIA will expand information to be distributed through the GEIA web site. This will include quality assured references and links and commentaries related to: non-GEIA global data bases and key regional inventories, underlying data sets and algorithms used to derive emissions, historical and future trends of emissions, seasonality of emissions, innovative techniques for developing emissions data bases, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GEIA Center tasks will include: (1) Coordination (Manage development, review and distribution of new GEIA data and information, and develop and maintain close collaboration with modeling groups and other customers); (2) Outreach (Expand the GEIA network, distribute news, and organize annual workshops, and develop informational materials for various audiences), and (3) Planning (Assess critical needs and implementation issues and develop new strategies to address those). Thus, GEIA will continue to provide valuable information for use of a large scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
