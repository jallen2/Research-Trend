    <AbstractNarration>0212782&lt;br/&gt;Venable&lt;br/&gt;This LTREB proposal is to extend the continuous record of population and community dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of desert winter annual plants on permanent plots at a Sonoran Desert site at the Desert&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory near Tucson, AZ, USA. It will clarify and extend the understanding of demographic&lt;br/&gt;variation and covariation and its role in population and community processes. Data on&lt;br/&gt;germination, survival and reproduction of desert annual plants will be continuously monitored on&lt;br/&gt;long-term plots established from 10 to 19 years ago at locations both under shrub canopies and in&lt;br/&gt;the open at this field station. Delayed germination and between year seed carry over are thought&lt;br/&gt;to be important for the persistence of desert annuals, so the magnitude of the soil seed reserves&lt;br/&gt;will be monitored and determine what fraction germinate in each year for each species under&lt;br/&gt;shrubs and in the open. Seeds will be separated from standardized soil samples and tested for&lt;br/&gt;viability. The results of this research will be analyzed together with weather data to determine&lt;br/&gt;how climatic variation determines population variation for these annual plant species. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators will then construct population and community models of this desert annual system.&lt;br/&gt;These models will be used to explore the role of soil seed banks in buffering populations in the&lt;br/&gt;face of environmental variation. They will also be used to investigate how life history&lt;br/&gt;differences among species promote their coexistence and species diversity.&lt;br/&gt;Desert annual plants have played an important role as model organisms in the development of our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how organisms adapt to variable and unpredictable environments. They have&lt;br/&gt;also been used to exemplify ideas about non-equilibrium community dynamics in variable&lt;br/&gt;environments. Yet their dynamics are not well known empirically, especially the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;seeds. This project will provide the best available long-term data for evaluating these ideas.&lt;br/&gt;There has been considerable theoretical and experimental work carried out on the evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;ecology, population ecology and community ecology of this system. Such combinations of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and experimental work with long-term observations are proving to be a powerful&lt;br/&gt;approach to yield new insights and syntheses in plant ecology.&lt;br/&gt;This research will further the goal of combining research and education by virtue of occurring in&lt;br/&gt;the academic environment of a major research university. Graduate and undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;will be involved in capacities that fosters hands-on training and research experience that&lt;br/&gt;complements formal coursework. Ph.D., Masters, and undergraduate honors projects will be&lt;br/&gt;facilitated as part of or offshoots of this research. REU support will be sought for related&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate projects. In the first phase of this research more than half of the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate participants in this project were women and an attempt will be made to include a&lt;br/&gt;high percentage of women in the proposed research. The PI will endeavor to include&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented ethnic and cultural groups in this research by working with minority access&lt;br/&gt;programs on campus.</AbstractNarration>
