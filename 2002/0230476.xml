    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230476&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Joseph, Babu&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of South Florida&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Enhancing Engineering Education Using Information Technology Tools: An Integrated Approach to building a design oriented chemical engineering curriculum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan for this engineering curricula revision is to use IT to enhance the way&lt;br/&gt;we package and deliver engineering concepts in a practical and relevant way. This proposal addresses some of the major challenges faced by the academic engineering community in adapting to the shifting paradigms in presentation and assimilation of concepts and themes that are relevant to engineering practice today. The technology, hardware and software that help us make the necessary transition are now available. However, the major challenge lies in the development of the appropriate pedagogical structure and paradigms that motivate the student to think, to explore and to learn through interactive experiences. This is the central motivation behind the proposed work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, we want to utilize IT to alter the organization, integration and delivery of core&lt;br/&gt;courses in chemical engineering such as thermodynamics, mass and energy balances, fluid dynamics, heat transfer and process control. We want to improve retention while increasing the understanding and the capability of engineering students to tackle complex problems. Simultaneously, we propose curriculum revisions that will introduce engineering software early and often in the curriculum so that the students are at once comfortable with and able to utilize this evolving technology to the maximum extent in their education. The specific objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the focus is on development of chemical engineering curriculum, at the University of South Florida of the concepts can also be extended to other engineering disciplines with similar benefits.</AbstractNarration>
