    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0244550 and DMS-0244100&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Ralph L. Cohen, Jun Li, &lt;br/&gt;and Dennis P. Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the topology of&lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, their applications to string&lt;br/&gt;topology, and certain mathematical questions arising from string&lt;br/&gt;theory in physics. It is a collaborative project involving&lt;br/&gt;algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and Riemann surface&lt;br/&gt;theory. It will pursue significant new research opportunities&lt;br/&gt;arising from three recent important developments: The&lt;br/&gt;Madsen-Weiss proof of the famous conjecture of Mumford on the&lt;br/&gt;stable cohomology of moduli spaces, the discovery by Chas and&lt;br/&gt;Sullivan of the new structures on the topology of loop spaces of&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, and recent advances in open string theory in physics.&lt;br/&gt;One of the goals of this project is to understand the&lt;br/&gt;implications of Madsen and Weiss' theorem on the Chas-Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;"String topology" theory. Another aspect of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;study the relationship between string topology and Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory in algebraic geometry. A longer term goal of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to investigate how this theory can help to give a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;framework for analyzing certain specific questions motivated by&lt;br/&gt;open string theory in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric questions have long been motivated by the attempt to&lt;br/&gt;understand physical theories. Einstein's general theory of&lt;br/&gt;relativity, and the attempt to place it in firm mathematical&lt;br/&gt;foundations, motivated much of the development of differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry throughout the 20th century. During the last 20 years&lt;br/&gt;of the century generalizations of the famous Maxwell's equations&lt;br/&gt;for electricity and magnetism led to new techniques for studying&lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology in dimensions three and four. String&lt;br/&gt;theory is a relatively new quantum theory of gravity. Placing it&lt;br/&gt;in firm mathematical foundations is quite challenging, and has&lt;br/&gt;motivated quite a bit of new research in geometry. For example&lt;br/&gt;the techniques of string theory predicted the answers to some&lt;br/&gt;classical questions in enumerative geometry, many of which were&lt;br/&gt;later verified using a new theory in algebraic geometry due to&lt;br/&gt;the mathematician M. Gromov, and the physicist, E. Witten.&lt;br/&gt;String theory involves understanding how vibrating strings evolve&lt;br/&gt;through time. As a string evolves, it maps out a two dimensional&lt;br/&gt;"world sheet". So the mathematics behind string theory must&lt;br/&gt;study spaces of "strings", or curves and loops, as well as spaces&lt;br/&gt;of two dimensional surfaces in an ambient space. This project&lt;br/&gt;has been motivated by recent advances in understanding the&lt;br/&gt;topological structure of spaces of strings, ("string topology"),&lt;br/&gt;as well as a separate breakthrough in understanding the space of&lt;br/&gt;two dimensional surfaces. The goal of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;understand the implications of this breakthrough on "string&lt;br/&gt;topology", understand how this topological theory is related to&lt;br/&gt;the geometric theory of Gromov and Witten, and to apply these&lt;br/&gt;theories to certain specific questions arising from string theory&lt;br/&gt;in physics.
