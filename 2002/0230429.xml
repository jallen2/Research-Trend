    <AbstractNarration>EAR-0230429&lt;br/&gt;Sornette&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a class of triggered-seismicity models, we have recently &lt;br/&gt;(i) classified the different regimes of triggered seismicity, &lt;br/&gt;(ii) found that the numerous small and intermediate-sized earthquakes may have a significantly larger effect than large earthquakes on future seismicity, when taken together, &lt;br/&gt;(iii) showed how cascades of triggered seismicity may lead to aftershock diffusion and foreshock migration, &lt;br/&gt;(iv) discovered that the inverse Omori law may derive from the direct Omori law as the most probable trajectory of seismicity leading to a mainshock, and &lt;br/&gt;(v) explained a change of the Gutenberg-Richter law from a concave to a convex shape for foreshocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on these empirical results and on our theoretical understanding of models of triggered seismicity, we will: &lt;br/&gt;1) investigate several physical mechanisms underlying the local Omori's law to constrain the origins of its observed variability and to understand better the physics of triggered seismicity, &lt;br/&gt;2) analyze in novel ways the data available from different catalogs, both regional (such as SCEC) and worldwide (such as ISC) which careful attention brought to their completeness and their quality; &lt;br/&gt;3) perform careful and systematic explorations of reported seismic patterns and analyze them in the perspective offered by the parsimonious triggered-seismicity model; &lt;br/&gt;4) develop a new statistical method for inversion of the triggering seismicity model taking into account the incompleteness of the catalogs for small earthquakes; &lt;br/&gt;5) test the validity and limits of stress-transfer models that neglect cascades of triggered seismicity; and&lt;br/&gt;6) develop a forecasting methodology using the triggered seismicity model with its cascade of triggered events as a strong null-hypothesis to test against other hypotheses and to develop accurate seismic hazard assessment in southern California.</AbstractNarration>
