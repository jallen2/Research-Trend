    <AbstractNarration>This project is attempting to address the need for materials that help students master a large body of factual material in anatomy and physiology in a manner that emphasizes the development of problem-solving and other core scientific competencies. The project aims to develop a prototype set of materials covering the heart and cardiovascular system that incorporates hands-on experiences and student-centered problem-solving tasks. The project seeks to serve as a model for how to develop new curricula and low cost materials, and how to train instructor in their use. A laboratory guide, instructor's manual and CD showing how the model is used, are being written. The products will be evaluated both with respect to their efficacy in training instructors and their impact on student learning.</AbstractNarration>
