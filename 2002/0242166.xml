    <AbstractNarration>The research supported under this award is focused on the development of advanced, mobile radar systems to be used in meteorological research. Specific research efforts are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Implement and validate a dual-polarized spaced-antennae transverse velocity measurement technique with the X-band radar to measure scatterer velocity component perpendicular to the beam pointing direction. This technique, in combination with conventional Doppler measurements, will lead to the collection of two-dimensional velocity field data with a single, spaced-antennae Doppler radar system. The intellectual merit of this effort is significant, as two-dimensional velocity measurements have been difficult and only been accomplished with coarse resolution, vertical-pointing wind profilers, coordinated measurement with multiple radar systems or with a scanning radar which requires the assumption of a uniform wind field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop and test polarimetric calibration techniques and rain rate and hail mapping algorithms for the X-band radar. The intellectual merit of this research effort is the potential for quantitative precipitation mapping at a spatial resolution that is not possible with the more common S-band weather radar systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Field test and collect high temporal resolution (10-20 second update) volume (0-24 deg elevation, 360 deg azimuth, to 30 km range) reflectivity and Doppler velocity field data in storms with a mobile X-band phased array Doppler radar system, which is being partially developed under support from the Office of Naval Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this research, Dr. Pazmany will coordinate his activities with Dr. Bluestein of the University of Oklahoma (ATM-0241037). Dr. Bluestein is an atmospheric scientist and the primary objective of his research is to use observations and numerical models to study various aspects of severe storms and tornadoes. Dr. Pazmany and his advanced radars will contribute to the observational base to be used by Dr. Bluestein. Due to this joint research effort, it is anticipated that the broader impacts of the proposed activity will ultimately lead to a more accurate prediction of severe weather events.</AbstractNarration>
