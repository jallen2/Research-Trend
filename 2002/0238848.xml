    <AbstractNarration>0238848 Harrell Intellectual Merit. The main theme of the proposed work is investigation of innovative evolutionary algorithm (EA) techniques for constrained problems and reliability-based problems related to surface water systems management, and development of guidelines for EA techniques that show promise of general applicability to surface water systems analysis. Development of new techniques and guidelines for efficient, effective and widely applicable methodologies will enhance the state-of-the-art methodologies in evolutionary algorithms for applications to complex surface water resources and environmental systems management problems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The development of guidelines for widely applicable, efficient methodologies for surface water systems analysis problems will make broad contributions in the areas of evolutionary computing and water resources and environmental systems management. An interactive educational module will be developed for graduate students for exploring genetic algorithms, including constraint-handling techniques, for water resources systems analysis applications. This module will be distributed to other educators, creating a broader impact on researchers and teachers in the areas of systems analysis, genetic algorithms, and water resources management. The elementary educational modules developed will provide learning materials and interactive tools to introduce young students to exciting applications in water resources and environmental management. The published details of these modules will provide a broad impact on elementary education.</AbstractNarration>
