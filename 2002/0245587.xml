    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a robust and effective sensing technology to reconstruct acoustic radiation from a complex vibrating structure subjected to an arbitrarily time-dependent excitation. The ultimate goal of this investigation is to provide practicing engineers with a versatile and powerful tool to visualize vibro-acoustic sources of complex structures such as automobiles or airplanes. Special attention will be given to developing an optimal regularization method to enhance accuracy and efficiency of reconstruction of an acoustic field in a non-ideal environment. In particular, the effect of acoustic reflection from nearby surfaces and transient nature of acoustic radiation that have never been addressed in the traditional near-field acoustic holography (NAH), will be considered. The research undertaken will have a broad impact on providing a better understanding of acoustic radiation by enabling one to "see" sound as it propagates away from a source and interacts with surrounding fluid medium and structures. This visualization technology will also significantly enhance the effectiveness of classroom teaching of acoustics. The goal of education plan is to integrate the proposed research with undergraduate and graduate programs in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Wayne State University (WSU), which will have a significant impact on student learning of acoustics and noise control.</AbstractNarration>
