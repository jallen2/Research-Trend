    <AbstractNarration>This project is an inventory of the macroinvertebrates (insects, mollusks, crustaceans and other animals) of the Selenge River and its tributaries in north central Mongolia. Occupying over 300,000 sq. km., the Selenge River basin lies in an active geologic zone, and connects Lake Hovsgol, one of the world's most pristine ancient lakes, with Lake Baikal, the world's oldest and most biologically diverse lake. In freshwater aquatic habitats, macroinvertebrates, particularly insects, comprise a large portion of biological diversity. Studies of their taxonomy (identification) and distribution provide important results for understanding the evolution, biogeography, and ecology of aquatic communities. Increasing economic development and population in the Selenge basin are stressing the aquatic community through mining, untreated wastes, agriculture, over-grazing, fires, and climate change. The project proposed here will generate not only basic scientific knowledge of the biodiversity of the Selenge basin, but will also provide the Mongolian government a yardstick for monitoring water quality. This project encompasses a comprehensive, three-year sampling program. Three month-long expeditions will be undertaken to sample a range of aquatic macroinvertebrates, assess habitats and measure physical characteristics of the waterways. The principal investigators are established insect scientists with a broad range of field experience around the world, including the completion of a major inventory project at Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia. The expeditions will be collaborative with Mongolian scientists and students, and other scientists, with a focus on training of Mongolian students to develop in-country scientific expertise. &lt;br/&gt;Goals for this project include surveying the major groups of aquatic insects and other invertebrate groups, collaborative publication of the survey results, and development of associated databases for literature, specimen-based distribution records, locality and habitat classification, and specimen images. Databases will be assembled by Mongolian and American scientists and will be available over the Internet. Based on the previous work in the Lake Hovsgol watershed by these investigators, this proposed field survey should increase by 85% the currently known 700 aquatic macroinvertebrate species in the groups to be studied. Among these additional species, we expect to find 100 or more species new to science and to add nearly 600 first records for species within Mongolia and the central Asian plateau. Beyond a strictly scientific research importance, this survey and resulting research will provide many associated benefits. Knowledge of species and their abundance is applied as an important measure of the health of aquatic habitats and is used routinely throughout the world to monitor water quality. Broad sampling of aquatic invertebrates along with the collection of water quality and riparian zone measurements will directly benefit efforts to establish a baseline for future water quality monitoring programs. The scientific knowledge will be useful in guiding Mongolia's government in its attempts to protect the environment and to develop eco-tourism. The proposed survey will allow these U.S. scientists to develop meaningful collaborations with current Mongolian scientists and to train Mongolian students in the field and laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
