    <AbstractNarration>Sauer&lt;br/&gt;0208092&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies computational aspects of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems, emphasizing the role of chaotic dynamics in&lt;br/&gt;the interpretation of long-time simulation outcomes and data from&lt;br/&gt;complicated dynamical processes. The work on simulation is an&lt;br/&gt;ongoing study of subtle biases occurring in deterministic&lt;br/&gt;modeling that have macroscopic effects on outcomes. It is an&lt;br/&gt;open question whether it is possible in principle for long-term&lt;br/&gt;computer simulations of typical nonhyperbolic chaotic systems to&lt;br/&gt;approximately match true system behavior. The second major area&lt;br/&gt;is ongoing work on the interpretation of physical and biological&lt;br/&gt;experiments that generate aperiodic data. There is a long history&lt;br/&gt;of applying random modeling to time series and spike timing data&lt;br/&gt;collected from laaboratory and natural processes. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator syudies ways to use dynamical systems techniques,&lt;br/&gt;including embedding theory and spike train reconstruction, to&lt;br/&gt;extend the power of deterministic modeling for experimental data.&lt;br/&gt; Computer simulation is a critical ingredient of modern&lt;br/&gt;science. It is important to know whether solutions of a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model used for simulation can be expected to be&lt;br/&gt;accurate qualitative and quantitative representations of the&lt;br/&gt;natural phenomena being modeled, in the face of small modeling&lt;br/&gt;errors, and whether computer solution of the model can represent&lt;br/&gt;solutions of the model, in the face of small floating point&lt;br/&gt;errors. This reseach builds a foundation for answering questions&lt;br/&gt;like this for physically relevant models. In particular the&lt;br/&gt;investigator is involved in isolating and quantifying the&lt;br/&gt;limitations of deterministic representations, especially for the&lt;br/&gt;purpose of long-term modeling. The second major focus of the&lt;br/&gt;project is the interpretation of data collected from experimental&lt;br/&gt;systems and nature when no first-principles mathematical or&lt;br/&gt;computer model is available. If time traces of physically&lt;br/&gt;relevant quantities can be measured from the process, techniques&lt;br/&gt;exist to attempt to reconstruct the dynamical behavior of the&lt;br/&gt;process, with potential to predict or control the process.&lt;br/&gt;Complex deterministic time series are being identified in&lt;br/&gt;physical, chemical, engineering and biological/medical settings.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator has made previous progress on expanding these&lt;br/&gt;conceptual foundations and developing related computational&lt;br/&gt;implementations, and is working to increase their power for the&lt;br/&gt;study of complex systems in scientific and engineering-related&lt;br/&gt;contexts.</AbstractNarration>
