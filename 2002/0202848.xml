    <AbstractNarration>Hunter College is addressing the need for effective secondary teachers of science with the creation of three new five-year BA/MA teacher-training programs in biology, chemistry, and physics. The new BA/MA programs include six central courses designed to substantially integrate discipline and pedagogy content. The development of these courses draws on the considerable experience of the science and education faculty with integration and inquiry gained during the construction of the 23-credit, integrated chemistry/physics/mathematics course for entering freshmen. The six central courses of the BA/MA programs are being designed by collaborative teams of faculty from the School of Education, faculty from the science departments, and high school teachers. A central theme in the new programs is training the future teachers to think and act like scientists through the use of inquiry. The preservice students experience inquiry in their early science courses, continue to gain practice with inquiry in many of their teacher training courses, and are required to use inquiry in their student teaching experiences. Recruitment is a significant component of the program. Early opportunities for students to participate in teaching experiences are provided and mechanisms are established to alter the climate in the science departments, broadening the focus to include careers in education. Support for newly graduated teachers in their classroom environment include a mentoring program and an outreach to Assistant Principals to build a community that can function as local support for the use of inquiry in the classroom. Approximately fifty new teachers are expected to graduate from this program in the fourth year of the funding period. These science teachers will be fully prepared to use inquiry pedagogy in their class-rooms, and will be supported locally at their high school and by Hunter College faculty mentors so that they can successfully translate their learning into classroom practice.</AbstractNarration>
