    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed work is to develop a unified framework&lt;br/&gt;for synthesis and control of infinite-state reactive systems based on&lt;br/&gt;temporal specifications. With synthesis, the full program is&lt;br/&gt;generated directly from its specification. With control, part of the&lt;br/&gt;system is given and the task is to generate the modules interacting&lt;br/&gt;with the given components such that the overall system satisfies its&lt;br/&gt;specification. The framework will include a computational model to&lt;br/&gt;represent the notions of infinite games, control, realizability, and&lt;br/&gt;synthesis of reactive systems, a specification language that can&lt;br/&gt;assign goals (winning conditions) to sets of system components, and&lt;br/&gt;deductive-algorithmic methods to solve the synthesis and control&lt;br/&gt;problems in their various forms for the infinite-state case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting point for this framework will be a theoretical foundation&lt;br/&gt;built on the models and methods developed for algorithmic synthesis&lt;br/&gt;and control of finite-state reactive systems. These methods will be&lt;br/&gt;combined with methods developed for deductive verification and&lt;br/&gt;abstract interpretation of reactive systems, and with deductive&lt;br/&gt;synthesis techniques for functional programs to allow the synthesis&lt;br/&gt;and control of infinite-state systems. Preliminary investigations into&lt;br/&gt;this approach, described in this proposal and also accepted for&lt;br/&gt;publication, are promising.</AbstractNarration>
