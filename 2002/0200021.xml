    <AbstractNarration>This award funds a conference in Groups and Computation at the&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University, March 24-28, 2003. The conference focuses&lt;br/&gt;on the interplay between theory and practice in computing with&lt;br/&gt;groups, algorithms for computation being at the heart of the&lt;br/&gt;conference. The primary conference goal is to provide a forum&lt;br/&gt;for computational group theorists, both mathematicians and&lt;br/&gt;computer scientists, to meet with colleagues in order to learn&lt;br/&gt;of recent research developments in this area, to learn of and&lt;br/&gt;work on new open problems, to further existing large projects in&lt;br/&gt;this area, and to develop software for large computer systems&lt;br/&gt;that handle group computations. A second goal is to give graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and recent Ph.D's an opportunity to learn of new work and&lt;br/&gt;of open problems in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group theory is often described as the algebraic theory of&lt;br/&gt;symmetry in the abstract. Group theory arises and is used in a&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of other fields, including solid state physics,&lt;br/&gt;chemistry (crystallography), coding theory and cryptography. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the structure of groups is the major task of group&lt;br/&gt;theory. The subject of the conference is the interaction between&lt;br/&gt;this mathematical discipline and algorithmic questions used in&lt;br/&gt;extensive computer computations with these fundamental algebraic&lt;br/&gt;objects.</AbstractNarration>
