    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports the acquisition of an X-ray microanalysis system with extended range parallel beam WDS spectrometer to augment the current research activities of a diverse faculty within CUNY and centered at the College of Staten Island. The new system includes two integrated components. The first of these components is an X-ray microanalysis system that utilizes energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to collect, identify and map X-ray spectra from the samples. The electron beam from the SEM gun interacts with a sample, exciting elements in the sample. The sample then emits secondary electrons and X-rays. The energy of the X- rays emitted is element specific. Through the EDS system, it is possible to simultaneously collect secondary electrons (to obtain a three-dimensional image of a sample) and K a energies of &gt; 0.1 keV (also emitted following excitation by the primary electron bombardment) and to obtain an accurate map of the distribution of elements within a sample. These elements include those of atomic mass equal to or greater than Be. The second component to be acquired is a parallel beam wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) system. The WDS system allows for the detection of elements from &lt; 10 keV, that is, for light element detection. The equipment will be used in collaborative research efforts related to elemental distribution within polymers and biopolymers. Research topics include analysis of the alignment of metals in nanotubes, binding of metals to sediments, and distribution of metal bioaccumulated by aquatic and terrestrial organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation acquisition supports a number of educational activities both at the College of Staten Island and the City University of New York. This includes its use in an Advanced Microscopy course "Instrumental Methods in Chemistry" and undergraduate research activities through the Independent Studies and Honors Thesis programs. Additionally, the instruments will support research activities in the College of Staten Island's NSF-funded REU program on Polymers and Biopolymers, as well as the Center for Environmental Science. As the Departments of Biology and Chemistry have an established interdisciplinary approach to research and teaching, the instruments will also be used in graduate education and training in the NSF-supported IGERT program on Nanostructural Materials and Devices.</AbstractNarration>
