    <AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development ( CAREER) project integrates research and educational initiatives focusing on micro- and nano-scale processing of biodegradable polymers using laser techniques for biomedical and bioMEMS applications. Research focusing on laser micro- and nano-scale processing with parametric studies using both a UV excimer laser and a femtosecond laser to produce controlled micro-features on polymer surfaces will be addressed. Biodegradable polymers hold immense promise as new materials for implantable biomedical micro-devices due to their biocompatibility and ability to naturally degrade and disappear in tissues over a desired period of time. This degradability eliminates a second surgery to retrieve the implanted micro-devices. The CAREER project will: (1) develop an advanced laser technique with a near-field beam delivery system to produce controlled micro- and nano-scale patterns on biodegradable polymer surfaces; (2) develop an experimental system and a numerical model to investigate the transient laser-material interaction process on extremely small time and length scales; and (3) implement the research into the development of biodegradable micro- and nano-devices. This research will make significant contribution to the emerging and interdisciplinary field of micro- and nano-manufacturing science and technology, bioengineering, and polymer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated education plan will focus on curriculum development in micro- and nano-manufacturing at the undergraduate and graduate levels by infusing emerging and multi-disciplinary research into the classroom. This plan also encourages women students in research and adopts cooperative learning techniques in teaching. The PI also incorporates a learning plan for himself in new methods of educational pedagogy and curriculum development.</AbstractNarration>
