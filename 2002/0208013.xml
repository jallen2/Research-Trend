    <AbstractNarration>This project is a study of computational complexity theory, in particular&lt;br/&gt;a study of structural complexity theory and some compelxity problems&lt;br/&gt;relating to lattice problems. Computational complexity theory is&lt;br/&gt;the study of the inherent hardness of computational problems, both&lt;br/&gt;in the worst-case measure as well as in the average-case measure.&lt;br/&gt;This theory is the underpinning of all computer security based on the&lt;br/&gt;hardness or insolvability of computational problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will study the interrelationship between a number of&lt;br/&gt;complexity classes, especially those between determinisitic P and the&lt;br/&gt;second level of the polynomial time hierarchy, building on the recent&lt;br/&gt;breakthrough concerning the class S2, the symmetric second level class of&lt;br/&gt;the hierarchy. The investigator also explores a notion of persistent&lt;br/&gt;NP-hardness. This is to be an intermediate level of complexity&lt;br/&gt;measure between worst-case hardness and average-case complexity&lt;br/&gt;in the framework of Levin and others. In lattice problems, &lt;br/&gt;the investigator will search for moderately efficient algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for the shortest vector problem and the closest vector problem,&lt;br/&gt;both in the worst case measure as well as in the average case measure.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will study their connections to random lattices,&lt;br/&gt;and potential applications to the design of secure public-key&lt;br/&gt;cryptosystems based on assumptions of hadness in the worst case &lt;br/&gt;complexity only.</AbstractNarration>
