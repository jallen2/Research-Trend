    <AbstractNarration>0216381&lt;br/&gt;Wei&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The phenomenal growth of wireless systems in thc last 15 years represents a major paradigm change for society. Today, wireless, personal, and mobile communications are essential for our modern economy and the general well being of the country. Wireless technologies have not only brought in USA billions of dollars in technology export, but also significantly increased the productivity of the whole nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation the PIs are requesting in this proposal is a wireless communication systems emulator. In short, it can transmit and receive not only standard wireless signals and display them in detail, but it also allows them to deviate from these standards. It contains a universal wireless signal generator/transmitter, a universal wireless signal receiver, a high resolution network analyzer and a multi-input network analyzer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless communications has been a major research focus area in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS), UCF, over the past few years. A major mission of SEECS is to advance the future of wireless communications through education and research. The PIs involved in this effort have been conducting research in wireless communications for a number of years now. Some examples of the state-of-the art that they have been engaged are included below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(a) Invented new decoding algorithms that are not only best known for block lengths from 100-250 bits, but also specifically geared towards practical implementation and compatibility with existing wireless systems. With the proposed emulator, they will be able to test these algorithms for applications in the real world.&lt;br/&gt;(b) Introduced a new intelligent packet network architecture, called a cognitive packet network (CPN), in which the packets have intelligent capabilities for routing and flow control themselves. The PIs currently have a network test-bed, with fixed wire-line linkage, and their plan, with the help of the emulator, is to extend it to incorporate wireless linkages. With the proposed instrument, they can also increase the intelligence of the packets using the information gained from link-quality, channel state information, power levels. etc.&lt;br/&gt;(c) Teleoperated robots have wide application from search-rescue operation to factory operation. The robotics and controls lab has several robots, real-time control systems, and other equipments. The proposed instrument will enable the PIs to extend their capability to mobile robots with advanced wireless communication capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The faculty members on this team have published several hundreds of papers in leading technical journals and conferences. In fact, all PIs and senior personnel have served or are serving as Editors / Associate Editors for prestigious international journals in the areas of their expertise. This state-of-the-art instrumentation will help them verify their research results, extend their capabilities, and justify their future research directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment will also enhance their educational capabilities. The PIs currently offer a Wireless Communications option for their electrical engineering undergraduate students and have several graduate students working on projects in the field of wireless communications. This emulator will not only help demonstrate to the students the theory presented in the classroom, but also provide a hands-on platform for thesis and dissertation works.</AbstractNarration>
