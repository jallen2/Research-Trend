    <AbstractNarration>This project is designed to integrate important contributions to research &lt;br/&gt;with an educational experience for promising undergraduate students. The &lt;br/&gt;James Madison University Particle and Nuclear Physics Group, consisting of &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Giovanetti, Dr. Niculescu, and a group of undergraduate students, is &lt;br/&gt;conducting research in the area of Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics at &lt;br/&gt;Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, TJNAF, and at the Paul &lt;br/&gt;Scherrer Institute, PSI. The members of the group are actively involved in &lt;br/&gt;the ongoing research at TJNAF and are contributing by designing and testing &lt;br/&gt;equipment, participating in data taking and performing data analysis. This &lt;br/&gt;group is also a key collaborator in an experiment underway at PSI (Muon &lt;br/&gt;Lifetime Experiment).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore the rich structure of particles like the proton &lt;br/&gt;and the neutron, which are the basic building blocks of the atomic nucleus. &lt;br/&gt;It is widely held that protons and neutrons are built out of three quarks. &lt;br/&gt;These quarks are viewed as fundamental particles that have simple &lt;br/&gt;properties. Gluonic forces hold the quarks together. The basic nature of &lt;br/&gt;the forces are believed to be understood. However there is not yet a &lt;br/&gt;complete picture of the three-quark system. Studies that probe the nature &lt;br/&gt;of the proton, and the neutron will clarify the important ingredients, test &lt;br/&gt;the validity of models and approximations, and perhaps discover new &lt;br/&gt;features that require a closer look at the underlying theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improvements in technology and progress in theoretical physics have created &lt;br/&gt;the opportunity to improve our knowledge of the strength of another basic &lt;br/&gt;interaction, the weak force. By measuring the lifetime of the muon the &lt;br/&gt;Fermi coupling constant can be extracted. This constant determines the &lt;br/&gt;strength of the weak force in the same manner as electric charge determines &lt;br/&gt;the strength of the electromagnetic force. The goal is to improve this &lt;br/&gt;measured value to one part per million.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***************************************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;Giovanetti, Kevin L&lt;br/&gt;giovankl@jmu.edu</AbstractNarration>
