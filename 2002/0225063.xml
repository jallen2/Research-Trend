    <AbstractNarration>Two years of support are being requested if at all possible. The reason for this is &lt;br/&gt;because it is necessary to complete several key steps before submission as a regular &lt;br/&gt;proposal. The first summer is to prepare papers for presentation and/or appearance in &lt;br/&gt;conferences and/or journals. During the ensuing academic year, the intellectual content &lt;br/&gt;of this potentially controversial material will be circulated for comment, both publicly in &lt;br/&gt;talks and privately among colleagues. Based on the feedback received, the ideas put forth &lt;br/&gt;will be modified and corrected. Only then does it make sense to use the following &lt;br/&gt;summer to involve an undergraduate student in implementing the salient features of the &lt;br/&gt;proposed work for both a greater depth of understanding and demonstration purposes. &lt;br/&gt; By this point in time, that would mean there should be preliminary results &lt;br/&gt;appearing in print, with supporting documentation on the web explaining this material. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, more capable assistive computing technology will be available by then (to &lt;br/&gt;help me overcome my hand disability), so that I might be able to more actively &lt;br/&gt;participate in the implementation details of that work. When all of this is readily in place, &lt;br/&gt;then it will be possible to submit a competitive regular proposal.</AbstractNarration>
