    <AbstractNarration>This project concerns birational geometry of complex varieties &lt;br/&gt;and the study of rationally connected varieties. The main &lt;br/&gt;objective is to study spaces of rational curves on rationally &lt;br/&gt;connected varieties, with the goal of constructing new birational &lt;br/&gt;invariants of these varieties and determining the relationship &lt;br/&gt;between these varieties and unirational varieties. The secondary &lt;br/&gt;objective is to develop further some of the techniques and tools &lt;br/&gt;of algebraic geometry: to develop techniques for determining when &lt;br/&gt;moduli stacks are rationally connected, to construct and study &lt;br/&gt;new compactifications of the space of smooth rational curves in &lt;br/&gt;projective space, and to refine the Behrend-Manin stratification &lt;br/&gt;of the Kontsevich moduli stack so that it detects mutliple covers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems of polynomial equations in some collection of variables &lt;br/&gt;arise in every branch of mathematics, science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;Determining the solutions of these systems of equations is of &lt;br/&gt;paramount importance. "Unirational varieties" precisely correspond &lt;br/&gt;to those systems of equations where the set of solutions is most &lt;br/&gt;easily described -- the set of solutions is the set of all outputs &lt;br/&gt;of some sequence of polynomials with arbitrary inputs. So it is &lt;br/&gt;very important to recognize which systems of equations correspond &lt;br/&gt;to unirational varieties. From the point of view of geometry, a &lt;br/&gt;closely related notion is "rational connectedness". This notion &lt;br/&gt;is far simpler to recognize in practice. Potentially both notions&lt;br/&gt;are equivalent. If one could prove that both notions are&lt;br/&gt;equivalent, this would give a simpler way to recognize which &lt;br/&gt;systems of equations correspond to unirational varieties. The &lt;br/&gt;investigator intends to continue his research of this problem.</AbstractNarration>
