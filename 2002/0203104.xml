    <AbstractNarration>The research project is focused on application of the Lax Pair&lt;br/&gt;and the Riemann-Hilbert Method to the solution of scattering &lt;br/&gt;problems in inhomogeneous geomaterials. This approach is based on &lt;br/&gt;a new version of the Inverse Scattering Transform suggested recently by &lt;br/&gt;A. Fokas for studying boundary problems for linear and integrable&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear PDEs. Topics of investigation include: (i) analysis of&lt;br/&gt;the Riemann-Hilbert problem on the elliptic curve related to the &lt;br/&gt;vector Lax pair of the elastodynamic equation; (ii) explicit evaluation &lt;br/&gt;of scattering coefficients of Raylegh wave in a quarter-space and &lt;br/&gt;a corner; (iii) the Riemann-Hilbert approach to scattering of elastic&lt;br/&gt;surface wave at a vertical interface of two homogeneous quarter-spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analysis of seismic waves is the major source of information&lt;br/&gt;about the Earth internal structure and its sesmicity. The elastodynamic &lt;br/&gt;equation serves as a basic mathematical model for studing diffraction and &lt;br/&gt;scattering of seismic waves on deep fault zone areas and other inhomogeneities&lt;br/&gt;in the Earth Crust and Upper Mantle. The research program indicated above&lt;br/&gt;would allow to make a considerable progress in solving some of the longstanding &lt;br/&gt;problems related to realistic geometry of seismic zones. Moreover, the&lt;br/&gt;important nature of the method developed in the project is that it can be also applied&lt;br/&gt;to various nonlinear versions of the elastodynamic equation. During the&lt;br/&gt;last decades it has been discovered that nonlinearity of the Earth materials&lt;br/&gt;may be responsible for some peculiar characteristics of the wavefield, hence&lt;br/&gt;the research project would provide an analytic tool for studing&lt;br/&gt;these completely new kind of seismic phenemena as well.</AbstractNarration>
