    <AbstractNarration>Muratov&lt;br/&gt;0211864 &lt;br/&gt;Shvartsman &lt;br/&gt;0211755&lt;br/&gt; In this collaborative project the investigators combine&lt;br/&gt;mechanistic modeling, computational analysis, and experimental&lt;br/&gt;techniques of developmental genetics to analyze cell&lt;br/&gt;communication networks in the development of the Drosophila egg&lt;br/&gt;(oogenesis). They focus on the patterning events mediated by the&lt;br/&gt;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), during which a localized&lt;br/&gt;source of the EGFR ligand is modulated in space and time by a&lt;br/&gt;distributed network of autocrine loops to produce a biochemical&lt;br/&gt;blueprint specifying the formation of a pair organ. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators develop mechanistic models of EGFR signaling in&lt;br/&gt;Drosophila oogenesis. These models are necessary to directly test&lt;br/&gt;consistency of the proposed regulatory mechanisms, to make the&lt;br/&gt;experimentally verifiable predictions, and to guide the design of&lt;br/&gt;future experiments. The models should explicitly account for the&lt;br/&gt;key components of the EGFR system: the receptor, four of its&lt;br/&gt;ligands, ligand processing proteins, and intracellular signaling&lt;br/&gt;cascades. The nonlinear reaction-transport models of spatially&lt;br/&gt;distributed EGFR signaling networks are analyzed using a&lt;br/&gt;combination of numerical simulations, asymptotic techniques, and&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation analysis. The tests of model-based predictions rely&lt;br/&gt;on experimental advantages of Drosophila genetics.&lt;br/&gt; Signaling through the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor EGFR&lt;br/&gt;is essential in a number of developmental processes across&lt;br/&gt;species, from fruitflies to humans, and is extensively studied at&lt;br/&gt;the molecular level. The main goal of the project is to develop&lt;br/&gt;modeling and computational tools necessary to describe&lt;br/&gt;reaction-transport processes in developing epithelial layers. In&lt;br/&gt;the context of Drosophila, the investigators aim to capture a&lt;br/&gt;large number of phenotypic transitions in eggshell morphology&lt;br/&gt;that have been observed following quantitative manipulations in&lt;br/&gt;the doses of the regulatory genes. This leads to a class of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems that are also relevant in other biological&lt;br/&gt;and physico-chemical settings. Given the highly conserved nature&lt;br/&gt;of EGFR systems, it is possible that the proposed analysis of&lt;br/&gt;patterning events in Drosophila oogenesis may be used to&lt;br/&gt;understand the role of EGFR in the formation of branched&lt;br/&gt;epithelial structures in the development of higher organisms. The&lt;br/&gt;project has a significant educational component: it brings&lt;br/&gt;together and trains students and postdocs in biology, engineering&lt;br/&gt;and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
