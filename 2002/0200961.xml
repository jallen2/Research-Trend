    <AbstractNarration>PI: Peter Bates, Brigham Young University&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Keining Lu, Brigham Young University&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200961&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop the geometrical theory of invariant manifolds and &lt;br/&gt;foliations for semiflows in Banach space with emphasis on how this can be &lt;br/&gt;applied to important areas of science. Of particular interest are how one &lt;br/&gt;may establish the existence of these structures knowing that good &lt;br/&gt;approximations exist in some sense. Applications which will be addressed &lt;br/&gt;include analysis of lattice dynamical systems, the existence of modulated &lt;br/&gt;waves in fluid models, the form and dynamics of vortices in superconducting &lt;br/&gt;materials, the form and dynamics of material phase boundaries, including &lt;br/&gt;those with random perturbations in the driving forces, and the development &lt;br/&gt;of good computational algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since most physical systems are highly complex, it is usually impossible to &lt;br/&gt;solve the equations which are proposed to describe and predict the relevant &lt;br/&gt;physical phenomena. Even if it were possible to solve one of these &lt;br/&gt;equations, the imprecision in measurement and our imperfect understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the actual physical laws may call into question the meaning of the &lt;br/&gt;solutions. This project will develop a theory whereby, under certain &lt;br/&gt;conditions, one can describe the nature of solutions and guarantee that the &lt;br/&gt;physical system behaves according to this description to a reasonable &lt;br/&gt;degree of accuracy. Special attention will be given to equations describing &lt;br/&gt;phenomena in material science, including phase transitions and &lt;br/&gt;superconductivity.</AbstractNarration>
