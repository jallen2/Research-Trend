    <AbstractNarration>Several recent meetings have highlighted the growing interest in the&lt;br/&gt;biological, ecological, environmental, and other research communities&lt;br/&gt;in the development and deployment of large distributed systems for&lt;br/&gt;information collection, aggregation, analysis, simulation, predictive&lt;br/&gt;modeling and realtime analysis within their respective disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;Likewise, recent events have caused concern and raised interest in the&lt;br/&gt;need for similar systems in the context of homeland security. It seems&lt;br/&gt;apparent that a structured discussion of the needs for these systems&lt;br/&gt;could create opportunities for synergistic efficiencies between the&lt;br/&gt;various user communities. To date, however, no such discussions have&lt;br/&gt;been held among these differing user communities, nor among these&lt;br/&gt;communities and the groups providing and developing technologies to&lt;br/&gt;support their needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is with the possibility of identifying such potential synergies&lt;br/&gt;that the Multi-Sector Crisis Management Consortium (MSCMC) is&lt;br/&gt;organizing a series of workshops to discuss the design, development&lt;br/&gt;and deployment of such systems "From Sensor to Supercomputer and Back:&lt;br/&gt;Systems for Information Collection, Aggregation, Analysis, Assessment&lt;br/&gt;and Realtime Simulation." To begin exploring these synergies, MSCMC is&lt;br/&gt;proposing the following workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop is to summarize the current and projected&lt;br/&gt;states of sensor, communication and power technologies for collection&lt;br/&gt;and communication of information from distributed sensor systems with&lt;br/&gt;large numbers of nodes, and to survey the present and expected needs&lt;br/&gt;for such systems in environmental, facility, medical, crisis&lt;br/&gt;management, public safety and national security arenas. A succinct&lt;br/&gt;summary of the current and projected technologies mapped to current&lt;br/&gt;and projected user requirements is envisioned to result from this&lt;br/&gt;workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together experts in field sensor, processing,&lt;br/&gt;wireless, field power source technologies, to structure solutions for&lt;br/&gt;the common problem of collecting and communicating data, including&lt;br/&gt;from remote field locations, by cost-effective, scalable, integrated&lt;br/&gt;devices and networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will examine the user needs and technologies involved in&lt;br/&gt;field deployable systems for information gathering including&lt;br/&gt;sensors, wireless communications and power supplies, up to the local&lt;br/&gt;aggregation point. While the integration of "locally" gathered&lt;br/&gt;information into larger infrastructures for purposes of analysis is&lt;br/&gt;also required, such integration is beyond the specific focus of this&lt;br/&gt;workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is intended that this two day workshop will produce:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (1) understanding by participants of the current state of the art&lt;br/&gt; and availability of technologies of sensors, power, integrated&lt;br/&gt; circuits, and wireless, and how they may be employed in our&lt;br/&gt; society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (2) determination of current and future needs for better&lt;br/&gt; capabilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (3) suggested courses of action to integrate available&lt;br/&gt; technologies into scalable, reliable, cost-effective devices and&lt;br/&gt; networks of value to meet those needs, including for both the&lt;br/&gt; general scientific and research community and to government&lt;br/&gt; agencies seeking better ways to protect the public from chemical&lt;br/&gt; and biological incidents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (4) proposed design and production of devices not now available&lt;br/&gt; or suitable for the above purposes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (5) recommendations for regulatory relief, especially for design,&lt;br/&gt; manufacture, and use of workshop-proposed wireless technologies&lt;br/&gt; for the above purposes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (6) recommendation for further work in these ares, and&lt;br/&gt; identification of potential collaborations and partners.</AbstractNarration>
