    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Adams will develop an independent technique to determine dissociative electron-ion recombination rates and product distributions. The method is designed to circumvent difficulties that have caused contradictory results from previous studies with flowing-afterglow and storage ring experiments. After initial tests on well understood systems, the technique will be applied to those for which controversial results have been reported in the literature. New systems where dissociative recombination plays a major role will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molecules of interstellar and cometary gases, and of the earth's upper as well as lower atmosphere, continually undergo dissociative ionization followed by recombination. The rates of recombination as well distributions of the dissociation products are experimentally determined and provide the basis for theoretical modeling. Conventional methods for determining these parameters have often given disparate results. This project is designed to develop a new method to generate reliable data for testing of existing theories and the development of new ones. The work will be performed with the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral research associates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Adams will develop an independent technique to determine dissociative electron-ion recombination rates and product distributions.
