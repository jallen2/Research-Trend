    <AbstractNarration>The META Program is a targeted scholarship program for students in mathematics, computer science, computer technology, engineering, or engineering technology. The META's Structured freshman year experience includes comprehensive academic and career counseling, student development courses, tutoring, study groups, supplemental instruction, and learning communities. With an emphasis on academic success, the bulk of META activities are designed to help the students handle course material better, including faculty instruction in alternative learning strategies and computer-based instruction. Extensive contact is being provided to META scholars who meet regularly with faculty, counselors, with one another, and with peer mentors. There is a dedicated staff and directors with strong institutional attachments as the five principal investigators have a combined 62 years of experience at the college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project objectives are to recruit and select 60 to 80 majors and provide needed support to all scholarship recipients. Project outcome objectives include: &lt;br/&gt;(a) at least 90% of students receiving META scholarship for more than a year have a grade point average of 2.75 or higher;&lt;br/&gt;(b) at least 75% of META scholarship recipients receive associate degrees or certificates or transfer into a four-year program; and&lt;br/&gt;(c) at least 75% of META scholars completing the degree or certificate and not continuing their education find employment in their field of study.</AbstractNarration>
