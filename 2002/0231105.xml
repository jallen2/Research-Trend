    <AbstractNarration>Research in the life sciences is becoming more and more interdisciplinary, relying on knowledge from physics, chemistry, and mathematics. However, as undergraduates, most future scientists study these disciplines in a series of unrelated courses that do not help them learn how to apply the tools and key concepts from one discipline to another. This proof-of-concept project is creating and testing learning materials, specifically a set of life science cases, that require students to use information from their math and chemistry courses to address tough biological problems. This teaching/learning approach aims to foster the development of critical thinking, teamwork and communication skills. The cases are being implemented and assessed in the context of Biology Interest Groups (BIGs), a UW-Madison program in which first year&lt;br/&gt;students co-enroll in calculus, chemistry, and a special topics biology seminar. A faculty team with representatives from biology, chemistry and mathematics is developing cases on Infectious Disease, Ecology, Food Production and Exercise Physiology. Topics emphasize real world problems and are drawn from the research disciplines of the case developers. Overall project evaluation is assessing student attitudes and learning, and determine the success of the team process for development. Project outcomes will be shared with science/math faculty at the UW-Madison and other UW-System campuses statewide.</AbstractNarration>
