    <AbstractNarration>0211048&lt;br/&gt;Bar-Yam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a new and growing effort to understand complex systems and &lt;br/&gt;complexity that has stimulated widespread interest in the scientific &lt;br/&gt;community. This grant will enable the participation of students, &lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellows and and other junior scientists in the &lt;br/&gt;International Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS). Sessions will &lt;br/&gt;focus on unified conceptual and mathematical strategies and their&lt;br/&gt;applications to physical, biological and social systems. The &lt;br/&gt;conference includes pedagogical sessions for students and topics of &lt;br/&gt;interest and concern to the public that will serve as vehicles of &lt;br/&gt;education and communication for a broader audience. A special &lt;br/&gt;topical day will address recent advances in the study of evolution&lt;br/&gt;and several sessions will focus on biocomplexity, ecology and&lt;br/&gt;multiscale patterns coupling biological, physical and social systems.&lt;br/&gt;Various conferences and workshops have addressed aspects of these &lt;br/&gt;growing efforts to understand complex systems. However, the ICCS &lt;br/&gt;is the only major international conference series to bring the wide &lt;br/&gt;diversity of research together, demonstrating the interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;yet integrative and coherent nature of these efforts. This conference &lt;br/&gt;series is organized by the New England Complex Systems Institute &lt;br/&gt;(NECSI).</AbstractNarration>
