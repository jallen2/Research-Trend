    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the engineering of biopolymeric materials for application in materials science and biology. Nature regularly uses precise control of macromolecular structure to impart function; the exquisite information storage, hierarchical assembly, and catalytic properties of natural molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins have long been admired by the polymer chemist. Despite the many advances in the chemical synthesis of polymers, no synthetic method offers the sequence and structural control afforded by protein polymer production by in vivo methods. Additionally, important advances in protein engineering have made possible the multisite incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins in vivo, which markedly expands the chemical versatility of genetically directed methods. This research program capitalizes on the structural and sequence control of biosynthesis, combined with the novel chemical function of non-natural amino acids, to create new polymeric materials with exceptional architectural control. Specific targets include the controlled presentation of groups such as saccharides, peptides, or electroactive moieties for applications in sensors, biomaterials, and nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highly interdisciplinary nature of this research program will provide diverse opportunities for training in the research environment, and research concepts in this program will also be integrated into the materials science and engineering curriculum in courses such as polymer synthesis and advanced biomaterials. Integration into undergraduate programs will include the implementation of biotechnology research and special topics discussion groups. In addition to these educational contributions at the university level, a novel outreach program, The Science of Art, will be implemented at a regional high school. The combination of these scientific and instructional programs will be the basis of innovative contributions to materials research and education.</AbstractNarration>
