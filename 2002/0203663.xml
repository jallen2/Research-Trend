    <AbstractNarration>This project is continuing a professional development model that is increasing the successful participation of community colleges and community college faculty in NSF programs. The Council for Resourcement Development (CRD) is building upon its existing regional conferences to offer a series of workshops designed to: familiarize faculty with NSF programs in general, showcase regional NSF funded projects and the faculty conducting those projects, and offer a workshop on proposal development strategies specific to NSF. The objectives and activities are to: 1) Provide coordination for workshop development and implementation at the regional level, 2) Recruit faculty to attend the workshops who have not yet received grant awards fromNSF, and 3) Evaluate the workshops with particular emphasis on the longitudinal outcomes. Follow-up activities with faculty are designed to increase grant submissions to the National Science Foundation. An increased emphasis is placed on attracting and assisting colleges in regions that have been underrepresented in the submission of grant applications to NSF. Longitudinal evaluation on grant submissions and awards are also being implemented.</AbstractNarration>
