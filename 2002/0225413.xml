    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research is to implement a&lt;br/&gt;conversational intelligent environment&lt;br/&gt;containing a distributed array of active cameras and other sensors,&lt;br/&gt;and communicating with users via natural dialogue, augmented where useful&lt;br/&gt;with imagery and pointing devices.&lt;br/&gt;This artificial spatial intelligence, termed a&lt;br/&gt;Voluble Intelligent Environment or VIE, will actively obtain information about,&lt;br/&gt;and provide assistance within a real physical domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project requires grounding natural language understanding in&lt;br/&gt;machine perception.&lt;br/&gt;A major difficulty is that outputs supplied by&lt;br/&gt;current perceptual algorithms are too low-level&lt;br/&gt;to serve as primitives for traditional understanding and reasoning systems.&lt;br/&gt;To address this, the PIs will integrate the results of machine vision&lt;br/&gt;and other perceptual functions into mid-level representations termed&lt;br/&gt;"perscripts", which represent items of perceptual information of the sort that&lt;br/&gt;would typically be described by a phrase or simple sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also requires advances in&lt;br/&gt;distributed systems technology to permit the&lt;br/&gt;various perceptual, computational, and communication components to&lt;br/&gt;be efficiently and flexibly configured.&lt;br/&gt;The integration framework will be based on&lt;br/&gt;a prototype distributed resource interface, InterWeave,&lt;br/&gt;developed at the University of Rochester.&lt;br/&gt;Interweave provides an efficient implementation&lt;br/&gt;of a network-wide global name/address space that directly supports&lt;br/&gt;the proposed approach to grounding language in perception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will be validated in&lt;br/&gt;a ``Household Assistant'' application that provides occupants of a&lt;br/&gt;``smart house'' with information useful in activities of&lt;br/&gt;daily living (such as ``where did I leave my glasses?'' or&lt;br/&gt;``did I take my meds?'').&lt;br/&gt;This application is being developed in conjunction with the University&lt;br/&gt;of Rochester Center for Future Health.&lt;br/&gt;It addresses needs of&lt;br/&gt;the elderly and the disabled, and has the potential to have a significant&lt;br/&gt;economic impact as part of an overall system that unloads caregivers for&lt;br/&gt;this population.</AbstractNarration>
