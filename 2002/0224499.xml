    <AbstractNarration>In June of 2002, a workshop will be held on Fundamentals of Distributed&lt;br/&gt;Computing at Bertinoro, Italy. From a set of 43 outstanding&lt;br/&gt;submissions, a total of 30 white papers were selected for publication,&lt;br/&gt;and 46 researchers (including a number of students) invited to attend&lt;br/&gt;the workshop. NSF provides travel funding to support attendance&lt;br/&gt;by these students, many of whom are on very tight budgets. The workshop&lt;br/&gt;will help set the agenda for a new generation of research in distributed&lt;br/&gt;computing while also knitting together the European and American&lt;br/&gt;research communities in the area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quality of the white papers was very high, and we have approached&lt;br/&gt;Springer-Verlag about the possibility of revising and extending them&lt;br/&gt;into a book-length treatment. Our hope is that we might use the&lt;br/&gt;workshop to develop a unified vision and to elucidate the research&lt;br/&gt;agenda in various areas of the discipline, then use this as a structure&lt;br/&gt;for the white papers. The resulting book will be both a snapshot of the&lt;br/&gt;state of the art and also a coherent articulation of research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities in the coming decade.</AbstractNarration>
