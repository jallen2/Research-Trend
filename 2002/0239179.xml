    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0239179&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Li Shi&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation: University of Texas&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: CAREER: Thermal transport and thermoelectric measurements of nanotransistors, nanowires,and superlattices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This career-development program proposes to investigate thermal transport of nanotransistors that are influenced by ballistic charge transport, and to characterize thermoelectric properties of nanowires and superlattices with potentially superior thermoelectric figure of merit. Techniques for nanoscale quantitative mapping of temperature and electric fields will be developed for studying heat dissipation and local hot spots in sub-100 nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and SiGe metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), and in single wall carbon nanotube (SWCN) devices. A suspended micro- device will be used to characterize thermoelectric properties of nanowires and to investigate quantum thermal transport in SWCNs. The PI will further develop a technique for nanoscale mapping of Seebeck coefficient across individual quantum well and barrier layers of Si/Ge and GaAs/AlAs superlattice coolers. &lt;br/&gt;The PI will adopt effective models for micro-nano scale engineering instruction. He will integrate micro-nano scale thermo-fluids teaching with existing undergraduate courses via a curriculum reform effort focused on Project-Centered Education at his home department. Further, the PI will develop a new graduate course on micro-nano scale thermal/fluid science and technology, and an introductory laboratory section for use in regular summer workshops organized by the PI's institution for K-12 teachers, women and minority students.&lt;br/&gt;The award is supported by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.</AbstractNarration>
