    <AbstractNarration>EAR-0226362&lt;br/&gt;Waychunas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscience and nanotechnology have emerged as major national goals as evidenced by the requested FY 2002 federal budget. The Earth science community has clearly identified nanoscience in the environment as an emerging field (National Academy of Sciences BROES report, Jordan et al. 2001). Earth science researchers have recognized the potential importance of studies of nanophase materials and have begun to develop specific research targets. Accordingly, this award will co-fund (with the National Research Council) an invitational workshop of approximately 50 people to assess the opportunities and challenges in the field, as well as the pertinent connections between nanogeoscience and more traditional chemical or materials-based nanoscience, and write a report of no more than 15 pages in the course of a 2.5 day meeting in June 2002 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
