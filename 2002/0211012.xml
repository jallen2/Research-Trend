    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the third DLESE Annual Meeting. This meeting will be held at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York from June 29 to July 2, 2002. The annual meeting will be preceded by a two-day preparation and planning meeting. This Annual Meeting will provide DLESE the opportunity to both demonstrate advances in the library's development and develop and strengthen ties between current and new collaborators in collections building, tool development, resource discovery, metadata and controlled vocabulary development efforts. The meeting will establish a platform where both the developers and library users will have opportunities to discuss a variety of issues. The developers will be able to demonstrate their new library functions, the users will be able to provide important feed back to the developers, and both developers and users will learn from their peers about potential uses, and make suggestions for critical improvements needed to make the library a stronger and more attractive learning/teaching environment for students/teachers from all levels of educational activities. The meeting will incorporate efforts to address issues such as diversity/underrepresented populations, academic recognition, pedagogical assessment and evaluation, sociological effects of electronic community collaboration and the development of mechanisms to provide guidance and support in designing new instructional materials that support teaching/learning about the Earth system. The Annual Meeting provides an opportunity for leaders representing these diverse interests in Earth system education to meet as a community and to work together to shape DLESE as a resource that serves our needs. The conveners will invite 115 people to the meeting. The invited people will represent a broader community including teachers from K-12 schools, college and university professors, and researchers in both earth and information technology sciences. The maximum number of participants will be limited to 200 for both logistical and practical concerns.</AbstractNarration>
