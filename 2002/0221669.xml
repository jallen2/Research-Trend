    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0138458&lt;br/&gt;Peter Schroder&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0221642&lt;br/&gt;Ronald A. Devore&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0221669&lt;br/&gt;Mathieu Desbrun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative project funded by the CARGO program under&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0138458, DMS-0221642, and DMS-0221669. This is the Age of Information. Whether it be in scientific computation or reverse engineering, in remote sensing or medicine, data sets of &lt;br/&gt;incredible resolution and exquisite detail are created&lt;br/&gt;daily. These data sets often have geometric structure which &lt;br/&gt;contains important information about the data and its &lt;br/&gt;application. The usefulness of such geometric datasets &lt;br/&gt;rests on our ability to process them efficiently, whether &lt;br/&gt;it be for storage, transmission, visual display, correlation, &lt;br/&gt;or registration against data from other modalities. &lt;br/&gt;Compression is the common critical issue in all&lt;br/&gt;these applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current data processing technology does not provide the &lt;br/&gt;efficient and geometrically faithful representations demanded &lt;br/&gt;by applications. In fact, a satisfactory data processing &lt;br/&gt;platform will not be created by incremental advances of current technology but rather through a fundamental investigation of &lt;br/&gt;how to represent large data sets with inherent geometry. To &lt;br/&gt;pursue the necessary advances a team of researchers and &lt;br/&gt;application developers representing expertise from&lt;br/&gt;several disciplines including mathematics, computer science, &lt;br/&gt;and engineering has been assembled. As drivers of the research, specially targeted applications (DTED, reverse engineering, &lt;br/&gt;physical simulation) have been selected to guide the formulation &lt;br/&gt;of the most critical and meaningful problems, as well as testing approaches to solving them. The team is carrying out &lt;br/&gt;fundamental investigations on the representation and compression &lt;br/&gt;of data sets with geometry by building new mathematical theory&lt;br/&gt;including deterministic models, appropriate application &lt;br/&gt;specific error metrics (e.g., Haussdorf distance rather&lt;br/&gt;than Lp norms), an information theory based on Kolmogorov &lt;br/&gt;entropy to determine the optimal compression, and the &lt;br/&gt;development of nonlinear methods for representing the data &lt;br/&gt;sets which are near optimal in the entropy sense.</AbstractNarration>
