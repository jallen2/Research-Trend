    <AbstractNarration>This research will develop new lift-and-project methods for 0-1 mixed-integer programming. These methods will encompass two classes of techniques. The research team will consider lifting an n-dimensional point to a zeta-vector of the subset algebra of the n-dimensional hypercube, thereby extending the Lovasz-Schrijver, Sherali-Adams, Lasserre methods, as well as the disjunctive programming ('lift and project') method of Balas, Ceria and Cornuejols. Such a lifting appears promising in that it produces higher-dimensional objects "faster" than the previously mentioned methods. The second class of techniques will consider successively refining a disjunction to generate deeper cutting planes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integer programming embodies the systematic solution of planning problems arising in numerous practical settings, e.g. transportation, logistics, supply chain, finance, power generation and others. Such problems are inherently non-continuous: they involve the allocation of discrete units of resources. As such, they are extremely intractable. At the same time, accurate solutions translate into substantial savings, and thus there is a need for effective solution methodologies. The impact of this research will be to broaden the class of problems that can be successfully tackled, using innovative techniques.</AbstractNarration>
