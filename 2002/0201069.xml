    <AbstractNarration>This award supports theoretical research and education in the area of strongly correlated electron systems. Research will focus on fundamental issues in two areas: high temperature superconductivity and quantum magnetism. The work in the former area has a more phenomenological bent includes the study of the why a magnetic moment appears with the addition of a nonmagnetic impurity and various issues related to transport properties in d-wave superconductors. Of particular interest is the physical origin of the experimentally observed scaling relation for the thermal hall conductivity and the appearance of a finite Nernst effect above the superconducting transition temperature. The study of quantum magnetism will emphasize understanding the role of quantum fluctuations. Of particular interest is the study of the Capriotti state and the conditions under which a spin liquid ground state might exist.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research in condensed matter physics with a focus on the physics of electrons in high temperature superconductors and other materials with strong electronic correlations. The research involves the creation of fundamental new knowledge and concepts in condensed matter theory that contribute to the formation of the pillars that support future technologies. More specifically, research will use the study of aspects of thermal and electronic transport properties in high temperature superconductivity to illuminate the fundamental nature of the strongly correlated state and that of the d-wave superconducting state that arises below the superconducting transition. Theoretical work is needed both to interpret experimental discoveries and to guide the search for new materials and new phenomena. This award also supports advanced training at the frontiers of condensed matter theory.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
