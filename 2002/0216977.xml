    <AbstractNarration>Modern, componentized Internet services allow server consolidation &lt;br/&gt;by sharing common service components. &lt;br/&gt;Such sharing can potentially reduce the installation cost, &lt;br/&gt;space, and energy consumption. However, to date, services &lt;br/&gt;are seldom shared across server applications to avoid&lt;br/&gt;possible interference between them. Service providers often run&lt;br/&gt;multiple instances of shared services, one for each frontend&lt;br/&gt;service. The only benefit gained thus far, from the deployment of&lt;br/&gt;multi-tier services is that new services can be composed quickly using&lt;br/&gt;existing service components. Since these service&lt;br/&gt;components may execute on different machines, each optimally configured&lt;br/&gt;for its services, multi-tiered services tend to be more&lt;br/&gt;scalable than monolithic counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to address the shortcoming of current&lt;br/&gt;OSs in executing multi-tiered services. We will focus on OS extensions &lt;br/&gt;that correlate and trace service activities across the tiers of a &lt;br/&gt;multi-tiered server farm. We will develop mechanisms for online&lt;br/&gt;classification of activities (e.g., premium vs.~basic service classes), &lt;br/&gt;as well as mechanisms that allow system administrators to insulate &lt;br/&gt;(performance-wise) different service classes even when the &lt;br/&gt;activities of different service classes may overlap and &lt;br/&gt;share backend services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same OS mechanisms that are used to manage multi-tiered &lt;br/&gt;services can be used to analyze the interactions between different &lt;br/&gt;tiers and the interferences between different service classes. &lt;br/&gt;We will show that a combination of service interaction analysis &lt;br/&gt;and service policing minimizes performance invasiveness &lt;br/&gt;between services/applications. &lt;br/&gt;We will also investigate how to improve insulation between &lt;br/&gt;services in this environment. &lt;br/&gt;We will explore how service implementations may take &lt;br/&gt;advantage of an improved OS infrastructure for multi-tiered</AbstractNarration>
