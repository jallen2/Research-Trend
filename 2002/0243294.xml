    <AbstractNarration>The awardee will continue operating a network of five Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers near the west coast of South America. The data are used to study the dynamics of the equatorial ionosphere, and to develop techniques to forecast the onset of ionospheric scintillations. The equatorial ionosphere is the location on Earth where the most scintillations occur. The occurrence of scintillations is mainly associated with the uprising of low-density plasma bubbles in the F region of the ionosphere. This phenomenon is called equatorial spread F. Thus far, it has not been possible to forecast the day-to-day variability of equatorial spread F. This project includes the routine observation of total electron content in the ionosphere, the study of the influence of neutral winds on irregularity formation, the design of a methodology for forecasting spread F, and in inversion of total electron content measurements to ionization profiles. The data will be disseminated via the World Wide Web to other scientists for use in ongoing research efforts. The GPS receivers will be upgraded and software implemented to provide near real-time maps of total electron content and scintillations. A sixth receiver will be deployed near the northern boundary of Columbia. This study will lead to improved forecasting capabilities that will help protect navigation and communication systems from the adverse effects of scintillation.</AbstractNarration>
