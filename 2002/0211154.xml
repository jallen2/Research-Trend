    <AbstractNarration>Haider&lt;br/&gt;0211154&lt;br/&gt; The investigator is developing multiphasic models for&lt;br/&gt;mechanical interactions between the cells and extracellular&lt;br/&gt;matrix in articular cartilage. A combination of analytical and&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods are used to solve: (1) contact problems that&lt;br/&gt;model experiments used to determine mechanical properties of&lt;br/&gt;isolated cell (chondrocyte) and cell-matrix (chondron) units, (2)&lt;br/&gt;interface problems that model local cell-matrix mechanics of the&lt;br/&gt;chondron in vivo, and (3) fast boundary integral models for&lt;br/&gt;transmission of mechanical signals in a tissue layer populated&lt;br/&gt;with many cells. Through collaboration with an orthopaedic&lt;br/&gt;research lab, the models developed by the investigator are being&lt;br/&gt;applied to: (a) the determination of material properties of cell&lt;br/&gt;and tissue explants using in-vitro micropipette testing and video&lt;br/&gt;microscopy, and (b) the simulation of local cell-matrix mechanics&lt;br/&gt;and comparison to confocal microscopy of dynamic loading in a&lt;br/&gt;tissue layer. A fundamental goal of this project is to quantify&lt;br/&gt;the dependence of local cell mechanics on external loading. By&lt;br/&gt;correlating experimental measurements of cell metabolic activity&lt;br/&gt;to mechanical components of the local cell environment, the&lt;br/&gt;complex relationship between tissue metabolism and cell mechanics&lt;br/&gt;is analyzed. Variations in chondron material and geometric&lt;br/&gt;properties, within and across a variety of tissue populations,&lt;br/&gt;are also incorporated into the models. This project contributes&lt;br/&gt;to understanding of the role of mechanics in maintenance of the&lt;br/&gt;extracellular matrix, and associated matrix degeneration with&lt;br/&gt;aging due to osteoarthritis.&lt;br/&gt; Articular cartilage is the primary load-bearing tissue in&lt;br/&gt;joints such as the knee, shoulder and hip. Degeneration of&lt;br/&gt;cartilage leads to osteoarthritis, a painful condition that&lt;br/&gt;affects millions of Americans and is predominantly associated&lt;br/&gt;with aging. Under repeated loading, the structural matrix of&lt;br/&gt;cartilage is in a continual state of turnover that is regulated&lt;br/&gt;by specialized cells called chondrocytes. These cells synthesize&lt;br/&gt;matrix components yet, remarkably, have no neural connection to&lt;br/&gt;the brain. As a result, cell metabolic activities directed at&lt;br/&gt;repairing the structural matrix are highly dependent on the local&lt;br/&gt;cell environment. In this project, a mathematical modeler&lt;br/&gt;collaborates with an orthopaedic research lab to understand the&lt;br/&gt;role of mechanical forces in the maintenance of cartilage. At&lt;br/&gt;the cellular level, forces in cartilage result from a complex&lt;br/&gt;coupling of solid and fluid mechanics with energy dissipation.&lt;br/&gt;Results of this work predict the dependence of local forces at&lt;br/&gt;the cellular scale on external loading. Local force predictions&lt;br/&gt;facilitate a quantitative description of the complex relationship&lt;br/&gt;between cell metabolic activity and cell mechanics. In&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with associated experiments for a variety of tissue&lt;br/&gt;populations, the models lead to an understanding of how these&lt;br/&gt;remarkable cells can maintain cartilage over the course of a&lt;br/&gt;lifetime, and how structural degeneration of cartilage is&lt;br/&gt;initiated in osteoarthritis.</AbstractNarration>
