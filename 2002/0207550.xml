    <AbstractNarration>Wang, Xiaodong&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives and Significance: The turbo principle [27 ],namely,the strategy that exploits the iterated&lt;br/&gt;exchange of soft information between di .erent blocks in a communication receiver,has grown to be a powerful&lt;br/&gt;tool in attacking a diverse set of problems in communications.In particular,the turbo multiuser detection&lt;br/&gt;(MUD)paradigm [59 ]has attracted signi .cant recent attention as an e .ective technique for joint decoding&lt;br/&gt;in multiuser communication systems.However to date the performance of various turbo MUD schemes&lt;br/&gt;is largely demonstrated via simulations,and the impact of turbo MUD on the network performance (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;throughput and delay)has not been explored systematically.It also remains unclear at this time how the&lt;br/&gt;upper-layer functionalities (such as ARQ protocol,power control,and admission control)should be designed&lt;br/&gt;to exploit the physical-layer turbo MUD.The objective of the proposed project is to develop analytical tools to&lt;br/&gt;assess and optimize the performance of various turbo MUD methods,and to apply these esults to c oss-layer&lt;br/&gt;design in wireless networks.&lt;br/&gt;Recently a technique known as density evolution [66,67 ]has been developed in the coding community that&lt;br/&gt;permits analysis of iterative decoding algorithm for in .nite-length codewords.In this proposal,under the&lt;br/&gt;density evolution framework,we outline a research plan aimed at understanding of the design and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;turbo multiuser detection for a variety of channel conditions and receiver structures,and the design of some&lt;br/&gt;upper-layer functionalities which takes into account the physical layer turbo MUD.While in this study we&lt;br/&gt;focus on multiuser CDMA systems,the general principle is applicable to several systems,such as space-time&lt;br/&gt;coding systems,OFDM systems,and intersymbol interference systems.</AbstractNarration>
