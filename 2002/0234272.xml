    <AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation (NSF) Microbial Observatory (MO) and Life in Extreme Environments (LExEn) programs have provided critical opportunities for research into the diversity and activity of microorganisms. Together, these programs sponsor diverse research efforts on microbial communities from a wide variety of natural environments, ranging from the extreme and/or unusual (e.g., hydrothermal vents and hypersaline lakes) to the typical and/or ubiquitous (e.g., ocean waters and agricultural soils). The investigators funded through the MO and LExEn programs have pushed the frontier of microbial diversity and microbial biogeochemistry research, discovering novel microbial lineages, describing the complexity of natural microbial communities, and linking microbial taxa to critical ecosystem functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop, including principal investigators of MO and LExEn projects, other outstanding scientists in the field, and Postdoctoral students is proposed as a mechanism to enhance future research in environmental biology and microbial life. The purpose of the workshop is two-fold: 1) to provide a platform for principal investigators, post-doctoral associates, and graduate students to share ideas and techniques among projects, facilitating communication of technical advancements and fostering collaborative/interdisciplinary activities; and 2) to discuss the future of microbial life research programs sponsored by the National Science Foundation, including identification of funding gaps and analysis of new research frontiers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide an important opportunity for student and postdoctoral training. At least 22 postdoctoral associates and graduate students will take part in the meeting as representatives of MO or LExEn projects. An additional 24 postdoctoral associates currently funded through the NSF Microbial Biology postdoctoral program, including underrepresented minorities in science, have been invited to attend.</AbstractNarration>
