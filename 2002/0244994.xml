    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: DMS-0244994: Byrna Kra&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penn State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kra proposes research in several areas of ergodic theory and&lt;br/&gt;differentiable dynamics, with an emphasis on applications of ergodic&lt;br/&gt;theory to number theory and combinatorics. The major area of research is&lt;br/&gt;the study of ``non-conventional'' ergodic averages, studying ergodic&lt;br/&gt;theorems for averages of functions where even if the system is ergodic,&lt;br/&gt;the limit need not be constant. The investigator proposes studying&lt;br/&gt;polynomial averages, averages for commuting transformations and averages&lt;br/&gt;along other sequences of recurrence. Additional lines of research are&lt;br/&gt;based on her work on circle maps, including connections between the&lt;br/&gt;differentiability of the map, the arithmetic properties of its rotation&lt;br/&gt;number and the dimension of its invariant limit set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project studies the long term behavior of systems whose dynamics is&lt;br/&gt;too complicated or too chaotic to be understood locally. Dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems are used to model problems in natural and social sciences and&lt;br/&gt;their study leads to an understanding of the evolution of the modeled&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. The educational portion of the project aims to contribute to&lt;br/&gt;the graduate and undergraduate programs at Penn State University, with&lt;br/&gt;special courses designed to inject research into the learning process at&lt;br/&gt;an early stage. In fall 2003, the PI will develop and teach a course on&lt;br/&gt;topological dynamics and Ramsey Theory in the MASS (Mathematics Advanced&lt;br/&gt;Studies Semesters) program, a long-standing program aimed at talented fourth-year undergraduates chosen in national competition. The outreach portion aims to make the&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics Department at Penn State a more attractive place for women to&lt;br/&gt;study and work, with the creation of a focus group on women's issues and&lt;br/&gt;support of research projects for undergraduate women.</AbstractNarration>
