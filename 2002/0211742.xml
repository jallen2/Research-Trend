    <AbstractNarration>In higher plants, each pollen grain contains two sperm cells that are delivered to the embryo sac. One sperm fertilizes the egg and this fusion gives rise to the embryo that eventually grows into the plant. The other sperm fertilizes another cell in the embryo sac and this second fusion gives rise to the endosperm, a nutritive tissue in the seed that is required for the development of the embryo. Double fertilization is arguably the developmental process of most economic value in crop plants, because most foods are seeds or arise from seeds. Double fertilization was discovered over 100 years ago. But because of the relative inaccessibility of plant gametes, the molecular biology and mechanistics of this unique feature of the higher plant life cycle are barely understood. In order to exploit gametes for crop improvement, it is necessary to know more about them.&lt;br/&gt;To facilitate a more global understanding of plant gamete gene expression, cDNA libraries will be constructed from isolated sperm, eggs, and embryo sacs of maize. More than 5000 cDNAs from each library will be sequenced. Expression profiles for about 200 diverse cDNAs from each library will be determined. Plants with fluorescently-tagged gametes will be constructed to facilitate analysis of gamete function in gene disruption lines, and to facilitate imaging of fertilization. Functional analyses will focus on genes predicted to encode surface-localized proteins that might mediate critical cellular interactions during double fertilization. All sequences and stocks from this project will be available to the research community. With this information about maize gamete gene expression, comparative genomics can be used to identify and manipulate gamete-expressed genes in diverse plant species.</AbstractNarration>
