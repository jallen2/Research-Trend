    <AbstractNarration>The cells in all complex organisms have two distinct DNA genomes, one in the nucleus and the other in the mitochondrion. The mitochondrion has a separate DNA genome as the result of its evolutionary history as a bacterial cell that entered into a mutually beneficial relationship with the ancestor of all modern eukaryotes (cells with separate nuclei). The mitochondrion's contribution is to act as the powerhouse of the cell, producing energy from the food we eat. To do this, the genes in the nucleus and the mitochondrion need to be able to communicate with each other to optimize energy production. A large part of this communication depends on an enzyme, the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, which is encoded in the nucleus and sent to the mitochondrion to read the mitochondrial DNA. This results in the conversion of the information in the mitochondrial DNA (via an RNA intermediate) into proteins necessary for energy production. This project will determine how this enzyme works and how it is sensitive to signals from the rest of the cell that control its activity. These signals help to coordinate the process of energy production and to insure that it is efficient and responsive to the availability of nutrients.</AbstractNarration>
