    <AbstractNarration>PI: Mikhail Feldman, University of Wisconsin&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200644&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;--------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of two main topics: (1) Free boundary&lt;br/&gt;problems for nonlinear elliptic equations. One of objectives&lt;br/&gt;is to develop techniques for studying free boundary problems&lt;br/&gt;arising in the models of compressible fluid dynamics, in&lt;br/&gt;particular to study existence, uniqueness and stability of&lt;br/&gt;multidimensional transonic shocks for Euler equations for&lt;br/&gt;steady and self-similar potential flows. Euler equations can&lt;br/&gt;be written as a single second order, nonlinear elliptic-hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;equation of mixed type for the velocity potential, if the flow&lt;br/&gt;is steady or self-similar. Transonic shocks are discontinuities&lt;br/&gt;in the gradient of the solution such that the type of equation&lt;br/&gt;changes from hyperbolic to elliptic across the shock surface.&lt;br/&gt;Transonic shocks arise in many situations of physical importance&lt;br/&gt;(steady supersonic flows around an obstacle, shock reflection for&lt;br/&gt;self-similar flows). (2) Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem.&lt;br/&gt;The questions to study include geometric and measure-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;properties of solutions, and applications to partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free boundary problems arise naturally in many models in physics,&lt;br/&gt;fluid dynamics, economics. Free boundaries correspond to sharp&lt;br/&gt;changes in the variables describing the problem. Significant&lt;br/&gt;progress has been made during last several decades in the study&lt;br/&gt;of free boundary problems. However in the case of nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations many important questions are yet to be studied.&lt;br/&gt;This is the first theme of the project. Better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;properties of free boundaries, such as stability, makes possible to&lt;br/&gt;understand complex phenomena in models and applications. We plan to&lt;br/&gt;study transonic shocks in a flow of compressible fluid or gas.&lt;br/&gt;Another area of the project is optimal transportation problem.&lt;br/&gt;Recently many fundamental properties and important applications of&lt;br/&gt;this problem within and beyond mathematics were discovered, in&lt;br/&gt;particular its connections to nonlinear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, and applications in models for front formation in the&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere, kinetic theory, fluid flow, elastic crystals, granular&lt;br/&gt;materials, and microeconomic decision problems. We plan to work&lt;br/&gt;on theory and applications of optimal transportation problem.</AbstractNarration>
