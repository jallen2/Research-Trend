    <AbstractNarration>The Mathematics Department of Wayne State University is hosting a National Science Foundation--Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences (NSF-CBMS) Regional Research Conference during the period of May 18 to May 22, 2003. The conference topic is ``Free boundary problems in partial differential equations and applications.'' This five-day-long conference is intended to stimulate further interest in this important mathematical research area. The aim of this conference is to highlight the new methods, directions and most recent developments in variational and nonvariational free boundary theory. It will focus on the existence and regularity of solutions of free boundary problems and applications to problems arising in science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor David Jerison from MIT will present ten lectures in this focused area along with additional invited speakers including Luis Caffarelli (UT, Austin), Avner Friedman (Ohio State University), Carlos Kenig (University of Chicago) and Fanghua Lin (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences), each of whom will give one hour lecture. These additional lectures are meant to complement the ten lectures given by the principal speaker and motivate more active discussions among the participants. The format of the conference will be intensive lectures by the featured speaker and four invited speakers along with semi-structured discussion sessions following the invited talks. To meet the requirement of CBMS meetings, we will not schedule any contributed talks by the participants. Anticipated participants shall include not only well established researchers, but also graduate students, postdoctoral and young researchers. In particular, the conference will encourage the participation of women, persons with disabilities and people from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
