    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research project is a close interaction between the design and synthesis of new compounds, detailed characterization of the physical properties and understanding the structure-property relationships. This research project will provide the basis for discovering interesting new materials leading to novel phenomena and useful applications. The synthesis and characterization of transition metal (B) perovskites (ABO3; A = rare earth, alkali earth, alkali metal ions), double perovskites (AA'BB'O6) and related quasi-low-dimensional (LD) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases [(AO)(ABO3)n; n = 1, 2, 3], and pyrochlore-based (A2B2O7) oxides with strongly correlated electronic interactions provide an opportunity to discover new materials with interesting properties. The research project is a systematic study of unique synthetic routes for the stabilization of new transition metal perovskites, LD RP phases and pyrochlore-type compounds. Crystal growth of new and promising phases whenever possible will be attempted and the characterization of properties by a battery of physical measurements will be carried out. A major focus of the research is the training of postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art reseach methods in solid state chemistry and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis and characterization of novel transition metal oxides with important electrical and magnetic properties is emphasized for applications in the electronic and communication industries, for example as possible computer memory chip components, sensors, and superconducting elements in imaging devices. Moreover, the results of these investigations will enhance fundamental understanding of the factors that determine material properties, which will enable the design and control of new unique materials by chemistry. The training of Postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art reseach methods in solid state chemistry and materials science will be emphasized. The next generation of well-trained solid state chemists and materials scientists is essentail for maintaining the leadership of US technology in the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>
