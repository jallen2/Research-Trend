    <AbstractNarration>This award will support a week-long summer program in polymer for undergraduates. Participants will be selected from applicants from across the nation. The purpose of "PolyCamp" is to expose undergraduate students to the fascinating field of polymer science with the ultimate goal of getting them to consider graduate school and eventual employment in the field. A second key purpose is to expose the students to the various exciting career opportunities in polymer science. The week-long program consists of a number of introductory lectures on polymer chemistry; industrial plant tours; industrial and academic lab tours; three laboratory experiments; and group and individual discussions of career pathways and opportunities in the polymer field. Although PolyCamp has is only one week in duration, it will especially appeal to students who, for whatever reason, cannot commit to a full summer. It is proposed that programs such as PolyCamp are an excellent way to increase the number of students who are interested in polymer science, which will benefit the entire polymer community. Long-term assessment data will be collected and used to determine to what extent the PolyCamp experience stimulated the students' interest in polymer science and how it has helped them develop and execute their career plans. The program has the strong backing of industrial affiliates, who eager to give plant tours and lead discussions of career opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
