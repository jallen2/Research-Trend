    <AbstractNarration>Transversal hot zones can form in commercial packed-bed reactors and may be deleterious because they may decrease the yield of the desired products, deactivate the catalyst and initiate runaway reactions that may ultimately result in explosions. The PI plans to conduct experiments and theoretical numerical studies on hot zone formation and dynamics. The problem is of both academic interest and engineering importance as the goal is not just to observe, analyze and characterize such hot zones, but to gain the ability to predict and control them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans experimental studies using an infrared imager of hot zone formation and motion for two test reactions: the oxidation of carbon monoxide and acetylene hydrogenation. These experiments will be used to determine under what conditions hot zones form and what are their characteristic motions. Numerical simulations of a three-dimensional two-phase model will be used to gain an understanding of the critical rate processes and parameters affecting hot zone formation in a uniform packed bed reactor. The model will provide guidance about interesting regions for experimental study and for the organization of experimental observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot spots and hot zones are a perennial problem of packed bed reactors. Providing guidance from first principals on how to avoid or control them would have significant safety benefits for the industrial operation of chemical manufacturing systems.</AbstractNarration>
