    <AbstractNarration>0217100&lt;br/&gt;Eberhardt&lt;br/&gt;This award continues Design Projects' activities begun under NSF award #9704215 at the University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB), in which students designed and built custom projects for people with disabilities. The objectives of the activities are to enhance engineering education, provide students with insight into careers in rehabilitation, improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, and to serve the community. The previous award led to the successful completion of numerous projects and training of over 40 undergraduate students in basic design principles. Projects are to be featured in regional news media and local television specials, and will be described in international symposia. This new project is expected to expand the number of design projects and will include students from the new Biomedical Engineering (BME) undergraduate program at UAB. The majority of the projects are to be conducted in partnership with United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) of Birmingham.</AbstractNarration>
