    <AbstractNarration>0227907&lt;br/&gt;Wight &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to Ohio University to support the activity described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060). The partners include Ohio University (Lead Institution), Intherthyr Corporation, DiAthegen LLC, GeneBact Biotechnologies, Battelle Memorial Institute, Diagnostic Hybrids Inc, Sen Med Medical Ventures, Athenian Venture Partners, Adena Ventures, Appalachian Regional Commission, Edison BioTechnology Center, Governor's Office for Appalachia, Governor's Regional Economic Development Office. The goals of the program include accelerating and enhancing the growth of the biotechnology sector in southeast Ohio region, accelerating the growth of existing companies and increasing their probability of success, creating the technology pipeline and creating new companies, sustaining the regional cluster, and keeping the companies in the region. New start-up companies based on intellectual property derived from the Ohio University research programs will be launched and nurtured. Training of the workforce for the biotech industry is a top priority. Partnering with existing corporate and other private and public partners will form a strong nucleus to form and retain start-up companies in biotech in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the program is to increase the number of new sources of higher-paying jobs, and to mobilize the underrepresented populations in the region by providing education, research and technology and business support for new start-up biotech companies. The economy in southeastern Ohio is among the worst in Appalachia.</AbstractNarration>
