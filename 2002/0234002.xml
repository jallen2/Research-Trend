    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0234002&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Bahar, Ivet&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: NIH-NSF BBSI on Simulation and Computer Visualization of Biological Systems at Multiple Scales&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to develop a Bioengineering &amp; Bioinformatics Summer Institute (BBSI) entitled NIH-NSF BBSI on Simulation and Computer Visualization of Biological Systems at &lt;br/&gt;Multiple Scales. for undergraduate and graduate students with strong analytical and &lt;br/&gt;quantitative skills, and high potential for careers in Computational Biology, Bioengineering, or Bioinformatics. The BBSI will be a joint program of the University of Pittsburgh (lead institution), the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and Duquesne University, and will also include faculty from Carnegie Mellon University. A major strength of this academic community is the breadth and depth of experience with biological models and simulations, from molecular to multicellular, and from analytical approaches to massively parallel computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives are to: (i) provide students with a unique training and research &lt;br/&gt;experience through a series of cross-disciplinary lectures, computational laboratory sessions, and independent research opportunities not available in traditional undergraduate programs; specifically, to present an integrated view of molecular-to-cellular analytical approaches and fundamental physicochemical, statistical mechanical, and kinetic principles needed for predictive theoretical and computational research; (ii) broaden the student's view of post-genomic computational and mathematical research areas in molecular, cellular, and systems biology, and (iii) motivate students to pursue careers in the field(s). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applicants will be accepted, from basic life or physical sciences, computer science, mathematics or engineering, and three first year graduate students. A ten-week program will encompass six weeks of lecture and computer lab coursework, three weeks of mentored research activity, and 1 week of student presentations. In addition, a weekly seminar series will cover a wide variety of related topics with presentations from local or invited outside experts, as well as discussions of scientific ethics and career opportunities. Student-organized journal clubs, and involvement of senior or graduate students in teaching activities will ensure efficient communication and contribute to professional growth.</AbstractNarration>
