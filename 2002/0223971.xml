    <AbstractNarration>The goal for this MUSES exploratory project is to integrate life cycle-based environmental, social and economic design criteria and ECC microstructure tailoring to enhance the sustainability of infrastructure systems. Worldwide construction of concrete infrastructure such as roads, bridges and pipes exceeds 6 billion tons/yr. The resulting impacts are dramatic and include greenhouse gas emissions, land disturbances, air pollution, and construction-related traffic congestion and vehicle damage. Engineered cementitious composites (ECC) are a new class of materials being developed to improve the performance of infrastructure systems. ECC formulations are designed through microstructure tailoring of inputs including matrix (cement and fly ash), fiber (virgin and recycled polymers, and interface elements. While ECC strain capacity is far superior to normal concrete, overall life cycle costs and benefits have not yet been evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing these criteria is complex due to widely varying scales of analysis (nanometers in materials science to kilometers in the geological sciences), the long-term nature and consequences of infrastructure systems, and the need to optimize the scheduling of large capital investments. To address this complexity, this research will draw upon a multi-disciplinary team from the University of Michigan's Advanced Civil Engineering Material Research Lab, Center for Sustainable Systems, College of Engineering, School of Public Health, School of Natural Resources and Environment, and Department of Geological Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will emphasize student education and research training through two graduate student research assistantships; specialized industrial ecology curriculum; a field component at a local cement manufacturer; a MUSES seminar series; and monthly research team workshops</AbstractNarration>
