    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0240380&lt;br/&gt;El-Sayed/Georgia Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis and characterization of transition metal nano-particles is the focus of this research project, being carried out at the Georgia Institute of Technology by co-P.I.'s El-Sayed and Wang and their coworkers. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the structure, formation mechanism, and thermal and photothermal stability of tranisition metal nanocrystals are being examined. Methods for controlling and affecting the growth morphology of these nanocrystals are examined using electron microscopy and spectroscopic probes. The dependence of the nanoparticle stability on the type of metal, the shape of the particle, the type of the capping ligand, and the nature of the chemical environment is examined. The results of these studies will be useful in evaluating nanoparticle materials for use in heterogeneous catalysis applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal nanoparticles show great promise for applications in heterogeneous catalysis. The rational understanding of the growth, the control of size and shape, and understanding the stability of these materials is the focus of this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. Professors El-Sayed and Wang and their coworkers at Georgia Tech are combining synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, and electron microscopic characterization of these important materials to gain this understanding.</AbstractNarration>
