    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for proposal # 0200225, Helmut Voelklein:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hurwitz spaces parametrize covers of the sphere&lt;br/&gt;of given ramification type and monodromy group.&lt;br/&gt;Each Hurwitz space has a natural map to the moduli &lt;br/&gt;space of genus g curves (for suitable g). This&lt;br/&gt;has been used in algebraic geometry for a long time,&lt;br/&gt;but only in the case of simple covers (which in &lt;br/&gt;particular have a symmetric group as monodromy group).&lt;br/&gt;Hurwitz spaces of covers with arbitrary monodromy &lt;br/&gt;group were constructed by Fried and Voelklein, &lt;br/&gt;and applied to the Inverse Galois problem. &lt;br/&gt;Proposed research explores how the group-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;methods associated with Hurwitz spaces can be &lt;br/&gt;applied in the study of the moduli of curves.&lt;br/&gt;This includes algorithmic methods of computational &lt;br/&gt;group theory, which are especially useful in the &lt;br/&gt;study of the braid group action on generating&lt;br/&gt;systems of a finite group. Generalizations replace &lt;br/&gt;the braid group by the mapping class group of a &lt;br/&gt;punctured surface of non-zero genus. Applications&lt;br/&gt;to the Inverse Galois Problem are to be expected.&lt;br/&gt;The project is partially in cooperation &lt;br/&gt;with G. Frey, K. Magaard and S. Shpectorov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group Theory is the abstract study of symmetry patterns &lt;br/&gt;(of any object). Many algorithms of Group Theory&lt;br/&gt;are implemented in modern computer algebra systems.&lt;br/&gt;Proposed research uses these computer algebra &lt;br/&gt;systems to find and study families of highly symmetric &lt;br/&gt;algebraic curves. Algebraic curves are basic objects&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics, physics and applications, e.g., cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;Elliptic curve cryptography provides encryption schemes&lt;br/&gt;used for data security on the internet.</AbstractNarration>
