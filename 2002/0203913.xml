    <AbstractNarration>This material synthesis and processing project is focused on next generation magnetic materials. Of primary importance is the preparation and characterization of high anisotropy CoPt and FePt nanoparticles. The particles will be prepared by a "cluster gun" assembly equipped with a special heat-treating stage, required to transform their structure from the fcc phase to the high anisotropy fct phase. Specially prepared substrates will also be used to assemble these nanoscale particles into ordered arrays. The properties of the particles and their arrays will be investigated as candidate media for high-density magnetic recording. The project will provide one post-doctoral associate with cutting edge training and education in magnetism and materials science. The project is co-funded between the Metals Program and the Condensed Matter Physics Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This material synthesis and processing project is focused on next generation magnetic materials. As a magnetic particle is continually reduced in size to the nanometer regime, it becomes susceptible to temperature effects that can cause its magnetization to fluctuate in different directions. It is no longer possible to "store" information in the particle's magnetization orientation. These issues are among the most important limits to how dense information can be stored on hard disk drives. The objective of this research is to develop recording media that will function at room temperature while using particles of sizes below one millionth of an inch. The materials are alloys or compounds of cobalt, platinum and iron. The project will provide one post-doctoral associate with cutting edge training and education in magnetism and materials science. The project is co-funded between the Metals Program and the Condensed Matter Physics Program.</AbstractNarration>
