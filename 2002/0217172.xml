    <AbstractNarration>Developing a Women Interested in Mathematics and Science Advancement (WIMSA) Network in a Rural Community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Women's deeply ingrained negative perceptions of science and mathematics are directly&lt;br/&gt;linked to their underrepresentation in these and related fields (Gottfried, 1993). The goal &lt;br/&gt;of our project is to increase the participation of women from rural communities in the &lt;br/&gt;fields of science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET). To achieve our goal, &lt;br/&gt;we will initiate a program that involves women throughout the community in a sustained&lt;br/&gt;network of support. This is an exciting, complex, long-term project. This proposal is for&lt;br/&gt;a PGE Demonstration Planning Grant, which will enable us to prepare a strong, comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;proposal for a full PGE Demonstration Grant. Our full grant will address the inequities &lt;br/&gt;experienced by girls, particularly in low-tech rural areas. The full grant will be used to &lt;br/&gt;create a program, called Women Interested in Mathematics and Science Advancement&lt;br/&gt;(WIMSA). The WIMSA program will consist of a network of people and organizations, &lt;br/&gt;all with the goal of increasing the participation and success of females in mathematics &lt;br/&gt;and science. The full proposal will address recruitment of WIMSA network members, &lt;br/&gt;sustaining their membership, and expanding the WIMSA program. The PGE Demonstration&lt;br/&gt;Planning project will focus on the design of all aspects of the WIMSA program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the two main planning grant objectives will be to design our pilot project, the &lt;br/&gt;annual WIMSA Summer Program (WSP) for middle school girls, which will have the dual &lt;br/&gt;purpose ofbeing the initial impetus to bring people into the WIMSA network, and of &lt;br/&gt;increasing the skill level of middle school girls and teachers. A planning committee,&lt;br/&gt;consisting of two K-12 teachers, two college students, and the two Principal &lt;br/&gt;Investigators, will be formed to develop the summer program. The committee will&lt;br/&gt;determine the size and scope of the program, design program activities and curriculum, &lt;br/&gt;and will collaborate with community organizations regarding WSP field activities. &lt;br/&gt;The program design will build on the successes of other SMET intervention programs &lt;br/&gt;for women across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our other main planning grant objective will be to design the WIMSA network connections &lt;br/&gt;and activities. We envision this network bringing together Mesa State faculty and students,&lt;br/&gt;K-12 teachers and students, private businesses, government organizations, educational&lt;br/&gt;associations, community leaders and any local programs involved with science and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Our first activity will be a WIMSA kickoff meeting, hosted by Mesa State,&lt;br/&gt;which will include people from all target organizations and will introduce them to the&lt;br/&gt;WIMSA concept. We will create a WISMA Advisory Board that will oversee all aspects &lt;br/&gt;of the WIMSA project, including writing the full PGE Demonstration Grant. We will &lt;br/&gt;design college courses to provide ongoing SMET activities and training for WIMSA &lt;br/&gt;members, including a graduate credit component for K-12 teachers. We will &lt;br/&gt;collaborate with local businesses and professionals to design activities for the&lt;br/&gt;WSP, internship opportunities for WIMSA college students, job-shadowing opportunities &lt;br/&gt;for K-12 students, and presentation opportunities at Mesa State. In order to sustain &lt;br/&gt;such relationshipsand collaborations, there will be WIMSA meetings at least three&lt;br/&gt;times per year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there are no programs in our area addressing the lack of females in SMET fields, &lt;br/&gt;there are programs and organizations committed to improving our community, and many&lt;br/&gt;people who wish to make a difference. The WIMSA program will provide an incredible &lt;br/&gt;opportunity to harness and coordinate these resources and create a &lt;br/&gt;very effective program that will have long-ranging impact.</AbstractNarration>
