    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230542&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Hyman, Scott David&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Sweet Briar College&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Reform of the Engineering Program at Sweet Briar College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet Briar College (SBC) shares the national concern over the decline&lt;br/&gt;in students graduating with bachelor's degrees in engineering over the last&lt;br/&gt;two decades. Moreover, as a women's college, SBC is concerned with the&lt;br/&gt;ongoing dramatic under representation of women in undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;engineering programs and in the engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;In response, SBC is requesting this planning grant in order to initiate&lt;br/&gt;the reform and upgrade of its engineering curriculum. The objective of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to develop an extensive engineering curriculum at SBC, which would&lt;br/&gt;be only the second such program in the nation at a liberal arts institution&lt;br/&gt;for women.&lt;br/&gt;SBC currently offers students a dual degree program with a number of&lt;br/&gt;cooperating institutions. Students follow a pre-engineering curriculum and&lt;br/&gt;complete a bachelor's degree from SBC and either a bachelor's, or in one case&lt;br/&gt;a master's, degree in engineering from the other university. The program&lt;br/&gt;upgrade will be to institute a true engineering curriculum at SBC: five&lt;br/&gt;courses at the introductory and intermediate level that will comprise the&lt;br/&gt;core sequence of an Engineering Science major, which will be supplemented by&lt;br/&gt;research and internship opportunities. The curriculum will be designed to&lt;br/&gt;complement the strong liberal arts and study abroad traditions of SBC and to&lt;br/&gt;allow the students to take full advantage of the proven nurturing environment&lt;br/&gt;of a women's college.</AbstractNarration>
