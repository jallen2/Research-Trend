    <AbstractNarration>NCAM Dissemination Project to Community Colleges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Demonstration, Enrichment and Information Dissemination project is a collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between the CPB/WGBH National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM) and the League for&lt;br/&gt;Innovation in the Community College. NCAM will work with the League to disseminate and&lt;br/&gt;institutionalize use of resources that can make technology-enabled science, technology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering and math (STEM) learning resources accessible to students, faculty and&lt;br/&gt;administrators at community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;Project goals are to elevate the issue of accessibility within the community college system;&lt;br/&gt;disseminate NSF-funded demonstration models, guidelines, tools and resources that enable&lt;br/&gt;creation of accessible STEM content; and encourage the community college system to&lt;br/&gt;participate in the development and implementation of accessible specifications for distributed&lt;br/&gt;learning platforms.&lt;br/&gt;NCAM will conduct presentations and workshops at annual League conferences, offer on-site&lt;br/&gt;Accessibility Forums at member colleges, and deliver online training and resources through the&lt;br/&gt;League's Web-based learning community, Transformational Learning Connections&lt;br/&gt;(LeagueTLC). Products and demonstration models that will be shared include:&lt;br/&gt;* distributed learning industry specifications and standards&lt;br/&gt;* developers' guidelines to creating accessible content, focused on math and science solutions&lt;br/&gt;* accessible online physics curriculum with multimedia lectures, quizzes, and electronic texts&lt;br/&gt;* demonstration models of accessible math and science content within software&lt;br/&gt;* access authoring tools including shareware and commercial products and tutorials&lt;br/&gt;Project activities will strengthen capacity within community colleges to create and utilize&lt;br/&gt;accessible math and science content in technology-enabled learning. Guidelines and technical&lt;br/&gt;resources will facilitate community college creation, maintenance, control, packaging and&lt;br/&gt;presentation of accessible digital content.&lt;br/&gt;Results will serve a wide array of users of online community college content " people with&lt;br/&gt;sensory disabilities, people with learning or print disabilities who benefit from multiple modes&lt;br/&gt;of presentation, and people with physical disabilities who use assistive technologies for&lt;br/&gt;navigation and control of content.&lt;br/&gt;Accessible content and systems will improve the quality of learning, teaching and/or work life&lt;br/&gt;for all of these users, whether they are community college students, faculty members and/or&lt;br/&gt;administrators.&lt;br/&gt;Through this initiative, the League for Innovation in the Community College will encourage use&lt;br/&gt;of its resources to connect and empower learning between innovative leaders and model&lt;br/&gt;programs in community colleges that are recruiting and preparing students with disabilities for&lt;br/&gt;STEM careers. This Project will also serve to build support and generate strategies within the&lt;br/&gt;League to mount a major learning thread on accessibility at one of the League's conferences.</AbstractNarration>
