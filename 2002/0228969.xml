    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Studies in Ceramics in the summer of 2002 will focus the effect of length scale of the microstructure on processing, characterization and properties of ceramics. This subject lies at the heart of our emerging ability to design ceramic materials with specific microstructures and properties. Recent research activities among ceramists and the growing number of publications in this area indicate that a meeting on this topic is especially timely. Key researchers in the field have committed to attend this meeting and describe their most recent findings (please see http://www.grc.uri.edu/programs/2002/ceramics.htm for the program). To augment the traditional technical presentations, additional program initiatives, namely an invited poster session for young scientists and enhanced participation of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. The conference will gather scholars and educators at all career levels in an atmosphere conducive not only to making technical progress, but also for establishing sustainable collaborations and professional relationships. The meeting setting and atmosphere provides ample time for discussions and networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference has significant broad impact for the ceramics community through the identification of key research areas, establishment of new collaborations, reinforcement of existing connections, and encouragement of a young and diverse group of professionals. The NSF funding will be used to encourage the participation of graduate students, post doctoral associates and other young scientists and engineers at the start of their professional careers.</AbstractNarration>
