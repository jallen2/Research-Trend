    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204506&lt;br/&gt;Bruce Kleiner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal consists of two projects which are&lt;br/&gt;motivated by the geometry of three dimensional manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;The first project uses quasisymmetric homeomorphisms&lt;br/&gt;as a framework to understand the asymptotic geometry&lt;br/&gt;of hyperbolic groups. Several uniformization and &lt;br/&gt;rigidity problems are discussed. The central problem&lt;br/&gt;is Cannon's conjecture that a hyperbolic group with&lt;br/&gt;boundary homeomorphic to the two-sphere is a lattice&lt;br/&gt;in the isometry group of hyperbolic space. A resolution&lt;br/&gt;of this conjecture would be a major step toward Thurston's&lt;br/&gt;Hyperbolization conjecture. The second part of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal addresses the Weak hyperbolization conjecture,&lt;br/&gt;the other missing step in the proof of Thurston's conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed attack uses geometry and dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;surface laminations in three manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major open problems in Mathematics is to determine &lt;br/&gt;the possible shapes (topologies) that a three dimensional space &lt;br/&gt;might assume. In the 1970's, Thurston formulated his famous&lt;br/&gt;Geometrization conjecture, which is a precise statement about&lt;br/&gt;how the classification of such spaces should look. The &lt;br/&gt;proposal addresses a piece of Thurston's conjecture known &lt;br/&gt;as the Hyperbolization conjecture. The general line of attack &lt;br/&gt;is to associate a two dimensional self-similar fractal sphere &lt;br/&gt;with each three dimensional space, and reduce the original&lt;br/&gt;conjecture to showing that one can find "good" coordinate systems&lt;br/&gt;for this associated fractal sphere.</AbstractNarration>
