    <AbstractNarration>Research and education activities in this project pursue the mitigation of wind-related natural hazards-the most costly natural hazards faced by the United States. The first objective is to establish a design and testing environment (DTE) in which a diverse collection of participants can learn, design, and test new concepts in wind-resistant design. Second, computational simulation tools will be developed based on discrete vortex methods (DVM). Third, experimental and computational tools will be integrated in such a way that as designs are tested, the models and tools are continuously being validated and improved. &lt;br/&gt;From a research standpoint, the DTE will facilitate interaction among researchers, students, and industry for conceiving novel concepts in wind-resistant design. These concepts will be tested using both experimental and computational tools. Research is therefore conducted to search for improved aerodynamic designs and to improve computational techniques. As an educational tool, the DTE will accommodate research and design participants from a wide range of backgrounds working at an appropriate level. All the activity of the DTE-submission of designs to be tested and reporting test results-will be accessible via the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;The project's intellectual merit derives from the integrated experimental and computational nature of the simulations and the foundation of discrete vortex methods. The project's broader impacts include new wind resistant design development, new computational tools for design, a database of aerodynamic loads accessible to anyone designing a structure, and a framework that fosters participation by people from a broad range of backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
