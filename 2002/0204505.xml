    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: DMS-0204505&lt;br/&gt;PI: Stuart S. Antman&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Maryland College Park&lt;br/&gt;Title: Nonlinear Problems of Solid Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S. S. Antman proposes to treat a variety of dynamical and steady-state nonlinear problems for rods, shells, and three-dimensional solid bodies. The bodies are composed of nonlinearly elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or magnetoelastic materials. In each case, properly invariant, geometrically exact theories encompassing general nonlinear constitutive equations are to be used. (Such correctly formulated nonlinear problems of solid mechanics can seldom be directly subsumed under available mathematical theories.) The goals of these studies are to discover new nonlinear effects, determine thresholds in constitutive equations separating qualitatively different responses, determine general classes of constitutive equations that are both physically and mathematically natural, examine important kinds of instabilities, determine how existence, regularity, and well-posedness depend on material behavior, contribute to the theory of shocks and dissipative mechanisms in solids, and develop new methods of nonlinear analysis and of effective computation for problems of solid mechanics. Among the specific areas to be studied are (i) eversion of nonlinearly elastic shells, (ii) nonlinear stability of structures subject to nonconservative loads, (iii) dynamic stability of inelastic bodies subject to stick-slip friction, (iv) global multiparameter Hopf bifurcation, (v) fluid-solid interactions, (vi) parametric resonance, (vi) attractors for problems with forcing, (vii) dynamics of incompressible elastic and viscoelastic rods,&lt;br/&gt;(viii) quasilinear hyperbolic problems from nonlinear elasticity, (ix) asymptotics of small inertia, (x) dissipative mechanisms, (xi) hysteresis, and (xii) control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S. S. Antman proposes to treat a variety of dynamical and steady-state nonlinear problems for a variety of solid bodies composed of a variety of materials. The governing theories, needed to describe accurately the behavior of bodies suffering large and rapid deformations, possibly under&lt;br/&gt;extremes of temperature and loading, present severe mathematical challenges and have seldom been analyzed. The research is to encompass (a) the development of physical theory, (b) the development of mathematical theory capable of handling the governing equations, (c) contribution to the development of numerical methods, and (d) the treatment of specific problems and classes of problems. Examples of the latter include: (i) Large buckling (collapse) of shells under high&lt;br/&gt;pressure. (ii) Dynamic instability of deformable structures under nonconservative loads. (Such loads may be induced by rotations, by contact with moving fluids, or feedback.) (iii) Stability of structures subject to periodic forcing. (iv) Fluid-structure interactions, e.g., like that of a propeller or panel of a ship or a helicopter in contact with a moving fluid and undergoing large and possibly destructive oscillations. (v) Fluid-solid interactions in physiology, such as blood flowing in an artery. (vi) Large motions of rigid bodies joined by deformable bodies (like space vehicles joined by a tether). (vi) The analysis of problems of electromagnetic solid mechanics with applications to the use of smart materials to control the response of vibrating solids, e.g., to bring a vibrating part of a submarine or space vehicle to rest in a short time.</AbstractNarration>
