    <AbstractNarration>The River Project provides an opportunity for high school students in Manhattan, New York, to become directly involved in the study of urban wildlife, habitats and water quality. Each year 50 students will participate in an internship for up to100 hours under the supervision of professional scientists and graduate students. Previous projects have included fish occurrence and distribution, inventory and monitoring, uptake route of pollutants in tomcod, water quality monitoring, etc. Students learn techniques for observation, recording, manipulating and analyzing data, species identification and field methods. Students are trained to use scientific instrumentation and laboratory equipment, including computers for data analysis and presentations. Participants are also trained to conduct interpretive tours of the Estuarium and interact with the public while describing the facility and research in which they are involved. At the conclusion of this three-year project, 150 students from Manhattan will have participated in this program.</AbstractNarration>
