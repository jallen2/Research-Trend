    <AbstractNarration>The University of Kentucky will provide engineering and computational equipment support to the AMPATH Project's First International Conference in Valdivia, Chile, April 10-12, 2002. The main objective of the conference is to create an environment for AMPATH participants in Latin America, potential participants and those with a regional, hemispheric or international interest in the project to exchange ideas, form new partnerships and solidify existing collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Kentucky had agreed to lend AMPATH the technology required for this conference to be accessible via the Access grid. The Grid node will be connected to the REUNA network, and through this connection, to the UCAID Abilene network. Interested participants worldwide, who are unable to attend personally, will be able to monitor the conference from their own sites, using the Access grid connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference support offered by UK includes shipping of the portable Access grid node, sending engineering staff to set up and maintain the equipment, as well ad international airfare, meals and lodging for the UK and AMPATH engineers, and the cost of the network connection to the Abilene backbone. In addition, the University of Kentucky will receive technology support from the University of Illinois at Chicago, which will send equipment for its AGAVE (Access Grid Augmented Virtual Environment) system and an engineer to maintain this equipment. The AGAVE system will connect to the Access Grid using the University of Kentucky's node.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will continue the exploration of connectivity of research and education networks between USA and South America.</AbstractNarration>
