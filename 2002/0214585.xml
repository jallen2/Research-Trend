    <AbstractNarration>Drew&lt;br/&gt;0214585&lt;br/&gt; The investigator derives and studies mathematical models for&lt;br/&gt;several different processes involved with cell division, focusing&lt;br/&gt;on E. coli cells because of the wealth of data available. A&lt;br/&gt;mature cell replicates its DNA. The daughter DNA strands must&lt;br/&gt;move into the halves of the mature cell, and finally, the cell&lt;br/&gt;divides. The relative timing of these events is crucial for the&lt;br/&gt;division into viable daughter cells, and placement of the septum&lt;br/&gt;must divide the cell and its DNA into relatively equal halves.&lt;br/&gt;Once replication begins,the cell then must become unable to start&lt;br/&gt;replication again until the cell is sufficiently mature.&lt;br/&gt;Sequestration is responsible for this eclipse period, where the&lt;br/&gt;new DNA strand binds to sites in the membrane, thereby blocking&lt;br/&gt;the oriC site and dnaA transcription regulation site, keeping the&lt;br/&gt;replication initiation from occurring too soon. This process of&lt;br/&gt;sequestration and de-sequestration is therefore (at least&lt;br/&gt;partially) responsible for the timing of cell division events.&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical model predicts the probability of each of the&lt;br/&gt;sequestration sites being sequestered, as a function of time. The&lt;br/&gt;replicated DNA strands are moved apart in the longitudinal&lt;br/&gt;direction (towards the cell poles) in order to assure exactly one&lt;br/&gt;set of chromosomes in each daughter cell. The process by which&lt;br/&gt;this occurs is unknown, but the timing of this event is crucial&lt;br/&gt;to viability. The project studies viable models for this&lt;br/&gt;seqregation. The site for septation is marked by formation of a&lt;br/&gt;Z-ring at the center of the rod-shaped cell, halfway between the&lt;br/&gt;poles. This Z-ring is involved in causing the cell to form a&lt;br/&gt;septum between the daughter halves. Placement of the Z-ring at&lt;br/&gt;the center is a result of the cooperative actions of three&lt;br/&gt;proteins from the min locus of the DNA. Three proteins behave in&lt;br/&gt;an oscillatory manner, with MinD alternately forming a layer on&lt;br/&gt;the cell membrane near one pole, then disassembling and&lt;br/&gt;re-forming at the other pole. The investigator studies a model&lt;br/&gt;for the dynamics of the Min system.&lt;br/&gt; The investigaor develops mathematical models to improve the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the biology of cell division in E. coli. The&lt;br/&gt;basic philosophy is to determine mechanisms that can describe&lt;br/&gt;observed events, and to evaluate whether these mechanisms can&lt;br/&gt;operate for reasonable parameter values, that is, whether the&lt;br/&gt;kinetic rates, diffusivities, and concentrations are within&lt;br/&gt;reasonable ranges of observed values. Location and timing of&lt;br/&gt;cellular events is an important aspect of molecular biology.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, mathematical models that incorporate intracellular&lt;br/&gt;transport and reactions, including reactions with organelles,&lt;br/&gt;should prove to be of general applicability to cellular biology.&lt;br/&gt;Such models can focus biological research on aspects of molecular&lt;br/&gt;dynamics that otherwise seem unconnected.</AbstractNarration>
