    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230646&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Saltzman, William&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Yale University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Enhancement of the Undergraduate Biomedical Engineering Curriculum at Yale University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will reformulate the biomedical engineering undergraduate curriculum at Yale by emphasizing a) faculty involvement with students at all levels throughout the 4 year B.S. program; b) integration of presentation of knowledge through laboratory, lecture, and electronic media; and c) definition of selected areas of emphasis that represent strengths of the Yale research faculty and areas of industrial importance. We propose a core curriculum that presents the core science of BME as well as specialized tracks that provide advanced training in our areas of emphasis: biomedical imaging, biomechanics, and biomolecular engineering. We will implement this proposal in two phases. During the 12-month planning phase, we will offer two new courses (one each at the freshman and senior-levels) and implement new junior-level laboratory modules that incorporate concepts from molecular and cellular biology. We will also explore new concepts and develop a coordinated plan for the second phase, beyond the 12-month planning period, which will include reformulation of the core BME courses and the addition of new advanced level electives in our areas of emphasis.</AbstractNarration>
