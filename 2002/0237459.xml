    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Oregon State University under the direction of Dr. A. Liston. This grant will allow the Oregon State University Herbarium to complete the databasing and georeferencing of its estimated 156,500 fern, gymnosperm, and flowering plant specimens collected in Oregon. With 3900 vascular plant species, the Oregon flora represents approximately 20% of the plant species found in the United States. The OSU Herbarium is the principal institution devoted to the documentation and study of Oregon's diverse flora. The OSU Herbarium collection encompasses 125 years and the entire state, providing comprehensive chronological, taxonomic and geographic coverage of Oregon plants. Data sharing with local, state, regional, and national efforts will be facilitated by a complete database of Oregon vascular plant specimens. The specimen database is used in a wide range of applications, including 1) the taxonomic study of the North American and Oregon floras; 2) documenting the occurrence and status of rare and endangered plants; and 3) documenting the distribution and spread of invasive plants. &lt;br/&gt;For each specimen, complete label data will be captured, providing taxonomic, locality, habitat, and collecting information. Each locality will be provided with latitude and longitude, allowing voucher-based mapping of all Oregon vascular plants. The specimen database and maps will be readily accessible via the internet. The OSU Herbarium specimen database will be useful to the management of plant diversity on federal, state, and private lands. Nearly 60% of Oregon's land is federally owned. US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and other resource managers throughout the state rely on plant taxonomic and distribution data provided by the OSU Herbarium. The specimen database and online maps will greatly enhance the accessibility of this information. Citizens and educators at all levels are interested in the plant diversity of Oregon, but most do not have access to the resources of the herbarium. The accessibility of label information and distribution maps will provide new opportunities for the general public, educators, and their students to increase their knowledge of Oregon's plants. Approximately 16 undergraduate students will be employed in curatorial, data entry, and georeferencing tasks associated with the project. These students will gain experience in collections procedures, specimen curation, and data entry. The OSU Herbarium is used by 10 courses taught in the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology. The specimen database will enhance and provide new opportunities for students enrolled in these courses.</AbstractNarration>
