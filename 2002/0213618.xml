    <AbstractNarration>The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Stanford University supports an interdisciplinary program in the area of polymeric materials. The Center is entitled "Center on Polymer Interfaces and Macromolecular Assemblies". The MRSEC is a partnership between Stanford University, UC Davis, UC Berkeley and the IBM Almaden Research Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is organized into three interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). Synthesis and Application of Nanostructured Materials (IRG 1) has as its mission to develop new methods to prepare functional macromolecules followed by self- and directed assembly of these molecules into nanoscopic structures. Potential applications are in nanotemplating, photovoltaic devices and novel catalytic systems. The techniques and materials developed in IRG1 have direct applications for single molecule studies in IRG 2 and polymer bilayer assemblies in IRG 3. Structure and Dynamics of Confined Systems (IRG 2) is concerned with the effect of confinement due to interfaces, entanglements, branching etc, on the structure and dynamics of molecules and macromolecular assemblies. IRG 3 on Functional Biomolecular Membranes investigates the fabrication of the interfaces between lipid membrane-countering surfaces and biological systems and the study of the dynamical properties of these interfaces. The ultimate goal of the IRG is to develop interfaces between hard and soft (functional) surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center support undergraduate summer research activities in academic and industrial settings as well as in science museum projects. Plans are to increase the participation of physically disabled students. The REU activities will be extended to UC Berkeley and to the Institute of Polymers in Dresden, Germany. The K-12 programs for teachers and students includes partnerships with area schools in collaboration with the East Palo Alto Unified School District. New activities are planned together with the San Francisco Exploratorium and its Teacher Institute. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center operates shared facilities at Stanford and UC Davis. These are accessible by CPIMA members as well as non-members. In addition, CPIMA members have access to a wide range of facilities at the IMB Almaden Research Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's participants include 26 faculty, 8 postdoctoral associates, 7 graduate students, and support for undergraduates and K-12 teachers. Professor Curtis W. Frank directs the MRSEC.</AbstractNarration>
