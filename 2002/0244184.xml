    <AbstractNarration>The Rice University Summer Institute of Statistics (RUSIS) will train and mentor 12 selected junior and senior underrepresented minority students, and students with no easy access to a career experience at their institution. The underlying motivation for the Institute is the fundamental interest in attracting more underrepresented minority students into graduate work in the Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, and facilitating their transition into research work. These objectives will be accomplished through the following mechanisms:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Intensive core courses in probability, stochastic processes, and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest. (e.g. multiple comparisons, extreme value theory, multivariate survival analysis, statistical genetics, and massive data methodologies). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Engaging the students in research projects under close collaboration with faculty mentors, with the goal of producing joint publications. Students will be mentored in the preparation of their work for presentation in national meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Short courses on the use of Unix platforms, latex, and software to be utilized for research purposes such as Mathematica and Splus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Visits to scientific facilities (e.g., Biomathematics and Biostatistics Departments at MD Anderson Cancer Center, NASA, Shell Oil) will be organized, and a series of lectures, by a variety of scientists, which are part of an AGEP funded program, will be attended. These lectures cover a variety of topics ranging from applying to Graduate School to career experiences by outstanding scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Evaluation and monitoring of the progress of students for seven years (expected time for them to finish graduate school) after their participation; annual evaluation of the program by the participating students and an external advisory committee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RUSIS is a 10-week summer program. Students with a mathematical background that includes three semesters of calculus, and one semester of linear algebra or matrix analysis, should contact the PI Javier Rojo (email: jrojo@rice.edu 713-348-2797) or Theresa Chatman (tlc@rice.edu 713-348-5180).</AbstractNarration>
