    <AbstractNarration>The ITR: Flathead Reservation Wireless Community Network at Salish Kootenai College would examine, explore, and adjust how people utilize wireless communications technology on this rural reservation to interface more effectively from remote locations. This project will facilitate changes in educational and business organizational processes in fixed wireless telecommuting through various wireless networking technologies. In addition, this project will also greatly enhance numerous programs and research projects both on campus and with other organizations throughout the reservation. Other activities that will be implemented are technologies and services that assist in teaching, training and the expansion of innovative educational environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is threefold. First, to see how far you can push wireless technology in a rural and remote environment to provide high-speed network connections. Second, to radically change the way certain educational and business organizational processes are carried out. Third, enhance peoples' experiences with information technology through a variety of wireless activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the first 6 months of the project, a single high-speed wireless link will be deployed to provide service to a selected part of the reservation. The second 6 months will focus on conducting the initial research activities, review of any results. The third &lt;br/&gt;6 months will be devoted to making adjustments and modifications to ongoing research activities, and the addition of another high-speed link. The final 6 months will be focused on making the transition to a fully self-sufficient, community-owned network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flathead Reservation Wireless Community Network will be collaborating with other tribal entities on conducting research test connections to examine the usefulness and how people respond to high-speed wireless network connections. Over the course of the project, various wireless networking technologies will be employed as they become available to test the reliability, functionality and practicality of each. Also, this project will collaborate with other NSF-sponsored projects with a wireless component and/or focus.</AbstractNarration>
