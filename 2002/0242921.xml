    <AbstractNarration>0242921&lt;br/&gt;Murad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a cooperative project in chemical engineering entitled the US-India Cooperative Research: Phase Transitions in Confined Aqueous Environments. US PI Sohail Murad, University of Illinois Chicago and K.G. Ayappa, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore will study the structure, phase behavior and dynamics of water as a function of varying concentrations of dissolved ions when water is present as an inhomogeneous fluid. The overall objective of this research is to advance the state-of-the-art understanding of fluids confined by impermeable and semi-permeable membranes. The improved understanding of such systems can result in more efficient processes for enhanced oil recovery, for water purification by reverse osmosis, and could provide better heterogeneous catalysts. These processes have important technological, environmental and societal consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out jointly by research teams at the University of Illinois, Chicago and at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. A key objective of this project is to expose American students to the Indian research and academic environment. With the important role that India is expected to play in the coming decades, this will be an invaluable experience for students entering an increasingly global marketplace. &lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly supported by the Office of International Science &amp; Engineering and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0242921&lt;br/&gt;Murad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a cooperative project in chemical engineering entitled the US-India Cooperative Research: Phase Transitions in Confined Aqueous Environments.
