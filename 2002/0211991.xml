    <AbstractNarration>The investigators organize an international conference on&lt;br/&gt;mathematics in biology. The theme of the conference is&lt;br/&gt;"Interdisciplinary Connections and Living Systems." The goals of&lt;br/&gt;the meeting are to highlight current top-level research, to&lt;br/&gt;provide a perspective on future research areas, to provide&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for career development to junior researchers, and&lt;br/&gt;to foster interactions between established researchers and junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers. The conference is linked with a short course on the&lt;br/&gt;mathematics of biological complexity designed for biologists, in&lt;br/&gt;order to provide opportunities as well for new collaborations to&lt;br/&gt;develop between empirical researchers and theoreticians.&lt;br/&gt; Quantitative approaches are becoming central to all&lt;br/&gt;components of research in the life sciences. With the rapid&lt;br/&gt;expansion of bioinformatics, computational biology, and&lt;br/&gt;proteomics, the underlying mathematical approaches that are&lt;br/&gt;essential to these fields are recognized as critical to further&lt;br/&gt;developments. Applications of mathematics to many areas that&lt;br/&gt;directly affect humans allows us to better evaluate the impacts&lt;br/&gt;of alternative management of natural systems, develop new&lt;br/&gt;techniques useful in biotechnology, and design more appropriate&lt;br/&gt;responses to health problems. The rapid developments in these&lt;br/&gt;areas require opportunities in particular for young researchers&lt;br/&gt;to gain perspective on the broad range of subjects that now&lt;br/&gt;define mathematical biology. The conference provides a method to&lt;br/&gt;carry this out as well as allowing younger researchers to&lt;br/&gt;participate in a formal mentoring program designed to enhance&lt;br/&gt;their ability to pursue a successful scientific career.</AbstractNarration>
