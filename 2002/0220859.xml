    <AbstractNarration>This project is establishing a CSEMS Scholars Program for academically talented, low-income undergraduate students in the fields of computer science, engineering, and mathematics. The intent is to encourage such students to enroll in these disciplines, and then to provide them with a comprehensive plan of scholarship, academic, and professional support throughout their undergraduate years, to improve their retention and graduation rates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In engineering at UC Riverside, much of the attrition occurs in the first two years. Family financial pressure and the subsequent need for students to work part-time are seen as primary contributing factors in this attrition. Thus, the core of the UCR CSEMS program is scholarship assistance to the targeted student cohorts. Twenty $2,500 freshman scholarships and twenty $2,500 sophomore/transfer student scholarships are awarded annually for each of four years, to academically talented but economically disadvantaged undergraduates majoring in the named fields. The primary goal of the program is to demonstrate that reduction of financial concern on the part of the students can result in a significant improvement in their retention statistics, and thereby their graduation rates. Only the freshman, sophomore, and transfer students who have been selected as CSEMS Scholars receive scholarships. However, the project intends to continue financial support to these students through junior/senior year summer internships at companies, or undergraduate research positions with faculty members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the financial component, this program is accompanied by an extensive support infrastructure of academic assistance and advising, career placement services, and faculty and professional mentoring throughout the students' academic years. During the annual recruitment activities of the College, the College of Engineering distributes brochures and provides other information that explains the CSEMS Scholars Program to potential UCR applicants. Selection of program participants is made by an Oversight Committee that includes faculty members as well as staff members from the campus Financial Aid Office and the offices of other support services. The Oversight Committee is responsible for general supervision of the program. Day-to-day operations, however, including student tracking and data analysis, is administered by the College Office of Special Programs with the active collaboration of the College Office of Student Affairs. Students receiving the NSF scholarship support are designated as UCR-COE/NSF Scholars. As they continue into the later phases of the program, they are designated as UCR- COE/Advanced Scholars. Together, the group is referred to as the UCR-COE Scholars.</AbstractNarration>
