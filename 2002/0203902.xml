    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0203902&lt;br/&gt;William J. Floyd&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an attempt to resolve the hyperbolic case of&lt;br/&gt;Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture. Specifically, the goal is to&lt;br/&gt;resolve the conjecture that a Gromov-hyperbolic group with space at&lt;br/&gt;infinity a 2-sphere has a cocompact, properly discontinuous action on&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic 3-space. The investigator and his collaborators are&lt;br/&gt;approaching the conjecture from the point of view of proving&lt;br/&gt;conformality of certain recursive sequences of tilings on the space&lt;br/&gt;at infinity of a Gromov-hyperbolic group. Previous work has indicated&lt;br/&gt;that conformality of a recursive sequence of tilings might follow&lt;br/&gt;from finding an invariant conformal structure for a branched surface&lt;br/&gt;associated to the recursive structure. This possibility arose from a&lt;br/&gt;connection between the recursive structures and rational maps, and&lt;br/&gt;Thurston's classification theorem for critically finite branched maps&lt;br/&gt;of the 2-sphere gives insight into how the theory might develop.&lt;br/&gt;Multiple approaches are planned for finding an invariant conformal&lt;br/&gt;structure. Further work is also planned on twisted face-pairing&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds. Much of the basic theory of twisted face pairings has&lt;br/&gt;been completed, but some questions remain which are central to&lt;br/&gt;further developments of the theory. Significant progress here could&lt;br/&gt;help the main part of the project, since twisted face pairings are a&lt;br/&gt;good source of test examples for the conjecture stated above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The immediate focus of this proposal is on sequences of planar&lt;br/&gt;tilings. Given an initial tiling and a combinatorial rule for&lt;br/&gt;subdivision, one recursively obtains a sequence of subdivisions of&lt;br/&gt;the initial tiling. The goal is to understand when these combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;subdivisions can be realized geometrically so that the tiles stay&lt;br/&gt;"almost round" at all stages of the sequence. This problem is&lt;br/&gt;interesting in its own right, but it is being studied here as part of&lt;br/&gt;a deeper problem. It is a key feature of a program of the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his collaborators to resolve the hyperbolic case of&lt;br/&gt;William P. Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture. The Geometrization&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, which is the central outstanding problem in&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional topology (it includes the Poincare conjecture as a&lt;br/&gt;special case), states that every compact 3-manifold can be naturally&lt;br/&gt;subdivided into geometric pieces. The techniques being developed for&lt;br/&gt;approaching this have potential applications in other disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
