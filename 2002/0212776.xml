    <AbstractNarration>0212776&lt;br/&gt;Matter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines the effects of dispersal on the population dynamics of the alpine butterfly, Parnassius smintheus. Within a network of 17 populations of the butterfly, two populations were removed. Based on previous data, populations near the removals are predicted to receive fewer immigrants (a 2% to 56% reduction in immigration), while more distant populations should be unaffected. If immigration is an important component of population size and persistence, populations near the removals should have reduced population sizes and an increased risk of extinction in comparison to more distant populations. Mark-recapture methods will be used to examine dispersal and population size. Experimental methods will lead to unambiguous conclusions regarding the role of dispersal for the population dynamics of this species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and natural heterogeneity, many species exist as networks of small, potentially extinction-prone populations. In such situations dispersal can be particularly important. Immigrants arriving to populations may bolster population size, preventing extinction. In cases where extinction has occurred, immigrants may act as colonists. Understanding the effects of dispersal is crucial for the management of these threatened species. This research will address the role of dispersal for one species that can serve as a model for threatened species. This RUI research project will train and support many undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
