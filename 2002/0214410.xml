    <AbstractNarration>In recent years, air traffic delays have become prevalent and are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude. This research will examine three principal issues: 1) What are the economic underpinnings of air traffic congestion? 2) Why do airlines choose not to adapt their schedules to fully account for predictable congestion? 3) What is the impact of expected travel time and scheduled travel time on fares? Since air traffic congestion is the proximate cause of longer travel times, the research begins by investigating its determinants. Two factors are possibly involved. One is the hub and spoke system used by most major carriers. Hubs enable passengers to connect to many destinations, creating network benefits that increase in the number of markets served from the hub. Congestion occurs when hub airlines bunch flights together in a short time period at hub airports, accepting longer average travel times in order to serve more cities and have shorter scheduled connections. The second factor in congestion is that airlines may not fully account for the fact that adding their own flights will lead to increased delays for other air carriers. Thus all airlines will have "too many" flights relative to what is socially optimal. Next, the project examines four reasons as to why airlines do not fully adjust their schedules for predictable increases in travel time, especially at hub airports, where hub airlines have especially poor on-time performance: i) competition with other carriers to report the shortest scheduled travel time may encourage obfuscation about accurate arrival times; ii) the uncertain nature of aircraft arrival times, combined with the constraint that an airline cannot schedule a departure until after the aircraft has been scheduled to arrive, makes it costly for an airline to add a large layover on the ground to buffer against delays; iii) hub airlines face additional incentives to have departure delays given that the hub carrier wants to retain the option to have flights that arrive earlier also depart earlier; iv) required minimum connection times at hubs encourage airlines to choose unrealistic schedules. The last stage of the research will examine how public policy could best address air traffic delays. This analysis will involve using fare data to determine how consumers value avoiding delays and the extent to which airlines are correctly taking the cost to consumers of delays into account when setting their schedules.&lt;br/&gt; This research will help design improved government policies with regard to air travel. The US Government can choose to tax additional flights and/or improve the transportation infrastructure. The results will help develop a tax that reduces inefficient congestion caused by airlines over-scheduling airports with fixed runway capacity while not discouraging the network benefits from operating a hub. At many airports, an ideal congestion tax might have a small impact on air traffic congestion since hub carriers may already internalize most of the costs of hubbing through a high local market share. Also, a careful examination of airline pricing and scheduling patterns allows for a more complete understanding of how competition affects the quality of private information and the economic value of consumer time. Such estimates provide a crucial, but often crudely estimated input in determining the optimal public investment in costly technology and infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
