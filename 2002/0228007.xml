    <AbstractNarration>University of Maryland College Park will study the experience of S&amp;E-trained women in the chemical industry. There are three areas of study: Contextual Patterns, Individual Experiences, and Effective Interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Issues:&lt;br/&gt;* What contextual patterns and influences exist with respect to the role of S&amp;E-trained women in the chemical industry?&lt;br/&gt;* What have been the individual experiences of S&amp;E-trained women in the chemical industry, and what vocationally-inhibitory and -facilitative factors can be identified from their reports?&lt;br/&gt;* What formal and informal strategies currently are being used to increase S&amp;E-trained&lt;br/&gt;women's participation in the chemical industry, and how effective are they?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contextual Patterns will be assessed through quantitative investigation of organizational patterns of women's participation in chemical business and industry in the U.S. over time. This will include identifying a national, representative sample of chemical businesses, gaining access to archival and current organizational data on male and female employment patterns, and administering an organizational survey to management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual Experiences will be assessed through both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) investigation. A survey will be administered to a large, national, representative sample of women in chemical business and industry to assess their self-reported experiences in occupational preparation, entry, and advancement. A representative sub-sample of these participants (diverse in race/ethnicity, age, work setting, S&amp;E sub-field, and education) will be interviewed to explore more specifically the variables that have inhibited or facilitated their career trajectories in the chemical industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective Interventions will be assessed through both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interview) investigation, as well as literature review. The quantitative portions of Studies 1 and 2 and the qualitative portion of Study 2 will include assessment of formal and informal strategies currently used by companies to increase women's participation; interviews also will be conducted with a sub-sample of management personnel from Study 1 regarding their perceptions of intervention strategies, to compare to the responses from individual women. These data will be combined with a literature review to identify best practices interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science and engineering (S&amp;E) fields are considered crucial to U.S. economic growth and are expanding rapidly. Demographic trends indicate that women and minorities represent the greatest increases in workforce participation; however, the continued under-representation of women (including minority women) in S&amp;E fields is well documented. Much of the attention to women's relative absence from S&amp;E fields has focused on women in academe, and very little is known about women in other S&amp;E settings. Industry is the largest employer of S&amp;E workers, but women are less likely than men to be employed in the industrial sector. Data regarding why women fail to enter industrial settings in predictable numbers and what happens to them there are virtually non-existent. Moreover, very little is known about the prevalence or effectiveness of strategies currently being used to address the paucity of women in industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the study include:&lt;br/&gt;* Providing a model for the study of demographic diversity in one industry&lt;br/&gt;* Identification of "best practices" interventions to enhance the careers of women in S&amp;E business and industry.&lt;br/&gt;* Training of graduate and undergraduate students in research methods of the social sciences.</AbstractNarration>
