    <AbstractNarration>Growing pressure to collect information on the Internet has created a need for&lt;br/&gt;more sophisticated ways to characterize privacy rights and balance them against&lt;br/&gt;legitimate commercial and law enforcement objectives. A wide range of businesses&lt;br/&gt;now rely on their ability to collect information about online customers as a&lt;br/&gt;foundation of their added value in the market place. The use or potential use of&lt;br/&gt;the Internet for purposes such as child pornography and planning of hate crimes&lt;br/&gt;and terrorism have heighted interest in (and loosened regulations on) network&lt;br/&gt;monitoring. Theft of intellectual property has led to the development of&lt;br/&gt;numerous protection mechanisms; these often involve registrations and involuntary&lt;br/&gt;monitoring of various kinds. In order to make security easier (and explore a&lt;br/&gt;lucrative business model), a number of companies seek to act as third-party&lt;br/&gt;caretakers of private information such as keys, authentication secrets, and&lt;br/&gt;credit card numbers. Arrayed against these trends are many citizens incensed by&lt;br/&gt;aggressive means used to collect information from them and a variety of groups&lt;br/&gt;that champion privacy rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been many advances in technologies both to aid information gathering&lt;br/&gt;and limit it. One important trend is toward more advanced systems for creating&lt;br/&gt;and managing digital credentials and authorization databases. In current&lt;br/&gt;practice credentials are sometimes `pushed' (like presenting a ticket to get into&lt;br/&gt;a movie theater) sometimes `pulled' (like getting access to an airplane seat with&lt;br/&gt;a `paperless' ticket) and sometimes both (like making a purchase at a store with&lt;br/&gt;a credit card whose validity is confirmed online). These approaches have&lt;br/&gt;Internet-based analogs, and technical advances have increased the range of&lt;br/&gt;options considerably in recent years. For example, work on public key systems&lt;br/&gt;has advanced techniques for delegation based on chains of `pushed' credentials&lt;br/&gt;and increased the automation of credential collection. Another important trend&lt;br/&gt;is toward more advanced systems for protecting privacy using anonymizing&lt;br/&gt;techniques. Tools such as onion routers and anonymous web publication servers&lt;br/&gt;provide some support but other techniques directly aid fine-grained mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;for obtaining privileges without exposing information unnecessarily. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work aims to develop formal support for characterizing privacy in the&lt;br/&gt;context of these advances. Efforts to improve access control systems and&lt;br/&gt;credential distribution have paid little attention to privacy mechanisms so far,&lt;br/&gt;resulting in systems that are good at propagating credentials reliably, but not&lt;br/&gt;tuned to do so within well-understood privacy constraints. This collaboration&lt;br/&gt;will build on our work in credential distribution and anonymity to create an&lt;br/&gt;integrated architecture and protocols to provide advanced access control within&lt;br/&gt;the limitations of privacy constraints.</AbstractNarration>
