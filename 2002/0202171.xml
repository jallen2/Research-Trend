    <AbstractNarration>2. Project Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this age of accelerated technological advances, increasing career specialization and extremely competitive job opportunities, society has a vested interest in promoting graduate and professional education as never before. The need for specialized knowledge and the acquisition of professional credentials place increasingly high demands on all college graduates, yet documented evidence shows that there exists a disparity in the opportunities for certain populations to gain access to programs conferring advanced degrees in science, mathematics and engineering (SME). Member institutions in the alliance spearheaded by Syracuse University with the collaboration of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Cornell University, and Puerto Rico-Mayaguez called the Central New York to Puerto Rico-Mayagilez (CNY-PR) are prepared to confront the challenge of making graduate study more available to reportedly underrepresented populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CNY-PR alliance is based on mutual commitment to research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, faculty development programs in an environment where recruitment, retention and mentoring are essential. The CNY-PR alliance brings valuable experience and resources for the enhancement of minority graduate education that will contribute to the diversification of the professoriate. The CNY-PR alliance goal is to use holistic approaches to substantially increase minority SME Ph.D. degree recipients entering academic positions. The CNY-PR alliance proposes the following objectives to achieve its goals:&lt;br/&gt;0 Provide inter-institutional engaging research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students&lt;br/&gt;0 Review and recommend innovative measures and guidelines for graduate admission criteria 0 Aggressively recruit and retain excellent minority students to ' the alliance institutions&lt;br/&gt;Provide multi-year funding package for accepted minority graduate students&lt;br/&gt;Expand professoriate and mentor training programs to alliance institutions&lt;br/&gt;Develop and implement continuous assessment tools to evaluate the alliance's objectives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each component of the program builds on the previous, creating a corridor the student moves through that motivates, guides, and supports from K-12 to Ph.D. to a successful career in academia or industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alliance institutions are excited about this program, and have begun laying the groundwork. External funding from industry is already being sought to ensure the continuous &lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>
