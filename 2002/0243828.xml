    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0243828 Date: 1-03-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Stewart Institution: Hope College &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Hope College for the summers of 2003-2006. The site director is Joanne L. Stewart. Ten students and twelve faculty research mentors will participate in a ten/eleven week program. Half of the students will be recruited from Hope College and half from other colleges and universities. The proposed research projects cover a broad range of both chemistry and biochemistry topics. The program will develop professional skills, especially oral and written communication skills, through seminars, reports, and presentation of a poster at an end-of-summer research symposium. Evaluation of the program will be conducted by the chemistry department as well as by participation in a larger outside evaluation program involving several undergraduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>
