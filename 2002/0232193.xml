    <AbstractNarration>The awardee will construct and deploy two eight-panel radars as the next step in the continuing engineering development of the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR). These radars will use production-level hardware, as opposed to the engineering prototype subassemblies constructed for earlier development efforts. The proposed deployment locations in Gakona, Alaska and Jicamarca, Peru will allow testing the radar hardware in actual operating conditions, using realistic pulse patterns and data acquisition algorithms. The locations were chosen because they each provide coherent scatter targets of scientific interest and with anticipated return strengths that should be readily detectable by the smaller radars. The two locations are also ideal in that they represent two very different environmental conditions, providing a good test of system integrity. Furthermore, they both have sufficient local infrastructure to keep the deployment costs reasonable. This project will help reduce risk and enhance capability for future construction and deployment of incoherent scatter radars based on the AMISR design.</AbstractNarration>
