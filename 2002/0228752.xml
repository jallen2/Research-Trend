    <AbstractNarration>Zhang&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0228752&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas-driven volcanic eruptions are a major natural hazard. These eruptions are powered by the exsolution of H2O and other volatiles from magma. The process is complex, and understanding it requires quantification and modeling of a number of variables and processes, especially the diffusion of water. After many years of work, most of the fundamental data for high-silica rhyolite--a magma with 77 wt% silica--has been experimentally determined. However, there is a critical need for experimental studies of dacitic magmas, containing around 65 wt% silica and common to explosive eruptions such as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, and the 1991 eruption of Mount Unzen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this grant, water diffusion in dacitic melt and glass will be investigated using dehydration and diffusion couple experiments over a wide range of temperature, pressure, and H2O contents. Experiments will be performed in one-atmosphere furnaces, rapid-quench cold-seal pressure vessels, internally-heated pressure vessels, and a piston-cylinder apparatus. Hydrous species concentrations will be analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and diffusion profiles modeled using a nonlinear diffusion equation. The results will be used to model bubble growth and magma fragmentation in dacite.</AbstractNarration>
