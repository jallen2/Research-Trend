    <AbstractNarration>Most thrust fault traces are arcuate in nature and are comprised of a series of&lt;br/&gt;salients and recesses suggesting that thrust faults are, in general, non-planar. Such three-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional complexities in the thrust surface geometry may be an important factor&lt;br/&gt;controlling the thrust fault kinematics. Consider the analogy of glacial ice flowing over&lt;br/&gt;an irregular substrate. The major resistance to movement is not due to the friction&lt;br/&gt;between the two materials (which is greatly reduced by pressure-melt water that coats the&lt;br/&gt;surface) but due to the distortion of the ice as it flows past surface irregularities. Thrust&lt;br/&gt;sheets may behave in a similar manner. Fault rocks are considerably weaker than the&lt;br/&gt;host rock and, therefore, the continued deformation of such rocks may not be the factor in&lt;br/&gt;large-scale thrust sheet emplacement. The PI suggests that three-dimension irregularities in&lt;br/&gt;thrust surface geometry play a major role in thrust sheet kinematics. If this is the case,&lt;br/&gt;one should expect that the strain patterns observed along strike of a given thrust fault will&lt;br/&gt;reflect the thrust fault geometry. Preliminary studies have shown that both c-axes&lt;br/&gt;patterns and relict grain shapes vary along the strike of the fault most likely due to the&lt;br/&gt;fault geometry effects. Initial data suggest that deformation is nearly plane strain&lt;br/&gt;within a prominent salient; but along the margins of the salient there is a stronger&lt;br/&gt;component of flattening strains. However, further examination of the strains in this&lt;br/&gt;region are needed to truly resolve this pattern. Three-dimensional finite strain geometries&lt;br/&gt;have been determined in this region by measuring relict quartz grain shapes and&lt;br/&gt;examining quartz c-axes fabrics. Moreover, it may also be useful to measure final stage&lt;br/&gt;incremental strains by determining three-dimensional recrystallized quartz grain shapes&lt;br/&gt;and three-dimensional quartz overgrowth geometries. It is only through examining&lt;br/&gt;incremental strain histories that the PI can fully understand the kinematics of thrust faults.&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, current mechanical models do not take into account the existence of&lt;br/&gt;non-plane strains and therefore only predict realistic fold-thrust belt behavior to a first-&lt;br/&gt;order. In order to make more realistic models for the evolution of fold-and-thrust belts&lt;br/&gt;we must start to incorporate the non-plane strain elements of geometrically complex&lt;br/&gt;thrust faults.</AbstractNarration>
