    <AbstractNarration>In this proposed RUI research, we will apply our current research results supported by NSF&lt;br/&gt;to design efficient parallel algorithms and to develop software to reliable numerical solutions&lt;br/&gt;for both unconstrained and constrained multivariate global nonlinear optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve high reliability, even in the presence of uncertainty in the data, roundo error, and&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearities by finite digit computations, we apply interval arithmetic in this project. The basic&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to be used are interval branch-and-bound method and interval Newton/generalized&lt;br/&gt;bisection method.&lt;br/&gt;In designing parallel algorithm and developing portable software, we will take full advantages&lt;br/&gt;of parallel computing to significantly reduce not only elapsed computation time but also total&lt;br/&gt;amount of computation due to the spatial nature of the problem we address. To achieve high efficiency,&lt;br/&gt;we will balance workload dynamically among available processors through inter-processor&lt;br/&gt;communication. The software will be architecture independent. General sparsity and scalability&lt;br/&gt;will be considered as well. The research results, parallel software package, installation and user&lt;br/&gt;guides, and testing examples will be freely disseminated through the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
