    <AbstractNarration>The Center for Bibliographical Studies at the University of California, &lt;br/&gt;Riverside, is creating a union catalog of Latin American imprints to &lt;br/&gt;1851. Existing printed bibliographies are for the most part old and &lt;br/&gt;incomplete or non-existent. The Center has keyed all the extant &lt;br/&gt;bibliographies and catalogs it can identify that are within scope, &lt;br/&gt;producing some over 85,000 separate entries. Under this grant the keyed &lt;br/&gt;entries will be modifed to fit MARC standards, duplicate holdings &lt;br/&gt;eliminated and holdings records consolidated forming an initial data base &lt;br/&gt;of 60-70,000 records. Uniform library symbols will be created. The &lt;br/&gt;resulting file will be mounted in the Research Libraries Information &lt;br/&gt;Network for public access. The process of adding additional records from &lt;br/&gt;machine-readable files submitted by participating libraries in North and &lt;br/&gt;South America will begin, matching algorithms developed, and new holdings &lt;br/&gt;and records as well as citations to microfilm facsimiles added. Scholars &lt;br/&gt;will have access to a single source for identifying surviving imprints and &lt;br/&gt;where they can be found. The file itself will be searchable across all &lt;br/&gt;fields through Boolean searching. Libraries will be able to use the file &lt;br/&gt;for copy cataloging and obtaining machine-readable records of their &lt;br/&gt;holdings for loading into their online public catalogs.</AbstractNarration>
