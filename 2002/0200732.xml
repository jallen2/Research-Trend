    <AbstractNarration>PI: Maciej R. Zworski, UC-Berkeley. DMS-0200732&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main interest of the PI is the study of quantum mechanics from the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical point of view, and of its many manifestations in the theory&lt;br/&gt;of partial differential equations and geometry. Specific current interests are &lt;br/&gt;the classical/quantum correspondence, resonances, geometric scattering, and&lt;br/&gt;non-hermitian quantum mechanics. More precisely, the PI is interested in resonances, &lt;br/&gt;which are mathematical objects modeling states which have certain frequencies of &lt;br/&gt;oscillations (or rest energies) and rates of decay, such as unstable molecules or &lt;br/&gt;classical system responding to resonant forcing terms. Despite a long tradition and a &lt;br/&gt;lot of recent progress our understanding is still very limited. Current experimental&lt;br/&gt;and numerical advances provide new stimuli for our studies. Another interest of the PI is&lt;br/&gt;non-hermitian quantum mechanics, which deals with systems in which energy is not conserved.&lt;br/&gt;That is almost always present when we localize a part of a system and the global &lt;br/&gt;conservation of energy disapears. In a subtle way resonances already fall into this &lt;br/&gt;category of phenomena. The mathematical problems present here are the stability of &lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues and measuring the size of the resolvent of non-self-adjoint operators. &lt;br/&gt;That leads to the study of ``pseudospectra'' which is then related to &lt;br/&gt;many interesting phenomena in PDEs. Finally, the PI's interest involves mathematical &lt;br/&gt;scattering. It replaces spectral theory for problems on non-compact domains, and in physics &lt;br/&gt;almost all the data comes from scattering experiments. Many new things are constantly &lt;br/&gt;discovered now, ranging from scattering on locally symmetric spaces to problems&lt;br/&gt;related to conformal field theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the phenomena discussed in this proposal are in fact more general: for instance, &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic scattering can be used to model quantum scattering, and its understanding&lt;br/&gt;can benefit from the development of the classical/quantum correspondence.&lt;br/&gt;The PI's work focuses on the search for general mathematical principles,&lt;br/&gt;and the detailed study of specific examples is motivated by that.</AbstractNarration>
