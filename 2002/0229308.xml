    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project would provide for completing the development and the implementation of a two-week summer training institute for practicing evaluators at Howard University, Washington, D.C. beginning in Summer 2003. The goal of the Institute would be to provide intensive professional development for mid-level evaluators focusing on the impact of contextually relevant factors (ethnic group, language, culture, etc.) on the entire evaluation process, from design to data analysis to dissemination of results. The Institute would enhance participant knowledge of critical relevant issues in science and mathematics and their relationship to contextual factors in the learning process. Further the Institute would provide participants with the skills and methodology to conduct an evaluation within a cultural context. The goal is to create a new model of evaluator training based on the influence of contextual factors, which would increase participant awareness of and competency in educational evaluation, particularly in math and science programs. The goals would be accomplished through: (a) a series of instructional activities that include the analysis of on-going and completed evaluation projects, (b) discussions with nationally known practicing evaluators who utilize a contextually relevant approach in their work and, (c) the implementation of a real-time project using appropriate methodology by each participant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the planning grant an administrative team, instructional faculty and an external advisory committee have defined the participant group, are finalizing the curriculum and completing logistical arrangements (obtaining housing, course credit, etc.). The project evaluator is completing the development of the evaluation plan.</AbstractNarration>
