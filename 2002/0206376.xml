    <AbstractNarration>Parasites draw nutrition directly from their hosts and adversely affect them in&lt;br/&gt;many ways. Major workers in the ant species Pheidole dentata are susceptible to&lt;br/&gt;parasitism by the phorid fly Apocephalus feeneri. Parasitism by the phorid is fatal for&lt;br/&gt;the parasitized ant and previous work has shown that foraging majors will try to&lt;br/&gt;conceal themselves when phorids are detected. In spite of this attempt to avoid&lt;br/&gt;parasitism, a small percentage of majors are successfully parasitized by phorids. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this study is to examine changes of those parasitized majors by comparing&lt;br/&gt;their behavior to that of non-parasitized nestmates. Equal numbers of parasitized and&lt;br/&gt;non-parasitized majors will be marked in a colony and their behaviors observed using&lt;br/&gt;standard ethogram techniques for the duration of the phorid's larval development.&lt;br/&gt;Frequencies and sequences of behaviors in parasitized and non-parasitized majors&lt;br/&gt;will be compared. To highlight the effect of parasitism on the specialized defensive&lt;br/&gt;response of P. dentata, parasitized majors will be exposed to fire ants in the genus&lt;br/&gt;Solenopsis. The outcome of these experiments will affect future ecological studies&lt;br/&gt;with P. dentata and potentially bio-control efforts in other ant-phorid systems.</AbstractNarration>
