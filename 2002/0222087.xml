    <AbstractNarration>The project is aimed at understanding the causes of population dynamics in two &lt;br/&gt;species of reef fish at the meso-scale (over areas tens of km in extent). Most reef fishes, and &lt;br/&gt;other benthic marine species, have a complex life cycle that includes a site-attached adult phase &lt;br/&gt;and a larval stage during which individuals may disperse long distances across open ocean. &lt;br/&gt;Much debate has centered on whether benthic population dynamics are controlled by the influx &lt;br/&gt;of pelagic larvae (larval settlement) or by density-dependent interactions among juveniles and &lt;br/&gt;adults in the benthic habitat. Past controversy, based on the notion that density-dependence is &lt;br/&gt;not compatible with a strong larval-input signal, has been resolved following recognition that &lt;br/&gt;both pre- and post-settlement processes influence the dynamics of most populations. One &lt;br/&gt;broadly applicable hypothesis (the recruit-adult hypothesis) predicts that oceanographic &lt;br/&gt;processes controlling the influx of larvae create predictable differences among populations at the &lt;br/&gt;meso-scale: sites with high settlement are chronically resource limited, whereas sites with low &lt;br/&gt;settlement rarely reach their carrying capacity and adult densities track larval influx. The &lt;br/&gt;carrying capacity of the benthic habitat, and the post-settlement interactions within it, are &lt;br/&gt;assumed to be consistent among meso-scale sites. All experimental evidence on the nature of &lt;br/&gt;post-settlement interactions is, however, based on study at small spatial scales (a few m's in &lt;br/&gt;extent). Studies in other environments indicate that population dynamics can potentially vary &lt;br/&gt;with spatial scale, however, and a major challenge now is to test whether small-scale results in &lt;br/&gt;marine systems will extrapolate to larger spatial domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past small-scale experiments by these investigators on two reef fishes indicate that competition for shelter &lt;br/&gt;sites used as refuges from predation is the cause of small-scale density dependence in both &lt;br/&gt;species. The strength of density dependence, however, depends on the local availability of &lt;br/&gt;shelter, and is eliminated in habitat patches that provide abundant shelter. They hypothesize that, &lt;br/&gt;in addition to oceanographic processes causing differential settlement, the carrying capacity of &lt;br/&gt;the benthic habitat will also vary at the meso-scale and cause differences among populations in &lt;br/&gt;the strength of density-dependent mortality. In this system, the investigators suggest that carrying &lt;br/&gt;capacity is a function of shelter abundance. They will test experimentally for shelter limitation at &lt;br/&gt;the meso-scale. To complement the field work, a mathematical scaling model will be constructed to explicitly link local- and meso-scale populations. This model will include a functional description of shelter limitation at local scales and will be used to test specific hypotheses for the congruence (or lack of it) in population dynamics at local and meso-scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Testing the expanded version of the recruit-adult hypothesis will provide a rare &lt;br/&gt;experimental test of the causal interactions shaping population dynamics at large spatial scales. &lt;br/&gt;Meso-scale populations are little studied, but a deeper understanding of their dynamics is of &lt;br/&gt;practical importance because it at this scale that marine reserves are designated and at which &lt;br/&gt;most reef fisheries are managed. Support for the hypothesis that meso-scale carrying capacity &lt;br/&gt;depends on shelter provided by the reef would also have important implications for the effects on &lt;br/&gt;fishes of the ongoing habitat degradation on coral reefs.</AbstractNarration>
