    <AbstractNarration>States and communities increasingly are recognizing that universities' roles in research, innovation, faculty entrepreneurship, and workforce preparedness provide the critical foundation for successful tech-based economic development. Paradoxically, the fiscal crises confronting all but four states is forcing difficult decisions regarding funding for higher education and tech-based economic development. The State Science and Technology Institute (SSTI) sixth annual conference in Dearborn, MI will serve as a forum for nurturing stronger alliances between university and economic development officials during challenging financial times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The university track will allow participants to examine and strengthen higher education's contributions toward forging local, state, and regional economic vitality. The goals of this track are to (1) increase among technology-based economic development professionals recognition of and support for the important roles universities play in building technology-based economies; (2) attract more university leadership and research administrators to participate in the gathering, allowing the opportunity to foster stronger working relationships with their state, local and regional economic development partners; (3) provide a forum for universities to discuss shared challenges and issues in and examples of effective tools and techniques for increasing commercialization of university technology, building the research enterprise, encouraging faculty entrepreneurship, and preparing tomorrow's workers and leaders; and (5) promote interstate and intrastate cooperation toward common goals for research and economic development.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
