    <AbstractNarration>This research project examines the structure of the free aqueous interface, water surfaces in contact with hydrophobic layers, the aqueous interface in the presence of molecular ions and sulfur-containing adsorbates, as well as the interaction of biomolecular species at the oil/water interface. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Richmond and her collaborators at the University of Oregon are carrying out experimental and computational studies of these complex and important systems. Vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, is used to obtain structural and dynamic information about the liquid/liquid and liquid/vapor interface in these studies. The fundamental understanding obtained in these studies is of importance in a variety of chemical process, environmental, and biological contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Richmond is examining the structure and dynamics of aqueous interfaces. Vibrational spectroscopic information obtained using sum frequency generation and molecular dynamics simulations provide an understanding of these important interfaces. Results of this work are relevant to a broad range of environmental, chemical, and biological processes involving the water interface.</AbstractNarration>
