    <AbstractNarration>0228268&lt;br/&gt;McCullough&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a study to determine the feasibility of developing and employing a broad variety of indicators that will enable monitoring of project outputs and outcomes at the program level for the Partnerships for Innovation Program. The study will examine which types of project outputs and outcomes should be monitored; which specific indicators will be useful and valid for monitoring the program; and how to resolve whatever difficulties the awardees in the Partnerships for Innovation Program would face in regularly collecting and reporting the data. The study will develop and validate an array of quantitative and qualitative indicators needed for monitoring the full range of activities supported by the Partnerships for Innovation Program. The current awards will be analyzed to categorize its goals, progress, outcomes and impacts. Indicators will be developed to measure proximate outputs at the project level. A sample of the awards will be selected for interactive input to test the validity of the indicators as well as to obtain input of the investigators on potential methodologies to obtain the data. The sample will be selected by the range of activities in the award. Participation by the awardees will be on a voluntary basis.</AbstractNarration>
