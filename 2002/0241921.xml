    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0241921&lt;br/&gt;Paulraj, Arogyaswami&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space-time (multiple antenna) techniques offer a variety of leverages to improve wireless systems performance. These include diversity, spatial multiplexing and interference reduction. Wireless standards bodies are incorporating space-time techniques into new standards. However, many existing wireless systems such as GSM and IS-95 rely on a single transmit and receive antenna (SISO) and therefore cannot benefit from space-time technology. This proposal aims to develop a novel approach that brings many of the benefits of space-time technology to SISO wireless by introducing an intermediate node with multiple receive and multiple transmit antennas. We characterize a SISO link with an intermediate node as a SI(MM)SO link. In such links, there is also the possibility of a SISO link bypass to the SI(MM)SO link. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives are &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Characterizing Shannon channel capacity of SI(MM)SO channels with bypass. &lt;br/&gt;2. Space-time processing schemes at the intermediate node. &lt;br/&gt;3. Extensions of the SI(MM)SO idea to MIMO channels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While theoretical work is the primary goal of this proposal, experimental support is available and can help measure real SI(MM)SO channels.</AbstractNarration>
