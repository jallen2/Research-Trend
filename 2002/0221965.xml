    <AbstractNarration>In this collaborative project faculty at a number of institutions are working together to develop and implement information technological solutions aimed at enhancing the interoperability of both collections and services for the NSDL. A particular emphasis is on exploring the requirements for supporting "tightly federated" collections, that feature close adherence to particular metadata frameworks so as to enable federated search services to be built. In this collaborative effort a team from the University of California - Berkeley is working primarily on collection interoperability while a team from the University of Missouri - Columbia is focusing its efforts on enhancing the interoperability of services (see DUE 0127580).</AbstractNarration>
