    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a Quantum Intelligence System (QIS), a cross-industry Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) platform that integrates business intelligence and optimization for real-time performance monitoring, automation, and optimization of complex business processes. The objectives are to demonstrate how to look through real-time data, report performance indicators, detect and diagnose problems, and visualize results. Its key innovation is to integrate a large amount of quantum information, automatically perform many what-if analyses and optimize a sequence of responses. The anticipated results include a preliminary prototype demonstrating the business values. &lt;br/&gt; QIS can be applied to supply chain management such as inventory management, production planning and logistics, resource/budget allocation, quality monitoring, and control and maintenance for reliability. QIS can also be applied to industries in the area of revenue, resource, and business activity monitoring. QIS is a cross-industry platform to provide real-time performance monitoring, problem detection and diagnosis, and improvement of overall business efficiency and performance.</AbstractNarration>
