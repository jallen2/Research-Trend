    <AbstractNarration>To understand the genetic and developmental bases of naturally-occurring&lt;br/&gt;organismal variation is to understand the raw material of evolution itself.&lt;br/&gt;Natural variation in seed coat morphology will be genetically and&lt;br/&gt;developmentally dissected in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A&lt;br/&gt;thorough description of seed coat development for a reference strain (this&lt;br/&gt;is the most commonly-used among many available strains) of Arabidopsis will&lt;br/&gt;be completed and will serve as the standard to which the development and&lt;br/&gt;underlying genetics of both chemically-induced and naturally-occurring&lt;br/&gt;(field-collected) mutants will be compared. Both artificial and natural&lt;br/&gt;mutants will be developmentally characterized and genetically mapped. These&lt;br/&gt;data, in addition to traditional complementation tests (crossing individuals&lt;br/&gt;and analyzing their progeny), will be utilized to identify the number of&lt;br/&gt;loci affecting variation in this developmental pathway and the frequency and&lt;br/&gt;origins of natural seed coat variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seed coat serves as the interface between the plant embryo and its&lt;br/&gt;environment and its roles are many and varied. This relatively simple, yet&lt;br/&gt;highly differentiated structure provides a unique opportunity to investigate&lt;br/&gt;evolutionarily important issues and the potential to identify genes&lt;br/&gt;responsible for the development of a commercially important organ&lt;br/&gt;responsible for such crops as cotton fiber and mucilage, (e.g., Metamucil).</AbstractNarration>
