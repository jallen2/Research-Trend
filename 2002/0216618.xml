    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Western Washington University under the supervision of Drs. Peterson, Moyer and Young of the Biology Department to support the acquisition of&lt;br/&gt;core instrumentation and software required for DNA sequencing, genotyping,&lt;br/&gt;and analysis. The ease with which DNA can now be sequenced, coupled with&lt;br/&gt;advances in molecular biology and computer science has revolutionized the&lt;br/&gt;biological sciences. This technology is now central to basic research in&lt;br/&gt;many disciplines, as well as integral to the training of future researchers&lt;br/&gt;and science educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from this proposal will facilitate primary research in eleven&lt;br/&gt;different labs with current and pending funding. A broad array of fields&lt;br/&gt;will be supported by this instrumentation, including Conservation Biology,&lt;br/&gt;Microbial Diversity, Evolutionary Biology, Plant Functional Genomics,&lt;br/&gt;Developmental Genetics, and Protein Biochemistry. State of the art&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation will further enable grant procurement and renewal by&lt;br/&gt;allowing us to perform rigorous research using modern techniques. This core&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation will also enhance our ability to attract and retain capable&lt;br/&gt;professors/researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to establishing and maintaining externally-funded research&lt;br/&gt;programs, we are dedicated to the integration of research and training&lt;br/&gt;through the mentoring of undergraduates in faculty research labs. This&lt;br/&gt;training will allow our students to continue to be recognized regionally&lt;br/&gt;and nationally with jobs in the biotechnology industry, admission to&lt;br/&gt;graduate and professional schools, and pre-doctoral awards. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;we are revising our core biology curriculum with a primary focus on the&lt;br/&gt;integration of molecular biology approaches at all class levels. In all,&lt;br/&gt;over 500 undergraduate students per year will directly benefit from this&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation through instruction in the Biology Department. Through&lt;br/&gt;WWU's Integrated Laboratory Network the equipment supported by this grant&lt;br/&gt;will be accessible to affiliated programs in the College of Arts and&lt;br/&gt;Sciences and the Huxley College of Environmental Studies, as well as to&lt;br/&gt;future K-12 science educators enrolled in the Woodring College of&lt;br/&gt;Education. In all, a broad spectrum of people, ranging from faculty and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates to K-12 science students will benefit. Access to automated&lt;br/&gt;DNA sequencing and genotyping technologies will enhance student education&lt;br/&gt;and professional opportunities while furthering fundamental science&lt;br/&gt;research.</AbstractNarration>
