    <AbstractNarration>This research explores extreme events in three nonlinear fluid flows: Turbulence, the pinch-off of pendant drops, and braking surface waves. Precision experiments examine each of these nonlinear systems to characterize and predict the occurrence of locally intense events which focus vorticity, dissipation, or energy in each system. The goal of this project is to characterize the causal mechanisms for these events and to use that knowledge to benchmark simulations and stimulate applied mathematical advances. The fundamental research should impact our ability to predict and numerically simulate strongly nonlinear fluid flow. In addition, the work has technical applications in the fields of mechanical engineering, geophysics, and applied mathematics. The mentoring and training of young scientists plays an important role in the research. Graduate and undergraduate students are involved in every aspect of this exciting research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores unusually strong disturbances that occur in fluid flows: Examples include turbulence and braking waves. Precision measurements will be used to predict the occurrence of locally intense events in such as rapid fluid rotation, or vortex formation, and large local occurrences of heating or energy dissipation. The goal is to build predictive models for these events and to use that knowledge to test computer simulations and to promote mathematical advances in these difficult problems. This research can be applied to the fields of mechanical engineering, geophysics, and applied mathematics. The mentoring and training of young scientists plays an important role in the proposed research. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in every aspect of this exciting research, which prepares them for careers in industry, government, or academia.</AbstractNarration>
