    <AbstractNarration>Our group is active in research that uses spin-polarized beams and&lt;br/&gt;spin-polarized targets to study issues in fundamental and applied physics.&lt;br/&gt;Currently, our primary focus is in the search for new physics beyond the&lt;br/&gt;Standard Model by performing a precision measurement of parity violation&lt;br/&gt;in the scattering of polarized electrons by unpolarized electrons in a&lt;br/&gt;liquid hydrogen target. The experiment, which is now being performed at&lt;br/&gt;the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, should eventually provide the most&lt;br/&gt;precise measurement of the electroweak mixing angle at low energies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, our group has joined the Star Collaboration at Brookhaven. This&lt;br/&gt;large collider physics experiment is presently commissioning a program to&lt;br/&gt;scatter spin-polarized protons with high center-of-mass energies in order&lt;br/&gt;to learn about the internal spin structure of the proton. The primary&lt;br/&gt;question being addressed is 'how much do gluons contribute to the proton's&lt;br/&gt;one-half spin'. Data over the next few years is expected to give the&lt;br/&gt;first direct glimpse into this important question. Finally, our group is&lt;br/&gt;also involved locally at Caltech in the development of spin-polarized&lt;br/&gt;noble gas, namely helium-3 and xenon-129, for use in nuclear physics and&lt;br/&gt;magnetic resonance imaging.</AbstractNarration>
