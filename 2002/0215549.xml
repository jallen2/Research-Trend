    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a research consortium (workshop) of promising doctoral students and distinguished research faculty in the field of human-computer interaction. The consortium will be held in conjunction with the ACM 2002 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2002) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI). The goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. Student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Student participants will also present their work during the technical program of the CHI 2002 conference. Extended abstracts of the students' work will be disseminated via publication in the CHI 2002 Extended Abstracts, which has wide print and electronic distribution. Evaluation of the consortium will be conducted by ACM SIGCHI's conference management committee, and results of the evaluation will be available to the organizers of future consortia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human-Computer Interaction is a multidisciplinary field of increasing importance to science, commerce, and society. This workshop contributes to the professional development of young scientists, whose professional careers will be devoted to understanding how computer systems and software can be designed to serve the needs of users.</AbstractNarration>
