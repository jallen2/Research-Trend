    <AbstractNarration>This project includes the research activities to obtain the stability and scalability of the inter-domain routing protocols. The proposed research will not only address issues on the current interdomain routing protocol, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), but also develop new interdomain routing protocols that can facilitate fast convergence and ensure reliability. In enhancing interdomain routing, robust configuration and traffic engineering capability are the integral part of the research. This includes fundamental understanding of BGP capability and investigating the minimum set of extensions to the current BGP. Robust configuration capability also requires high-level specification of the network configuration goal. The research team will perform systematic studies of fundamental issues on interdomain routing, including tradeoffs between traffic engineering capability and scalability of interdomain routing, routing policy guidelines to avoid persistent oscillation and the tradeoff between these guidelines and traffic engineering capability, reducing routing protocol convergence delay, and enhancing routing reliability by specifying high-level routing policy semantics. One component of this project is to educate graduate and undergraduate students on the management and configuration of the networks as well as to create awareness and interest among students on the issues surrounding interdomain routing.</AbstractNarration>
