    <AbstractNarration>This grant is for the acquisition of a multilayer monochromator for the synchrotron microtomography station at the Louisiana State University Center for Advance Microstructures and Devices (CAMD). A SXM station has recently been assembled at the synchrotron facility by a multidisciplinary group of physicists, chemists, and engineers. The SXM station has been installed on a CAMD bending magnet with a maximum energy of about 15 keV. It is anticipated that in 2002, the station will be placed on a 7.3T wiggler beamline, which will provide usable photons to &gt;50 keV. While the early results have been highly successful, analysis of the data has highlighted the need for the monochromatic beam. As a polychromatic x-ray beam traverses a sample, the shape of the energy spectrum changes with the lower end of the incident energy spectrum absorbed more than the higher end. This property is known as beam hardening. For the lower Z elements found in environmental and biological samples, a monochromatic beam will aid in optimizing the contrast and thus minimizing the image artifacts from beam hardening effects. In addition, a monochromatic beam will also aid in chemical identification through contrast arising from a judicious choice of energies above and below core-excitation thresholds. The CAMD SXM beamline appears to be the only SXM beamline in the world currently without a monochromator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synchrotron x-ray microtomography (SXM) is playing an increasingly important role in research in materials, biology, physics, geology, and environmental sciences. Many applications use tomographic imaging techniques to produce a three-dimensional representation of a sample. Since October 2000, the SXM station at LSU has been used to acquire images from such disciplines as chemistry, physics, biology, oceanography, material science, and engineering. Because of CAMD's close association with the state of Louisiana and LSU, education and outreach are strongly emphasized. Participants in the SXM research program include local high school students, undergraduate research assistants (through several NSF-sponsored REU programs), graduate students, post-doctoral associates, and both LSU and Southern University faculty and staff.</AbstractNarration>
