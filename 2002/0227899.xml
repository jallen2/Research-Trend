    <AbstractNarration>0227899&lt;br/&gt;Calzonetti &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the University of Toledo to support the activity described below for 24 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060).&lt;br/&gt;The partners include the University of Toledo (Lead Institution), Bowling Green University, Owens Community College, IQ Systems, First Solar, Cooltech, Dana Corporation, General Motors Corporation, Owens-Corning, Pilkington, Center for Technology Commercialization, EISC, Inc, Regional Technology Alliance, NASA Glenn, Regional Growth Partnership, City of Toledo, COSI-Toledo, and Toledo Zoo.&lt;br/&gt;The activities of the program include the following: (1) improvements in the technical skills of the workforce by design of the technical programs at Owens Community College in the area of alternative energies, (2) participation of African American and Hispanic students from the Toledo EXCEL Program, (3) promotion of related industrial and business development through support provided by the Regional Growth Partnership and the Regional Technology Alliance, (4) increased public awareness of alternative energy systems, (5) development of statewide support through the Ohio Alternative Energy Development Council, (6) transfer of alternative energy research and technology from the University of Toledo and Bowling Green University to the partner companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will increase academic research on alternative energy systems, develop the energy systems technologies, make innovations in manufacturing of these systems, develop the workforce for these companies, increase the participation of underrepresented populations in alternative energy systems technology, improve the environment from responsible manufacturing and less-polluting energy systems, and promote regional cluster development and increased investment in alternative energy technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The region of northwest Ohio is in a state of economic depression. The proposed effort will provide new technologies, new companies, and new jobs. The creation of new jobs will have a significant impact on the region, which currently has a high unemployment. Involvement of underrepresented groups in alternative energy technology has obvious societal implications. In addition, lowered energy costs and environmental improvements from less-polluting energy will have societal benefits.</AbstractNarration>
