    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is designed to leverage the success in polarized strip development. It will also advance two configurations for 2D and 3D capable auto stereoscopic display products, and initiate customer evaluation of these products. Specific objectives of the project include: completion of the technical developments necessary to produce 2D/3D products using the proprietary Strip Polarizer Parallax Barrier (SPPB) technique for flat panel displays; collaboration with a target customer to design and develop a market specific product; initiation of a pilot-manufacturing run to produce prototypes for initial market feedback; qualification of the initial prototypes in terms of performance, quality, manufacturability and acceptance; and continuation of research efforts needed to produce full resolution 2D/3D products. A successful Phase II program will advance the technology to prototype and initiate market feedback in target applications. Phase II prototypes will embody the majority of the technology needed to produce the full resolution products and will serve to firm up manufacturing processes while establishing initial market demand in those segments where natural upgrades to full resolution will increase market penetration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The direct commercial potential of the projects lies in autostereoscopic products that will be manufactured using the proposed technology. Such display products will find widespread use in scientific and medical visualization applications, CAD, industrial inspection, and remote vision applications. Consumer based applications may include electronic commerce and computer gaming.</AbstractNarration>
