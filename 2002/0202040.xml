    <AbstractNarration>John Protasiewicz, Department of Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to investigate new compounds containing multiple bonds to phosphorus. The project has three main goals: 1) to develop new and better methodologies for the synthesis of phosphaalkenes, diphosphenes and other P=X bonds; 2) synthesize and study new ligands containing several low coordinate main group elements; and 3) characterize extended systems having interesting optical and electronic properties. The fundamental chemistry of phosphinidenes will be examined following their thermal or photochemical generation from phosphinidene precursors. In addition, phosphinidene precursors will be used to construct discrete oligomers and ultimately polymers with desireable properties. Phosphorus-containing analogs to poly(phenylenevinylenes), PPV, and poly(phenyleneethylenes), PPE, are two of the polymers to be prepared and studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conjugated oligomers and polymers are technologically important as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), molecular wires and molecular switches. Incorporating phosphorus or related main group elements into the backbone of these polymers can change the properties in many ways. Students and researchers trained to work in this project will gain a broad knowledge in inorganic and organometallic synthetic methods as well as interdisciplinary areas such as polymer chemistry and molecular electronics.</AbstractNarration>
