    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230702&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Skokan, Catherine&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Colorado School of Mines&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Engineering Our World&lt;br/&gt;NSF RECEIVED DATE: 06/04/2002&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Our World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal, Engineering Our World. is to plan and pilot a program &lt;br/&gt;for improving teacher knowledge and student understanding of the concepts of various &lt;br/&gt;engineering disciplines and how these relate to their current science and mathematics curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;The program will be designed to both engage and educate middle school students through the use &lt;br/&gt;of hands-on, inquiry-based experiments in a mathematically rich environment. One unusual &lt;br/&gt;feature of this program is the inclusion of teacher workshops and monthly follow-up classroom &lt;br/&gt;visits. Another feature is development of a course for pre-service teachers. The existence of this &lt;br/&gt;new course will increase the impact of this project in years to come. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the summer teacher workshops will be threefold: 1) to improve the middle &lt;br/&gt;school teachers' backgrounds of engineering disciplines and their relevance to physical science &lt;br/&gt;and associated mathematical concepts in their current curriculum, 2) to introduce the teachers to &lt;br/&gt;techniques for integrating content and learning standards (including content literacy) into the &lt;br/&gt;curriculum, and 3) to provide teachers with instruction concerning how to use inexpensive &lt;br/&gt;materials to provide hands-on learning experiences in their classroom. . The purpose of the &lt;br/&gt;follow-up classroom visits will be to assist the teachers in implementing the hands-on engineering &lt;br/&gt;experiments in their classrooms and to respond to teachers' questions concerning science and &lt;br/&gt;engineering concepts. In other words, members of the CSM faculty team will become a valuable &lt;br/&gt;classroom resource for both students and teachers alike. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In parallel with this effort, a program for pre-service teachers will be developed. The &lt;br/&gt;University of Colorado at Colorado Springs will pilot a one-semester course for pre-service &lt;br/&gt;teachers covering the .Fundamentals of Engineering.. The pre-service teachers will use &lt;br/&gt;materials developed through this project during classroom visits with in-service teachers and &lt;br/&gt;apply these materials during their student teaching experiences at the middle school level. This &lt;br/&gt;proposal is intended to develop/adapt an appropriate set of course material for the teacher &lt;br/&gt;workshops and in-class lessons, and to test and evaluate the materials in urban and suburban &lt;br/&gt;classrooms. The joint effort of addressing both in-service and pre-service teachers will provide a &lt;br/&gt;continuous stream of knowledgeable instructors that can use engineering principals to illustrate &lt;br/&gt;the practical applications of science and mathematics to middle school students.</AbstractNarration>
