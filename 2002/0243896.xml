    <AbstractNarration>0243896 Schwartz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a five-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Colorado Boulder for fifteen students each summer for research opportunities in the area of functional materials. The principal objective of this program will be to encourage promising students, particularly those from population groups underrepresented in research fields in engineering and those from primarily undergraduate institutions, to pursue graduate studies in preparation for a career in engineering research. The program will include (1) a student poster competition to encourage students to present their research at subsequent technical meetings; (2) a provision to pay travel expenses related to making presentations; (3) a recruiting strategy to improve student diversity that involves a partnership with CU-Boulder's Multicultural Engineering Program; (4) a seminar program that focuses on preparing students to do research; (5) a meaningful program of social and cultural activities designed to complement research activities; and (6) a program evaluation and follow-up survey to gauge the program's effectiveness. Students will conduct research targeted at the synthesis and characterization of novel materials with specified properties. The materials of interest will be aligned with the expertise of participating faculty and will include nanomaterials, biomaterials, catalysts, polymers, gels, ceramics, thin films, and membranes.</AbstractNarration>
