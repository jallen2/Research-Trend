    <AbstractNarration>DMS - 0203697 PI: Wolfgang Ziller ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to continue his work on various&lt;br/&gt;ways in which Lie groups arise in geometry. Special emphasis will be put on&lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology of cohomogeneity one manifolds, i.e. manifolds on which a&lt;br/&gt;Lie group acts with one dimensional quotient. In our previous proposal we &lt;br/&gt;conjectured that every cohomogeneity one manifold has a metric with &lt;br/&gt;non-negative sectional curvature. A particularly interesting case are the &lt;br/&gt;Kervaire spheres which are exotic in many dimensions. We will try to construct&lt;br/&gt;metrics with nonnegative curvature on these Kervaire spheres. A further goal is &lt;br/&gt;to classify all cohomogeneity one manifolds with positive sectional curvature&lt;br/&gt;in the hope of finding some new examples, with good candidates available in &lt;br/&gt;dimension 7 and 9. &lt;br/&gt;We will also study variational properties of homogeneous Einstein metrics. In &lt;br/&gt;our previous proposal we showed that a partial Palais Smale condition is &lt;br/&gt;satisfied which enables one do carry out Morse theory and Lusternik Schnirelmann &lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A subject of major interest in global Riemannian geometry is studying manifolds &lt;br/&gt;whose curvature have special properties, in particular those whose curvature has &lt;br/&gt;a fixed sign. Manifolds with positive curvature or nonnegative curvature have &lt;br/&gt;been studied since the beginning of global Riemannian geometry. Very few &lt;br/&gt;examples of this type are known and new ones seem to be difficult to construct. &lt;br/&gt;A main objective of our proposal is to construct such knew examples. Of &lt;br/&gt;particular interest are exotic spheres, which are manifolds that look&lt;br/&gt;like spheres but on which ordinary calculus is quite different. These objects&lt;br/&gt;were discovered 40 years ago by Milnor and ever since then geometers were&lt;br/&gt;interested in finding a geometric description of them where the natural local&lt;br/&gt;invariants look like spheres, i.e. where the curvature is positive or &lt;br/&gt;non-negative. Whether they have metrics of positive curvature is in fact one of &lt;br/&gt;the major open problems in the subject.&lt;br/&gt;Another subject of major interest in global Riemannian geometry is the existence &lt;br/&gt;of Einstein metrics, which have many applications in physics in particular to &lt;br/&gt;building new models of Kaluza Klein theory. In this context homogeneous Einstein &lt;br/&gt;metrics have been studied a lot by various physicists. We develop a general &lt;br/&gt;variational theory for homogeneous Einstein metrics which enable one to find &lt;br/&gt;many new examples without having to solve the algebraic equations which the &lt;br/&gt;Einstein equations reduce to in the homogenous case and which can be quite &lt;br/&gt;difficult or impossible to solve explicitly.</AbstractNarration>
