    <AbstractNarration>A graph is perfect if for every induced subgraph, the chromatic &lt;br/&gt;number is equal to the maximum size of a complete subgraph. The &lt;br/&gt;Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture (SPGC) of Berge from 1960 asserts &lt;br/&gt;that a graph is perfect if and only if it has no induced subgraph &lt;br/&gt;isomorphic to an odd cycle of length at least five, or the &lt;br/&gt;complement of such a cycle. A related open question is whether &lt;br/&gt;perfectness can be tested in polynomial time. The PI and his &lt;br/&gt;colleagues are pursuing a strategy for proving the SPGC. They &lt;br/&gt;have formulated several conjectures about graph decomposition&lt;br/&gt;that together with earlier conjectures and results imply the SPGC, &lt;br/&gt;and are working toward establishing the validity of those &lt;br/&gt;conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work falls within the area of graph theory, and is closely &lt;br/&gt;related to theoretical computer science and mathematical &lt;br/&gt;programming (operations research). A graph is an abstract &lt;br/&gt;mathematical notion used to model networks, such as telephone &lt;br/&gt;networks, transportation networks or the Internet. Within graph &lt;br/&gt;theory the class of perfect graphs is important for several &lt;br/&gt;reasons. For instance, many problems of interest in practice that &lt;br/&gt;are intractable in general can be solved efficiently when &lt;br/&gt;restricted to the class of perfect graphs. Also, the question of &lt;br/&gt;when a certain class of linear programs always have an integer &lt;br/&gt;solution can be answered in terms of the perfectness of an &lt;br/&gt;associated graph. Thus the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture is &lt;br/&gt;believed to be an important open problem, and its resolution&lt;br/&gt;is likely to have implications in the design of efficient &lt;br/&gt;algorithms of interest to theoretical computer scientists and &lt;br/&gt;operations researchers.</AbstractNarration>
