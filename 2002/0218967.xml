    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for a research project whose goal is to advance the understanding and knowledge to develop a new non-contact and non-destructive characterization technique based on the effect of thermally stimulated luminescence applicable for fast imaging of the full-size bulk silicon carbide (SiC) wafers and epitaxial films. The results acquired by this new technique will be correlated with other spatially resolved analytical tools, including photoluminescence mapping, scanning acoustic microscopy, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The objective of the research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the role of nano-porous buffer layers between the SiC substrate and the epitaxial films as a means to upgrading of the material quality by reducing concentration of defects in the SiC films and improvement of operational parameters of devices. The understanding and knowledge acquired will provide guidance to overcome the technical barriers that have hindered the widespread application of SiC-based devices for high-power/high-frequency and optoelectronic applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, when completed, will directly benefit SiC wafer and device manufacturers. The results should promote the industry-wide adoption of this new metrology applicable eventually for in-line process control. One of the major SiC wafers and epi-layers producers, Sterling Semiconductors has expressed a deep interest in this type of the metrology and offered in-kind support to the university group with pre-characterized 2" and 3" diameter research-grade SiC wafers. It is anticipated that the project will provide U.S. companies with more cost-effective quality characterization processes while simultaneously improving parameters of SiC devices. The project is an integrated step towards the building a strong research program on SiC technology at the University of South Florida. The facilities available for the program include a chemical vapor deposition system for epitaxial SiC growth and advanced state-of-the-art characterization equipment located at the university clean room. It is believed that the program will attract quality graduate students with diverse background. The program provides a unique opportunity for the graduate students to meet and work with experts from industry, and will have highly positive impact to engineering education. The project is based on the international cooperation between faculties of the University of South Florida (Tampa, Florida), National Politechnic Institute (Mexico) and professionals in industry (Sterling Semiconductors) possessing a complimentary expertise in SiC growth and characterization. The results of the program will be published in referred journals and presented at the major international conferences. Some of them will be included to new graduate courses developed by university faculties.</AbstractNarration>
