    <AbstractNarration>Adaptive methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) are the most effective computational approach for a large class of PDEs that arise in many important applications in science and engineering. This area has grown steadily during the past two decades. This workshop will bring together leading researchers from around the world to address both theoretical and computational aspects of adaptive methods for PDEs and to foster stronger collaboration between mathematicians, engineers and scientists. Topics include a posteriori error estimation, adaptive h-p refinement, adaptivity with complex geometry, implementation of adaptive codes, moving mesh techniques and applications, adaptive spectral methods, nonlinear analysis, adaptive modeling and applications of adaptive methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will supplement Canadian funding to support the IMACS Workshop on Adaptive Methods for Partial Differential Equations to be held at the Fields Institute of Mathematics in Toronto in August 2002. IMACS is the International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation. This workshop is part of a year-long program focusing on numerical computation - the first ever at the Fields Institute. The program recognizes the central importance of numerical analysis in advancing computational science and engineering, and seeks to expand interactions among mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. The funds will be used to support travel expenses of researchers from the U.S., including invited speakers and young researchers at the graduate or postdoctoral level. Topics discussed at the workshop will be far ranging but will include optimal adaptive strategies, high-performance computation, error estimation, implementation issues, geometrical considerations, and applications. Applications will involve fluid flow, optimal design and manufacturing, electromagnetic phenomena, and biomechanics and biomaterials.</AbstractNarration>
