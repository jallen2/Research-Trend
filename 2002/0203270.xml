    <AbstractNarration>Davis, Timothy&lt;br/&gt;University of Florida&lt;br/&gt;0203270&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is the development of innovative library-quality software and under-&lt;br/&gt;lying mathematics for dual active set techniques in optimization.The dual active set algorithm&lt;br/&gt;(DASA)was .rst introduced in the context of state constrained control problems,and later in the&lt;br/&gt;context of constrained mathematical programs.For linear or quadratic programming,each step of&lt;br/&gt;the algorithm is equivalent to solving a linear system of equations,and in successive steps,there&lt;br/&gt;is a small rank change in the matrix corresponding to the change in the active set.Numerical&lt;br/&gt;experience has shown that the dual active set framework is an extremely e .cient approach for&lt;br/&gt;solving some broad classes of optimization problems,including problems in optimal control and&lt;br/&gt;quadratic network optimization.A version of the algorithm targeted to linear programming has&lt;br/&gt;already solved some LPs that other state-of-the-art packages are unable to solve.We will develop&lt;br/&gt;a variety of sparse matrix techniques,which have broad applicability,and which provide,in par-&lt;br/&gt;ticular,the numerical foundation for DASA.Each technique will be developed into library-quality&lt;br/&gt;software and made widely available.These include:</AbstractNarration>
