    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to organize a conference on "Colleges of Education and Engineering: Fostering Campus Collaborations". This is a follow-up conference which builds upon the success of the previous conference "Taking the Lead: A Deans Summit on Education for Technological World". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference comprises of approximately 200-250 attendees, including faculty from both engineering and education colleges as well as deans, provosts or presidents. The conference features best practices in campus collaborations that result in enhanced teacher preparation, improved curricula and teaching methodologies, expanded outreach for both education and engineering programs, and educational standards development. All sessions cover methodologies and strategies to overcome constraints and to maximize impact. The conference focuses on teacher preparation, community outreach to K-12, and pedagogical strategies for engineering education. In addition, seven themes are emphasized throughout the conference. These themes consist of "Community of Deans", "Collaborations", "Diversity", "Successful practices Integrating/Infusing Standards", "Pipeline for Teacher Education and Engineering", and "Funding Sources".</AbstractNarration>
