    <AbstractNarration>Southern Rings is a consortium of three two-year colleges and a four-year college to establish a regional center to increase the number of technologically-trained information technology technicians in south Georgia. The planning process is to define and develop roles of industrial partners and secondary schools, an effective co-principal investigator structure, a multi-institutional approach to academic programs and content delivery, technical support for activities, and management and evaluation plans. The process determines specifics of the models to ensure scalability and sustainability of the efforts and to extend them to rural communities that have no institutions of higher education.</AbstractNarration>
