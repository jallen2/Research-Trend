    <AbstractNarration>Knyazev&lt;br/&gt;0209311&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleagues organize a conference on &lt;br/&gt;iterative methods in scientific computing. Iterative methods for the &lt;br/&gt;solution of linear and nonlinear systems of equations play an &lt;br/&gt;increasingly important role in the numerical simulation of physical &lt;br/&gt;phenomena. Preconditioning is the key for significant improvement of the &lt;br/&gt;performance as it allows one to find a path between Scylla of expensive &lt;br/&gt;factorizations of direct methods and Charybdis of slow convergence. The &lt;br/&gt;recent surge of activity in computational biology creates new &lt;br/&gt;opportunities for iterative methods. As an example, the protein folding &lt;br/&gt;problem involves predicting the native state of a protein. This is &lt;br/&gt;accomplished by minimizing a complex energy function. Global &lt;br/&gt;optimization methods for solving this problem employ iterative methods, &lt;br/&gt;but computational limitations have restricted the application of such &lt;br/&gt;methods to small proteins (fewer than 100 amino acid residues). High &lt;br/&gt;performance computing is one avenue researchers are taking. The &lt;br/&gt;protein folding problem is only one of a great many applications that &lt;br/&gt;can use iterative methods to solve them. Some of the specific topics &lt;br/&gt;targeted at this meeting are: applications (with new emphasis on &lt;br/&gt;computational biology), domain decomposition, preconditioning, parallel &lt;br/&gt;methods, nonsymmetric solvers, nonlinear systems and eigenvalue solvers, &lt;br/&gt;multilevel methods, Krylov methods, interdisciplinary research, student &lt;br/&gt;papers, and open problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The International Association for Mathematics and Computers in &lt;br/&gt;simulations (IMACS) International Symposiums on Iterative Methods in &lt;br/&gt;Scientific Computing are meetings that have been held regularly since &lt;br/&gt;1988. The investigator and colleagues organize the sixth such meeting. &lt;br/&gt;The conference is dedicated to providing an overview of the state of the &lt;br/&gt;art in the use of iterative methods with an eye to contributions of the &lt;br/&gt;past, present and future. The emphasis is placed upon identifying future &lt;br/&gt;research directions in the mainstream of modern scientific computing. Of &lt;br/&gt;particular interest are talks on interdisciplinary research, open &lt;br/&gt;problems, and applications, particularly in computational biology. A &lt;br/&gt;special issue of the IMACS Journal Applied Numerical Mathematics is &lt;br/&gt;devoted to the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
