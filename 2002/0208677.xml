    <AbstractNarration>The next generation of computers will be multi-threaded,&lt;br/&gt;allowing the simultaneous execution of several programs.&lt;br/&gt;Most computer workloads are difficult to recast into&lt;br/&gt;multi-threaded form, under-utilizing multi-threading capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies a new approach to program translation:&lt;br/&gt;Assist Threads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An assist thread is a specialized version of an application program that,&lt;br/&gt;when run as an independent thread, assists (and optimizes) the application.&lt;br/&gt;Roles for assist threads include program profiling, monitoring, pre-execution,&lt;br/&gt;and memory management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments show that assist threads&lt;br/&gt;can effectively implement garbage collection.&lt;br/&gt;An assist thread mimics an application's execution,&lt;br/&gt;tracking memory accesses and recycling unused memory as it is recognized.&lt;br/&gt;The main application thread ignores memory management concerns,&lt;br/&gt;becoming simpler, faster and more reliable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other varieties of assist threads execute slightly in advance of an&lt;br/&gt;application program, precomputing and preloading needed data values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research makes both theoretical and practical contributions to&lt;br/&gt;compiler technology. It explores how to generate the computations&lt;br/&gt;necessary to implement assist threads. It also experiments with a variety&lt;br/&gt;of assist threads, evaluating their effectiveness and efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In summary, this research opens new avenues of application for multi-threaded&lt;br/&gt;processors, making them more effective in supporting the needs of a wide&lt;br/&gt;variety of computer users.</AbstractNarration>
