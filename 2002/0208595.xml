    <AbstractNarration>Kolmogorov complexity is a modern theory of randomness&lt;br/&gt;and has many applications in computer science and&lt;br/&gt;other fields. The investigator is enriching this theory&lt;br/&gt;and its applications by doing research in two directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm&lt;br/&gt;is at the heart of practical algorithm analysis. &lt;br/&gt;It has been demonstrated over the past decade that &lt;br/&gt;Kolmogorov complexity is a powerful tool to help analyzing the &lt;br/&gt;average-case complexity and the lower bounds of algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;Examples are the average case analysis of Shellsort and Heapsort.&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to continue this work to systematically develop &lt;br/&gt;the tool, the Incompressibility Method. This involves comparative &lt;br/&gt;studies to understand why, how, and when &lt;br/&gt;the incompressibility method&lt;br/&gt;works. In order to demonstrate, and to uncover,&lt;br/&gt;the power of this method, this method will be used to solve &lt;br/&gt;other open questions. Samples of some open questions include: &lt;br/&gt;improving Shellsort average-case lower bound analysis, &lt;br/&gt;average height of balanced trees, and Stack sorting lower bound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modern information age and the post-genomic era raises a &lt;br/&gt;fundamental question: Given two sequences (genomes or English&lt;br/&gt;documents), how much information do they share? For example,&lt;br/&gt;given two genomes, can we measure their evolutionary distance? &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this second part of the proposal is to understand &lt;br/&gt;this fundamental question and develop tools.&lt;br/&gt;In the past, the PI and his coauthors have partially answered this&lt;br/&gt;question by defining the concept of Information Distance. &lt;br/&gt;Information Distance measures the absolute&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamic energy required to convert one sequence to another.&lt;br/&gt;However, it does not measure evolutionary distance because&lt;br/&gt;genomic evolution allows long segment deletion/insertion, cheaply.&lt;br/&gt;A new theory suitable for such evolutionary distance will be&lt;br/&gt;developed. To demonstrate the feasibility of this research,&lt;br/&gt;some preliminary theory has been proposed and successfully applied to &lt;br/&gt;construct whole genome and chain letter phylogenies when no other&lt;br/&gt;method applies. More recently, this theory has also been&lt;br/&gt;applied to program plagiarism detection and language classification.</AbstractNarration>
