    <AbstractNarration>The project is proposed by a partnership that includes Washington University, St. Louis, five near-urban school districts in St. Louis (Ferguson-Florissant, Maplewood-Richmond Heights, Riverview Gardens, University City and Webster Groves) and two informal science centers, the St. Louis Science Center and the St. Louis Zoo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partnership effort is to improve the mathematics and science achievement of preK-12 students beginning with a particular focus on grades 4-8. The school districts are responsible for the education of approximately 29,000 students and the project will impact several hundred teachers each year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal is to enhance student achievement, and this is accomplished by: improving capacity to provide a challenging math and science curriculum for every student; developing exemplary teacher support from pre-service education through the induction years; improving teacher quality, quantity and diversity using innovative recruitment strategies, and; narrowing the achievement gap between under-represented minority students and Caucasians in math and science. &lt;br/&gt;To achieve these goals, the partnership is designing and implementing a six-part infrastructure for teacher professional development and a materials management and community support system, which is to be sustained for the long-term.</AbstractNarration>
