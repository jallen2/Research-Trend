    <AbstractNarration>0202132&lt;br/&gt;Dvorsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support an eight month research fellowship by Dr. Alexander L. Dvorsky to work with Dr. Daniel Sternheimer at the University de Bourgogne in Dijon, France. Co-funding for this project comes from the Math and Physical Science Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantization is the process of forming a quantum-mechanical system starting from a classical one. There exist different methods of quantization, and Dr. Dvorsky is interested in deformation quantization. Intuitively a deformation of a mathematical object is a family of the same kind of objects depending on some parameter. An example is deforming a cummutative algebra of functions (with the ordinary product) leads to the non-commutative "star-products" suitable for quantum mechanics. This project addresses the applications of deformation quantization to the central questions of analysis on Lie groups (mathematical objects which encode the symmetries of various classical-and quantum-mechanical constructions) and Lie supergroups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The host and his laboratory at the Universite de Bourgogne have strong connections with leading research performed in France and other countries of the European Union.</AbstractNarration>
