    <AbstractNarration>Nitrogen deposition, habitat fragmentation, and inbreeding can reduce the likelihood that a plant population may persist. While many studies explore the effect of a single disturbance, native plant populations are likely to experience multiple and simultaneous disturbances. The efficiency with which individuals acquire and use nitrogen (NUE) affects the response of populations to nitrogen deposition. This response is sensitive to inbreeding caused by fragmentation that can reduce NUE. It is therefore important to investigate these perturbations together. Greenhouse studies with experimentally inbred plants will address the quantitative effect of inbreeding on the acquisition and use of nitrogen. Field studies of fragmented populations will address the effect of fragmentation on inbreeding and NUE. The results of these empirical studies will be used to predict the response of plants in fragmented landscapes to increased nitrogen deposition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will examine the mechanistic basis underlying previously documented responses of populations to perturbation. The work, involving quantitative genetic analysis of the ecologically specific attribute NUE will incorporate genetics into ecosystem and community ecological study. Population persistence is a product of individuals' varied responses to the environment. Simultaneous consideration of genetic and environmental contributions to population dynamics is essential as conservation biologists and other scientists make predictions about future persistence.</AbstractNarration>
