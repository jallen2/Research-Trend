    <AbstractNarration>This project develops strategies and pilot programs to increase the number of undergraduate students obtaining degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The project establishes "On-line Science and Engineering Interactive Learning Communities (SEILCs)" to improve retention, and to increase student enrollment. SEILCs feature intelligent tutoring systems and web-based courses supplemented with on-line live interactions with tutors and faculty. SEILCs are open to all students in the College of Engineering, and the College of Science and Technology. Using SEILCs, the project develops and implements a pilot program with a slow-paced five-year curriculum in Electrical and Computer Engineering for students who meet admission standards, but may have inadequate backgrounds in mathematics and basic sciences. The five-year format makes it possible to deal with their academic needs in a more systematic way. The project also provides on-line science and engineering interactive learning communities with intelligent tutoring systems for high school level science and mathematics courses in coordination with the college of Science and Technology. These special learning communities serve a dual purpose. Incoming Temple University students in the STEM fields use interactive tutoring to This project develops strategies and pilot programs to increase the number of undergraduate students obtaining degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.

The project also provides on-line science and engineering interactive learning communities with intelligent tutoring systems for high school level science and mathematics courses in coordination with the college of Science and Technology. These special learning communities serve a dual purpose. Incoming Temple University students in the STEM fields use interactive tutoring to review basic mathematics and science concepts. Students from selected high schools use them in their college preparation as a service to Temple University feeder high schools. The interactions of the high school students with the monitors and professors of learning communities increase their interest an awareness of the STEM fields of study. The project also establishes comprehensive internships to provide financial support and coordinated industrial experience. basic mathematics and science concepts.
