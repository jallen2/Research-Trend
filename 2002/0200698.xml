    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator intends to apply model-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;methods to the representation theory of Lie algebras and&lt;br/&gt;noncommutative rings, as well as to the K-theory of a pointed&lt;br/&gt;abelian category. One of the main goals of the project will be&lt;br/&gt;to generalize classical results about finite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;representations to the pseudo-finite dimensional case - a&lt;br/&gt;representation of an algebra is called pseudo-finite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;if it satisfies the axioms for a finite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;representation. A theory of pseudo-finite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;representations has already been introduced for the Lie algebra&lt;br/&gt;sl (2,k), and the project is devoted to generalizing this theory&lt;br/&gt;for the case of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra L ,&lt;br/&gt;as well as the corresponding Lie group G(L). The project will&lt;br/&gt;also focus on the complex of positive-primitive formulae in the&lt;br/&gt;language of modules over an associative ring R. The aim will be&lt;br/&gt;to establish a relationship between the homology of this complex&lt;br/&gt;and the K-theory of the free abelian category over R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry plays an essential role in the study of physical objects&lt;br/&gt;that occur in Nature. The symmetries of an object - think, for&lt;br/&gt;example, of a crystal or a butterfly - are the rigid motions that&lt;br/&gt;bring the object back onto itself. These symmetries form an&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structure, called a group. In this way, we can&lt;br/&gt;associate to every physical object its group of symmetries. In&lt;br/&gt;representation theory, the mathematician considers a group G as&lt;br/&gt;an abstract object and attempts to classify all the objects of&lt;br/&gt;which G is the symmetry group. Traditionally, research has&lt;br/&gt;focused on the case where the objects are finite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;vector spaces. In this project, the methods of mathematical logic&lt;br/&gt;are applied to include the infinite-dimensional cases called&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-finite dimensional. These are the situations that the&lt;br/&gt;limited power of expression of the mathematical language in use&lt;br/&gt;cannot distinguish from the finite-dimensional. It has been shown&lt;br/&gt;that many such objects exist, but to unlock the secrets behind&lt;br/&gt;any particular one of them remains a baffling question.</AbstractNarration>
