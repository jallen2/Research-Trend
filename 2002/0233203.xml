    <AbstractNarration>0233203&lt;br/&gt;Vilesov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year collaborative research project. The principal investigator for the project is Professor Andrey Vilesov at the University of Southern California. Professor Birgitta Whaley of the University of California in Berkeley will also be participating. The Japanese collaborator is Professor Takamasa Momose at Kyoto University in Japan. They will be undertaking research on the study of quantum hydrogen fluids and crystals. They will combine several experimental and theoretical approaches to study the dynamics of pure and doped hydrogen clusters and crystals. Theoretical calculations will provide detailed insights into the nature of the quantum statistical effects and the effect of the interaction with molecular chromophore core. An important component of the project is the development of the pulsed Raman shifter based on solid para hydrogen crystal, the medium, which is characterized by large gain and extremely narrow lines. This development may give a real break through in the field of pulsed far infrared laser technology (5-10 um), where there are no commercial lasers at present. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together the efforts of three laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. researchers provide expertise of the growth and spectroscopy of pure and molecular doped hydrogen clusters inside ultracold helium droplets and theoretical interpretation of the results, whereas the Japanese group has a unique high resolution (10 MHz) difference frequency generation laser spectrometer and is proficient in infrared spectroscopy (3-10 um) of pure and molecular doped para hydrogen crystals. The collaboration will offer great mutual benefits. The project advances international human resources through the participation of a number of postdocs and graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. Results of the research will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>
