    <AbstractNarration>The identification of ancient continental transform margins has proven difficult&lt;br/&gt;for a variety of reasons. Transform faults are commonly reactivated subsequent to their&lt;br/&gt;active transcurrent displacement histories by younger tectonic processes. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;piercing points that permit assessment of offset are commonly equivocal and subject to&lt;br/&gt;multiple interpretations. However, analysis of sedimentary basins developed adjacent to&lt;br/&gt;transform faults, particularly faults that transect marginal continental lithosphere,&lt;br/&gt;provides a powerful tool for evaluation of ancient transform margins. Evaluation of the&lt;br/&gt;timing of deposition and deformation is especially critical, because the two processes&lt;br/&gt;should be partly coeval in strike-slip basins. In northern Sonora, the postulated Mesozoic&lt;br/&gt;type example of a continental transform, the Mojave-Sonora megashear, juxtaposes a&lt;br/&gt;continental crustal fragment, the Caborca block, against cratonal North America along&lt;br/&gt;what is now a complex structural zone. A narrow, deformed sedimentary basin of Late&lt;br/&gt;Jurassic-Early Cretaceous age lies along this structural boundary for a distance of more&lt;br/&gt;than 300 km. The subsidence history of the basin largely coincided with the posited&lt;br/&gt;displacement history of the megashear and so provides a unique opportunity to evaluate&lt;br/&gt;the megashear hypothesis and understand the processes that constructed the Late&lt;br/&gt;Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Cordilleran continental margin.&lt;br/&gt;A two-year field- and laboratory-based study proposed here will determine the&lt;br/&gt;depositional and structural evolution of the sedimentary basin adjacent to the megashear&lt;br/&gt;and the uplift history of the Caborca block, which forms the present southern edge of the&lt;br/&gt;basin. The objectives of the research fall into three major categories:&lt;br/&gt;1. Basin origin and its Mesozoic proximity to the Caborca block.&lt;br/&gt;Lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and geochronologic analysis will determine the&lt;br/&gt;lifespan and geometry of the basin, while provenance studies will determine if the&lt;br/&gt;Caborca block was a sediment source for the basin. Fossils in the strata and interbedded&lt;br/&gt;volcaniclastic rocks make this objective practicable.&lt;br/&gt;2. Deformation kinematics and chronology of the basin. Strata in the basin are&lt;br/&gt;locally tightly folded, cleaved, and metamorphosed. However, deformation intensity is&lt;br/&gt;greater in older rocks than in younger ones, a variation which may be either temporal or&lt;br/&gt;related to burial depth of strata during deformation. Mesoscale and microscale structural&lt;br/&gt;analysis will evaluate kinematics and variability of deformation both stratigraphically and&lt;br/&gt;geographically with respect to the megashear. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology on&lt;br/&gt;metamorphosed pelites will determine the age of the deformation in the basin.&lt;br/&gt;3. Time of uplift of Caborca block. The age of uplift of the basin margin will be&lt;br/&gt;determined from stratigraphic relations and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar thermochronology in order to&lt;br/&gt;establish time of uplift of the outboard block relative to deformation of the basin. The&lt;br/&gt;uplift analysis will also permit evaluation of provenance results.&lt;br/&gt;This integrated sedimentologic, structural and geochronologic study will evaluate&lt;br/&gt;the transform processes that are inferred to have created the southwestern Cordilleran&lt;br/&gt;margin beginning in the Late Jurassic. If the megashear hypothesis remains tenable, this&lt;br/&gt;study should serve as a template for other analyses of ancient continental transform&lt;br/&gt;margins. If the megashear hypothesis is refuted, the study will force re-evaluation of the&lt;br/&gt;Mesozoic tectonics of the southwestern Cordilleran margin and the kinematics of&lt;br/&gt;Pangean supercontinent break up in Mexico.</AbstractNarration>
