    <AbstractNarration>0216030&lt;br/&gt;Campbell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) with on-line sample preparation systems for continuous flow analysis of stable isotopes of Carbon, Oxygen and Hydrogen in natural waters and carbonates at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. A new Finnigan Delta Plus SIRMS will replace a 14 years old machine (a Finnigan Delta E) that is no longer supported by the manufacturer and is having increasing periods of down time due to electronics and vacuum system failures. The enhanced capabilities of a new SIRMS with on-line sample preparation systems for continuous flow (CF) analysis will allow for the analysis of very small samples with high throughput. Indeed, the newer generation of CF-SIRMS systems allow for orders of magnitude smaller samples to be analyzed with improved precision. This capability is important for study of micro-spatial isotopic variability in authigenic carbonates, sedimentary cements and pegmatite minerals, as a result of which we are now learning of the great degree of heterogeneity and potential historic information recorded at this scale which was previously homogenized and analyzed in bulk to interpret geologic history. &lt;br/&gt;The new SIRMS will support research ranging from studies of the sources of volatiles in volcanic emissions to hydrological and ecological studies of the pathways groundwater transport and processes of evaporation and transpiration in the semi-arid to arid Southwestern U.S. to studies of the genesis of hydrothermal ore deposits. Further, this facility will be an attractive addition to New Mexico Tech's analytical arsenal in facilitating the recruitment of minority students to the geosciences through its relationship with a local Native American College (Dine College) and through its association with the NSF-supported New Mexico Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NM-AGEP), which seeks to assist underrepresented groups in preparation for careers in science academia. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
