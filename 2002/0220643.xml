    <AbstractNarration>The project provides a unique opportunity for talented but financially&lt;br/&gt;disadvantaged high school students from Southeastern Massachusetts to enter and complete &lt;br/&gt;an innovative education program in computer science, civil, mechanical, electrical, and &lt;br/&gt;computer engineering disciplines at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth (UMD). &lt;br/&gt;Residents of Southeastern Massachusetts are going through a major economic transition &lt;br/&gt;that resulted from almost total loss of textile industry in the United States. This region was &lt;br/&gt;once one of the richest communities in the nation, but it is now home for mostly working &lt;br/&gt;class population with first generation college attendees. UMD is well known for providing &lt;br/&gt;one of the best undergraduate engineering programs in northeast United States. However, &lt;br/&gt;it still loses the battle for attracting highly qualified students who cannot afford college &lt;br/&gt;on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UMD has developed a strategic plan to play a major role in the economic revival of the &lt;br/&gt;region. As part of this plan, the University has established an Advanced Technology and &lt;br/&gt;Manufacturing Center (ATMC). ATMC assists technology based companies in the region &lt;br/&gt;to develop new products and processes and helps them commercialize university-&lt;br/&gt;developed technologies. While ATMC has a staff of professionals, it also employs a good &lt;br/&gt;number of student interns who function as junior engineers on its projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines internship opportunities available at the ATMC with an NSF&lt;br/&gt;supported Foundation Coalition program that has been established for freshmen and &lt;br/&gt;sophomores in the College of Engineering at UMD. This combination provides a unique &lt;br/&gt;educational opportunity for students with financial needs. Students admitted through &lt;br/&gt;CSEMS spend their first two years in the College of Engineering's integrated math/&lt;br/&gt;science/engineering curriculum and are supported by NSF scholarships. In their last &lt;br/&gt;two years, they join the ATMC as interns. During their ten hours a week internship at &lt;br/&gt;the ATMC, CSEMS students are not only gain invaluable experience, they also earn &lt;br/&gt;internship salaries that are higher than what they receive during the first two years &lt;br/&gt;work study program. With this plan, CSEMS students are trained similar to that of &lt;br/&gt;medical school students who get experience in teaching hospitals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to take maximum advantage of this scholarship program, we plan for a project &lt;br/&gt;cycle of six years funded by a combination of NSF and private industry. During the first &lt;br/&gt;three years we admit three cohorts of twenty students each. By the end of the four-year &lt;br/&gt;NSF project period, each student is supported by NSF funds for the first two years of &lt;br/&gt;his/her education. During the last two years, each student is supported by industry &lt;br/&gt;projects at ATMC. To accomplish the objectives of this project a partnership has been &lt;br/&gt;developed with eighteen of the area high schools, and a contact person has been &lt;br/&gt;identified for each school. All schools have expressed their enthusiasm to identify &lt;br/&gt;qualified students for this program. In addition, a set of programs and activities has &lt;br/&gt;been planned to add to the exceptional features of this project.</AbstractNarration>
