    <AbstractNarration>The PI intends to undertake a combinatorial study of structures&lt;br/&gt;arising from affine algebras with applications to mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physics, representation theory and q-series.&lt;br/&gt;The primary combinatorial objects are crystal graphs which are&lt;br/&gt;colored directed graphs. They provide a combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;description of the deep theory of crystal bases of modules over&lt;br/&gt;quantized universal enveloping algebras developed by Kashiwara&lt;br/&gt;and Lusztig: As the quantum parameter q tends to zero,&lt;br/&gt;these bases are described precisely by the crystal graphs encoding&lt;br/&gt;nearly all the essential algebraic data. Despite their importance,&lt;br/&gt;little is known about the combinatorial structure of crystals&lt;br/&gt;corresponding to finite-dimensional modules of affine algebras.&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a method to undertake such a combinatorial study.&lt;br/&gt;These studies will have applications to q-series, branching&lt;br/&gt;functions and fusion coefficients in conformal field theory and&lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanics, and the theory of symmetric functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project in combinatorial representation theory with &lt;br/&gt;applications to mathematical (theoretical) physics. Representation&lt;br/&gt;Theory is the area of mathematics most intimately involved with&lt;br/&gt;studying the nature of symmetries, of any sort, whereever they occur.&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorial representation theory refers to a methodology that&lt;br/&gt;uses explicitly computable formulas. About a decade ago it was&lt;br/&gt;realized that certain models in the area of physics known as&lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanics have symmetries that are not yet completely&lt;br/&gt;understood. This project carries out a&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial study of the structure of those classes of symmetries&lt;br/&gt;that can be represented by "colored directed graphs."&lt;br/&gt;Remarkably, the structures that occur have applications in&lt;br/&gt;many diverse areas of mathematics and physics,&lt;br/&gt;such as statistical mechanical models, representation theory,&lt;br/&gt;the theory of symmetric functions and combinatorics. For example,&lt;br/&gt;they lead to formulas which encode the&lt;br/&gt;particle structure of the underlying physical model.</AbstractNarration>
