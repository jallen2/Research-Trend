    <AbstractNarration>"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Sensory Ecology of an Animal Communication Network" (IBN 0239164/0238854)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George W. Uetz, J. Andrew Roberts, University of Cincinnati &lt;br/&gt;David L. Clark, Alma College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal communication is often multi-modal, as production and detection of signals may involve several sensory modes. Conspicuous, multi-modal signals may be intercepted by receivers that are intended (potential mates) or unintended (eavesdropping competitors and predators) and the evolution of signaling behavior is subject to trade-offs between conflicting selection pressures. This research will use field observation, environmental measurement and laboratory experimentation to examine how eavesdropping competitors and predators intercept and exploit the courtship signals of spiders. Studies will examine how visual and vibratory signals of male wolf spiders are influenced by the complex forest floor environment and transmitted within a "communication network" of potential receivers. The "active space", or transmission range of multi-modal signals will be measured in the field with computer-assisted illuminance spectrophotometry and laser doppler vibration recording. Sensory cue isolation and video/audio playback experiments will determine how multiple modes of communication influence signal detection by other spiders, as well as vertebrate and invertebrate predators. Taken together, results of field and laboratory studies will allow a better understanding of animal communication in a complex environment. Collaboration between researchers from a university and a liberal arts college will promote teaching, training and learning through post-doctoral training, involvement of undergraduate students from both institutions in the research, and a research and education partnership with the environmental education center where field research is done.</AbstractNarration>
