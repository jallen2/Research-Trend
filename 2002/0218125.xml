    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates reinforcement learning algorithms that use dynamic abstraction to exploit the spatial and temporal structure of complex environments to facilitate learning. The use of abstraction is one of the features of human intelligence that allows us to operate as effectively as we do in complex environments. We systematically ignore details that are not relevant to a task at hand, and we rapidly switch between abstractions when we focus on a succession of subtasks. For example, in planning everyday activities, such as driving to work, we abstract out irrelevant details such as the layout of objects inside the car, but when we actually drive, many of these details become relevant, such as the locations of the steering wheel and the accelerator. Different abstractions are appropriate for different tasks or subtasks, and the agent has to shift abstractions as it shifts to new tasks or to new subtasks.&lt;br/&gt;This project combines the theory of options with factored state and action representations to give precise meaning to the concept of dynamic abstractions and to study methods for creating and exploiting them. It will develop formalisms for representing option models in terms of factored state and action representations by extending existing formalisms for single-step dynamic Bayes network models to the multi-time case. It will investigate how the multi-time formulation call facilitate creating and using dynamic abstractions. An algebraic theory of abstraction will be developed by extending relevant concepts from classical automata theory to multi-time factored models. Methods will be developed for learning compact multistep option models by extending an existing mixture model algorithm for learning transition models from single-step to multi-step models. In general the notion of dynamic abstraction will be a valuable tool to apply to many difficult optimization problems in large-scale manufacturing (e.g., factory process control), robotics (navigation), multi-agent coordination, and other state-of-the-art applications of reinforcement learning. Since this research combines ideas from the fields of decision theory, operations research, control theory, cognitive science, and AI, it may provide a useful bridge that has the potential to foster contributions in all of these fields.</AbstractNarration>
