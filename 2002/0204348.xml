    <AbstractNarration>Distributed, heterogeneous (DH) software systems are critical for&lt;br/&gt;the operation of modern, globalized organizations. &lt;br/&gt;Like all software, DH systems come under evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;pressure as organizational needs evolve. Adapting DH systems to meet &lt;br/&gt;changing needs in areas such as security is challenging:&lt;br/&gt;Co-ordinated changes, made in different languages, and on different&lt;br/&gt;platforms must still preserve type-safety, and must not increase&lt;br/&gt;complexity and/or complicate maintenance. &lt;br/&gt;This project investigates &lt;br/&gt;enhancements to standards-based middleware (e.g., CORBA) &lt;br/&gt;to support evolution.&lt;br/&gt;We preserve and enhance the core IDL-based heterogeneous &lt;br/&gt;philosophy of middleware. First, &lt;br/&gt;interface-description language (IDL),&lt;br/&gt;used to model the architecture-level interfaces of &lt;br/&gt;components, is enhanced to support&lt;br/&gt;modeling of the evolutionary changes made to a DH systems. Location&lt;br/&gt;of changes, types and life-times of new information &lt;br/&gt;to be created are all explicitly modeled in an &lt;br/&gt;aspect-oriented style at the IDL level. &lt;br/&gt;Code generation supports&lt;br/&gt;a wide range of implementation choices to&lt;br/&gt;realize these architectural change-models. All implementations&lt;br/&gt;are fully inter-operable. Finally, change-models&lt;br/&gt;and implementations can be "compononentized", &lt;br/&gt;packaged up and added to existing systems. Like this research,&lt;br/&gt;our educational plans also span&lt;br/&gt;several topics areas, including functional programming,&lt;br/&gt;object-orientation, and architecture. We &lt;br/&gt;develop practically-grounded pedagogy on software evolution,&lt;br/&gt;comparing the varying approaches to separation of concerns in&lt;br/&gt;object-orientation, higher-order polymorphism (including&lt;br/&gt;monadic programming), connectors, and aspects.</AbstractNarration>
