    <AbstractNarration>This project is a partnership of several science departments and several minority serving school systems. The Broader Impact of the project is very high. Students are placed in several urban schools with large minority enrollments. The Fellows, in partnership with cooperating teachers, are adapting and implementing laboratories, activities and demonstrations that meet California science content standards. Part of the Intellectual Merit of the proposal is the broad range of academic faculty involved in both supervising Fellows and participating in professional development activities. The Departments of Physics and Astronomy, Geological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biology and Microbiology are involved. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Mathematics and the Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Science For Our Schools (SFOS)&lt;br/&gt;Institution: California State University at Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PI: Susan Tereby, David Mayo&lt;br/&gt;Partner School Districts: Garvey, Montebello Unified, Los Angeles Unified District K, Baldwin Park&lt;br/&gt;Number of Fellows per year: 8 graduate students&lt;br/&gt;Target Audience: Grades 7 - 12&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Urban&lt;br/&gt;NSF Supported Disciplines: Physics and Astronomy, Geology, Chemistry and Biology.</AbstractNarration>
