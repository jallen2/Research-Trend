    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0200614&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mattias Jonsson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will use valuations, &lt;br/&gt;a tool from algebra, to study local problems &lt;br/&gt;in dynamics and analysis in two complex dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;Valuations can be visualized concretely as the&lt;br/&gt;different ways that a sequence of points can converge&lt;br/&gt;to the origin. In fact, they parameterize all the&lt;br/&gt;local data at a point. Local phenomena in complex variables, &lt;br/&gt;such as the singularity of a plurisubharmonic functions &lt;br/&gt;or the rate of convergence of an orbit to a fixed point,&lt;br/&gt;can be effectively studied by observing the behavior along&lt;br/&gt;different approaches to the point. Valuations constitute a&lt;br/&gt;very powerful tool for this study. The success of the&lt;br/&gt;approach depends on the fact that the set of all valuations&lt;br/&gt;at a point in two dimensions is a set that can be understood:&lt;br/&gt;it is a tree in the sense of an infinite collection of real &lt;br/&gt;intervals welded together at branch points so that no cycles&lt;br/&gt;appear. This tree is a complicated but manageable object&lt;br/&gt;and its one-dimensionality has striking applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems are mathematical models that are widely &lt;br/&gt;used in virtually every science for any situation that&lt;br/&gt;undergoes a time-evolution. Sir Isaac Newton invented&lt;br/&gt;calculus, or mathematical analysis, for the study of the&lt;br/&gt;planetary system, a prime example of a dynamical system.&lt;br/&gt;Much of mathematics has developed as a respond to the need&lt;br/&gt;to model and understand the world around us.&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the principal investigator will use a tool&lt;br/&gt;from a different field of mathematics in order to understand&lt;br/&gt;certain dynamical systems. One example of a system&lt;br/&gt;that can be studied arises from numerical (iterative) &lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and the study of the dynamical systems in &lt;br/&gt;this proposal will give information on the performance of &lt;br/&gt;the algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
