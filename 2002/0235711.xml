    <AbstractNarration>The retina maps the visual field onto two parts of the brain: the optic tectum and the thalamus. The first is responsible for the basic features of vision, and the second is responsible for the detection of movements. How is this complex pattern established in the developing brain? Descriptive studies implicate teneurins, a family of proteins that reside in the membranes of embryonic neurons, in the development of the visual system. What do teneurins do? When cells in culture are forced to express teneurins they aggregate with one another, implying that teneurins could either bundle axons together as they grow toward specific targets, or they could help the processes of one neuron recognize and bind to a specific target neuron. In this proposal the specific functions of teneurins will be studied in the visual systems of the developing chick and amphibian by taking advantage the accessibility of these systems to genetic and other experimental manipulation. Teneurins will be introduced into neurons that normally do not express them and the fate of those neurons will studied. Conversely, neurons that normally expressed teneurins will have their teneurins genetically knocked out, and their ability to grow toward and recognize their appropriate targets will be determined. By studying the specific roles of this family of molecules in the visual system, it is hoped that insights will be obtained that can be applied to understanding other complex developmental events that feature cell motility, pathfinding and cell-cell recognition. In addition, the novel experimental techniques to be developed may have broader applications in other systems, including mammals. Many of the studies will be carried out by students to expose them to scientific methodology before applying to professional school, or as part of their training to become the next generation of teachers and scientists</AbstractNarration>
