    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0202536.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns two major themes. The first is the study of&lt;br/&gt;rigidity theorems (i.e. metric uniqueness) on compact manifolds. Here&lt;br/&gt;for example we consider isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces&lt;br/&gt;with the same spectra (e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami&lt;br/&gt;operator, or Lengths of closed geodesics) be isometric. This also&lt;br/&gt;includes questions about metric rigidity induced by conjugacy of&lt;br/&gt;geodesic flows, as well as inverse scattering problems. The other theme&lt;br/&gt;considers infinite groups G acting cocompactly on nonpositively curved&lt;br/&gt;spaces H (in the sense of Alexandrov). The project is to study the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between the geometry of H and the induced action of G on&lt;br/&gt;the ideal boundary of H. This can be considered an aspect of geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory and is partially motivated by some questions of Gromov. &lt;br/&gt;As well as these two major themes the proposal concerns the authors&lt;br/&gt;continuing work on various isoperimetric inequalities. These groups show up as &lt;br/&gt;symmetries of Hadamard spaces H (which include spaces of nonpositive curvature.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first theme of the project concerns the question of whether a space&lt;br/&gt;can be determined by a certain set of data. One part of this relates to&lt;br/&gt;questions of remote sensing. For example: can you determine the density&lt;br/&gt;of an object (say a persons body or the moon) from measurements taken&lt;br/&gt;"from the outside"? The CAT scan is a practical example where one&lt;br/&gt;determines the mass density (or more accurately the absorption&lt;br/&gt;coefficient) of an object from measurements of the total mass along&lt;br/&gt;straight lines. An alternative set of measurements is the set of times&lt;br/&gt;it takes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary&lt;br/&gt;(this is a special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt with in&lt;br/&gt;the proposal). The thrust of the proposed study is to determine under&lt;br/&gt;which circumstances certain sets of data (e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of&lt;br/&gt;closed geodesics, distances between boundary points) are sufficient to&lt;br/&gt;completely determine the geometry of the spaces in question. Groups show up &lt;br/&gt;naturally as symmetries of various spaces. The second theme of this project &lt;br/&gt;concerns the study a certain class of infinite groups.</AbstractNarration>
