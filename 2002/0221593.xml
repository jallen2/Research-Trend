    <AbstractNarration>IBN 97-29344 Neural Regulation of Adrenocortical Cell Functions Recent studies indicate that the autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) nervous system contributes to the regulation of the cells of endocrine glands. In particular, the PI has discovered that autonomic nerves control proliferation and secretion of corticosteroids by the cells of the adrenal cortex. These autonomic nerves include both sympathetic nerves and the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. In these studies, the PI's propose to determine the mechanisms used by nerves to stimulate these adrenocortical cell activities. Four general questions are addressed: (1) Is the cell proliferation regulated by sympathetic nerve activity and by which neurotransmitter? (2) Does the growth factor, bFGF, play a role? (3) Do the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla contribute to the regulation of adrenocortical cell secretion? (4) What signal transduction pathway is turned on by the chromaffin cell activity? In order to study the direct neural- adrenocortical cell interactions, the PIs will use their recently established co-cultures of nerve and adrenocortical cells for these studies. Taken together, these studies will contribute to the overall understanding of how endocrine gland function is controlled and the mechanisms by which the central nervous system exerts this regulatory function.</AbstractNarration>
