    <AbstractNarration>EIA 02-16165&lt;br/&gt;Skormin, Victor A.&lt;br/&gt;SUNY - Binghamton &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI: Development of an Advanced Laser Communications Research Facility with Internet Accessible Instrumentation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, developing an experimental research laboratory, expands a concept of sharing advanced scientific equipment in "cyberspace." This technology facilitates the access to equipment via the Internet offering the most advanced instrumentation and relevant interactive instruction to diverse groups of population; thus enhancing engineering education and training. This development will set unique space-qualified laser equipment intended for space communication and offer carefully designed "fixed" and "open-ended" experiments nation- and world-wide. The proposed project is not a virtual lab, offering instead enhanced "real" infrastructure of the laser communications research lab. The new development involves upgrading the equipment and auxiliary systems and enhancing its reliability, accuracy and rate of operation. Hence the facility developed will be suitable for unlimited global access via the Internet, enabling universities, industries, high schools, and individual users worldwide to perform advanced experiments in real-time and to collect data for analysis and interpretation. This project specifically enables and services an often forgotten population, the disabled. The Laser Communication Research Laboratory (LCRL), where the development will take place, contributes to satellite communication technology by addressing, among others, the following technical research problems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Modeling, Characterization, and Control of Electromechanical Beam Steering Systems,&lt;br/&gt;2. Free Space Propagation, Diffraction and Alignment of Laser Beams,&lt;br/&gt;3. Optical Beam Modulation and Steering,&lt;br/&gt;4. Rejection of Atmospheric Effects in Communication Systems,&lt;br/&gt;5. Experimental Analysis, Modeling and Control of Acousto-Optic Laser Beam Steering Systems with Bragg Cells,&lt;br/&gt;6. Gimbals Systems, and&lt;br/&gt;7. Liquid Crystal Technology.</AbstractNarration>
