    <AbstractNarration>This research program addresses the design of molecules which will permit the development of functional materials and devices. Fluorescent and photochromic compounds will be embedded into solid polmer matrices. The resulting molecule-based materials will be integrated into device configurations designed to execute logic operations relying exclusively on optical inputs and outputs. These solid-state all-optical logic gates will process multiple optical signals. Electron deficient surface coatings will be assembled from electroactive and fluorescent building blocks. The resulting molecule-based materials will recognize and immobilize electron rich substrates at solid/liquid interfaces, providing new avenues for sensor development. Students will be trained in the multidisciplinary fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology through a combination of lecture and laboratory investigations. A research forum for regional colleges and a research opportunity program targeting minority students will provide cohesiveness and foster exchanges and collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of this CAREER Award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Francisco Raymo, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Miami, is exploring the preparation of molecule-based materials and devices. Professor Raymo is developing new strategies for all-optical multi-channel signal processing which will complement current optical fiber technology. He is also preparing novel materials designed to permit facile detection and recognition of selected molecules, forming the basis of new sensor technologies. Professor Raymo is training students, both in the laboratory and in the lecture hall, in the modern techniques and concepts of nanoscience and nanotechnology. In addition, he is bringing research opportunities to minority students and coordinating multi-institutional exchanges and collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
