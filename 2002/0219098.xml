    <AbstractNarration>The proposal was submitted to the Chemical and Transport Systems Division in response to the FY2002 Information Technology Research solicitation, described in NSF Announcement. NSF 01-149, in the "Small" category. The proposal is for development of a comprehensive set of numerical models and techniques for the simulation of ultra-fast laser machining and to employ these techniques to obtain a detailed understanding of the fundamental physics of ultra-fast laser processing. In particular, the PIs propose to develop numerical multiscale finite volume and molecular dynamics models of these processes and to implement them on shared-memory parallel computers. Phenomenological issues to be addressed include melting and ejection of molten droplets due to recoil pressure and droplet redeposition. Large-scale simulation offers the possibility of resolving a number of fundamental questions concerning mechanisms of the ablation process in ultra-fast laser machining. The large-scale parallel computing aspects of the research will broaden the capabilities of thermal science researchers in this important information technology area. Other technologies that may be impacted by the development of these computational techniques include high speed microelectronics device simulation, microscale energy generation, and in a variety of emerging bio- and non-technologies. Educational impacts include expanded computational science expertise in graduate students involved with advanced manufacturing sciences and the expansion of content in upper level courses taught by the collaborating PIs. Funding is from funds reserved for ITR-Small grants in the CTS Division as well as from the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing program.</AbstractNarration>
