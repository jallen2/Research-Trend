    <AbstractNarration>M.E. Mear, K. Ravi-Chandar and G.J. Rodin&lt;br/&gt;Center for Mechanics of Solids, Structures and Materials&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas at Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas at Austin is engaged in a four-year focused research effort aimed at providing the physical underpinnings of three-dimensional (3-D) crack evolution through an integrated theoretical, computational and experimental investigation. Specifically, we are: (i) performing critical experiments that will provide insight into general (mixed mode) 3-D fracture evolution, (ii) performing numerical analyses of the experimental specimens/observations to determine the crack-tip fields corresponding to crack growth, and (iii) developing criteria for crack growth initiation and shape evolution which are consistent with the experimental observations and numerical simulations. &lt;br/&gt;The technological importance of this work stems from the staggering human and economic costs of structural failure resulting from material fracture. This cost is compounded by the fact that much of the infrastructure built in post World War II boom is aging yet excessively expensive to replace. While significant progress in failure analysis over the past four decades has aided in the design and analysis of fracture critical and flaw/damage tolerant structures, limitations in the characterization and modeling of flaws in their early stages of development have restricted much of the success of fracture mechanics to situations where the flaws are fully developed and admit treatment within a two-dimensional framework. The objective of this investigation is to provide a basis for overcoming these limitations.</AbstractNarration>
