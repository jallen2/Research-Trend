    <AbstractNarration>This project will study the gendered nature of learning science in the elementary grades.&lt;br/&gt;Standards-based science instruction largely consists of students engaging in first-hand&lt;br/&gt;investigation of scientific phenomena. This is in contrast to traditional science &lt;br/&gt;instruction that relies heavily on textbooks. The justification for investigation-based &lt;br/&gt;instructional design has typically been that the authority for scientific belief ought to&lt;br/&gt;reside in the actions of children rather than the authority of text. However, this &lt;br/&gt;unfortunate dichotomy between investigation and text undermines the potential uses &lt;br/&gt;of both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Girls are typically strong readers- an attribute that ought to make them strong in science.&lt;br/&gt;After all, at some point they must be able to read scientific text to excel in science classes.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, research on text preferences shows that although girls are strong readers, &lt;br/&gt;they prefer to read fiction rather than nonfiction. The primary objective of the project is &lt;br/&gt;to learn how science-related text embedded in inquiry science instruction can be used to &lt;br/&gt;engage girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first year of this three year study willbe spent in four third grade&lt;br/&gt;classrooms to observe how science-related texts are used. This will include documentation of text experiences created by teachers and created by girls in encounters with text supplemental to regular &lt;br/&gt;instruction (e.g., library visits, classroom-reading centers, books from home). This will be&lt;br/&gt;supplemented by classroom observations and interviews with girls, teachers, librarians &lt;br/&gt;and parents to collect additional data on the use of and interest in science books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second year of the project will consist of design experiments in the classrooms&lt;br/&gt;during which the teachers and researchers work together to analyze classroom activities &lt;br/&gt;and design instruction in cycles that allow research and teaching practice to influence &lt;br/&gt;one another. Data from the first year will be used to better understand how girls may &lt;br/&gt;engage with science text and design instruction to maximize girls interest in science&lt;br/&gt;and learning from science inquiry instruction that includes the use of text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1. What role does text play in girls classroom science experiences?&lt;br/&gt;2. How do teachers view the role of text in girls' learning of science?&lt;br/&gt;3. What texts are present in girls' homes and how are they used?&lt;br/&gt;4. What science texts do girls prefer when exposed to a large range of text genres and&lt;br/&gt;uses?&lt;br/&gt;5. How do girls uses of text enable and/or constrain their engagement and development&lt;br/&gt;of scientific ideas?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final year will be spent analyzing results of the design experiment and conducting &lt;br/&gt;cross-year analyses, preparing research papers for submission to science and literacy&lt;br/&gt;education journals, and developing a web-based curriculum unit for use in teacher&lt;br/&gt;education programs, including our own NSF-sponsored science teacher education reform &lt;br/&gt;effort.</AbstractNarration>
