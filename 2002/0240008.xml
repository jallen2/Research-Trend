    <AbstractNarration>Alan Cowley, Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for his exploration of new Group 13 compounds. The particular focus is on boranediyls and their metal complexes, synthesis, characterization and further reactions with organic and organometallic molecules. Boranediyls are electron-poor compounds with a formal B(I) oxidation state. Cowley uses sterically encumbering ligands to stabilize these reactive molecules. In addition to the fundamental interest in boranediyl electronic structure, these molecules may provide useful routes into metal boride nanoparticles and boron-containing polymers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boron has a rich chemistry that can be exploited in catalysis and materials synthesis. Chemical vapor deposition may provide a route into new metal boride nanoparticles. Polymers containing boron often have useful optical and electronic properties. Students will be trained in demanding synthetic techniques as well as state-of-the-art characterization tools for molecules, polymers and solid state materials.</AbstractNarration>
