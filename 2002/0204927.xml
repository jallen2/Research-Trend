    <AbstractNarration>Abstract - DMS 0204927&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the proposal is to apply methods of &lt;br/&gt;noncommutative geometry and supergeometry to the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;problems arising in theoretical physics. &lt;br/&gt;The development of (super)string theory led to the idea that &lt;br/&gt;this theory should by embedded into more general theory&lt;br/&gt;called M-theory. This hypothetical theory should live in&lt;br/&gt;11-dimensional space and the corresponding low energy action&lt;br/&gt;should be given by 11-dimensional supergravity. At this&lt;br/&gt;moment a rigorous definition of M-theory is not known. &lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, using various heuristic tools (first of all,&lt;br/&gt;dualities) physicists have created a beautiful and&lt;br/&gt;consistent picture, where all versions of (super)string&lt;br/&gt;theory can be obtained as limiting cases.A promising approach &lt;br/&gt;to a rigorous definition of M-theory is based on so&lt;br/&gt;called M(atrix) theory. The action functional of BFSS M(atrix) &lt;br/&gt;model can be obtained from ten-dimensional supersymmetric&lt;br/&gt;Yang-Mills theory ( 10 D SYM theory) by means of dimensional&lt;br/&gt;reduction to (0+1)-dimensional space.(This means that we should &lt;br/&gt;consider only gauge fields that do not depend on spatial&lt;br/&gt;variables, but can be time-dependent.) It was shown by &lt;br/&gt;A.Connes, M. Douglas and A. Schwarz (1998) that&lt;br/&gt;compactification of M(atrix) theory can lead&lt;br/&gt;to gauge theories on noncommutative spaces, in particular, on &lt;br/&gt;noncommutative tori.This paper opened the way for application &lt;br/&gt;of Connes' noncommutative geometry to string/M-theory . It&lt;br/&gt;became very popular, especially after the appearance of the&lt;br/&gt;influential Seiberg-Witten paper (1999) , that contains&lt;br/&gt;together with important new results, the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;Nekrasov-Schwarz noncommutative instantons (1998), gauge&lt;br/&gt;(complete) Morita equivalence defined by A.Schwarz (1998),and &lt;br/&gt;Pioline-Schwarz background independence (1999) from the&lt;br/&gt;string theory viewpoint. The number of papers considering the &lt;br/&gt;relation of string/M-theory to noncommutative spaces grows &lt;br/&gt;exponentially (today it is close to a thousand); many of these&lt;br/&gt;articles were influenced by the papers of A. Schwarz and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators. A. Schwarz intends to continue his work on&lt;br/&gt;applications of noncommutative geometry to string/ M-theory. &lt;br/&gt;He is planning to analyze thoroughly the general theory of &lt;br/&gt;gauge fields on noncommutative spaces and its relation to the &lt;br/&gt;duality in physics. He would like to apply (in collaboration &lt;br/&gt;with M. Movshev) this general theory to the construction&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of gauge theories on noncommutative curved spaces. &lt;br/&gt;One more direction the PI would like to pursue ( also&lt;br/&gt;together with M. Movshev) is a search of formulation&lt;br/&gt;M(atrix) theory ( and, more generally, maximally supersymmetric&lt;br/&gt;gauge theory) in a manifestly supersymmetric form. The solution &lt;br/&gt;of this problem is interesting by itself, but M. Movshev and &lt;br/&gt;A. Schwarz are planning to use it also as a starting point in &lt;br/&gt;the construction of a maximally supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeld&lt;br/&gt;action for nonabelian gauge fields and on noncommutative &lt;br/&gt;spaces. A. Schwarz is planning to develop a complex version of &lt;br/&gt;Connes' noncommutative geometry and the theory of&lt;br/&gt;noncommutative theta functions having in mind possible&lt;br/&gt;applications to noncommutative instantons and other BPS&lt;br/&gt;fields.He aims also to study the role of K-theory in &lt;br/&gt;string/ M-theory. M. Movshev is planning to analyze&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structures arising in open string field theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is clear now that noncommutative geometry is quite useful&lt;br/&gt;in physics. The PI intends to develop methods of&lt;br/&gt;noncommutative geometry and to apply these methods to&lt;br/&gt;various problems arising in string/ M-theory. It seems&lt;br/&gt;that noncommutative geometry should play an important role&lt;br/&gt;in rigorous formulation of M-theory. The PI hopes that&lt;br/&gt;his work will contribute to the search of appropriate&lt;br/&gt;mathematical formalism.</AbstractNarration>
