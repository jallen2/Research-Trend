    <AbstractNarration>Project ProBase&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Project ProBase (Problem-based technology curriculum) will develop an innovative&lt;br/&gt;set of 8 secondary level, technology-rich curriculum units based on a validated set of&lt;br/&gt;bridge competencies. The materials will be targeted for the 11th and 12th grade levels and&lt;br/&gt;will be designed to develop a comprehensive technical foundation for post-secondary&lt;br/&gt;community college technician education. The materials will be designed to be delivered&lt;br/&gt;using a constuctivist approach that utilizes a series of technological problem solving&lt;br/&gt;activities. ProBase will provide pre-technical high school students with a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;curriculum, designed to prepare them to enter community college technician programs.&lt;br/&gt;ProBase will develop and field-test curriculum materials designed to fill the gap between&lt;br/&gt;(a) the curriculum content standards developed at the national level (i.e., Standards for&lt;br/&gt;Technological Literacy, the National Science Education Standards, and the Curriculum&lt;br/&gt;Standards for School Mathematics) and (b) the entry-level knowledge and skills needed&lt;br/&gt;by students entering community college technical education programs. This curriculum&lt;br/&gt;will focus on core concepts identified in the Standards for Technological Literacy as well&lt;br/&gt;as a set of Bridge Competencies identified by the Community College consortium&lt;br/&gt;involved in the project. The materials will be produced and disseminated by the&lt;br/&gt;International Technology Education Association.</AbstractNarration>
