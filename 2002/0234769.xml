    <AbstractNarration>Pheromones are chemical compounds released by an animal that can act as specific attractants for a mate, and are well studied in moths and other insects. In the air, the odor plume is characterized by turbulent eddies; thus, detection can involve rapid changes between a high intensity odorant signal and complete absence of a signal. To maximize detection among the complex mix of odorants in a normal environment, the olfactory system needs to be able to inactivate pheromonal chemical signals rapidly because a high temporal resolution is needed to follow the pulsatile signals of the turbulent plume correctly to its source. This project utilizes biochemistry and molecular biology in a novel protocol to isolate enzymes from the antenna of the wild silkmoth, and to test the hypothesis that fast inactivation of pheromones in the insect antenna is achieved by pheromone-degrading enzymes. Results will help to resolve the controversy over whether such degradation may be more important than binding proteins for the fast inactivation. This study will have an impact beyond sensory neurobiology to a possible potential in designing biosensors and for pest control measures. The project also provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, particularly from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
