    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to purchase a GC-MS system for use on research projects directed by Professors Phillip Savage and three co-PIs at the University of Michigan. These investigators share common interests in kinetics and catalysis. A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a mass spectrometric (MS) detector is an extremely powerful analytical instrument. The GC can separate individual sample constituents in a complex mixture of reaction products, and the MS provides both universal and specific detection of the eluting compounds. The combination of separation by GC and detection by MS allows the complete resolution, qualitative identification, and quantitative analysis of even complex reaction product spectra. This feature renders GC-MS invaluable for experimental research in kinetics, catalysis, and reaction engineering. The ongoing projects have broader impacts in industrial applications. The research projects for which the GC-MS would be used include exploring the use of high-temperature water as an environmentally benign reaction medium for different industrial chemistries, reducing the formation of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins during the production of pentachlorophenol, developing high-activity catalysts and novel strategies for selective catalytic reduction of NOx, elucidating the aging mechanism for petroleum asphaltenes, and preventing wax deposition in sub-sea oil pipelines. The proposed activities are expected to advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning.</AbstractNarration>
