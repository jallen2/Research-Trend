    <AbstractNarration>EIA 02-24449&lt;br/&gt;Dinda, Peter A.&lt;br/&gt;Banerjee, Prithviraj; Kao, Ming-Yang&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE RR: Collaborative Research on Wide-Area Network Computing Using Virtual Machines&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative research project (with Fortes at University of Florida, proposal 02-24442), requiring a wide-area test bed that enables experimentation with, access to, and running of applications on unique resources, requests PC clusters, an IBM server, and other ancillary hardware for projects in&lt;br/&gt;1. Distributed grid computing and information processing systems using virtualization technologies and&lt;br/&gt;2. Information grids with real users and research applications requiring capabilities enabled by virtual machines (VMs).&lt;br/&gt;Deploying a distributed system based on clusters connected by local, metropolitan, and wide area networks, the work aims to provide a virtual computing and data storage interface to clients that access resources on the underlying "information grid." The test bed includes the following defining features.&lt;br/&gt;1. Virtualization capabilities, i.e., the ability to instantiate independent logical machines that can be multiplexed on physical processors (or fractions of them), storage and network I/O channels, and can use distinct operating systems;&lt;br/&gt;2. Wide-area distribution, i.e., Internet-linked test bed components in independently-administered geographically-apart network domains;&lt;br/&gt;3. Scalable capacity for both scientific computing and information processing; and&lt;br/&gt;4. Heterogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;Interrelated projects enabled by the test bed towards the goal of developing VM-based middleware for grid computing include virtualized end resources, monitoring and prediction, interactive computing, virtual file systems, data management, cycle selling, and security. Information grids and web portals for use of CAD tools are also enabled by the infrastructure for dissemination of collaborative research results and data, and for digital government services. From the availability of the portals and grid-computing resources benefits are expected in brain-machine interfaces, biologically-inspired nanocomputing, auction-based computing, distributed knowledge applications, medical imaging and data archiving, light-scattering spectroscopy, and mixed non-linear optimization. Collaborations include the Sigmicro microarchitecture center, NETCARE and the Purdue-hosted Nanohub (enabling users to run tools for computer architecture and parallel computing, and nanoelectrnics). The project impacts some minority serving institutions such as Chicago State and Florida A&amp; M Universities and enables a testbed for a transnational digital government projects involving Carnegie Mellon University, University of Belize, University of Colorado, University of Florida, University of Massachusetts, and Pontificia Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra of the Dominican Republic.</AbstractNarration>
