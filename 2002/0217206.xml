    <AbstractNarration>During the elementary school years, children become increasingly skilled in the use of a broad array of techniques for the storage and retrieval of information. For example, kindergartners and fifth-graders differ markedly in the ways in which they rehearse and organize to-be-remembered material. Unfortunately, however, even though much is known about the memory skills of children of different ages, relatively little information is available concerning the ways in which the skills of individual children change over time. Moreover, even less is understood about the factors that influence the emergence, modification, and effectiveness of these abilities. To a considerable extent, these gaps in understanding reflect the widespread use of cross-sectional research designs in which age differences in performance are examined by assessing different groups of children at each of the ages of interest. Although these methodologies can yield precise descriptions of the skills of children at different ages, they do not permit statements about developmental change. To do so requires a commitment to a longitudinal design in which a sample is established and then assessed repeatedly over time as the children mature and reach specified age points. In this way, it is possible to identify contrasting developmental patterns and also to explore potential mediators of change. This research will address these issues using a short-term longitudinal study of memory development in the first and second grades of the elementary school. A sample of 120 first grade children, drawn from 12 first grade classrooms, will be followed for two years, with a wide range of memory assessments being made four times each year. In addition, in order to understand the forces that propel developmental change, the research will examine key features of the children's classrooms thought to influence the acquisition and consolidation of mnemonic skills. An extensive series of observations in the classrooms of the participants will emphasize in particular the nature of "teacher talk" about remembering, the memory demands that are expressed, the specific strategies that are modeled or discussed, and the expectations that are transmitted by teachers. The focus on linkages between the classroom and individual memory development emerges from a number of lines of evidence that suggest the role of formal schooling in the development of a repertoire of effective techniques for remembering. The multiple measures, both of the individual children and of the classrooms, will enable the research to describe in considerable depth children's changing skills as well as the context in which they develop. Moreover, the research will relate the children's trajectories of memory performance over time to various characteristics of the "teacher talk" to which they are exposed in their classrooms. The results of the research should have clear relevance to the educational enterprise in terms of helping to craft teaching strategies that will encourage the development of effective memory strategies in children and thus encourage them to reach their educational potential.</AbstractNarration>
