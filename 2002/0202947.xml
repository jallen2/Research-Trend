    <AbstractNarration>This multi-year collaborative project is developing, pilot testing, institutionalizing, and disseminating a comprehensive program to recruit, prepare, and retain future K-12 mathematics teachers with deep content knowledge, effective pedagogical skills, and technological capabilities necessary to enable all K-12 students to attain high standards of mathematical achievement. Project partners include the Kansas State University (KSU) Center for Science Education, KSU's College of Education and College of Arts and Sciences, and three school districts: Geary County Unified School District, Kansas City, Kansas Unified School District, and Manhattan-Ogden Unified School District. The project team features mathematicians, mathematics educators, and K-12 mathematics teachers, to ensure that teacher preparation is part of the continuum of teacher education that extends through the induction years and beyond. Five key components are: (1) innovative recruitment initiatives to increase the number of traditional and nontraditional students entering K-12 mathematics teacher education (including minority and bilingual students, STEM majors, community college students, and professionals); (2) a strong foundation in challenging mathematics content and technological knowledge based on state and national mathematics content standards linked to effective pedagogical strategies; (3) effective research-based methods of teaching focused on national and state mathematics teaching standards, current research, and best practice; (4) extensive clinical field experiences teaching diverse learners in a variety of Professional Development Schools under the guidance of mentor teachers; and (5) continuous support and assistance for graduates during their initial three years of teaching to facilitate their transition from teacher preparation to practice. The project builds on established collaborations with mathematics faculty from two-year feeder colleges to strengthen the mathematics courses future teachers take at these colleges.</AbstractNarration>
