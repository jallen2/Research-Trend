    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing a reliable and valid statics assessment instrument to evaluate student learning. In the first step we are working to define the core concepts in statics. Our second step is to create an appropriate instrument, a set of questions that tests students' basic knowledge of statics as well as their depth of comprehension and application skills. This development process is based on the success of the widely accepted Force Concepts Inventory in Physics. In the third step we are undertaking extensive field-testing to assure the validity and reliability of this instrument. The fourth step, following the development and validation of the instrument, is to initiate national dissemination of the Statics Knowledge Inventory instrument. To help in this effort we have created a national board of mechanics faculty. This instrument will find wide application because many engineering programs require their majors to study statics. Our project is providing faculty with a validated instrument for formative assessing as they develop and refine their individual courses to enhance student learning. We are also working with a commercial publisher to disseminate and publish this work.</AbstractNarration>
