    <AbstractNarration>CMS-0201482&lt;br/&gt;PI: Joseph Dove&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Virginia Polytechnic and State University&lt;br/&gt;Title: "New Design Criteria for Soil and Construction Material Interface Systems"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central to many facets of geotechnical engineering design is the problem of determining how local interactions between soil materials and manufactured inclusions dictate overall behavior of a geotechnical composite system. Whether the inclusion is geosynthetic, steel, concrete, or a new material yet to be developed, the interactions between soil and construction materials are governed by underlying physical principles related to measurable properties. Unfortunately, there are few, if any, predictive relationships for interface systems available to the research and practice communities. This deficiency is important because innovative applications are arising which require close control over interface resistance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to: 1) Formulate new practical design methods and tools for interface systems; 2) Quantify the micro-mechanical behavior of soil-construction material interfaces in two- and three-dimensions; and 3) Determine the spatial scales that control behavior of interfaces for a given soil material and inclusion geometry. Results from previous NSF-sponsored research, a laboratory testing program, and two and three-dimensional discrete element micromechanical models will be used to accomplish these goals. Specific issues to be addressed in the experiments and modeling include the role of grain shape; surface topography; relative hardness; particle movements with respect to the surface asperities; particle breakage; and, solid surface wear on the strength and dilatancy of the soil within the interface shear zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this research will be realized in five primary impact areas: integration of education and research; participation of minorities and women; enhancing infrastructure for research; rapid and broad dissemination of research results; and, societal benefits. Education and research will be integrated by bringing research results and new materials into undergraduate and graduate courses. The PIs will continue their long-standing practice of involving undergraduate students in research through the REU program. Participation of underrepresented minorities and women is encouraged. The Ph.D. student involved in this project will serve as a model for her fellow women graduate and undergraduate student colleauges. McNair Scholars, especially those from the Appalachian region, will be actively recruited to conduct their summer internship on this project, and as graduate students. The three-dimensional models and algorithms produced will enhance the research and teaching infrastructure by providing advanced computing resources for solving problems in soil/structure interaction. In addition, project findings will be widely disseminated in print and web-based media. A surface profile database will be created in downloable format on the world wide web. Finally, society at large will benefit from cost saving opportunities and technological advancement.</AbstractNarration>
