    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unifying Chronostratigraphic Databases Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christopher Keane and Steven Stanley&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0224582&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Geological Institute proposes to convene a workshop to bring together a number of the groups working on chronostratigraphic databases. The primary goal of the workshop is to establish the framework for a consortium of scientific entities that will undertake a sustained effort to continually recalibrate the time scale, while simultaneously reassessing its relationship to a wide variety of geologic data and temp[oral patterns through a coordinated data system of geologic time. Through the workshop, participants will identify the nature, similarities, and issues facing each chronostratigraphic effort currently underway. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A well calibrated, properly applied geologic time scale is essential to our understanding the evolution of the Earth, including the ages of rocks and fossils, timing of major events in earth history, and rates of natural processes. The workshop will examine the needs of a range of end-users of a coordinated data system dealing with geologic time. By establishing a list of primary end-user needs as well as issues facing each organization, an effective plan for building a coordinated data system of geologic time can be effectively constructed.</AbstractNarration>
