    <AbstractNarration>The Mechanisms for Interior Dissipation of the Oceanic General Circulation&lt;br/&gt;M. Jeroen Molemaker and James McWilliams&lt;br/&gt;UCLA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses the fundamental question of how dissipation is accomplished for the large-scale circulation while in equilibrium. The hypothesis to be addressed is that a crucial step en route to dissipation is that instabilities of mesoscale structures arise due to unbalanced motions. Computation models based on different dynamical approximations will be used to help distinguish and determine the different mechanisms of forward energy cascades. Several different mesoscale circulation regimes will be examined to determine where energy transfer exchange with the sub-mesoscale unbalanced motions is likely to occur; these regimes will include the following: an inflowing jet, boundary upwelling, and homogeneous turbulence. The standard for dynamical behavior will be the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations. New methods will be devised to partition the flow and its dissipation routes into balanced and unbalanced parts in order to say when the interior dissipation is likely to be enhanced over the expectation of geostrophic turbulence. The broader goal will be to determine how the vertical and horizontal eddy viscosities in GCMs should depend upon the large- and mesoscale properties of the resolved circulation and stratification.</AbstractNarration>
