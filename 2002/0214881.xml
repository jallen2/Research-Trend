    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a new intraoperative imaging probe based on a solid-state, compact readout sensor coupled to a high resolution, high light output converter. Nuclear Medicine imaging has been widely used to preoperatively image structures of interest for excisional biopsy. Radio-guided intraoperative procedures utilizing non-imaging gamma detector probes and radiotracers have facilitated a cost-effective, highly specific means to locate suspect tissue and access it for pathologic analysis. The result of radio-guided surgery is increased tissue specificity obtained for biopsy, minimally accessed incisions, and the reduction of inpatient hospital utilization with an improved patient recovery. The main drawback of non- imaging gamma guidance is the lack of ancillary information of the surveyed area, such as distinction between two neighboring radioactive regions, which can be overcome with an intraoperative imaging probe. Also, the highly penetrating gamma radiation from other parts of the body increases the background, and limits the practical use of current probes. This Phase i project seeks to address these limitations by designing a new-generation intraoperative probe intended to image the tumor bed with short-range beta rays. When developed, this detector will allow accurate delineation of the tumor, thus facilitating precise resection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in the area of biomedical devices and instrumentation.</AbstractNarration>
