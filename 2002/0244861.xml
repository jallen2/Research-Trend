    <AbstractNarration>A student will work on the control system for the polarized Helium-3&lt;br/&gt;target for the BLAST experiment at MIT Bates Linear Accelerator&lt;br/&gt;Center. This target will be used in 2004 for an experiment to&lt;br/&gt;measure the charge distribution inside of a&lt;br/&gt;neutron. A student will work with computers and the EPICS control&lt;br/&gt;system (used in many accelerator laboratories) to control lasers,&lt;br/&gt;power monitors and other components of this complex target. A&lt;br/&gt;student will also be able to participate in large, active and&lt;br/&gt;ongoing experiment which measures some of the basic properties of&lt;br/&gt;nature at the nuclear and sub-nuclear scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project a student will be bringing a major data acquisition&lt;br/&gt;system (CODA) which is used at several major accelerator&lt;br/&gt;laboratories, to the lab bench. By working in cooperation with the&lt;br/&gt;data acquisition group at Jefferson Lab (Newport News, VA) and the&lt;br/&gt;an electronics group at Indiana University we will work to join CODA&lt;br/&gt;to the PCI-bus. The PCI-bus is the back bone of most Linux&lt;br/&gt;computers, and&lt;br/&gt;different then the hardware which traditionally drives data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition systems.&lt;br/&gt;This would allowing the testing of equipment on small systems to be&lt;br/&gt;done the same way as on large laboratory based data acquisition&lt;br/&gt;system.</AbstractNarration>
