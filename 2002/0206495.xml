    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Douglas Soltis of University of Florida and Mr.&lt;br/&gt;Michael Zanis of Washington State University to investigate the genes governing flower&lt;br/&gt;development in "primitive" flowering plants. Much is known about the genetics of&lt;br/&gt;flower development in the higher flowering plants, Arabidopsis (thale cress) and&lt;br/&gt;Antirrhinum (snapdragon). In contrast, little is known about the genetics of flower&lt;br/&gt;development in primitive flowering plants. Dr. Soltis and Mr. Zanis are focusing on&lt;br/&gt;isolating and characterizing MADS-box genes, a family of development regulatory genes,&lt;br/&gt;from two primitive flowering plants, Nuphar (a member of the waterlily family) and&lt;br/&gt;Illicium (a member of the star anise family). They have developed a method for&lt;br/&gt;extracting RNA from Nuphar and Illicium flowers, and are using degenerate polymerase&lt;br/&gt;chain raction (PCR) to amplify and obtain DNA sequences of MADS-box genes. The&lt;br/&gt;relationships of the MADS-box genes isolated from Nuphar and Illicium are compared to&lt;br/&gt;MADS-box genes isolated from other flowering plants. Lastly, using RT-PCR Dr. Soltis&lt;br/&gt;and Mr. Zanis are characterizing the floral tissues in which the MADS-box genes are&lt;br/&gt;expressed.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the genes involved in flower development in primitive flowering&lt;br/&gt;plants, such as Nuphar and Illicium, is critical because of the insights they may provide&lt;br/&gt;into the early angiosperm flower. Moreover, elucidating the genetics of floral&lt;br/&gt;development in these key flowering plants not only will help to answer questions&lt;br/&gt;regarding the origin and diversification of the flower, but will also provide the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to link what is known about model flowering plant systems, such as&lt;br/&gt;Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis, with other flowering plants, providing a more&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive picture of floral development.</AbstractNarration>
