    <AbstractNarration>Over the last several years, the critical need to bolster participation in science at all levels in &lt;br/&gt;the United States has become an issue of national concern. As the number of people trained in &lt;br/&gt;highly technical fields in the sciences, mathematics and engineering grows, there is evidence &lt;br/&gt;to suggest that students who have aptitude and interest in the sciences and mathematics often &lt;br/&gt;become disillusioned with their college-level studies and opt for majors in non-science &lt;br/&gt;disciplines. These students abandon potentially promising careers in science, technology, &lt;br/&gt;engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields because of inadequate preparation during their &lt;br/&gt;high school years, feelings that they can not compete, inadequate and/or poor advising by &lt;br/&gt;college faculty, and disinterest in university-level general education classes in STEM fields. A &lt;br/&gt;most harmful part of this trend is that many students make decisions to leave STEM majors &lt;br/&gt;during their first year of college when they have not yet had the opportunity to develop strong &lt;br/&gt;ties with STEM departments. This loss of talent is detrimental not only to the intellectual &lt;br/&gt;capital that is a source of national pride but also to the nation's ability to maintain the high &lt;br/&gt;standard of living that is one by-product of a technologically-advanced economy. The solution &lt;br/&gt;to this problem lies, in part, in the ability of colleges and universities to restructure science &lt;br/&gt;and mathematics courses and majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this problem in which promising students switch to non-scientific majors early &lt;br/&gt;in their college education, funding is requested for a three-year initiative that has as its &lt;br/&gt;overarching goal to recruit and retain promising students in STEM majors. Our approach &lt;br/&gt;is to develop a pilot project that consists of three parts: (1) a Summer Science Institute &lt;br/&gt;for high school students; (2) a Freshman Year Science Seminar Series, and (3) a Sophomore &lt;br/&gt;Year Independent Research Experience. At the heart of each of these programs are common &lt;br/&gt;themes, including introducing students to the joys of scientific discovery and the nature of &lt;br/&gt;team-based interdisciplinary research, informing students about exciting career choices in &lt;br/&gt;STEM fields, exposing them to the rich history of scientific thought and discovery, and &lt;br/&gt;providing them with the tools and support structure they need to complete a baccalaureate &lt;br/&gt;degree in one or more STEM disciplines. We integrate practices that have been shown to be &lt;br/&gt;effective in improving participation, including close mentoring, extracurricular activities, &lt;br/&gt;development of a cohort, inclusion of parents, and professional development for faculty. &lt;br/&gt;According to recent studies, the problem of first-year flight disproportionately impacts &lt;br/&gt;women, minorities, low-income, and/or first-generation students. For this reason, our &lt;br/&gt;recruiting efforts are concentrate on these target groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pilot program has been carefully overseen and assessed by an Advisory Board chaired by &lt;br/&gt;the chief academic officer of Central Washington University, Provost/Senior Vice President &lt;br/&gt;David Soltz. Assessment is coordinated by Associate Professor of Science Education &lt;br/&gt;and Chemistry Martha Kurtz and Vice Provost and Professor of Curriculum and Supervision &lt;br/&gt;Linda Beath. Twice per year, goals, assessment strategies and benchmarks are reviewed &lt;br/&gt;in order to improve the program. Should our approach be successful, full scale implementation &lt;br/&gt;at CWU would rely on funding from private sources and redirection of internal resources. &lt;br/&gt;Because our proposed program relies on themes and resources that are fundamental to most &lt;br/&gt;colleges and universities, we anticipate that other STEM groups could adopt our program, &lt;br/&gt;thereby increasing its impact from a local to a national scope. Central Washington University &lt;br/&gt;is well poised to support a program that stresses outreach to minority populations, careful &lt;br/&gt;mentoring, and inquiry-based, interdisciplinary academic programs. CWU emphasizes small &lt;br/&gt;class size, close professional relationships between faculty and students, and a culture that &lt;br/&gt;rewards innovative, inquiry-based teaching and learning. The University has a strong, &lt;br/&gt;well-supported program in undergraduate research and creative expression, and strengths in &lt;br/&gt;education promote effective use of assessment strategies. This project reflects a &lt;br/&gt;collaborative effort among 11 faculty in six College of the Sciences departments. Co-PIs &lt;br/&gt;include Wendy Bohrson (Geological Sciences), Michael Braunstein (Physics), Eric Bullock &lt;br/&gt;(Chemistry), Carey Gazis (Geological Sciences), Lisa Ely (Geological Sciences), Ed &lt;br/&gt;Gellenbeck (Computer Sciences), Stephen Glasby(Mathematics), Martha Kurtz (Science &lt;br/&gt;Education and Chemistry), Steven Lundblad (Geological Sciences), Andy Piacsek (Physics), &lt;br/&gt;and Holly Pinkart (Biological Sciences).</AbstractNarration>
