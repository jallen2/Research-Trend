    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002. The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Transformation of neural signals across single neurons." This project addresses the physiological and biophysical mechanisms of individual neurons that underlie phase-coding in barn owls, specifically how they encode time. First, it will focus on verifying the presence of a subthreshold presynaptic code in postsynaptic cells. Second, morphological and physiological characteristics of the synapse will be determined.</AbstractNarration>
