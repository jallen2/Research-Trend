    <AbstractNarration>0200746&lt;br/&gt;Jackson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-UK cooperative research in physical experimental chemistry involves Michael Jackson and students at Unviersity of Wisconsin La Crosse and John M. Brown at Oxford University's Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory. The objective is to perform high-resolution spectroscopy in the far-infrared region using laser magnetic resonance (LMR). LMR is a technique for the detection of transient species in the gas phase and the study of their rotational or vibrational-rotational spectra. The researchers propose to investigate several important molecular species, including chlorine monoxide, which is found in the upper atmosphere, and the super oxide anion radical, which is one of the most important biological free radicals and a major factor in the aging process, auto-immune diseases and tissue rejection. They will examine these species at high sensitivity from the visible to microwave regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US investigator brings to this project expertise in LMR studies in the far-infrared region. This is complemented by British expertise in geometrical and electronic structures of small unstable molecules (free radicals). The study will advance understanding of the structure and behavior of free radicals of interest to the fields of atmospheric chemistry, astronomy, biology and biomedical research. Students from a predominantly undergraduate teaching institution will gain international experience and benefit from training in LMR spectrometer system and studies of free radicals using LMR experimental techniques.</AbstractNarration>
