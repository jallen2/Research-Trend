    <AbstractNarration>The investigator intends to pursue a diverse set of projects related to&lt;br/&gt;Selmer groups, elliptic curves, modular forms, p-adic L-functions and&lt;br/&gt;Iwasawa theory. Selmer groups have traditionally been an important tool&lt;br/&gt;for studying the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve over a number&lt;br/&gt;field. They have also played an important role in proving special cases&lt;br/&gt;of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture which provides a relationship&lt;br/&gt;between arithmetic properties of an elliptic curve E and the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;the Hasse-Weil L-function for E. In recent years it has become clear that&lt;br/&gt;certain natural generalizations of the Selmer group should provide similar&lt;br/&gt;conjectural relationships to the behavior of much more general kinds of&lt;br/&gt;L-functions. Iwasawa theory provides a framework for studying these&lt;br/&gt;conjectures by allowing the L-functions to vary in families defined by&lt;br/&gt;congruences modulo powers of a prime p. This leads to the notion of a&lt;br/&gt;p-adic L-function and to the formulation of analogous conjectural&lt;br/&gt;relationships relating the behavior of such p-adic L-functions to the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding Selmer groups. The investigator, together with several&lt;br/&gt;collaborators, intends to study this kind of conjectural relationship in&lt;br/&gt;some new settings: (1) p-adic analogues of classical Artin L-functions,&lt;br/&gt;(2) families of L-functions associated to certain families of Galois&lt;br/&gt;representations of varying dimension. In addition, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;intends to study relationships between Selmer groups associated to modular&lt;br/&gt;forms and ideal class groups of certain number fields and to study some&lt;br/&gt;unresolved questions about the derivatives of p-adic L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the fundamental questions in the theory of numbers is the study&lt;br/&gt;of solutions of an algebraic equation. The difficulty of this question&lt;br/&gt;depends on the degree of the equation and the number of variables. It&lt;br/&gt;has been understood since antiquity how to study this question when the&lt;br/&gt;degree is one or two and the number of variables is also one or two.&lt;br/&gt;However, the question becomes much more subtle when one considers&lt;br/&gt;equations of degree three, even if the number of variables is just two.&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental conjecture concerning this kind of equation was formulated&lt;br/&gt;in the 1960s by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. Although considerable progress&lt;br/&gt;has been made since then, the conjecture remains unresolved. Such equations&lt;br/&gt;define a class of curves known as "elliptic curves." The study of their&lt;br/&gt;properties has proved to be of importance in crytography - designing codes&lt;br/&gt;for the secure transmission of information. Professor Greenberg intends to&lt;br/&gt;continue his study of "Selmer groups" which have been a traditional tool in&lt;br/&gt;understanding the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and in studying&lt;br/&gt;the conjecture of Birch and Swinnnerton-Dyer. The ultimate goal is to&lt;br/&gt;achieve a deeper understanding of the solutions to the algebraic equations&lt;br/&gt;that define an elliptic curve, and to develop a more general point of view&lt;br/&gt;concerning conjectures analogous to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.</AbstractNarration>
