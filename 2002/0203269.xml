    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Tulsa has created a program that provides sufficient time, guidance, financial support and facilities for undergraduates to undertake and complete a substantial research project in environmental biology. The program provides incentives that make pursuing a graduate degree a very attractive educational path by creating the means to integrate undergraduate work with the Department's Master of Science program, or to prepare for graduate work at some other institution. The heart of the program is year-round independent research fostered through a one-on-one mentoring relationship with a faculty member engaged in research, but it also includes a variety of experiences designed to initiate students into the culture of science. A sophomore/junior-year colloquium that connects extant freshman and senior experiences will not only afford students time and guidance to engage in critical literature review integrated with an invited-speaker series but also will provide a forum for critical peer review of their work and for practice of their presentation skills. New course work in environmental ethics and experimental design will also benefit UMEB students as well as others in the campus community. Each year will culminate in a research symposium where students present their work to the campus community and their families. As part of the research experience, students will attend scientific meetings annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target group for the UMEB program is under-represented groups in the scientific research community. The University of Tulsa is positioned in a metropolitan area with the second highest concentration of urban Native Americans in the country. Although Oklahoma is known for its Native populations, it also has a large number of Historically Black Towns, and more recently Oklahoma has seen a significant rise in its Hispanic population. The Faculty of Biology will also use the UMEB program to improve its mentoring of students, particularly in helping minorities since many do not have established role models in the scientific community. The core of this endeavor involves engaging in a dialogue to improve the faculty's collective mentoring skills based on readings and presentations of consultants from other faculties and the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be evaluated yearly to discern whether its goals are being met and how the program is impacting participating students. That evaluation process will include not only course and overall program evaluation by students but also evaluation of the program by the PIs through review of each participant's progress and the type of students participating in the program. Those results will be shared at national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
