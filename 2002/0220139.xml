    <AbstractNarration>Web-based services delivered on scalable cluster platforms are playing&lt;br/&gt;an increasingly important role in today's society. A key aspect that&lt;br/&gt;has not been sufficiently addressed is delivering scalable performance&lt;br/&gt;with quality of service guarantees. It is all too common that web&lt;br/&gt;services suffer from outages due to unexpected demand. In the future,&lt;br/&gt;as even more computing devices (e.g., Sensor Networks) depend on&lt;br/&gt;services, ensuring scalability, reliability, fault-tolerance and&lt;br/&gt;quality of service will become paramount, and will allow our society&lt;br/&gt;to function normally. This proposal aims at solving the critical&lt;br/&gt;research necessary to achieve this vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the problem of resource management for&lt;br/&gt;Internet services on large-scale clusters, and develop novel solutions&lt;br/&gt;that address the shortcomings of traditional approaches (i.e., poor&lt;br/&gt;resource utilization, high cost, and low flexibility). This work will&lt;br/&gt;develop models that express how clusters share the resources, and will&lt;br/&gt;devise metrics that capture the needs of Internet services. Performing&lt;br/&gt;extensive simulations using workloads of real web services, a variety&lt;br/&gt;of scheduling algorithms and techniques for managing resources will be&lt;br/&gt;analyzed. Results from these studies will be applied in building an&lt;br/&gt;actual cluster research prototype capable of delivering the desired&lt;br/&gt;service guarantees.</AbstractNarration>
