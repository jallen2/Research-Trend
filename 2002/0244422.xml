    <AbstractNarration>The nuclear physics group at California State University, Los Angeles,&lt;br/&gt;studies nuclear structure of low mass nuclei and the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;neutron and proton. These studies use the high energy electron&lt;br/&gt;accelerator at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, and similar lower&lt;br/&gt;energy accelerators at other sites. In the present research period we&lt;br/&gt;will be leading a group to study the nuclear structure of the most&lt;br/&gt;common isotope of helium, helium-4. Helium-4 is an excellent laboratory&lt;br/&gt;for testing theoretical models of how neutrons, protons and exotic&lt;br/&gt;particles combine to form the nuclear ground state. Helium-4 is also of&lt;br/&gt;particular interest because about 25% of the visible mass in the&lt;br/&gt;universe is bound up in helium-4 nuclei. Understanding this nucleus will&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;tell us something significant about a large component of the visible&lt;br/&gt;universe, as well as serve as a testing ground for nuclear theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students and graduate students are significantly involved&lt;br/&gt;with our research. These students participate in the research in&lt;br/&gt;meaningful ways, working directly with us or in teams. They will do and&lt;br/&gt;have done data reduction and analysis, contributed to the construction&lt;br/&gt;of experimental equipment for approved experiments, participated in&lt;br/&gt;running the experiments, and learned how to use Monte Carlo simulation&lt;br/&gt;techniques in understanding complex pieces of apparatus. Our goal is to&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;bring students into a research experience as soon as possible in their&lt;br/&gt;college careers. This experience serves our students well, either if&lt;br/&gt;they decide to go on to graduate level research, or to enter industry,&lt;br/&gt;where their background in team work to solve complex problems will be an&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;advantage. High School science teachers have also contributed to our&lt;br/&gt;research effort by doing data reduction and analysis. We hope to have a&lt;br/&gt;teacher do a Master's thesis in physics using our data.</AbstractNarration>
