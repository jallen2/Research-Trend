    <AbstractNarration>Common Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Techniques suffer from a number of fundamental difficulties limiting their usefulness in quantifying nanoscale interactions. The goal of this CAREER project at Wayne State University is to apply a novel AFM technique based on fiber interferometry and off-resonance, ultra-small amplitude operation to study important questions of the nanomechanics of individual atoms and molecules on surfaces. This includes the manipulation of single atoms and molecules, atomic scale energy dissipation, atomic bonding as a function of controlled tip and surface chemistry, atomic relaxation, and the relationship between AFM and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) imaging. These questions, while of a fundamental nature, are crucial for the rational development of future atomic/molecular scale nanosystems. Combined with this study is an integrated outreach program targeting parents of school age children with a series of lectures and demonstrations designed to illustrate the excitement of scientific research and raise awareness of scientific careers as fulfilling career choices for their children. This outreach program will be conducted in collaboration with local schools and two local science museums. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future of Nanotechnology lies in the controlled manipulation of single atoms and molecules. This lofty goal can only be achieved if we gain solid knowledge of the mechanics of single atoms and molecules. This CAREER project at Wayne State University is designed to use a novel instrument, a "Sub-Angstrom Amplitude Atomic Force Microscope", to measure forces while manipulating single atoms and molecules, and to conduct complementary and important experiments on the 'nanomechanics' of single atoms. These studies will provide crucial knowledge necessary for the design of future nanometer scale devices. Research will involve graduate and undergraduate students at Wayne State University. In addition, the project includes a significant outreach component whereby parents of local school students are provided with an insight into the excitement of scientific research, the stimulating life of a university researcher, and the latest findings in Physics and Nanotechnology. This program, provided through local schools and two local science museums, is designed to raise awareness of scientific careers as fulfilling career choices, and to enlighten the participants about the importance of fundamental and applied science in our society.</AbstractNarration>
