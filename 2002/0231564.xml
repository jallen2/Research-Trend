    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to Colorado State University for Nancy Levinger with the Chemistry REU Leadership Group to host a Workshop for selected REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) and LS-AMP (Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation) Program Directors to explore ways for these two major NSF programs to operate synergistically to lead to mutually beneficial interactions for both programs. Also funded will be travel grants for over 50 students each year to participate in the spring ACS (American Chemical Society) Meetings in 2003 and 2004. These travel awards will leverage additional funds and facilitate the attendance at both of these meetings for 100-150 students participants each year. Inter-institutional interactions and possible collaboration between REU faculty and site directors will also be promoted. Support is also provided for regular meetings of the Chemistry Leadership Group to meet to proceed with implementing the recommendations from the Spring 2001 Workshop for the Chemistry REU Site Directors. Items that these meetings will address also include program evaluation and development, and explore cooperative ventures between different programs.</AbstractNarration>
