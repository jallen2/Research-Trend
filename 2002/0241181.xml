    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT ABSTRACT 0241181&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award support the CCW Rice Genome Sequencing Consortium [Clemson Univ.&lt;br/&gt;Genomics Institute (CUGI), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and Washington&lt;br/&gt;Univ. Genome Sequencing Center (WUGSC)] to continue their rice genome sequencing project that was funded in October 1999. The original goal of the project was to production&lt;br/&gt;sequence, finish and annotate approximately 20 Mb of rice genomic DNA on the short&lt;br/&gt;arms of chromosomes 10 and 3 as part of the International Rice Genome Sequencing&lt;br/&gt;Project (IRGSP). Chromosome 10 is essentially finished and a joint manuscript is in preparation. Chromosome 3 is in progress. In collaboration with the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), the specific objectives of this award is to completely sequence, finish, annotate and publish rice chromosomes 3. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals are: 1) to generate a Phase II draft of rice chromosome 3 (~75% done already with current funding) by December 2002; and 2) completely finish rice chromosome 3 by September 2003, in collaboration with TIGR, in support of the ultimate IRGSP objective of depositing a finished rice genome in GenBank. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An outline of research plan is: &lt;br/&gt;A) Forty-four ~143kb Nipponbare BAC clones (CUGI/Monsanto) anchored to the short&lt;br/&gt;arm of chromosome 3 will be validated for insert integrity and chromosomal location&lt;br/&gt;B) Library development and production sequencing (10X) of the 44 BAC clones will be&lt;br/&gt;performed &lt;br/&gt;C) 44 production sequenced BACs will be finished &lt;br/&gt;D) finishing technology development aimed at establishing robust chemistries and protocols that can be used by the consortium to finish difficult regions of the rice genome.&lt;br/&gt;E) 44 finished BACs will be phase I annotated &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All sequence data will be publicly released according to the "Bermuda" policies.</AbstractNarration>
