    <AbstractNarration>Aurnou&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229791&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding for work in a new experimental fluid&lt;br/&gt;mechanics laboratory at UCLA. The lab will utilize two, new powerful&lt;br/&gt;diagnostic techniques to provide high-resolution, quantitative velocity&lt;br/&gt;measurements of simulated convection in the Earth's outer core. The&lt;br/&gt;results will test long-held theories regarding the properties of&lt;br/&gt;convective flows in core fluids and will provide a detailed&lt;br/&gt;characterization of flow dynamics at nearly planetary parameter values.&lt;br/&gt;The first project will use the recently developed technique of acoustic&lt;br/&gt;Doppler velocimetry to study convecting liquid metals, which have&lt;br/&gt;physical properties similar to that of the molten outer core. The&lt;br/&gt;results will test the linear stability theory of rotating&lt;br/&gt;magnetoconvection, the foundation of modern dynamo theory. Established&lt;br/&gt;by Chandrasekhar in the 1950's, this stability theory has only undergone&lt;br/&gt;a single prior experimental investigation that reached the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;regime. The second project will utilize the optical technique of&lt;br/&gt;particle image velocimetry (PIV), applying it to a rotating spherical&lt;br/&gt;shell of convecting water, a set-up that mimics the dynamics and the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of the outer core. PIV will provide, for the first time,&lt;br/&gt;quantitative measurements of the flow fields (velocity, vorticity and&lt;br/&gt;helicity) that are believed to be essential components of the geodynamo,&lt;br/&gt;but have never been measured adequately by experimental means.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the experimental design will enable PIV to measure&lt;br/&gt;convection in the polar regions, which have not been studied extensively&lt;br/&gt;but now appear to be significant. Together, these state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;acoustic and optical velocimetry techniques will provide benchmarks for&lt;br/&gt;numerical and theoretical studies of core convection and the geodynamo.&lt;br/&gt;They will also generate the highest resolution experimental convection&lt;br/&gt;data to date for interpreting geomagnetic and seismic observations of&lt;br/&gt;the deep Earth.</AbstractNarration>
