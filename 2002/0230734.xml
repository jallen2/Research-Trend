    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230734&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Pezeshki, Charles&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Washington State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Engineering Informatics, An Integrated Approach Toward Analysis and Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes an approach to implement a mechanical and materials &lt;br/&gt;engineering informatics. environment for education, integrating the diverse disciplines &lt;br/&gt;present in the field of mechanics, materials, heat transfer, thermodynamics, fluid &lt;br/&gt;mechanics, dynamics, and control systems around a common set of problems and design &lt;br/&gt;issues centered on MEMS technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to implement this curriculum overhaul, planning monies are requested for four &lt;br/&gt;essential thrusts. These are: &lt;br/&gt; Identifying key software that can be used with current coursework that will &lt;br/&gt;facilitate understanding of fundamental physical phenomena. &lt;br/&gt; Training faculty in the use of that software so that all faculty have a baseline competence with current engineering tools in their discipline. &lt;br/&gt; Developing a set of canonical examples for each discipline that are easy-to-use, &lt;br/&gt;error-free, appropriate for visualizing the desired physical principle, have some &lt;br/&gt;ability to be modified parametrically for use in design studies, and also have some &lt;br/&gt;degree of hierarchical parentage so that they can be used for ABET evaluation &lt;br/&gt;purposes. &lt;br/&gt; Developing a database, accessible over the Internet, for use in our distance &lt;br/&gt;education program that enables students in both our main campus and branch &lt;br/&gt;campus environments to complete examples and share results with both &lt;br/&gt;professors and fellow students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Implementation of such a curriculum change would enable the university to mimic the most sophisticated design/build processes present in industry today at minimal cost, the university equivalent of the .paperless airplane.. Further, it is the environment that our students will be practicing in as sophisticated software becomes ubiquitous in the next ten years.</AbstractNarration>
