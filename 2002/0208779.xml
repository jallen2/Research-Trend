    <AbstractNarration>Cyberlogic is a semantic foundation for implementing evidential&lt;br/&gt;transactions using the public key infrastructure (PKI). Evidential&lt;br/&gt;transactions form the basis of frameworks for authorization and&lt;br/&gt;authentication, electronic commerce, business workflow, and digital&lt;br/&gt;government. Such transactions involve the exchange of physical evidence&lt;br/&gt;in the form of identity cards, driver's licenses, money, checks, visas,&lt;br/&gt;airline tickets, traffic tickets, birth certificates, and stock&lt;br/&gt;certificates, as well as electronic evidence including PIN numbers,&lt;br/&gt;passwords, keys, certificates, and nonces. Cyberlogic is an enabling&lt;br/&gt;foundation for building and analyzing protocols that involve the&lt;br/&gt;exchange of electronic forms of evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyberlogic builds on evidence, public keys, and protocols. First, evidence&lt;br/&gt;is encoded by means of numbers using digital certificates and nonces.&lt;br/&gt;Second, public keys are predicates so that any information $i$ signed by a&lt;br/&gt;private key corresponding to the public key $P$ entails that $P$ holds of&lt;br/&gt;$i$. Indeed, the signed certificate is a proof for the assertion contained&lt;br/&gt;in the certificate. Third, protocols are distributed logic programs that&lt;br/&gt;gather evidence by using both ordinary predicates and digital&lt;br/&gt;certificates. These simple building blocks can be used to&lt;br/&gt;construct a rich variety of services in a variety of domains&lt;br/&gt;ranging from digital government to access control in computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The public key infrastructure (PKI) provides basic services for&lt;br/&gt;encryption, authentication, trust, authorization, and digital&lt;br/&gt;certificates. Cyberlogic is a protocol layer over the PKI that serves as&lt;br/&gt;a reliable foundation for evidential transactions. It provides a&lt;br/&gt;standardized semantic and computational infrastructure for exchanging&lt;br/&gt;evidence in electronic form. With such a foundation, it is possible to&lt;br/&gt;design secure electronic versions of transactions that currently require&lt;br/&gt;physical forms of evidence.</AbstractNarration>
