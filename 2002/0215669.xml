    <AbstractNarration>The funds requested in this proposal are to help support the CAARI 2002:&lt;br/&gt;17th International Conference on the Application of Accelerators in Research and Industry. The conference is jointly sponsored by The Division of Nuclear Physics NSF, The Department of Energy (Nuclear Physics), The American Physical Society, and the University of North Texas. Approximately 1000 participants will attend the conference from 50 countries. The funds requested will be used specifically to help fund the participation of 15 young scientists, who will be invited speakers at the meeting. The conference is composed of 500 presentations on the use of particle accelerators in applied and pure science. The applied science includes topics such as; ion beam analysis of materials, synchrotron experiments, neutron and charged particle activation analysis, ion implantation, and medical radioisotope production and use. The research topics covered include mostly atomic and nuclear physics experiments below an incident beam energy of 25&lt;br/&gt;MeV. Other details of the meeting can be found on our website: http://orgs.unt.edu/CAARI</AbstractNarration>
