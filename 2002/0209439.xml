    <AbstractNarration>This research focuses on understanding the principles of building responsive polymeric materials by means of self-assembly of polymers at surfaces. Applications of the multilayering technique to produce new materials for controlled delivery of chemicals have been recently proposed, yet there is presently no adequate understanding of the response properties of multilayered films. Multilayers will be built using various copolymers that contain centers for both electrostatic and hydrogen bonding; and the fraction of monomer units within a copolymer will be systematically varied to control pH/ionic strength at which the films delaminate or swell. Novel modifications of the polymers will produce non-delaminating films with targeted response properties. The film growth and response properties will be determined by in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, in situ ellipsometry in phase-modulated mode, and permeability ionizations and degree of hydrogen-bonding among the layered molecules. The second will enable measurements of the swelling of the films in different environmental measurements. The question of how they are translated into changes in film density and stability will be addressed. Finally, the knowledge of interlayer interactions, swelling and permeability of the films will be used to build polymeric containers with rationally designed response of the membrane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research might enable the design of novel layered polymer films and capsules with targeted response characteristics. The potential applications of these materials include temporary protection layers, responsive coatings and controlled delivery of chemicals, such as pesticides, fragrances or drugs.</AbstractNarration>
