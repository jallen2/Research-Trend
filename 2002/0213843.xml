    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I addresses the development of a remote-telemetry compatible sensor for measuring reductions in methyl tertiary butyl ether levels in soil at underground storage tank cleanup sites. At present, there are over 160,000 sites with petroleum and methyl tertiary butyl ether contaminated soil, which poses a significant threat to the environment as well as human health and safety. In addition, there are approximately 286,000 underground storage tanks that pose a significant risk to the environment because they are not in compliance with federally mandated leak detection requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sensor would enable the development of a new and improved chemical detection system for identifying methyl tertiary butyl ether levels in soil and to accurately determine the risks of underground storage tanks in cleanup sites.</AbstractNarration>
