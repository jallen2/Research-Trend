    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Program will demonstrate the feasibility of model-guided approach for developing spin dependent tunnel junctions in magnetoelectronic devices. Spin dependent tunnel junctions are at the forefront of nanotechnology that is under intensive research and development worldwide. Spin dependent tunnel devices are expected to be commercialized in about two years in sensor, isolator, and memory. Due to the unique requirements of the tunnel barrier with a nominal thickness of ~1nm and its interfaces with two ferromagnetic layers, an experimental approach by itself is inefficient in developing new junctions. There is a critical need for guidance from a realistic modeling in the fabrication processing, and this project is specifically designed to fulfill this need. Realistic atomistic modeling will be established and experiments will be judicially chosen to demonstrate the feasibility of this integrated approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magneto-random access memories are used in reprogrammable logic, read heads, generic magnetic field sensors, and galvanic isolators and are important components for the electronic storage industry. They have the potential to be applied in other microelectronic devices where thin layers and interfaces are critical.</AbstractNarration>
