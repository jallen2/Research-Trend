    <AbstractNarration>0217131&lt;br/&gt;Fernelius&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. Nils Fernelius, Physicist, Dr. David Zelmon, Electrical Engineer, both in the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio and Dr. Kerim Allahverdi, Senior Scientist, Materials and Chemical Technologies Institute, the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Council (TUBITAK), Marmara Research Center (MRC), Gebze-Kocaeli, Turkey. The investigators plan to make precise measurements of the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices at various infrared wavelengths for pure and doped Galium Selenide (GaSe), so that reliable Sellmeier equations can be constructed. These equations are used in the design of various optical devices such as second harmonic generators and optical parametric oscillators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: &lt;br/&gt;The U.S team has unique capabilities to measure the refractive indices. The Turkish team has expert capability in sample growing and polishing. Both of these capabilities are needed to achieve the research goals. In this cooperative research the staff of the MRC will manufacture GaSe samples as specified by the AFRL staff. These samples will be used by the latter in making precision measurements of the index refraction and to construct the Sellmeier equations. The process will be repeated to narrow the differences between the measured and calculated indices. One of the two U.S. PIs will visit MRC to compare the results of the Sellemeier equations from the obtained data.</AbstractNarration>
