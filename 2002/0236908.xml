    <AbstractNarration>OIA-0236908&lt;br/&gt;Richardson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided to the Potomac Institute For Policy Studies to conduct a study to define and document likely S&amp;T trends and their impacts on national security over the next 20 years. In order to address the goal the following questions will be addressed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-What S&amp;T trends are most likely to yield products to benefit national security?&lt;br/&gt;-What S&amp;T trends are likely to pose dangers to our society? &lt;br/&gt;-How are the important trends likely to evolve and what indicators will herald new and significant capabilities or threats?&lt;br/&gt;-Who will be the most likely producer of the necessary capabilities and threats?&lt;br/&gt;-Are there roadblocks in the way of scientific or technological progress that may deter these capabilities and threats? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least six S&amp;T areas will be examined during the conduct of this project: Advanced Materials; Nanotechnology; Life Sciences; Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; Energy; and Information Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will feed into a larger study (under multi-agency sponsorship) aimed at suggesting ways to improve the quality of science and technology information involved in making decisions on S&amp;T-laden issues at the national security level. This will significantly enhance the nation's ability to develop strategies and policies on issues with important scientific and technical content.</AbstractNarration>
