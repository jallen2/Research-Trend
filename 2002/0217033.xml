    <AbstractNarration>Children can develop a wealth of knowledge about science and technology from their&lt;br/&gt;everyday experience. When visiting museums, watching educational TV, surfing the Web, &lt;br/&gt;or reading science-oriented books, children are actively developing proto-scientific &lt;br/&gt;reasoning skills, nascent theories for scientific domains, knowledge of interesting science&lt;br/&gt;facts, knowledge about famous scientific narratives, and early ideas about what different&lt;br/&gt;kinds of scientists do in their professional work. When children encounter science &lt;br/&gt;instruction in elementary and middle school, when they dream about what they might do &lt;br/&gt;when they grow up, and when they make choices about the courses they want to take in &lt;br/&gt;high school and beyond, those with experience and interest practicing scientific and&lt;br/&gt;technical thinking are more likely to seek it out and to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtually all children and their parents come equipped with the tools needed to cultivate&lt;br/&gt;early math or scientific literacy, but these conversations and activities need to start &lt;br/&gt;from a seed a simple observation, an unexpected outcome, a question. For families with &lt;br/&gt;high levels of scientific literacy and interest, these seeds can be sown from personal&lt;br/&gt;experience. Indeed, more than three quarters of scientists in a recent National&lt;br/&gt;Science Foundation survey reported developing their passion for science in early,&lt;br/&gt;out-of-school activities such as nature walks with their parents, family visits to &lt;br/&gt;museums, or taking apart radios or launching rockets at home. We have no doubt that&lt;br/&gt;museum-based and media-based informal science infrastructure will have a positive &lt;br/&gt;effect on scientific literacy and science achievement, but the biggest effects will be for&lt;br/&gt;those who already are most likely to enter the educational and professional pipe-line &lt;br/&gt;for science and technology--the children of families that go to museums, watch &lt;br/&gt;educational programming, and visit educational web sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interestingly, boys more than girls are most likely to reap these benefits within highly&lt;br/&gt;motivated families. There is evidence to suggest that parents are less likely to bring &lt;br/&gt;their daughters to science museums than their sons, and that even among museum-going&lt;br/&gt;families, parents were more than three times more likely to explain the science of an &lt;br/&gt;exhibit to boys than to girls (true even when the boys and girls were as young as&lt;br/&gt;one to three-years old). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What of families who may not be as comfortable with or as interested in pursuing &lt;br/&gt;science? These parents, already less likely to visit science museums for family&lt;br/&gt;recreation, may also not be aware of how many "teachable moments" exist in everyday &lt;br/&gt;life to prompt conversations with their children about math, science and technology, and&lt;br/&gt;especially so if they're parents of girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on a successful pilot project we propose to seed the development of scientific&lt;br/&gt;and technical literacy by developing, placing, and maintaining engaging gender-sensitive&lt;br/&gt;science-oriented signage in the places where the broadest cross-section of Pittsburgh's &lt;br/&gt;children and families gather. We call these signs "explanatoids." While science museums &lt;br/&gt;and science-oriented media are important forces for informal science education, children&lt;br/&gt;and their families must seek them out over other forms of leisure activity. In contrast, &lt;br/&gt;our explanatoids bring science to the people, in a way that includes girls fully in that &lt;br/&gt;outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are asking for support for three years to develop our pilot work into a full-scale&lt;br/&gt;regional project that can be replicated elsewhere as a gender-sensitive model for&lt;br/&gt;enhancing math/science literacy within a community. The project will include the&lt;br/&gt;development and installation of gender-sensitive signage as well as the production &lt;br/&gt;of associated support materials for parents and teachers throughout the Southwest&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania region. The project will leverage unique partnerships already built between&lt;br/&gt;Family Communications, Inc. (producers of Mister Rogers Neighborhood), local foundations,&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research &amp;&lt;br/&gt;Development Center, Kennywood Amusement Park, The Pittsburgh Teachers Institute,&lt;br/&gt;The Pittsburgh Children's Museum, and The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy. Formative &lt;br/&gt;and summative evaluation will provide quantitative and qualitative measures of the ways&lt;br/&gt;that the project (1) counters negative stereotypes about girls and women in math, &lt;br/&gt;science and technology; (2) enhances girls' interests and successful participation in &lt;br/&gt;those arenas in schooling and career aspirations; and (3) advances the recognition that&lt;br/&gt;math, science and technology are integral to the regions future economic well-being.</AbstractNarration>
