    <AbstractNarration>Timbuktu Academy has succeeded in designing a program that has raised their education focus to an applied level, and directly addressed some of the issues that lead to minority underrepresentation in science, mathematics and engineering. The program achieves this through an alternative approach to mentoring, such that minority students can successfully complete their undergraduate education. To do this, the Timbuktu Academy has brought together all the key elements that make the program a success at the Southern University and A&amp;M College in Baton Rouge. And while the philosophical approach of the program may be different, a subset of the student population responds extremely well to such mentoring activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The achievement of the Timbuktu Academy underscores that, while the leaders have taken a unique approach to science education, the technique has been spectacularly successful.</AbstractNarration>
