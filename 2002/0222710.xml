    <AbstractNarration>The multi-institutional project focuses on a novel integration of video conferencing clients and services with NMI Middleware standards, functions and services. The outcome will be a videoconferencing application directory enabling secure, inter-domain authentication for calls that transit institutional organizational boundaries. A testbed for video middleware will be established to test the architecture, its implementation using multiple products, and the interoperability of these products. Testbed results will be provided to the higher education and research community in the form of a video middleware "cookbook". The project has identified 4 goals.&lt;br/&gt; - develop the NMI Release 1 communications object class for use in H.323, SIP, MPEG2, VRVS and Access Grid implementations&lt;br/&gt; - develop a framework for specification of videoconferencing security requirements&lt;br/&gt; - develop a testbed to deploy and test middleware-ware, inter-operable videoconferencing services.&lt;br/&gt;- disseminate the results through conferences, publications including a Video Middleware Cookbook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is based on substantial experience building ViDe.Net, the international videoconferencing service for higher education. As the global internet becomes a true multi-service infrastructure, use of internet videoconferencing will increase throughout education, including K-12. The ability to look up and connect to resources through secure, easy-to-use interfaces will enable greater use of this technology to enhances classroom instruction and overcome geographic and economic disadvantage.</AbstractNarration>
