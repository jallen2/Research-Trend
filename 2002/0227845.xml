    <AbstractNarration>EIA - 0227845&lt;br/&gt;Yanco, H &lt;br/&gt;Univ of Massachusetts at Lowell &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Student Travel to the AAAI Robot Competition and Exhibition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for fifteen students, with special efforts made to incorporate women and underrepresented minorities, to attend and participate in the AAAI Robot Competition and Exhibition at the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2002) in Edmonton, Alberta. This event brings together robotics researchers from colleges, universities and research laboratories to compete and to demonstrate cutting edge, state of the art research in this area. Students attending benefit from observing demonstrations of the research, networking with students from other institutions with similar interests, presenting and discussing their own research, and through a significant mentoring program. Every supported student will be expected to write a one or two page report on her or his experiences at the competition and exhibition. These reports will be used in evaluating the success of the funded student participation in the event.</AbstractNarration>
