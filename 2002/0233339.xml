    <AbstractNarration>Power distribution voltages and insulation are areas of critical importance to the study of SSP systems. Due &lt;br/&gt;to the importance of the mass and cost of the SSP system, most designs for the SSP operate at high voltages &lt;br/&gt;in order to reduce transmission losses and mass. Some design concepts even use no insulation. Use of these &lt;br/&gt;high voltages will present challenges of electrical breakdown and performance of insulators, insulation, and &lt;br/&gt;switchgear. As a result, there is a strong research motivation for technology geared towards enhancement of &lt;br/&gt;PMAD systems exposed to electrical breakdown and corona type faults. In harsh environments (aerospace), economic and effective fault management (maintenance and monitoring of electric power systems) is needed to ensure high performance. In the effective fault management of the aerospace environment, the maintenance cost of aging distribution cables is a major consideration. The installation and maintenance of the equipment on board the SSP is also of high significance. These operations can be significantly improved by more accurate predictions of insulating aging, as well as detection and location of faults within the components of the power system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on the design of an integrated system using state-of-the-art technology for &lt;br/&gt;continuous and periodic monitoring of a space power system with emphasis on the detection and diagnosis &lt;br/&gt;of corona and soft faults. This scheme involves the cost effective, efficient monitoring and control for an &lt;br/&gt;enhanced space solar power network. A network of sensors will monitor the network, report information &lt;br/&gt;for the detection of faults, and provide health-status information of electrical insulation and other &lt;br/&gt;components in the system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Energy Systems and Control (CESaC), Howard University is one of the research centers in &lt;br/&gt;the US that has demonstrated capabilities in the following combination of fields: Power system analysis in &lt;br/&gt;the terrestrial, non-terrestrial, naval systems, and spacecraft energy power systems; Application of &lt;br/&gt;optimization techniques to improve the solution of different problems, and applications of intelligent &lt;br/&gt;systems to the solution of complex problems. This combination is necessary for completion of the complex &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary tasks that will be faced in this project. The project will create an opportunity for students &lt;br/&gt;from differing branches of electrical engineering - material sciences, communications, power systems and &lt;br/&gt;controls - to become aware of modern problems in the power industry and contribute to the technical &lt;br/&gt;progress in this field.</AbstractNarration>
