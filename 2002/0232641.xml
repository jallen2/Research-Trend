    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will test the feasibility of an innovative method for extending traditional Location-Based Services clients into a real-time, 3D spatially correct, interactive system that interacts with virtual information embedded into mission-critical environments. The demand for 'point-of-need' information delivery is most evident in mission-critical environments typical of first responders, homeland security and other themed-specific situations. However, current LBS's suffer from inadequate networks, clients, delivery mechanisms and imprecise spatial/contextual relationships between the physical environment and virtual media information. VRGIS Corporation proposes an innovative Enhanced Location-Based Services system that integrates Geographic Information Systems, Global Positioning Systems, wireless and augmented reality technologies to enhance in situ 'Just-In-Time' information and communication layers aware of both a user's physical environment and information requirements. By accessing this system through an augmented client (PDA, portable, wearable computing devices), users can maneuver through mission-critical environments interacting with 3D positioned, real-time, intelligent data points derived from online GIS databases, early warning systems, critical building information, sensors, hydrological data and communications through a multi-user network.&lt;br/&gt; The proffered technology has the potential to produce an Enhanced Location-Based 3D software client that can be utilized in homeland security and emergency services applications.</AbstractNarration>
