    <AbstractNarration>Proposal 0242218&lt;br/&gt;Group Travel Grant to 2003 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation&lt;br/&gt;PI: Yuan Zheng&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, is the best event in terms of quality and quantity in the areas of robotics and automation, and has served as a forum gathering international researchers for presentation and discussion of emerging technologies. This project is to support about 45 U.S. researchers to participate in the 2003 ICRA that will be held in Taipei, Taiwan, May 12-17, 2003. The primary objective is to help U.S. researchers participate in this key international conference, who could not otherwise attend the Conference. U.S. researchers will maintain a highly competitive position in research by presenting research results, discussion, and exchange information with researchers from all over the world. This project strongly supports minority group researchers and students who would need financial support for their participation in the 2003 ICRA.</AbstractNarration>
