    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is the automated reconstruction of highly accurate photorealistic descriptions of large-scale 3D scenes with a minimum of human interaction and increased computational efficiency. Recent developments in laser-range sensing technology make possible the acquisition of accurate 3D scans of large-scale scenes. Dense and complex 3D range data-sets along with high resolution color imagery (ground and aerial-based) will be utilized. Research will be carried in the areas of range segmentation (in order to handle the geometric complexity), automatic registration between range and 2D images, 3D modeling, fusion of aerial photography, and visualization. The proposed research is going to directly affect applications in the areas of urban planning, urban design, disaster prevention, electronic journalism, architecture, archeology, historical preservation, and entertainment. The novel solutions that will be developed will have a direct effect on the educational agenda of the PI and on his outreach activities. The cross-fertilization between Computer Science, Geography, and Film and Media departments is another priority. Finally, collaboration with institutions such as museums, and with companies concentrated on 3D site modeling and site construction is an essential step for forwarding this research out of the academic environment.</AbstractNarration>
