    <AbstractNarration>0224957&lt;br/&gt;Ponganis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the effects of the iceberg, B-15, on the emperor&lt;br/&gt;penguin population at Cape Crozier. The population of this southernmost of emperor&lt;br/&gt;penguin colonies, although sometimes fluctuating radically, had steadily grown in past&lt;br/&gt;years, with as many as 1200 chicks counted. This probably represented an adult&lt;br/&gt;population of 2400-3000 birds. However, in 2001, after B-15 ground into the Cape&lt;br/&gt;Crozier area during the winter breeding period, no live emperor chicks were found. The&lt;br/&gt;colony had disappeared. The goal of this project is to determine if the colony will re-&lt;br/&gt;establish itself at Cape Crozier or relocate nearby to a different site. If the colony&lt;br/&gt;reestablishes at Cape Crozier, we will estimate the previous year's loss with a census of&lt;br/&gt;the chicks present this year. The destruction of the colony site by the iceberg in 2001&lt;br/&gt;represents a natural experiment to examine the resilience of breeding emperors to short&lt;br/&gt;term disasters. Broader impacts of this study are related to the historical importance and&lt;br/&gt;worldwide interest in this colony as it was the first emperor colony discovered, and has&lt;br/&gt;probably the longest census record of any penguin colony.</AbstractNarration>
