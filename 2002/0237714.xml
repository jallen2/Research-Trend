    <AbstractNarration>A conference on Cat-CVD (Hot-Wire CVD) Processing, http://www.nrel.gov/cat-cvd2/ , will be held in Denver, CO September 10-13, 2002. The conference objective is to provide a forum for discussion to assess and understand the deposition of Si and other thin film related materials by the Cat-CVD (Hot-Wire CVD) process, to address deposition related processing issues, and investigate new applications which may lead to industrial utilization of this rapidly maturing technology. &lt;br/&gt;The program is organized as a workshop-style conference to provide an interdisciplinary forum for device engineers, solid state physicists, and materials scientists to discuss topics of common interest both formally through invited and contributed presentations, and informally during a variety of events including a poster presentation session. Objectives are to stimulate communications among the community of researchers addressing Hot-Wire CVD Processing and its relationship to technology. A variety of disciplinary backgrounds-chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science, is represented and contrributes positively to the intellectual content of the Conference. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established between universities, government research institutions, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;An evaluation of the progress and status of Hot-Wire CVD Processing and related device issues along with current assessments of the most important developments will be of significant value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of electronic materials in computing, data processing, and communications. To promote and sustain the growth of such technologies, it is vital to attract the support, enthusiasm, and interest of young researchers and students. To this end, sessions will be held sequentially, and special efforts made to ensure information exchange in an informal setting. Leading scientists in the Si field have committed to attend the conference, so there will be opportunity for interactions between researchers of all levels of experience in Cat-CVD. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
