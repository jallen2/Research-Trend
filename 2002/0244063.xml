    <AbstractNarration>Undergraduate research training in the field of molecular biophysics is available at Princeton University under the NSF REU Site program, Summer Research in Molecular Biophysics. The field of molecular biophysics can be characterized by its focus on the application of research methods and intellectual approaches drawn from the mathematical and physical sciences aimed at advancing molecular-level understanding of biological systems. The need for scientific personnel trained in this area has been widely acknowledged, both to serve practical national needs and to advance scholarship in the field. The program aims to attract students majoring in physical and mathematical sciences who wish to work on problems of biology. A goal of this program is to expose students to contemporary problems for which our state of knowledge is being significantly advanced by cross-disciplinary approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site program builds on a summer minority research program with a track record of successful recruitment through active contacts in science and math departments at many historically-minority undergraduate institutions. Thus, the program aims to draw applicants from the qualified minority pool mainly from schools without graduate programs. As well, an international arrangement for exchange of undergraduate students in biophysical sciences with Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden offers an optional summer research abroad opportunity for students who successfully complete a summer research program at Princeton in the previous year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central feature of the on-campus program is nine weeks of summer research with individual faculty selected for their experience in and dedication to effective mentoring. Faculty mentors are drawn from the participating departments of applied and computational mathematics, chemistry, chemical engineering, computer science, molecular biology, and physics. In addition, biophysics students participate in summer activities on campus aimed at promoting careers in scholarship. Training in scientific ethics is offered, as well as basic education in the application of the scientific method, the nature of scientific inquiry, and the development of knowledge, and training in the use of web-based informatics and structure analysis tools. Students who successfully complete a summer in the program and their undergraduate degree requirements can request to be reviewed for early admission into the relevant departmental graduate program at Princeton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is open to students completing the sophomore or junior year. The closing date for applications is March 1st each year. Electronic applications are available on the program's website: http://www.princeton.edu/~chemdept/mbp/sumprog.html. The point-of-contact for student recruitment is Kirsten Erwin, Undergraduate Administrator, Chemistry Department (609) 258-5015; kirsten@princeton.edu.</AbstractNarration>
