    <AbstractNarration>Award number: 0228784&lt;br/&gt;PI: Devendra P. Garg &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Duke University&lt;br/&gt;Title: A Multi-Sensor Fused Intelligent Biomemetic Microrobot&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes an in-depth analytical investigation, design, and development of an innovative and unconventional multi-sensor-fused architecture for a biomimetic microrobot. This device would derive its inspiration from nature and integrate the physical and biological characteristics of several insects. The microrobot would prove to be a great asset for applications in a variety of scientific and engineering systems that acquire, process, and integrate information gathered from multiple knowledge sources. Specific examples of capabilities to be included are the visual, auditory, proximity, olfactory, and communication faculties. The proposed architecture and the microrobot could be gainfully employed for reconnaissance and information retrieval in unstructured and uncertain environments. An example of such a situation is that presented by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Other crucial tasks that the proposed microrobot could perform include that of surveillance and target acquisition. The operation of the microrobot would be remote; hence the communication protocol would be wire-free. In addition to developing a sound mathematical basis, the proposed microrobot architectures functioning and performance will be verified via exhaustive computer simulations, building a prototype microrobot, and validating the results by exposing the microrobot to a variety of unstructured environments during laboratory experiments.</AbstractNarration>
