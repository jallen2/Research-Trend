    <AbstractNarration>The theory of special values of L-functions is a major, active area of&lt;br/&gt;research within the general fields of number theory and arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. Stark's Main Conjecture provides a link between&lt;br/&gt;special values of Artin L-functions and the arithmetic of the associated&lt;br/&gt;Galois extensions. In recent years, Rubin and Popescu have formulated&lt;br/&gt;refined, integral versions of Stark's Main Conjecture in the case of&lt;br/&gt;abelian L-functions of arbitrary order of vanishing at the origin. Also,&lt;br/&gt;Burns and Flach, by reworking earlier conjectures of Bloch-Kato and&lt;br/&gt;Fontaine-Perrin Riou, have formulated the Equivariant Tamagawa Number&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture for certain classes of motivic L-functions. If restricted to&lt;br/&gt;the case of Artin L-functions, the Burns-Flach conjecture can also be&lt;br/&gt;viewed as a refined, integral version of Stark's Main Conjecture. The&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator focuses on providing evidence for, studying the&lt;br/&gt;functorial behavior of, and finding links between the Conjectures of&lt;br/&gt;Rubin, Popescu, and Burns-Flach. He also works on developing&lt;br/&gt;Gross-type p-adic refinements of these statements, as well as building&lt;br/&gt;bridges between these statements and the Theory of Euler Systems,&lt;br/&gt;Equivariant Iwasawa Theory, and the Conjectures of Brumer, Leopoldt, and&lt;br/&gt;Chinburg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The L-functions are mathematical objects of analytic (continuous) nature,&lt;br/&gt;encoding an enormous amount of extremely interesting and useful&lt;br/&gt;information of arithmetic (discrete) nature. The main goal of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to continue a program initiated by Stark, Rubin, the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator, and Burns-Flach, and develop general recipes (conjectures)&lt;br/&gt;aimed at retrieving the arithmetic data encoded in a special type of&lt;br/&gt;L-functions (the Artin L-functions), and follow these recipes (in other&lt;br/&gt;words prove these conjectures) in several important special cases. In&lt;br/&gt;parallel, the Principal Investigator is developing links between these&lt;br/&gt;conjectures and other, already developed theories, dealing with objects of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic (discrete) nature, such as the theory of Euler Systems and&lt;br/&gt;Equivariant Iwasawa Theory. Aside from its importance for the central&lt;br/&gt;areas of pure mathematics called number theory and arithmetic algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, this research could have far reaching practical applications to&lt;br/&gt;the development of new data encryption algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
