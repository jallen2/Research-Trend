    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of creating a system that automatically generates personalized broadcasts from a library of audio / video (rich media) content. Such a system is needed because individuals are overloaded with rich media content and lack advanced tools for navigating this deluge of rich media. Building upon StreamSage's existing expertise in dealing with rich media information, StreamSage's research will alleviate this problem by creating a system capable of creating "personalized rich media broadcasts" that automatically characterize the gaps between disjointed segments of content and fill these gaps with bridging text that provides necessary background and structure to the segments from multiple rich media files.&lt;br/&gt; The effort in Phase I will expand the current-state-of-the-art by developing algorithms capable of automatically identifying the types of gaps between the rich media segments and by establishing methods by which the information necessary for coherently bridging these gaps can be automatically extracted from the rich media files. The personalized broadcast system created by this research would greatly improve end-user interactions with the rich media content by intelligently ordering and bridging the content pushed or pulled to the end-user. Additionally, an automated personalized broadcast system would enable the pushing of rich media content on a large scale, which has been impossible to date because of the tremendous manual intervention required to create a broadcast of usable quality.</AbstractNarration>
