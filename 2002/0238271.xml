    <AbstractNarration>In recent times much has been said about how, once deployed, networks&lt;br/&gt;of devices with wireless communication capabilities will affect the way&lt;br/&gt;we work, learn, interact, organize, get entertained, fight wars, and&lt;br/&gt;recover from disasters. This interest in wireless networks has led to&lt;br/&gt;a fair amount of research activity in the areas of mobile and ad-hoc&lt;br/&gt;networking, addressing both systems and theory issues. However, not&lt;br/&gt;much research work has been done on fundamental information theoretic&lt;br/&gt;concepts related to wireless *sensor* networks, i.e., networks of tiny,&lt;br/&gt;low power, unreliable devices equipped with very limited sensing and&lt;br/&gt;communication capabilities, and embedded in the environment. This&lt;br/&gt;project is primarily about the study of fundamental performance limits&lt;br/&gt;for large-scale wireless sensor networks. Specifically, there are&lt;br/&gt;three problems, deeply intertwined with each other, and very relevant&lt;br/&gt;in practice, on which we concentrate our efforts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Source Coding problems, dealing with the design and performance&lt;br/&gt;analysis of codes and signal processing algorithms for the random fields&lt;br/&gt;generated by sensor nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Routing problems, dealing with design and performance analysis of&lt;br/&gt;protocols and signal processing algorithms for moving sensor data *within*&lt;br/&gt;the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Reachback Communication problems, dealing with the design and&lt;br/&gt;performance analysis of codes and signal processing algorithms for moving&lt;br/&gt;sensor data *out* of the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solution to problems of source coding, routing, and reachback&lt;br/&gt;communication in sensor networks requires a "marriage" of networking&lt;br/&gt;and communication theoretic concepts. This presents an interesting&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for innovation in education, since networking is typically&lt;br/&gt;regarded as a "pure CS" topic, whereas communication theory is typically&lt;br/&gt;regarded as a "pure EE" topic. All of my educational and outreach&lt;br/&gt;activities (undergraduate and graduate course development, lab development,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate textbook development, service to community) are designed&lt;br/&gt;around the general goal of providing a solid theoretical basis to our&lt;br/&gt;students in networking and communications, as well as the more specific&lt;br/&gt;goal of highlighting the interplay between these concepts in the context&lt;br/&gt;of wireless sensor networks.</AbstractNarration>
