    <AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to the Spin Electronics for the 21st Century Initiative, Program Solicitation NSF 02-036. The proposal focuses on the application of semiconductor nanostructures in the emerging field of spin-based electronics. The program objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To explore demonstrations of the spintronic applications of nanostructures, including nanoscale implementations of the spin filter, the spin valve, and the spin transistor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To undertake experimental investigations of spin-polarized transport in semiconductor nanostructures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To perform theoretical studies of the spin-dependent electronic structure of semiconductor nanostructures, and of the mechanisms of spin decoherence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key outcome of this research is expected to be the development of a crucial understanding of the manner in which the unique properties of semiconductor nanostructures may be exploited in future spintronic devices. An important aspect of this program is its coordinated structure. The principal investigators have proven track records in the experimental and theoretical study of semiconductor nanostructures, and their collaboration is expected to result in a highly multidisciplinary interaction. The research program itself explores the implementation of complicated spintronic devices, such as the spin valve or the spin transistor, by integrating nanoscale implementations of the most basic of spin devices, the spin filter. Theoretical modeling explores the spin-resolved subband structure in these devices, the mechanisms for spin decoherence, and the transport properties of the structures being investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its scientific importance, this program also contributes to the creation of a superior environment for graduate and undergraduate education at Arizona State University. Its pedagogic impact is further enhanced by the collaborations it promotes with researchers at national laboratories in the US (Sandia) and Japan (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST). Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project benefit greatly from the opportunities provided by these collaborations. A significant component of these collaborations, for example, is the opportunities they provide for student internship during this program. At the same time, undergraduate involvement in this program is encouraged by coordinating the research with the two-semester senior-design projects, which form one of the graduation requirements of the undergraduate program in the Electrical Engineering Department. As we have done in the past, we continue to make efforts to involve both underrepresented minorities and women in this program. A valuable opportunity for wider outreach is provided by the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program, which we have a record of involvement in and which actively encourages female high-school students to enter engineering programs. Dissemination of the results of this program is promoted through publications in the top peer-review journals, student and faculty participation in conferences, and the posting of related material on a central web resource that is being developed under an existing NSF-sponsored project.</AbstractNarration>
