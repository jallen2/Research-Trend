    <AbstractNarration>AST-0204127&lt;br/&gt;Shelus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) experiment accurately measures the round-trip travel time for a &lt;br/&gt;laser pulse that is emitted from an observing station on the Earth and returns after bouncing off &lt;br/&gt;of a retroreflector array on the surface of the Moon. Such observations have been made at &lt;br/&gt;McDonald Observatory for more than 30 years. The data provide for varied, multi-disciplinary &lt;br/&gt;and inter-disciplinary science results in areas of solid Earth sciences, geodesy and geodynamics, &lt;br/&gt;solar system ephemerides, terrestrial and celestial reference frames, lunar physics, general &lt;br/&gt;relativity and gravitational physics. Standing alone or combined with data from other observing &lt;br/&gt;techniques, LLR expands the understanding of the precession of the Earth.s spin axis, the lunar &lt;br/&gt;nutation, Earth orientatation, the Earth.s obliquity to the ecliptic, the intersection of the celestial &lt;br/&gt;equator and the ecliptic, lunar and solar solid body tides, lunar tidal deceleration, lunar physical &lt;br/&gt;and free librations, the structure of the moon and energy dissipation in the lunar interior. LLR &lt;br/&gt;provides input into lunar surface cartography and surveying and helps determine Earth station &lt;br/&gt;and lunar surface retroreflector locations and motions, mass of the Earth-Moon system, lunar and &lt;br/&gt;terrestrial gravity harmonics and Love numbers, relativistic geodesic precession, and the &lt;br/&gt;equivalence principle of general relativity. Due to the passive nature of the reflectors and the &lt;br/&gt;improvement of observing equipment and data analysis capabilities with time, LLR data will &lt;br/&gt;continue to provide for improved results. Gains are steady and, as the data base expands, we are &lt;br/&gt;striving to learn even more by applying more clever observation strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this proposal, we continue the LLR observational effort at the McDonald Laser Ranging &lt;br/&gt;Station (MLRS). With routine single-person operation and a 24 hour/day, 7 day/week schedule, &lt;br/&gt;lunar coverage will be substantial in the years to come, as we share the use of the MLRS with &lt;br/&gt;artificial satellite laser ranging (SLR) efforts. We are cooperating with other observing efforts &lt;br/&gt;around the world, especially the French LLR/SLR station in the south of France. In addition to &lt;br/&gt;the observations, an analysis effort with world-wide communication, cooperation, and &lt;br/&gt;coordination will be ongoing here at the University of Texas at Austin. We cooperate with &lt;br/&gt;analysis efforts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the &lt;br/&gt;Paris Observatory, and the BKG in Frankfurt and Munich. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the University of Texas McDonald Observatory, since the inception of the International &lt;br/&gt;Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) in 1998, houses the ILRS LLR Operations and Analysis Center. &lt;br/&gt;The small size of the LLR observing network, and the relatively small number of LLR analysis &lt;br/&gt;centers, dictate the unique nature and operational procedures of this LLR Operations/Analysis &lt;br/&gt;Center. The responsibility of the LLR Operations Center has evolved to be one that assures the &lt;br/&gt;smooth flow of data through the LLR network, in a form and format that is useful for obtaining &lt;br/&gt;scientific results. The center also coordinates the observations and their scheduling in a manner &lt;br/&gt;to maximum the scientific gains. Predicts are coordinated on-site at each LLR station and the &lt;br/&gt;data are automatically transferred from all observing sites to the ILRS data centers. LLR data &lt;br/&gt;analysts can secure their data directly from the data centers as needed. Feed-back from these &lt;br/&gt;analysts often goes directly back to the individual observing stations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the auspices of this National Science Foundation Grant, we are looking forward to &lt;br/&gt;additional years of successful LLR observation and analysis, resulting in the steady and rapid expansion of scientific results. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
