    <AbstractNarration>The project focuses on the development of high-performance computational &lt;br/&gt;tools for financial engineering. The goal is to develop computational &lt;br/&gt;methods to evaluate complex financial products used to manage foreign &lt;br/&gt;exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity and energy price risks and credit &lt;br/&gt;risk, and manage large portfolios of assets. The methodology is based on &lt;br/&gt;extensions to financial engineering of finite-element methods successfully &lt;br/&gt;used in diverse branches of engineering to solve numerically multi-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional partial differential and integral equations. Partial integro-&lt;br/&gt;differential equations arise in the study of Markov jump-diffusion processes &lt;br/&gt;and associated optimal stopping and stochastic control problems in financial &lt;br/&gt;engineering. The aim of the present proposal is to develop both the &lt;br/&gt;necessary mathematical theory to extend finite element methods to jump-&lt;br/&gt;diffusion processes and develop high-performance computational tools &lt;br/&gt;based on these methods that can be effectively implemented and used by &lt;br/&gt;industry practitioners in the financial services, as well as researchers in &lt;br/&gt;financial engineering, applied probability and branches of operations &lt;br/&gt;research that use continuous-time Markov processes. Specific challenges in &lt;br/&gt;financial engineering to be addressed in the project include high &lt;br/&gt;dimensionality and jumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methodologies developed in this project will help financial institutions, &lt;br/&gt;corporate treasuries and energy companies accurately value complex &lt;br/&gt;financial instruments, efficiently manage risk of financial transactions, and &lt;br/&gt;dynamically manage portfolios of assets. In addition to financial &lt;br/&gt;engineering, we anticipate that this project will have a broader impact on &lt;br/&gt;research and application areas that use continuous-time Markov processes as &lt;br/&gt;a modeling framework. Constructive approximations and computational &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for jump-diffusion processes developed in this project should &lt;br/&gt;prove useful for diverse areas of application that use jump-diffusion &lt;br/&gt;processes. This proposal will support the new Ph.D. major in financial &lt;br/&gt;engineering at Northwestern University. This new Ph.D. major will result in &lt;br/&gt;training of highly qualified researchers in financial engineering. This project &lt;br/&gt;is a part of the long-term development effort at Northwestern University in &lt;br/&gt;the area of financial engineering. This project will also help the Department &lt;br/&gt;of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Nevada Las Vegas establish a &lt;br/&gt;research program in financial mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
