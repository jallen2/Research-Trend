    <AbstractNarration>The central object of study are Schrodinger operators with potentials&lt;br/&gt;displaying aperiodic order. In one dimension there have been recent&lt;br/&gt;advances in the understanding of their spectral and quantum dynamical&lt;br/&gt;properties, particularly in the case of the Fibonacci potential and&lt;br/&gt;related models, so-called Sturmian potentials, which are the standard&lt;br/&gt;models of one-dimensional quasicrystals. It is the goal of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research to extend the theory to larger classes of potentials in one&lt;br/&gt;dimension and to tackle the higher dimensional case. A crucial tool in one&lt;br/&gt;dimension is the trace map, an energy-indexed dynamical system which can&lt;br/&gt;be used to characterize and study the spectrum of the operators. Along&lt;br/&gt;with combinatorial partition results and Gordon-type criteria one can&lt;br/&gt;obtain good bounds on generalized eigenfunctions from which one can deduce&lt;br/&gt;spectral and quantum dynamical consequences. It appears feasible that this&lt;br/&gt;approach is applicable to potentials beyond the class of Sturmian&lt;br/&gt;potentials -- sufficiently low complexity should suffice to induce&lt;br/&gt;partitions and trace maps. In higher dimensions the main goal is to find&lt;br/&gt;an analog of Gordon's criterion which can serve as a link between&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and spectral theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematics of aperiodic order is a young emerging field that has&lt;br/&gt;sparked a lot of research activity since the mid-nineties. Researchers&lt;br/&gt;from disciplines as diverse as spectral theory, group theory, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, combinatorics, and algebraic topology have found a common&lt;br/&gt;ground that was motivated by the discovery of quasicrystals in 1984&lt;br/&gt;and the subsequent reconsideration of the nature of order and ordered&lt;br/&gt;structures. By now, quite a number of structural models for quasicrystals&lt;br/&gt;have been proposed. Joint efforts are being undertaken to investigate&lt;br/&gt;their properties and shed light on why quasicrystals exist, how they form,&lt;br/&gt;why they are stable. Regarding their electronic transport properties, it&lt;br/&gt;is expected that quasicrystals may exhibit anomalous behavior. It is&lt;br/&gt;therefore planned to study transport properties of Sturmian and related&lt;br/&gt;models from this perspective.</AbstractNarration>
