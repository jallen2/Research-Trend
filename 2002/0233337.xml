    <AbstractNarration>0233337&lt;br/&gt;Hoffman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award supports US-France collaboration in neuroscience and sensory systems between Larry F. Hoffman at the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Lee Moore at the Laboratory of the Neurobiology of Network Sensors at the University of Paris VI. The investigators propose to develop a new approach to investigate central processing mechanisms into the central nervous system of afferent neurons from individual vestibular end organs. They will conduct experiments and modeling studies designed to reveal the biophysical bases of processing and neural computation in second order vestibular neurons. The investigations focus on the convergence of dynamically diverse afferents projecting from the horizontal semicircular canal in the ear. The experimental component will be conducted by the US group, taking advantage of instrumental and experimental expertise in natural vestibular stimuli and electrophysiologic recordings. The French investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in neuron biophysics. He will integrate his methods into the preparation of in situ electrophysiology performed by the UCLA lab. The vestibular nucleus neurons will be characterized and subsequently imaged by confocal microscopy. The images will then be utilized in the modeling component conducted by the French group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator. The CNRS will support the visits of the French investigator. The proposal will advance understanding of afferent sensory neuron input in the central nervous system and biomedical understanding of balance and movement disorders.</AbstractNarration>
