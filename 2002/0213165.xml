    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Richard Kemp, Department of Chemistry, University of New Mexico, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for research into the rapid fixation of carbon dioxide into organic molecules. There is a need for C-11 containing compounds for several applications, including positron emission tomography (PET). Due to the short half-life of C-11 rapid incorporation of C-11 carbon dioxide is required if these species are to be obtained. The objective of this research is to develop routes to incorporate C-11 carbon dioxide into organic products in less than one hour. Carbon dioxide is known to slowly insert into subvalent group 14 amides to produce isocyanate and/or carbodiimide. Building on the observation that changes in ligand structure and main group metal can dramatically affect CO2 incorporation rates, low-valent Ge, Sn, and Pb reagents will be prepared with a variety of ligands. Their reaction with carbon dioxide will be studied in order to determine the factors that influence the reaction rate. Group 14 compounds will then be developed into catalysts by using various silylated organic amines as substrates. Finally, related compounds not based on Group 14 bis(amides), which should also react with CO2 to produce isocyanates, will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, methods will be developed to rapidly incorporate radioactive C-11 into organic molecules. These species are required for several applications including PET. This is a GOALI project that involves collaborative efforts between the University of New Mexico and General Electric Corp. The research includes developing the basic science behind rapid carbon dioxide incorporation. The eventual goal is new industrial preparations of valuable radioactive products. Both graduate and postdoctoral students will gain experience in multitask interdisciplinary objectives as part of a collaboration with industry. It is likely that students from traditionally under-represented groups will participate in this research.</AbstractNarration>
