    <AbstractNarration>Access Science, a renewed GK-12 project, supports fellows at the University of Pennsylvania from the departments of Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, for educational activities with grade K-12 students in the urban public schools in West Philadelphia. The school population is 98% African American. Penn's Center for Community Partnership participates in the project. Ten graduate students and twenty advanced undergraduates are supported per year. The themes are hands-on and inquiry based science, mathematics, engineering and technology. The nature of the schools involved result in a broad impact of this project on populations that are currently underrepresented in the sciences, technology, mathematics, and engineering professions. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: GK-12 Access Science: Today's Teachers and Tomorrow's Scientists Teaching and Learning Together&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dennis DeTurck&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;Partner School Districts: School District of Philadelphia, West and Southwest Area Offices&lt;br/&gt;Number of Fellows/year: 10 graduate; 20 Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;Funding: $1,496,070 Total for 3 years&lt;br/&gt;Grade Bands: K-12&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Urban&lt;br/&gt;Disciplines: Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Engineering</AbstractNarration>
