    <AbstractNarration>Despite recent economic downturns, the demand for skilled information technology (IT) professionals in the United States and in Central Florida remains significant. Community colleges play significant roles in the success of students (especially underrepresented populations) who pursue high skill, high wage technical degrees and careers such as those in IT-related areas. Valencia CC's project provides educational opportunities to low-income, academically talented students through scholarships and support services that promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement in six Associate in Science degree programs related to computer technology and engineering technology: Computer Engineering Technology (CET), Computer Information Technology (CIT), Computer Programming and Analysis (CP&amp;A), Database Technology (DBT), E-Business Technology (EBT), and Electronics Engineering Technology (EET). Project objectives include increasing the number of full-time students, establishing higher retention rates, and establishing higher placement rates. Valencia CC awards 30 scholarships each year to full-time students pursuing the targeted degree programs, for a total of 120 scholarships over the four-year grant period. Student must meet all CSEMS eligibility requirements and are recruited through extensive existing recruitment strategies. Valencia's IT and EET programs are nationally recognized for being well defined, current, and rigorous in content, with curriculum that is relevant and responsive to the needs of the business community. High academic performance is encouraged through supplemental advisement services. A small portion of the project funds are allocated to management costs and support programs and services designed to enhance&lt;br/&gt;student learning, confidence, performance, retention, and placement. The student support services strategies include student advisement and mentoring by faculty and industry representatives, recruitment and retention activities, and the availability of industry-based internships for scholarship recipients.&lt;br/&gt;Internships not only supplement classroom-based learning experiences; they provide students with networking opportunities critical to finding eventual employment after graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marketing to students is targeted at: (1) current Valencia students in the targeted programs who have at least 25 percent of their coursework remaining; (2) high school seniors and recent high school graduates who are or were enrolled in dual enrollment programs related to the targeted programs; (3) high school seniors and recent high school graduates who are or were enrolled in schools with high minority student populations; (4) female high school seniors and recent high school graduates who have or had an interest in IT or EET programs. The likelihood of success in achieving the objectives of this project are increased by the fact that Valencia will be able to implement the project rapidly by building upon existing academic and support services.</AbstractNarration>
