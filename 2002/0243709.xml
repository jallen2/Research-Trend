    <AbstractNarration>The REU program in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State University offers to undergraduate students the opportunity to do forefront research in a field of physics -- nuclear, condensed matter, high-energy, or astrophysics. Approximately twenty students participate in the program each summer. They live and work on the MSU campus for a 10-week period. Seminars, field trips, social activities, and sports are planned, in addition to the individual research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student in the program will work on a well-defined research project under the direction of a faculty mentor. A wide variety of projects is available, both experimental and theoretical. In nuclear physics, MSU is the site of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory; research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities include experimental nuclear physics, accelerator and detector design and testing, and theoretical studies. Condensed matter physics includes basic solid-state physics and properties of new materials. REU projects in high-energy physics are done at MSU, relating to experiments at Fermilab and CERN. In the field of astrophysics, a 24-inch reflecting telescope is available at MSU, and data from other observatories may be analyzed. At the end of the program&lt;br/&gt;each student will write a research report and give an oral presentation.</AbstractNarration>
