    <AbstractNarration>0243991 Tiwari&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site that will be a part of the National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) established by NSF in 1994. The REU Site will provide a ten week summer research experience at each of the member institutions for 12 student participants per year at Cornell University; 10 student participants per year at the University of California Santa Barbara; 8 student participants per year at Penn State University; 6 student participants per year at Howard University; and 12 student participants per year at Stanford University. Students are recruited from colleges and universities throughout the United States with a focus on sophomore-level and junior-level students and with an effort to attract students from smaller non-research universities and students from underrepresented groups. The program provides students with an opportunity to do research in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Students will work on independent research projects using the advanced fabrication resources available through the NNUN with opportunities for research collaboration with faculty and students at each of the five-member NNUN institutions. This REU Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.</AbstractNarration>
