    <AbstractNarration>Award: DMS-0245349&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Harvey M. Friedman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friedman proposes to continue his efforts into extending the&lt;br/&gt;scope of the incompleteness phenomena. Under prior NSF support,&lt;br/&gt;Friedman has discovered a new mathematical theory which seeks to&lt;br/&gt;analyze the Boolean relations that hold between sets and their&lt;br/&gt;images under functions of several variables. This new Boolean&lt;br/&gt;relation theory seeks to analyze statements of the form "for all&lt;br/&gt;functions of a certain kind, there exist sets of a certain kind,&lt;br/&gt;such that a given Boolean relation holds among the sets and their&lt;br/&gt;images under the functions". Under prior NSF support, Friedman&lt;br/&gt;discovered a "singular" statement of a particularly simple form&lt;br/&gt;in Boolean relation theory that can be proved only by going&lt;br/&gt;beyond the usual axioms for mathematics. Friedman has considered&lt;br/&gt;all 6561 statements of the same simple form and showed that all&lt;br/&gt;can be proved or refuted using weak axioms, with the sole&lt;br/&gt;exception (up to symmetry) of the "singular" statement. Friedman&lt;br/&gt;proposes to develop Boolean relation theory in several&lt;br/&gt;directions, including expanding the set of 6561 statements, and&lt;br/&gt;shifting to many diverse mathematical contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the early part of the 20th century, the standard axioms and&lt;br/&gt;rules of mathematics had been established - the so called Zermelo&lt;br/&gt;Frankel axioms of set theory (ZFC). In the 1930's, Kurt Godel&lt;br/&gt;stunned the mathematical world with his incompleteness theorems&lt;br/&gt;that showed that any systematization such as ZFC is&lt;br/&gt;incomplete. I.e., there will always remain sentences that can&lt;br/&gt;neither be proved nor refuted within that systematization. This&lt;br/&gt;is normally referred to as the incompleteness phenomenom. Godel's&lt;br/&gt;original examples of statements of unprovable and unrefutable in&lt;br/&gt;ZFC were very far removed from the usual considerations of&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians. Through a series of developments, starting with&lt;br/&gt;later work of Godel and Cohen, various specialists in set theory,&lt;br/&gt;work of Friedman recognized by the NSF Alan T. Waterman Award in&lt;br/&gt;1984, and more recent work of Friedman, a body of such examples&lt;br/&gt;has been built up that are of increasing relevance to normal&lt;br/&gt;mathematical considerations. Recent work of Friedman along these&lt;br/&gt;lines gives new reasons for rethinking and extending the usual&lt;br/&gt;ZFC axioms for mathematics. To test the broader impact of the&lt;br/&gt;research, Friedman actively seeks and obtains regular feedback on&lt;br/&gt;the "naturalness" and "normality" of the various examples from&lt;br/&gt;the wider mathematical community. Friedman seeks to widen this&lt;br/&gt;broader impact.</AbstractNarration>
