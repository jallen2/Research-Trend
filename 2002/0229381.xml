    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0229381&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Delale, Feridun&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: CUNY City College&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Curriculum Reform of the Mechanical Engineering Program at City College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project plans for the systemic reform of the mechanical engineering curriculum at the City College of New York. Building on our previous experience in educational projects, five current members of the Mechanical Engineering Faculty and a current and former Associate Dean will spearhead the planning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the plan will be to develop means for achieving the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;a) Integration of emerging technologies into the curriculum. These technologies include&lt;br/&gt;micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS), nanotechnology, biotechnology, new&lt;br/&gt;application of materials, intelligent systems, and advanced computer aided engineering&lt;br/&gt;software b) Reform of pedagogical methods by introducing the results of cognitive&lt;br/&gt;research, industry needs and technological literacy concerns into the design of the&lt;br/&gt;learning environment c) Consistency of instruction by formulating department policies on&lt;br/&gt;expectations, responsibility, ethics, homework, report writing and team work d) Issues&lt;br/&gt;related to retention, timely graduation and greater enrollment of women and e) Broader&lt;br/&gt;impact of the reform effort and dissemination of results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning activities will be carried out by involving the Department's stakeholders,&lt;br/&gt;namely: faculty (including adjuncts and graduate teaching assistants), students and&lt;br/&gt;employers. After gathering the views of all the stakeholders, each course will be analyzed&lt;br/&gt;to determine a strategy for implementing the proposed changes. A report detailing the&lt;br/&gt;curriculum reform plan will be prepared. The report will also include a plan for&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of the implementation phase of this effort.</AbstractNarration>
