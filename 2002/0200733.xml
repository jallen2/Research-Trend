    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0200733&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nikola Lakic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vector fields defined on closed sets in the plane have&lt;br/&gt;recently found several new applications in various branches&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics and other natural sciences. The definition&lt;br/&gt;of the norm of these vector fields depends on which&lt;br/&gt;application the fields are used for. One norm comes from&lt;br/&gt;looking at vector fields as tangent vectors to the&lt;br/&gt;Teichmuller space of the given closed set. This norm,&lt;br/&gt;called the Teichmuller norm, is suitable for applications&lt;br/&gt;in holomorphic motions and complex dynamics. It turns the&lt;br/&gt;space of vector fields into a space of all initial&lt;br/&gt;velocities of holomorphic motions of the closed set. Since&lt;br/&gt;the holomorphic motions of the fixed closed set are defined&lt;br/&gt;by an intrinsic condition on the closed set, it is natural&lt;br/&gt;that there is a criterion that guarantees that the vector&lt;br/&gt;field has bounded norm, and which is expressed purely in&lt;br/&gt;terms of the values of the vector field on the closed set.&lt;br/&gt;Such a criterion was found recently by considering the&lt;br/&gt;velocity of the cross ratio for every possible quadruple&lt;br/&gt;in the given closed set. The velocity is measured with&lt;br/&gt;respect to the Poincare density of the Riemann sphere&lt;br/&gt;punctured at three points. This leads to an alternative&lt;br/&gt;norm on vector fields, called the cross ratio norm. The&lt;br/&gt;cross ratio norm is equivalent to the Teichmuller norm,&lt;br/&gt;and the equivalence constant is universal and independent&lt;br/&gt;of the closed set or vector field. Hence, a vector field&lt;br/&gt;is a derivative of some holomorphic motion if, and only if,&lt;br/&gt;it has bounded cross ratio norm. This equivalence led to&lt;br/&gt;the introduction of a new canonical density on any Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surface. The new density is equivalent to Poincare density,&lt;br/&gt;and this equivalence has several important applications of&lt;br/&gt;the vector field theory to hyperbolic and conformal geometry.&lt;br/&gt;It provides a link between, on the one hand, hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, Riemann surfaces, and geometric function theory,&lt;br/&gt;and on the other hand, Teichmuller theory, quadratic&lt;br/&gt;differentials and h olomorphic motions with their&lt;br/&gt;applications to complex dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many years the analytical and geometrical techniques&lt;br/&gt;developed in dynamical systems and Teichmuller theory have&lt;br/&gt;been applied to a number of important nonlinear problems&lt;br/&gt;with broad impact on ecology, economics, and genetics. One&lt;br/&gt;can expect these trends to continue. This project will&lt;br/&gt;feature the applications of the finite earthquake theorem&lt;br/&gt;to various directions. This, recently stated and proved,&lt;br/&gt;theorem provides a way to code each finite or countable&lt;br/&gt;string of data into the weighted tree associated to a&lt;br/&gt;finite lamination and vice versa. That could turn out to&lt;br/&gt;be an efficient way of coding. The applications will be&lt;br/&gt;based on recently made program in Maple that sketches the&lt;br/&gt;graph of finite laminations corresponding to a given&lt;br/&gt;homeomorphism and lists weights associated to each leaf of&lt;br/&gt;those laminations. The third component of the project is&lt;br/&gt;based on integrating research and education.</AbstractNarration>
