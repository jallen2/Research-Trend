    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to devise software to provide quick (24- hour) and affordable analyses for competitive technological intelligence and innovation forecasting. It substantially enriches intelligence on external technology progress for decision-making. Search Technology proposes to work closely with our partner to develop "Quick Technology Information Products" (QTIPs) to address the needs of a spectrum of senior technology managers and professionals. Macros will be prepared to expedite information search in extensive R&amp;D publication and patent databases, text analyses, and graphical representation of findings for intranet dissemination. Findings will address "who's doing what?" on technologies of interest, and go further to identify research and development patterns, map topical interrelationships, and forecast likely developmental progression using a series of innovation indicators. The project entails requirements analysis, evaluation of pilot analyses, and coding of macros to facilitate the priority information products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications include enhanced analytical software for industry and fast-response information services on emerging technologies. Both aim to enhance technology management by improving R&amp;D portfolio selection, intellectual property exploitation, new product development, and external collaboration in technology development.</AbstractNarration>
