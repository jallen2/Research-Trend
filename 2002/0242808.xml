    <AbstractNarration>0242808&lt;br/&gt;Makki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is for support of a joint research project by Dr. Rafic Makki, Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and a team of scientists in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the American University of Beirut (AUB), including Dr. Ayman Kayssi, Dr. Ali Chehab and Dr. Ibrahim Hajj. The research is to improve on the present design of sensors to make them process-variation and temperature tolerant. These sensors are for on-chip testing of embedded memories and other mixed-signal circuits in deep sub-micron technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This award will add an international dimension to a current grant from the Division of Computer and Communications Research (CCR) to the PI. The project provides funds for visits by two of the Lebanese scientists to UNC, Charlotte and a visit by the U.S. PI to AUB. It allows collaboration between the PI and three highly qualified Lebanese scientists in a country where collaboration has been at very low levels for many years. Funding for this project is provided jointly by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Computer and Communications Research.</AbstractNarration>
