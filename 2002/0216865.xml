    <AbstractNarration>The funds provided by the NSF Instrumentation for Materials Research program support Michigan State university with the acquisition of a unique micro-compounding molding system to support research in emerging new bio-based materials and polymers, and related educational programs. The equipment will be used in support of research which includes: (i) investigation of fundamental phenomena in newly developed bio-based materials and polymers, (ii) optimization of processing parameters at the micro-scale - - to establish structure, property, and performance relations and (iii) expansion of the integration of research and education in the area of polymer blending, polymer compounding and nanocomposites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds provided by the NSF Instrumentation for Materials Research program support the Michigan State University with the acquisition of a unique micro-compounding molding system.
