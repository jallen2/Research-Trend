    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the feasibility of developing a highly innovative, low-cost, high-speed opto-electronic sensor capable of continuously monitoring molten metal alloy compositions during casting and melting operations. Development of this sensor is among the highest priority technology needs identified by both the metal casting industry and the aluminum industry in their industry roadmaps of the future. In order to effectively compete, U.S. metal industries must increase their use of low cost scrap and must also find ways to increase production efficiency. The proposed sensor will acquire critical compositional data thousands of times faster than current commercial methods and will operate on a real time basis without the need to place the sensor in contact with the molten metal. At these speeds, a melt shop could produce one extra metal production batch (i.e. heat) per day, amounting to a 15% increase in productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The $30 Billion aluminum smelting industry translates to a potential $4.5 Billion increase in production output for little or no additional capital investment other than the sensor system itself. Improved product quality, reduced emissions, energy savings, and increased product yield will result from the shorter melting times. Similar improvements would be possible for zinc, copper, brass, bronze, iron, ceramics and glass industries that also have need for a similar continuous sensor system to monitor composition and quality.</AbstractNarration>
