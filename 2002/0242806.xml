    <AbstractNarration>The award provides travel support for U.S. and foreign students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the Seventh International Conference on Southern Hemisphere Meteorology and Oceanography (7ICSHMO), to be held in Wellington, New Zealand from March 24-28, 2003. The award will be administered by the American Meteorological Society (Dr. Ron McPherson, Exective Director), and will provide travel assistance to young researchers who would otherwise be unable to attend the meeting. The conference themes include a) Southern oceans and air-sea interaction, 2) Atmospheric chemistry in the Southern Hemisphere, 3) Tropical-extratropical interactions and teleconnections in the Southern Hemisphere, 4) Role of cryosphere in southern climate, 5) South American monsoon, and 6) Southern climate and society issues. The 7ICSHMO meeting will be held at the Te Papa National Museum of New Zealand, in Wellington. The lead organizers of the workshop are Dr. George Kiladis (NOAA Aeronomy, Boulder) and Dr. Jim Renwick (National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand. The workshop format includes 5 keynote talks: Kevin Trenberth (USA, NCAR Climate and Global Dynamics Division); Chris Folland (UK, British Meteorological Office), Stephen Rintoul (Australia, CSIRO Division of Oceanography), Dean Roemmich (USA, Scripps Institution of Oceanography), Per Nyberg (USA, Cray Research), and possibly, Anne Thompson (USA, NASA/GSFC). The 5-day meeting will run two parallel sessions, and the 16-member strong program committee comprising of leading scientists from the United States, Brazil, Botswana, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina, has put together exciting sessions for the benefit of mainstream researchers as well as graduate students and post-docs. The meeting program is available from the conference web-site (http://metsoc.rsnz.org/7icshmo/index2.html).</AbstractNarration>
