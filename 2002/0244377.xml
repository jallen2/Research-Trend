    <AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on the study of coadjoint representations and related algebraic structures related to coadjoint orbits. These coadjoint representations play a fundamental role in understanding certain aspects of the Anti-de Sitter Space / conformal field theory conjecture as well as understanding such diverse topics as black hole quantization and conformal field theory. The research will focus on understanding the Virasaro algebra arising in string theory and its dual (the coadjoint representation). By considering the semi-direct product of the Virasoro algebra and the Kac-Moody algebra, two symplectic structures of classical mechanics can be obtained which are important for quantizing the theory. The resulting action can be used for describing quantization about BTZ black holes as well as for studying Chern Simons theory. A toy M theory will be studied based on a particular N=1 Virasaro action.</AbstractNarration>
