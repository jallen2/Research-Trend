    <AbstractNarration>This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the question of the effect of the spatial and temporal organization of adsorbed reactants and reactive intermediates on the kinetics of surface reactions. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, Professor Madix and his coworkers in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Stanford University, examine the spatial distribution of adsorbed species in static and time dependent measurements. Studies of oxidation reactions on silver, auto-catalytic surface explosions on nickel and palladium, and poisoning and promotion by selected surface reaction modifiers are examined. In addition, the steady state distribution of adsorbed intermediates in surface oxidation reactions are studied. Information from this experimental project provides input into the development of detailed models of surface reaction kinetics, as well as fundamental insight into the nature of the dynamic catalytic surface. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the effect of the organization of reactive intermediates in two dimensions on the overall kinetics of surface reactions is the goal of this research project carried out by Professor Madix at Stanford University. Using tools that allow the atomic level imaging of the reacting surface, detailed information about the role of adsorbate structure on the surface reaction kinetics is obtained. This information is crucial to our detailed understanding of a range of important catalytic reaction systems, and extends to the understanding of surface reactions in a variety of technologically important contexts.</AbstractNarration>
