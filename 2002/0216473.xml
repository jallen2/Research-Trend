    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the University of South Dakota Department of Biology, under the supervision of Drs. Nepokroeff, Britten, Helenurm &amp; Swallow, to acquire automated genetic analysis instrumentation. The equipment will be used for automated DNA sequencing, genetic fragment and genotyping analysis (e.g. microsatellite detection, DNA finger-printing using AFLPs). The equipment will be housed in the Biology Department, and will be used by an additional 17 faculty from USD's Departments of Biology and Basic Biomedical Sciences. The acquisition of this equipment at USD is especially significant because there is currently no such facility on campus, and no high-throughput facility in the state of South Dakota.&lt;br/&gt;Researchers in Biology at USD will address a number of important questions in evolutionary genetics, conservation biology and systematics using the genetic analyzer. Specific projects to be addressed by Dr. Nepokroeff include the systematics of the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae, using molecular phylogenetic analysis of several different DNA sequences and phylogenetic approaches to study biogeography, (colonization and dispersal) in Pacific island species of the tropical shrub genus Psychotria (one of the most species-rich genera of flowering plants). Additionally, she will study conservation and population genetics of several Hawaiian plant lineages using AFLP and microsatellite markers. Dr. Britten plans to address population genetic structure and genetic variability of several Federally endangered species. He will be investigating the effects of population fragmentation through habitat loss and historical sylvatic plague infections in Black-tailed prairie dogs using AFLP and microsatellite analysis. Additionally, he plans to examine genetic variation in trumpeter swans and sandhill cranes. Dr. Helenurm will address population genetics and evolution of insular endemic plants. He will use DNA finger-printing methods, e.g., microsatellite and AFLP markers to examine levels of genetic variability in several species of flowering plants endemic to California's Channel Islands, many of which are endangered. He will also use AFLPs and DNA sequences to examine within-species (or "phylogeographic") relationships for plant species in the Channel Islands, a system which is poorly known. Dr. Swallow will address questions concerning correlated evolution of morphological, behavioral and physiological traits in stalk-eyed flies (family Diopsidae), wild relatives of the fruit fly. He will use DNA sequences for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among species and populations of stalk-eyed flies. Secondly, he will use DNA markers (AFLPs) in a QTL study to determine the number of genes involved in traits related to species recognition and mate choice.&lt;br/&gt;The equipment will be used in original research by faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduates and undergraduate students at USD, will be integrated into three courses in the USD curriculum. The equipment will also be incorporated in several existing summer programs, geared to give research experiences to area minority high school students and their teachers. The new equipment and proposed programs are anticipated to serve at least four area colleges with research expertise and experiences, in addition to the USD community. Acquiring an on-site facility will enhance the PI's competitiveness for federal research funds and attract new faculty and graduate students to USD's growing research programs. Thus, a genetic analyzer facility will have an enormous impact on the quality of research and educational programs at USD, will allow the PIs to integrate teaching and research at a high level, and will enrich the USD community in a diversity of ways.</AbstractNarration>
