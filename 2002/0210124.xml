    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates the potential for augmenting damping in&lt;br/&gt;composite structures by taking advantage of the energy dissipation between&lt;br/&gt;densely packed, highly interconnected networks of multi-walled carbon&lt;br/&gt;nanotubes (nano-films) . The novel, nano-engineered damping films&lt;br/&gt;developed in this project are expected to offer several advantages: &lt;br/&gt;1) Nano-films show no degradation in structure/properties upto 600 deg C &lt;br/&gt;and are expected to offer superior performance and reliability for high&lt;br/&gt;temperature applications. 2) Nano-films do not exhibit resin penetration&lt;br/&gt;when co-cured within composite structures and could potentially be&lt;br/&gt;seamlessly integrated into heterogeneous systems. 3) Nano-films offer&lt;br/&gt;multi-functionality in terms of enhanced stiffness in addition to damping&lt;br/&gt;augmentation. The specific stiffness of nano-films are expected to be an&lt;br/&gt;order of magnitude greater than commercially available viscoelastic&lt;br/&gt;polymer films. This research project is directed towards further exploring&lt;br/&gt;and developing these concepts so as to enable the efficient synthesis of&lt;br/&gt;these novel multifunctional materials into multi-scale structural systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves strong interdisciplinary collaboration between&lt;br/&gt;material science (patterning and assembly of nanostructures) and&lt;br/&gt;mechanical engineering (damping and stiffness increase in composites). &lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the training of 1 Ph.D student and several&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students (under the Undergraduate Research Projects - URP&lt;br/&gt;Program) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</AbstractNarration>
