    <AbstractNarration>Mixture models, which can be viewed also as clustering&lt;br/&gt; techniques, have become widely used statistical tools in the&lt;br/&gt; analysis of heterogeneous data, aiding researchers in&lt;br/&gt; interpreting existing data or in classifying new data. This&lt;br/&gt; project extends the current interests of the PI in mixture&lt;br/&gt; models to new directions while integrating them into&lt;br/&gt; education. It is well known that under the normal mixture&lt;br/&gt; model with unequal variance, the likelihood is unbounded and&lt;br/&gt; hence the global maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) does not&lt;br/&gt; exist. High-dimensional data analysis is becoming increasingly&lt;br/&gt; important in many applied fields, including bioinformatics,&lt;br/&gt; astronomy and imaging. Moreover, finding the nonparametric MLE&lt;br/&gt; is widely regarded as computationally intensive, with the&lt;br/&gt; particular difficulty being locating the mass points. To&lt;br/&gt; address these issues this project will (1) establish&lt;br/&gt; spacings-based inferential tools and asymptotic theory for the&lt;br/&gt; normal mixtures with unequal variances to overcome the&lt;br/&gt; limitations of the likelihood approach; (2) generalize these&lt;br/&gt; methods to multivariate normal mixture model; (3) develop&lt;br/&gt; theory and algorithms for multivariate mixtures via the&lt;br/&gt; penalized dual method; (4) develop methods for solving&lt;br/&gt; nonparametric mixture problems; (5) extend the multivariate&lt;br/&gt; mixture methods to identify features in spatial patterns and&lt;br/&gt; in turn develop efficient pattern recognition algorithms for&lt;br/&gt; use in hyperspectral image classification, mammography and&lt;br/&gt; minefield detection; and (6) integrate research and education&lt;br/&gt; to advance discovery and understanding of mixtures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project will: (1) promote discovery and understanding of&lt;br/&gt; the mixture models for modeling univariate and multivariate&lt;br/&gt; heterogeneous data; (2) broaden and initiate new applications&lt;br/&gt; to advance mixture models to new frontiers; (3) promote&lt;br/&gt; collaborative learning and foster critical thinking through&lt;br/&gt; student involvement in the PI's research projects; (4) build a&lt;br/&gt; firm foundation for the PI in contributing to a&lt;br/&gt; well-integrated research and education program in the theory,&lt;br/&gt; computation and application of mixture models and related&lt;br/&gt; areas; (5) impart education that will train a new generation&lt;br/&gt; of scientists and engineers capable of developing mixture&lt;br/&gt; models tools to solve important problems arising from new&lt;br/&gt; frontiers of biology, engineering and medicine; (6) result in&lt;br/&gt; offering an interdisciplinary course in mixture models and&lt;br/&gt; applications to graduate students, enabling and promoting&lt;br/&gt; interactions between statistics and allied fields; (7) enhance&lt;br/&gt; multidisciplinary research experience for students through the&lt;br/&gt; PI's collaborations and partnerships with the U.S. Navy and&lt;br/&gt; international scientists.</AbstractNarration>
