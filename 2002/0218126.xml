    <AbstractNarration>0218126&lt;br/&gt;Thatchenkery&lt;br/&gt;This award provides travel support for a delegation of senior and junior scientists to the US-India Workshop: Learning from the Indian Development Experience, Bangalore, November 2002. US PI Tojo Thatchenkery, Department of Social &amp; Organizational Learning, George Mason University (GMU) and Chiranjib Sen, School of Public Policy, Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Bangalore are co-organizers of this workshop. This gathering of scholars from a range of disciplines will focus on India's development experience, particularly as related to the emerging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry. The assumption is that the Indian development model is different from other national development success stories such as for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The workshop will contribute to fuller understanding of India's innovation-led development (private sector) model and its applicability to other developing countries. The workshop will foster Indo-US collaboration and create a collaborative program between GMU and the IIM's School of Public Policy, which will study policy implications of ICT for India's globalization efforts. The proceedings of the workshop will be published. Funding for this workshop is provided jointly by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
