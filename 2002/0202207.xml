    <AbstractNarration>In research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program, Professor Lindner and his coworkers at the University of Memphis are developing ion-selective electrodes with sub-micromolar detection limits. The best results are expected when the parasitic, transmembrane ion fluxes, across the ion-selective membrane, are prevented through the application of a few nA/cm2 direct current. Chrono-amperometric and chrono-potentiometric measurements will be employed in combination with spectroscopic imaging of transport processes in the sensing membrane to develop measurement protocols for the analysis of extremely dilute samples. The methods will be adapted to small size, microfabricated sensors and tested in environmental and biological samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ion-selective electrodes are simple, accurate and cost effective devices for both in vivo and in vitro measurement of ion concentrations. Dr. Lindner and his coworkers in the Joint Graduate Program for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Memphis are working on experimental techniques that project several orders of magnitudes improvement in the performance of ion sensors. This improvement is expected to profoundly affect the role of ion-selective electrodes in microanalysis, e.g., in environmental monitoring, or cellular biology.</AbstractNarration>
