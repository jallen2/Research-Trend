    <AbstractNarration>There are many different sources from which relevant information can be&lt;br/&gt;obtained for an intelligence task at hand, such as an analysis of operations&lt;br/&gt;planning by Al Qaeda. The accuracy of this information is frequently&lt;br/&gt;imperfect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information obtained from each source is frequently also different in&lt;br/&gt;structure and scope. XML has emerged today as the standard for information exchange. Its&lt;br/&gt;flexibility permits the representation of information from heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;sources in a single unified framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to manage uncertain (probabilistic) data,&lt;br/&gt;represented in XML. While there have been previous efforts to develop&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic relational systems, the need for representing and querying&lt;br/&gt;uncertain information is much greater for loosely structured data not &lt;br/&gt;readily amenable to a relational representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;XML data poses several modeling challenges that are the focus of this&lt;br/&gt;project: due to the data having (an inclusion hierarchy) structure,&lt;br/&gt;probabilities cannot be assigned independently; due to XML elements occurring&lt;br/&gt;at multiple granularities, probabilities may be assigned at multiple levels;&lt;br/&gt;due to the possibility of missing and repeated sub-elements, one may not be&lt;br/&gt;able to obtain complete distributions.</AbstractNarration>
