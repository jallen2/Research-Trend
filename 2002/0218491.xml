    <AbstractNarration>Many computational problems of practical interest can be posed in terms of search. Examples include discrete optimization problem that arise naturally in many areas of science, engineering and business. The development of a robust network infrastructure coupled with the advent of reasonably-priced computing equipment has helped focus attention on techniques that use multiple processors operating in parallel to improve search performance. Our research focuses on the design, development, implementation and evaluation of scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed search technique and their application, generally in concert with other optimization techniques, to construct hybrid optimization systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the work described here relies on a unique underlying parallelization paradigm of our own design called nagging. It contrast to more traditional problem partitioning techniques, nagging plays mutiple reformations of a problem --- or portions of a problem --- against each other to improve performance. We will improve and refine our understanding of nagging, including research on adaptive strategies for combining nagging and partitioning strategies; to improve and refine our distributed search infrastructure, including, for example, the use of cryptographic protocols to support authentication and distribution of new applications across management boundaries; and to continue our interdisciplinary collaborative efforts to apply distributed search concert with other optimization techniques to scientific computing problems.</AbstractNarration>
