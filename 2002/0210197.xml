    <AbstractNarration>David Lilja&lt;br/&gt;U Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;0210197&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work in physics, chemistry, and materials science has&lt;br/&gt;produced nanometer-scale structures out of exotic materials using&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated fabrication techniques. However, very little work has&lt;br/&gt;been conducted in computer engineering to investigate how to build&lt;br/&gt;full-scale computer systems out of these new devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this exploratory project is to begin to develop new&lt;br/&gt;techniques for constructing finite state machines (FSMs) out of&lt;br/&gt;molecular nanodevices. FSMs are one of the fundamental building&lt;br/&gt;blocks of any digital computing system. In this project, we&lt;br/&gt;introduce NanoBoxes as a possible abstraction for constructing&lt;br/&gt;reliable finite state machines for use in molecular computer&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reliability and error characteristics of molecular nanodevices&lt;br/&gt;are substantially different from the corresponding characteristics&lt;br/&gt;of traditional silicon-based CMOS transistors. These nanodevice&lt;br/&gt;characteristics present new challenges to computer designers which&lt;br/&gt;will require an entirely new approach for designing finite state&lt;br/&gt;machines. The techniques we develop eventually could be used to&lt;br/&gt;build entire computer systems out of molecular nanodevices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a high-risk/high-reward project. The risk is that we need&lt;br/&gt;to develop new approaches for designing computers out of a large&lt;br/&gt;collection of devices which are still under development themselves.&lt;br/&gt;By observing common trends in newly developed molecular devices, we&lt;br/&gt;make assumptions about their weak drive capabilities and their&lt;br/&gt;unstable nature. While we expect that we can adapt and extend&lt;br/&gt;traditional space, time, and information redundancy techniques for&lt;br/&gt;fault-tolerance into this new domain of molecular computers, new&lt;br/&gt;ideas will be necessary to develop appropriate solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is high-reward, however, since by conducting computer&lt;br/&gt;architecture research in tandem with research on the nanodevices&lt;br/&gt;themselves, we will be streamlining the development process to be&lt;br/&gt;able to have fully-functional molecular computers more quickly than&lt;br/&gt;if we wait for the nanodevice research to solidify. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;while we are tailoring our techniques for molecular nanodevices, our&lt;br/&gt;techniques also will be applicable to error detection and correction&lt;br/&gt;in quantum nanodevices and in nanometer-scale conventional CMOS&lt;br/&gt;devices, which are becoming more fault-prone as transistor sizes&lt;br/&gt;shrink.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make substantial contributions to educational and&lt;br/&gt;human resource development. It will initiate the dissertation&lt;br/&gt;research of a Ph.D. student in electrical and computer engineering&lt;br/&gt;to focus their research in this new area. We also expect to involve&lt;br/&gt;a few M.S. students in this work and possibly provide research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for undergraduate students through existing internship&lt;br/&gt;programs at the University of Minnesota.</AbstractNarration>
