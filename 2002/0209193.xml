    <AbstractNarration>A. Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;capabilities for analyzing complex interactions between heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems specification domains. Three research activities are&lt;br/&gt;being undertaken: (i) development of domain models for important&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems requirements domains; (ii) development of semantics&lt;br/&gt;for combining heterogeneous embedded systems specifications; and (iii)&lt;br/&gt;development of techniques for predictive analysis of composed&lt;br/&gt;specifications. The results of this research are being evaluated&lt;br/&gt;using problems from the Ambient Computing Environments (ACE) research&lt;br/&gt;center at The University of Kansas / ITTC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The facet-based approach being investigated involves modeling and&lt;br/&gt;integrating heterogeneous specifications using domain specific&lt;br/&gt;semantic systems. Each system model, or facet, is defined by&lt;br/&gt;extending a domain. A domain provides a vocabulary and model of&lt;br/&gt;computation for describing a system from one perspective. Facets use&lt;br/&gt;domains as modeling semantics and are composed to describe components&lt;br/&gt;and systems. Specifically, individual models are composed to define:&lt;br/&gt;(i) multiple aspects of the same component; and (ii) heterogeneous,&lt;br/&gt;multi-component systems. Projection functions and morphisms support&lt;br/&gt;specification transformation and composition using category and&lt;br/&gt;institution theoretic semantics. Special projection functions, called&lt;br/&gt;interactions, model how and when models from one domain interact with&lt;br/&gt;models from another. Interactions support integrated component&lt;br/&gt;analysis and modeling communication between heterogeneous components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing domain models, domain interaction models, and prototype&lt;br/&gt;analysis tools demonstrates the effectiveness of the facet-based&lt;br/&gt;approach for modeling embedded systems. The first and second research&lt;br/&gt;tasks encompass the development of domain and domain interaction&lt;br/&gt;models for defining embedded components. Both functional and&lt;br/&gt;performance constraint models are being supported. Domain models are&lt;br/&gt;being developed to represent basic models of computation and&lt;br/&gt;vocabularies for specification. Interaction models consisting of&lt;br/&gt;projection functions and specification morphisms are being defined to&lt;br/&gt;move information between domains. The third research task is the&lt;br/&gt;development of software systems for analyzing specifications. Two&lt;br/&gt;complimentary approaches are being explored: (i) formal analysis; and&lt;br/&gt;(ii) simulation. Formal analysis is achieved by mapping domain&lt;br/&gt;definitions to existing formal analysis environments. Specification&lt;br/&gt;simulation is achieved by mapping domain definitions to communicating,&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous simulation environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenge problems from the NSF and DARPA sponsored Ambient Computing&lt;br/&gt;Environments (ACE) research infrastructure at ITTC are being used to&lt;br/&gt;evaluate ongoing research. ACE provides an environment where&lt;br/&gt;computing moves seamlessly with individuals within a physical&lt;br/&gt;environment. ACE is implemented as a collection of highly mobile,&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous embedded systems that perform tasks including personal&lt;br/&gt;data management, control of robotic devices, and various sensor&lt;br/&gt;related tasks The results of this research have widespread impact on&lt;br/&gt;the research and industrial communities. The Rosetta systems level&lt;br/&gt;specification language is being used for domain models, interaction&lt;br/&gt;definitions and system specifications for embedded systems. Rosetta&lt;br/&gt;is being standardized by the Accellera CAD standards organization as a&lt;br/&gt;next-generation systems level design language. Successful results&lt;br/&gt;from this research activity are being disseminated as a part of the&lt;br/&gt;base Rosetta domain system and are being integrated into the&lt;br/&gt;collection of standard Rosetta domain models.</AbstractNarration>
