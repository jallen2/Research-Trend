    <AbstractNarration>A state-of-the art (scanning)transmission electron microscope (TEM)will be upgraded to an environmental TEM allowing near-atomic resolution imaging at pressures up to 8 Torr and temperatures up to 900 degree C. These capabilities are vital for proposed nanoscience, biotechnology and environmental science research. Near-atom-scale patterns will be defined by electron-beam decomposition of molecules adsorbed on surfaces. In situ investigation of vapor-liquid-solid grown Si nanopillars will facilitate rapid process optimization allowing growth on technologically relevant Si(100) surfaces. Characterization of artificial bone synthesized using genetically engineered osteoblasts will be facilitated by the capability for imaging hydrated specimens. Imaging at elevated pressure and temperature will be employed to discover novel materials useful for mineral sequestration of greenhouse gases. These advanced characterization capabilities will be fully integrated into the classroom learning experience and will significantly enhance industrial outreach facilitating academic/industrial knowledge transfer.&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;A state-of-the art (scanning)transmission electron microscope (TEM)will be upgraded to an environmental TEM allowing near-atomic resolution imaging of diverse samples at pressures of up to 8 Torr and temperatures of up to 900 degree C. These capabilities are vital for cutting edge research proposed in strategic thrust areas at ASU including nanoscience and technology, biotechnology and environmental science. Specifically, electron beam stimulated surface chemistry will be employed for writing near atomic scale patterns, real-time imaging will be used to optimize process conditions for Si nanopillar formation, characterization of tissue engineered artificial bone and in situ investigation of mineral sequestration of greenhouse gases. The advanced characterization capabilities of this instrument will be fully integrated into classroom learning at ASU through its internet connection to the Goldwater Materials Visualization Facility. Further, these capabilities will enhance academic/industrial knowledge transfer facilitated by our highly successful Industrial Associates program.</AbstractNarration>
