    <AbstractNarration>With this award Professor Falvey will continue his work on the chemical and spectroscopic studies of nitrenium ions and related electron deficient nitrogen species. A variety of experimental techniques will be used to elucidate the chemical and physical properties of nitrenium ions. The chemistry of aryl nitrenium ions will be studied in detail in the course of this work. Aryl nitrenium ions are generated in biological systems through enzyme catalyzed metabolism of aromatic amines. These nitrenium ions are electrophilic and hence very reactive so the production of these species in living organisms is believed to be mutagenic and/or carcinogenic. Aryl nitrenium ions are also implicated as intermediates in the synthesis of polyanilines, a conducting polymer. Aniline oxidation will be used to generate nitrenium ions and their reactions with a variety of electron rich arenes will be studied. Professor Falvey and his group will also work to prepare and study ground state triplet nitrenium ions since theory predicts they will have different chemical reactivities than the ground state singlet nitrenium ions outlined in the first part of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Daniel E. Falvey of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Maryland, College Park. Dr. Falvey will work on the generation and study of a family of reactive molecules known as nitrenium ions. These molecules contain an electron deficient and hence chemically reactive nitrogen atom as part of their molecular structure. Nitrenium ions are generated in biological systems through enzyme catalyzed metabolism of aromatic amines. The production of these species in living organisms is believed to be mutagenic and/or carcinogenic. Nitrenium ions are also implicated as intermediates in the synthesis of polyanilines, a conducting polymer. A thorough understanding of how these species are generated and how they react should contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental chemistry involved in both of the processes outlined above. Students trained during the course of this work will gain skills needed by the speciality chemicals industry and the pharmaceutical industry.</AbstractNarration>
