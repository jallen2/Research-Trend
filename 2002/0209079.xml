    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Thomas C. Flood, Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California, in fundamental studies of alkane activation and functionalization. They are particularly interested in understanding the weak interactions of alkanes with electrophilic metal centers. These sigma complexed alkane intermediates may play a key role in many primary reactions involved in catalysis. One catalytic transformation Flood is concentrating on is the oxidation of methane to methanol using a rhodium or osmium catalyst. A flexible triamine ligand such as 1,4,7-triazacyclononane (tacn or Cn) complexes and stabilizes the catalyst and will not decompose under the reaction conditions &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New catalysts and processes may be designed as a result of detailed understanding of the way alkanes interact with metal centers,. The efficient conversion of alkanes to alcohols is a longstanding goal of the chemical industry. Students will be trained in the synthesis, characterization and mechanistic studies of these potential catalysts and catalyst precursors.</AbstractNarration>
