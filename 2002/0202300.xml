    <AbstractNarration>CMS-0202300&lt;br/&gt;PI: Joseph Dove&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Virginia Polytechnic and State University&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Workshop on Geotechnical Composite Systems"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-day workshop will be held in June, 2002 to bring together practitioners, researchers, and government agency end-users for the purpose of exploring and advancing the new, integrated field of Geotechnical Composite Systems. Geotechnical composite systems incorporate man-made elements into soil or rock to create large-scale composite materials. The workshop will involve 25 participants with differing backgrounds from academic institutions, specialty construction companies, governmental agencies, and engineering design firms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most exciting and compelling issues in modern geotechnical engineering are found at the boundary between disciplines, and cannot be addressed by a single group or single individual. The principal goal of this workshop is to bring together a diverse group of researchers, practitioners, end users, and other interested persons to accomplish the following six specific objectives: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Establish common ground, and a language for communication, between disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Identify gaps in knowledge about geotechnical composite systems as they are used in&lt;br/&gt;existing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Propose new types of geotechnical composite systems and new applications for&lt;br/&gt;existing geotechnical composite systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Explore how methods from other disciplines, such as composite materials&lt;br/&gt;engineering, may apply to the field of geotechnical composite systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Identify and prioritize research needs in geotechnical composite systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Broadly disseminate the workshop results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to invited participants, other individuals interested in the topic will be invited to apply for funds to attend the workshop. Underrepresented minorities, female and academically young investigators will be particularly encouraged to apply.</AbstractNarration>
