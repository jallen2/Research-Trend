    <AbstractNarration>Data mining is an emerging field. The knowledge of data mining has been in demand in the IT industry and in new areas like bioinformatics, information assurance, and homeland security where data are massive. Traditionally, data mining courses are offered at the graduate level; now, this type of course is needed at the undergraduate level to increase interest in this area and address labor market demands. This collaborative project between Arizona and Wright State Universities develops an undergraduate data mining course for junior and seniors. The objectives are: develop a course that can be taught either by semester ASU or quarter WSU term, establish vehicles and approaches to increase student retention in the course, and promote data mining skills essential to problem solving. The objectives are accomplished in several ways: designing a pre-assessment instrument measuring student knowledge of data mining, and on-line tutorials; develop course materials that will enhance problem solving skills through reflection, critique, exercises, discerning theory from practice; and using a continuous evaluation process that addresses not only student achievement but also enrollment retention. Input from leading IT industry is used to incorporate immediate practical needs. The results of the project including evaluation are published via various means. Notes, supporting materials, projects, and exams are made available on the course web site.</AbstractNarration>
