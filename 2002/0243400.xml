    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research will focus on the investigation of four topics of very topical and current interest. The first concerns how family symmetry gets broken in grand unified models with family gauge groups. This renewed interest in family symmetries has arisen because they arise naturally in orbifold compactifications in string theory. Possible experimental signatures of flavor changing currents in these models will be investigated. The second project consists of identifying possible Kaluza-Klein states in extra-dimensional models that are candidates for being observed at lepton colliders. The third topic of research will be whether mu-tau conversion can be observed in nuclei. Finally the implication of both CPT and Lorentz violation that are possible in string theory will be investigated in terms of possible atomic physics experiments.</AbstractNarration>
