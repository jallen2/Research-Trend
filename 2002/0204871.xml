    <AbstractNarration>This individual investigator award will provide support for a program that focuses on the study of electron correlation effects in two-dimensional systems, such as ultra-thin magnetic-impurity-doped Be films, and ultra-thin superconducting Be and Al films. Some bulk materials with a strongly layered structure such as superconducting LaSb2 and metamagnetic SmSb2 will also be studied. One of the primary goals of the program is to investigate the transport and tunneling characteristics of these systems in high magnetic fields and low temperatures. Their behavior in such extreme environments gives insight into how low dimensionality, disorder, and correlations can give rise to exotic effects such state memory, reentrance, multifold magnetoresistance, non-equilibrium fluctuations, and quantum transitions. Besides being at the forefront of condensed matter research, the program will provide an important venue for the training undergraduates, graduate students, and K-12 science teachers. The latter will be made possible by sponsoring summer internships for "Teach For America" corps members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award provides support for a program that investigates how the repulsive interactions between electrons affects their ability to conduct electricity and more importantly how these interactions can orchestrate seemingly improbable behavior such as memory effects and extremely large increases in resistance with the application of magnetic field. Emphasis is placed on systems for which the electron motion is confined to a plane such as is the case for metal films that are only a few atoms thick. The behavior of these systems gives insight into how low dimensionality, disorder, and electronic correlations can give rise to novel and perhaps useful properties that may one day be of technological relevance. This type of search and discovery research is important for maintaining the health of the national research and development enterprise. The program also provides an important venue for the training undergraduates, graduate students, and K-12 science teachers. The latter is made possible by being a summer internship sponsor for "Teach For America" corps members.</AbstractNarration>
