    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop proof-of-principle software permitting any graphic to be converted easily into a universally usable file in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) web language format. Any sighted person with rudimentary computer skills could use this software to convert a graphic to SVG and could add information that does not change the visual appearance of the graphic, but makes it usable by individuals who are blind or have other print reading disabilities. A blind computer user could then download the file from the web and view it by embossing a copy on the Tiger Tactile Graphics and Braille Embosser, placing the tactile copy on an inexpensive digitizing pad, and pressing objects in the graphic in order to hear them identified by the self-voicing Accessible SVG Viewer.&lt;br/&gt; ViewPlus Technologies expects Accessible SVG to be adopted rapidly by authors who need to display graphical information and who work in institutions required to provide accessible information. As SVG becomes more and more popular, a substantial fraction of web authors and webmasters are likely to purchase the SVG conversion software. Generally, most companies and institutions are discovering that it is good business to make their information accessible and are likely to do so if most authors can understand easily ho to accomplish that objective.</AbstractNarration>
