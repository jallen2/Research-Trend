    <AbstractNarration>This project, which is a collaborative effort between the University of&lt;br/&gt;California at Riverside and Los Angeles, focuses on processor and&lt;br/&gt;system architecture issues for Web Switches. Web switches are network&lt;br/&gt;processing elements that modify network traffic based on content.&lt;br/&gt;These devices are frequently used to provide load balancing between&lt;br/&gt;functionally equivalent servers as well as cryptographic services; in&lt;br/&gt;in the future will be used for a host of new applications including&lt;br/&gt;active security and multimedia trans-coding. This project will begin&lt;br/&gt;by developing a benchmarking framework that can be used to evaluate&lt;br/&gt;the performance of Web switches. The research will then use advanced&lt;br/&gt;processor simulation tools to study architectural tradeoffs in the&lt;br/&gt;face of the benchmark workload. In particular, the researchers will&lt;br/&gt;focus on the efficacy of hardware accelerator blocks that have been&lt;br/&gt;proposed. Finally, work will be completed to implement the workload&lt;br/&gt;and capitalize on acquired knowledge in the context of an existing&lt;br/&gt;test bed for network processors.</AbstractNarration>
