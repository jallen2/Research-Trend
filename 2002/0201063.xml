    <AbstractNarration>This project concerns the fluid dynamics and force-generating mechanisms of microorganisms, with applications ranging from dynein activation in a eucaryotic flagellum to the motility of pathogenic spirochetes. Computational models are developed that couple the internal molecular motors and elastic mechanisms of motile microorganisms with a viscous, incompressible fluid. A unified computational approach is adopted to model the internal axoneme mechanics of cilia and spermatozoa, the action of the internal periplasmic flagella of spirochetes, as well as mucociliary interactions. In addition to modeling the dynamics of a single organism, the collective hydrodynamic interactions of groups of organisms and their environment can be examined. The moving boundary problem posed by a flexible, swimming organism is very difficult to analyze, even when an organism's waveform is assumed to be known. In fact, the waveform of a microorganism is an emergent property of the coupled nonlinear system consisting of the organism's force-generating mechanisms, its passive elastic structure, and the external fluid dynamics. The investigators develop a mathematical model and a numerical method designed to study this coupled mechanical system. Modern methods in computational fluid dynamics are used to create a controlled environment where the measurement and visualization of locomotive effects can be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motion of microorganisms in fluid is of fundamental importance in physiology. Human reproduction requires the successful journey of spermatozoa through both the male and female reproductive tracts. The robust locomotory ability of pathogenic spirochetes enable these bacteria to efficiently move through viscous fluids and mucosal surfaces. A multidisciplinary research team of mathematicians, computational scientists and experimental biologists coordinates their efforts to investigate the fundamental mechanics of cell motility in a number of systems. These systems include cilia and flagella, spirochetes (such as those that are the causative agents of Lyme disease and syphilis), bacterial biofilms and mucus-ciliary transport in the respiratory tract. A greater understanding of how the internal biochemistry and biophysical mechanisms of microorganisms are coupled to the fluid environment in which they move can have an impact on drug design for bacterial infection as well as infertility treatment. This project draws ideas from many disciplines such as fluid mechanics, scientific computing, cell biology, and numerical analysis. Our multidisciplinary approach enables significant progress in the understanding of microorganism motility. Furthermore, the algorithms and methods developed are useful in studying other biofluiddynamic problems and contribute to expertise in high performance computing.</AbstractNarration>
