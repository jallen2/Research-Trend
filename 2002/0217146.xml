    <AbstractNarration>Girls Under the Hood is a demonstration project designed to encourage teenage girls in rural&lt;br/&gt;Madison County, New York, to achieve excellence in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and&lt;br/&gt;Technology (SMET) fields. Central to the success of this project is the hands-on experience&lt;br/&gt;that will demonstrate the relationship of SMET to the participants everyday lives. Using the&lt;br/&gt;automobile as a vehicle for inquiry-based scientific learning, 24 girls ages 14-17 will&lt;br/&gt;explore topics such as the science of internal combustion, the mathematics of fuel economy,&lt;br/&gt;the engineering of the power train, the technology of computerized diagnostic equipment, and&lt;br/&gt;the integration of all these fields. In addition to exploring and learning many scientific&lt;br/&gt;principles behind the various systems of the automobile, participants will acquire practical&lt;br/&gt;skills that they can share with their families.&lt;br/&gt;During a seven-day residential summer camp, participants will experience two different&lt;br/&gt;college campus settings a mere five miles apart: Colgate University, in Hamilton, New York,&lt;br/&gt;a nationally-ranked liberal arts institution; and in America's Most-Wired; two-year school, the&lt;br/&gt;State University of New York College of Agriculture and Technology, in Morrisville, New&lt;br/&gt;York. Morning sessions will be held in the new automotive technology building at the SUNY&lt;br/&gt;Morrisville campus, where participants will engage in hands-on exploration of the&lt;br/&gt;automobile. Meals, lodging, and most of the afternoon and evening sessions will take place at&lt;br/&gt;Colgate University, where the girls will further explore the basic scientific principles behind&lt;br/&gt;the operation of automobiles and how those same principles can be transferred to a variety of&lt;br/&gt;other applications.&lt;br/&gt;Girls Under the Hood will capitalize on the natural curiosity of females in a non-threatening&lt;br/&gt;(cooperative, welcoming, and predominantly female) environment at a critical time in their&lt;br/&gt;lives when they are focused on getting their driver's license. Through exposure to female role&lt;br/&gt;models (teachers, undergraduate teaching assistants and successful industry practitioners) and&lt;br/&gt;solicitation of parent, school, industry and government support, this project will seize&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to relate course content to SMET careers, and to challenge students' ideas about&lt;br/&gt;gender appropriate careers. The confidence that girls gain in their ability to understand the&lt;br/&gt;science and technology of automobiles will carry over into confidence that they can succeed&lt;br/&gt;in other areas of SMET, and the applications they will see of SMET courses will encourage&lt;br/&gt;them to take more courses in those areas.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual benefit of this project is that it will serve as an educational model for the&lt;br/&gt;application of contextualized science education, as well as provide a better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;gender-fair learning opportunities in SMET education utilizing a unique combination of rural&lt;br/&gt;public high schools, public and private universities, community, industry, and government.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project include positive changes in participants' interest in SMET,&lt;br/&gt;confidence in their ability to do math and science, and election of upper level math and&lt;br/&gt;science courses. An added benefit will be the establishment of an educational collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between a four year and a two year college.</AbstractNarration>
