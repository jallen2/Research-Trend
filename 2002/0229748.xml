    <AbstractNarration>The project concerns the development and implementation of a workshop to get feedback about the draft of the Computer Engineering component of Computing Curricula 2001 (CC2001). CC2001 is a joint multi-year (since 1998) undertaking of the Computer Society of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE-CS) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to develop new guidelines for undergraduate programs that deal with computers in general. CC2001 provides innovative approaches and recommendations for implementing computing curricula looking at low-level, transition, and upper-level courses that are tailorable to a particular program's needs. In addition the document states what the "core" set of material that every program should contain as well as providing information about possible focus areas that a department can utilize in tailoring their program. Tasks include collecting the materials, developing a readable volume, and producing the volume (Activity 1), conducting a workshop to solicit comments from the community (Activity 2), and the ongoing assessment of the Computer Engineering component of CC2001 (Activity 3). The purpose of the proposed workshop is to convene a group of experts in the area of Computer Engineering to review the draft of the Computer Engineering Curricula and obtain feedback about the draft. Project plans call for disseminating the resulting document the comnputer engineering community after it is completed.</AbstractNarration>
