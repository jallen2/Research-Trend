    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Kalton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the aim is to study a number of problems&lt;br/&gt;related to Banach space theory and its applications. Part&lt;br/&gt;of the project deals with the theory of extensions of one&lt;br/&gt;Banach space by another. For example it is planned to study&lt;br/&gt;the problem of classifying those Banach spaces such that&lt;br/&gt;every minimal extension is trivial. This problem can be&lt;br/&gt;reformulated as a problem in approximation theory. It is&lt;br/&gt;also planned to study applications to problems in the&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear theory of Banach spaces, related to problems of&lt;br/&gt;existence of uniform homeomorphisms between two Banach&lt;br/&gt;spaces or between their unit balls. In a somewhat different&lt;br/&gt;direction the proposer plans to continue his ongoing&lt;br/&gt;research on Rademacher-bounded families of operators with&lt;br/&gt;applications to sectorial operators and semigroups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of extensions can be considered in the following&lt;br/&gt;terms. Suppose we are given a centrally symmetric solid in&lt;br/&gt;three or more dimensions and we are allowed only to compute&lt;br/&gt;its cross-section by a slice in some directions and the&lt;br/&gt;shadow cast by the body in the perpendicular directions.&lt;br/&gt;This gives us some information about the solid, but does not&lt;br/&gt;permit complete reconstruction. The idea of studying&lt;br/&gt;extensions is to obtain more complete information about the&lt;br/&gt;body under certain additional conditions. Many questions of&lt;br/&gt;importance in mathematical analysis and applications,&lt;br/&gt;although not formally expressed in this way, can be&lt;br/&gt;visualized in terms of extensions. Sectorial operators are&lt;br/&gt;of importance in the basic theory of partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations of evolution type; such equations are very&lt;br/&gt;important in physical applications. Typically a sectorial&lt;br/&gt;operator is a differential operator acting on some suitable&lt;br/&gt;space of functions. By understanding the properties of&lt;br/&gt;sectorial operators and the semigroups they generate one&lt;br/&gt;gains a better understanding of the behavior of solutions of&lt;br/&gt;certain partial differential equations.</AbstractNarration>
