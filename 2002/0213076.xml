    <AbstractNarration>0213076&lt;br/&gt;Hudspeth&lt;br/&gt; Phylogenetic relationships within the Peronosporomycetes, a&lt;br/&gt;diverse group of economically important fungal-like protists often&lt;br/&gt;referred to as oomycetes, are poorly understood. In this study the&lt;br/&gt;primary goal is to establish an extensive DNA database derived from&lt;br/&gt;mitochondrial and nuclear genes of a diverse selection of these&lt;br/&gt;organisms. The resultant database is then to be used to infer&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary relationships of major, understudied, and newly identified&lt;br/&gt;genera. With the development of peronosporomycete specific DNA primers&lt;br/&gt;this study emphasizes both obligate and opportunistic parasites of&lt;br/&gt;plants, algae, and terrestrial and marine animals. The resulting&lt;br/&gt;inferred phylogeny is expected to provide new insight into evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;relationships and trends within the Peronosporomycetes, and to identify&lt;br/&gt;anomalously placed taxa for reevaluation using morphological and&lt;br/&gt;biochemical data. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this study stems from the inclusion in the&lt;br/&gt;Peronosporomycetes of a significant number of pathogenic organisms.&lt;br/&gt;Hosts include representatives from all eukaryotic kingdoms. Plant&lt;br/&gt;pathogens encompass a spectrum of cereal and leguminous crops, rosaceous&lt;br/&gt;fruit trees, forest trees, and ornamental plants as hosts. The societal&lt;br/&gt;impact of the downy mildews Plasmopara and Peronospora (responsible for&lt;br/&gt;the decimation of the French wine and Cuban tobacco industries) and of&lt;br/&gt;Phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of late blight of potato&lt;br/&gt;(famines in Ireland in the mid-1840's and World War I Germany), is part&lt;br/&gt;of the historical record. Currently, the worldwide economic impact of&lt;br/&gt;these and other peronosporomycete genera amounts to tens of billions of&lt;br/&gt;dollars in crop losses and disease control. The newly identified&lt;br/&gt;Phytophthora ramorum (causative agent for sudden oak death) with its&lt;br/&gt;broad host range currently threatens large stands of trees in the&lt;br/&gt;western U.S., and aggressive hybrid variants of other&lt;br/&gt;"phytophthoras" with their expanding host ranges are emerging&lt;br/&gt;as additional threats. In the rapidly expanding area of aquaculture,&lt;br/&gt;peronosporomycete animal "mycoses" affecting roe, fingerlings,&lt;br/&gt;molluscans, and crustaceans are currently being identified. Even the&lt;br/&gt;incidence of mammalian "pythiosis" (Pythium isidiosum) in an&lt;br/&gt;increasing number of hosts, including man, is being recognized.&lt;br/&gt;Establishing a molecular database for this group provides both a&lt;br/&gt;resource for the early and rapid molecular identification of pathogens,&lt;br/&gt;and a significant step in understanding the evolutionary history and&lt;br/&gt;trends of the Peronosporomycetes.</AbstractNarration>
