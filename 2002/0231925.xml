    <AbstractNarration>9875544&lt;br/&gt;Lin&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this research is to develop for the area of solid state materials chemistry a rational synthesis of acentric and chiral polymeric coordination networks using metal-ligand coordination as the molecular basis for the construction. Three novel aproaches will be examined: (1) crystal engineering of acentric interpenetrated diamonoid networks; (2) design of acentric and chiral two-dimensional square grids based on metal pyridinecarboxalates; (3) synthesis of acentric, pillared two-dimensional sheets of basic trinuclear carboxalates with three-fold rotational symmetry. The educational aims will focus on curriculum development, the encouragement of underrespresented groups to become scientists and engineers, the involvment of undergraduate and summer high school students in research, and public outreach that emphasizes environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Crystal engineering of organic solids via non-covalent bonding such as hydrogen bonding is emerging as a very important area in the design, synthesis, and materials property optimization for nonlinear optical device materials, and for the development of novel chiral zeolytic materials for separations processes employed in the protection and conservation of the environment.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
