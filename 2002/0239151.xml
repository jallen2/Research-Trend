    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at developing MEMS-based miniaturized fluid viscosity and density sensors that can operate within small confines provide electronic readout, and that are capable of surviving harsh environments (high temperature, high pressure, corrosive, abrasive) typical of many fluid sensor applications. The Harsh Environment Fluid Viscosity-Density Sensor consists of a packaged flexural plate wave (FPW) resonator instrumented with low cost, compact electronics for sensor read-out. In Phase I, the technical objectives were successfully accomplished by fabricating resonant FPW fluid sensors from harsh environment compatible single crystal SiC and epitaxial piezoelectric AlN materials, and demonstrated their ability to independently measure fluid viscosity and density. In Phase II, fully functional, packaged and electronically instrumented Harsh Environment Fluid Viscosity-Density Sensor prototypes will be developed and optimized for specific customer applications. The fluid sensors will be field tested in our customer's systems to demonstrate precise and accurate fluid viscosity and density measurements and stable operation in the customer's fluids and environmental conditions. After successful completion of Phase II, the Harsh Environment Fluid Viscosity-Density Sensor will be ready for scale-up manufacturing and commercialization in Phase III.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Harsh Environment Fluid Viscosity-Density Sensor has commercial applications in 1) Condition-Based Maintenance of oils and other fluids in engines and industrial process equipment, 2) Process and Quality Control in manufacturing, chemical processing and water/waste treatment industries, and 3) down-hole sensors for Petrochemical Exploration and Extraction</AbstractNarration>
