    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0203586&lt;br/&gt;Johnstone, John&lt;br/&gt;U of Alabama @ Birmingham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work of this proposal can be divided into three categories: (1) the study of dual representations of&lt;br/&gt;the tangent space of a curve and surface, (2) the application of these dual representations to the computation&lt;br/&gt;of bitangency, and (3) the application of bitangency to several problems in geometric modeling, computer&lt;br/&gt;graphics and robotics such as visibility, lighting and motion.&lt;br/&gt;The problem that binds together these areas of study is bitangency. There are basically three bitangent&lt;br/&gt;structures: the bitangent line (a line that is tangent to two curves), the bitangent plane (a plane that&lt;br/&gt;is tangent totwo surfaces), and the bitangent developable (the envelope of a familyof bitangent planes).&lt;br/&gt;While the tangent is important in the analysis of individual curves and surfaces in isolation, the bitangent&lt;br/&gt;is important in the analysis of collections of curves and surfaces, since it relates two curves or two surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;As the analysis of large scenes becomes increasingly important, the bitangent becomes an important tool.</AbstractNarration>
