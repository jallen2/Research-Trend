    <AbstractNarration>Post-orogenic extension occurs in most of the major mountain belts on Earth, regardless of&lt;br/&gt;age or tectonic setting. Efforts have been made to both quantify the driving mechanisms and also to correlate them from young to old mountain belts, but the fundamental physics behind the transition from contractional orogenesis to extension remain unclear. Studies that seek to explain not only the kinematics of mountain evolution but also the dynamics can give insights into crustal architecture and possibly deeper mantle involvement in lithospheric dynamics. This project proposes to address these issues by initially studying the temporal differences in post-orogenic extension across the strike length of a major orogenic belt, the ca.1.1 billion year-old Grenville Province. These results will be used in a larger context to assist in creating an accurate three-dimensional model of the post-orogenic evolution of an orogen. This project is exploratory in nature, as the effects of Paleozoic mountain-building events on some of the rocks are not fully known, and a record of activity related to Proterozoic orogenic events may be difficult or impossible to find. However, if successful, important insights will be gained about the nature of post-orogenic extension down the length of the ancient Laurentian margin. The Grenville Province is exposed as a laterally continuous belt from Labrador, Canada to Ontario, Canada and New York state. It is exposed in a series of small inliers and basement massifs down the eastern United States, with one of the southernmost outcrops within the Pine Mountain window of Alabama and Georgia, as well as westerly massifs in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. The structures and age relationships are well documented in the Canadian Grenville but are not well known in the southern exposures. Detailed information about Grenville structures in this region can provide important insights and correlations to the northern, well-studied Grenville exposures. This project requests funds to conduct an initial study of deformed basement rocks within the Pine Mountain window to determine their suitability for comparison with other Grenville-aged structures. It is possible that the Paleozoic Appalachian orogenic events have overprinted these rocks to such an extent that Grenville structures can no longer be documented. However, with the advent of the technique of electron microprobe dating of monazites, it is possible to quickly and accurately determine the age of minerals within shear zones and therefore to determine the effects of metamorphic overprinting. In this study, the PI will collect and analyze sheared basement rocks from the Pine Mountain window as well as analyze the PI 's existing collection of sheared rocks from the Canadian/New York Grenville Province. This will be done using electron microprobe analysis of monazites in thin sections at the University of Massachusetts. This technique, while not as precise as traditional methods of geochronology, is rapid, efficient, and allows the investigator to retain all structural information of a sample, which is essential when studying shear zones that may have had multiple episodes of deformation. This will allow the PI to determine the nature of the Paleozoic metamorphic overprint of these rocks. In addition, analysis of the rocks in Ontario and New York provides a check on the technique of monazite dating by the electron microprobe, a relatively new procedure. Since there is an extensive database of ages, collected by the PI using standard U/Pb and 40 Ar-39 Ar isotopic techniques, all monazite ages can be framed within a very detailed temperature-time path.</AbstractNarration>
