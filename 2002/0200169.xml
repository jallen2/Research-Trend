    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0200169: Calculus of Variations in L-infinity and Nonlinear PDE's&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robert R. Jensen, Co-PI: Emmanuel N. Barron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of nonlinear essential supremum functionals is the focus&lt;br/&gt;of this project. In variational problems with such functionals the&lt;br/&gt;natural questions of interest are existence of an absolute (or&lt;br/&gt;local) minimizer, i.e., a function which minimizes the functional&lt;br/&gt;on every subdomain, necessary conditions for the minimizer leading&lt;br/&gt;to very nonlinear differential equations, and regularity of the&lt;br/&gt;minimizer. In contrast to the classical calculus of variations,&lt;br/&gt;even under very strong assumptions, regularity beyond continuous&lt;br/&gt;differentiability is not expected, but even this much smoothness&lt;br/&gt;is unknown. Virtually every question posed in classical&lt;br/&gt;variational analysis can be posed for supremum functionals--&lt;br/&gt;constraints, relaxation, homogenization, duality--and this can be&lt;br/&gt;done for both scalar and vector valued problems where the results&lt;br/&gt;are more difficult. This subject has placed a new focus on&lt;br/&gt;viscosity solutions for fully nonlinear equations, and a new&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on an old area of convex analysis, quasiconvexity. The&lt;br/&gt;motivation for the study of such problems comes from consideration&lt;br/&gt;of physical problems in which the use of the typical energy norm&lt;br/&gt;is not adequate, that is, one must design for the worst case.&lt;br/&gt;Supremum norm functionals lack strong differentiability and the&lt;br/&gt;subsequent difficulties associated with this lack must be dealt&lt;br/&gt;with using all forms of nonlinear analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of variational analysis in engineering, physics, medicine,&lt;br/&gt;economics, and other fields is well established. Extreme value&lt;br/&gt;engineering is an area in which one seeks to consider the worst&lt;br/&gt;case in order to properly design or build some mechanism. In this&lt;br/&gt;project these two disciplines are merged to apply variational&lt;br/&gt;analysis in order to accomodate a worst case analysis. In certain&lt;br/&gt;areas, such as medicine, or structural engineering, it is clear&lt;br/&gt;that the worst case analysis is the only realistic design. For&lt;br/&gt;example, an oncological treatment cannot seek to minimize the&lt;br/&gt;average tumor load, but must minimize the maximum tumor load. A&lt;br/&gt;bridge should not be designed to minimize average stresses but&lt;br/&gt;maximum pointwise stresses. Many control mechanisms implemented&lt;br/&gt;only when a maximum indicator is triggered. These are all problems&lt;br/&gt;which are applications of the project considered and in which many&lt;br/&gt;new techniques must be developed. The basic and fundamental&lt;br/&gt;results of this area of variational analysis, including existence&lt;br/&gt;and the determination of criteria sufficient to determine the&lt;br/&gt;optimal function, will be studied. The analysis leads to the study&lt;br/&gt;of nonlinear partial differential equations and systems of such&lt;br/&gt;equations.</AbstractNarration>
