    <AbstractNarration>Integrated studies of interactions among plants, microbes, and the soils they inhabit are&lt;br/&gt;critical to our understanding of ecosystem function. We propose to use a combination of&lt;br/&gt;biochemical and molecular-genetic methods to determine effects of artificial defoliation of&lt;br/&gt;Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) on structure and function of ectomycorrhizal (EM)&lt;br/&gt;communities in pure P. contorta and mixed P. contorta/Picea engelmannii (Engelmann&lt;br/&gt;spruce) stands. We will defoliate only the pine in both pure P. contorta and mixed P.&lt;br/&gt;contorta/P. engelmannii patches formed within mixed stands by small-scale disturbance. We&lt;br/&gt;will then determine how defoliation affects EM fungal community structure, activities of&lt;br/&gt;enzymes that break down litter, and enzymatic function of soil fungal communities. We will&lt;br/&gt;sample across a soil fertility gradient created by a transition from relatively nutrient-rich&lt;br/&gt;andesite, through a transition zone created by glacial activity, to nutrient-poor rhyolite. By&lt;br/&gt;doing so, we will determine how interactions among carbon flow to roots, tree species&lt;br/&gt;diversity, and soil fertility influence ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and function, for the&lt;br/&gt;first time.&lt;br/&gt;Our preliminary data from this system indicate that defoliation of pine only in a patch of mixed&lt;br/&gt;pine/spruce can 1) significantly affect the EM community of mixed P. contorta/P. engelmannii&lt;br/&gt;stands, and 2) affect the EM of non-defoliated spruce. Our data also show that soil fertility plays&lt;br/&gt;a pivotal role in influencing EM community structure, and the work of others demonstrates that&lt;br/&gt;soil fertility can moderate effects of defoliation and insect herbivory. We will be the first to&lt;br/&gt;investigate how alteration of carbon flow to roots affects EM community structure, EM&lt;br/&gt;enzymatic function, and below-ground function in a mixed tree species forest, and the first to&lt;br/&gt;combine these factors with soil fertility. We will conduct this study in Yellowstone National&lt;br/&gt;Park, the centerpiece of the 11-million acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which includes&lt;br/&gt;several National Forests in three states. By using a combination of biochemical and molecular&lt;br/&gt;methods, we will provide the most comprehensive picture of these aspects of ecosystem function&lt;br/&gt;to date. Thus, we will add greatly to our understanding of a pristine, economically important, and&lt;br/&gt;geographically dominant ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;Our education/outreach and broader impacts will be far-reaching. For example, Cullings is&lt;br/&gt;adjunct at a Hispanic-Serving Institution and will teach classes and seminars there, and students&lt;br/&gt;from that institution will be invited to participate in the study. In addition, Cullings is a member&lt;br/&gt;of the Ames Native American Advisory Council, an education/outreach organization within&lt;br/&gt;NASA dedicated to bringing science education to reservations. Henson has volunteered for 12&lt;br/&gt;years as an ASM minority educator/lecturer, and has been a preceptor for NIH (Institutional&lt;br/&gt;Student Minority Development) and NSF (Minority Access Program, Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;for All) minority education grants. In addition, and for the past 10 years her lab has hosted&lt;br/&gt;Native American high school students and teachers through the American Indian Research&lt;br/&gt;Opportunities (AIRO) program on campus. Her group also assists YNP park personnel with their&lt;br/&gt;microbiology brochures and videotapes for the general public, and maintains a Web site about&lt;br/&gt;their work in Yellowstone (www.montana.edu.hotfungi). Henson also participates in ASMs on-&lt;br/&gt;line science mentoring project. Students from all programs will be recruited to participate in this&lt;br/&gt;project.</AbstractNarration>
