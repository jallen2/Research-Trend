    <AbstractNarration>Funding for computer scientists in quan um information processing has come from a variety of&lt;br/&gt;programs a NSF. While a new QuBIC program has been announced in he EIA division of CISE,&lt;br/&gt;there is arguably a need for a focused program on quantum information processing with a direct&lt;br/&gt;focus on he computer science aspects of he research. The C-CR division of CISE would be the&lt;br/&gt;natural location for such a program on "Quantum Communications, Cryptography and Coding."&lt;br/&gt;To gauge the need and plan what migh be the scientific coverage and research agenda for such&lt;br/&gt;a potential program,we plan to bring several of he leading researchers together for a planning&lt;br/&gt;workshop.This workshop will lead to a five-to ten-page report that will give a detailed assessment&lt;br/&gt;of the need for a new C-CR program and give a descrip ion of he research areas ha such a program&lt;br/&gt;should focus on. By having a C-CR program on "Quantum Communications, Cryptography and&lt;br/&gt;Coding," NSF would be able to focus its efforts on he computer science aspects of quanum&lt;br/&gt;information processing and greatly enhance its ability o make sure he United States keeps its&lt;br/&gt;leading role in his important area. This workshop and report will be the first important step in&lt;br/&gt;planning such a program.</AbstractNarration>
