    <AbstractNarration>The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to Furman University to prepare solid-state charge-transfer complexes from functionalized diacetylenes. With this award, Professors Timothy Hanks at Furman University and William Pennington at Clemson University will prepare three types of polymeric materials - crystalline and microcrystalline powders, and amorphous thin films - from hosts derived from donor diacetylene molecules with attached inclusion acceptor-compounds - organo-iodides - in a 'pocket' or 'cavity' of the polymeric material. Nanoporous zeolite type materials will be prepared from these polymers after removal of the inclusion compounds by thermolysis or solvent extraction. A number of donor molecules, which not only photopolymerize, but also provide cavities of different sizes and shapes for acceptor molecules, will be synthesized and characterized, and these studies may result in new classes of porous organic solids with tunable optical, electronic and chemical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zeolite-like nanoporous materials that will be prepared in this study are expected to have tunable optical, electronic and chemical properties. This project at a primarily undergraduate institution, which has an active research program with undergraduate and high school students, will provide, in addition, research and educational opportunities in material synthesis and characterization.</AbstractNarration>
