    <AbstractNarration>Hear Our Voices is a Demonstration initiative that links twenty Clubhouses from the &lt;br/&gt;Computer Clubhouse Network in creating new opportunities specifically for girls and&lt;br/&gt;young women, to develop fluency with computer technology, and to learn valuable career&lt;br/&gt;and life skills as well. Hear Our Voices will serve as a model for the future in other &lt;br/&gt;Computer Clubhouses in the Network, as well as like-minded informal educational&lt;br/&gt;programs for girls and young women at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founded at the Computer Museum in Boston in 1993, the Computer Clubhouse has grown&lt;br/&gt;into a Network of 48 Clubhouses in 13 states and the District of Columbia, plus 11&lt;br/&gt;Clubhouses overseas, touching the lives of thousands of young people. The Computer &lt;br/&gt;Clubhouses provide a successful, innovative, andempowering after-school learning&lt;br/&gt;environment for young people (ages 8-18) from underserved communities. A safe and&lt;br/&gt;welcoming milieu, skilled and caring mentors, and high-end hardware and professional&lt;br/&gt;software tools help Clubhouse youth become confident learners through a variety of creative&lt;br/&gt;computer applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flagship Computer Clubhouse moved to the Museum of Science in 1999, when the&lt;br/&gt;Computer Museum joined forces with the Museum of Science. Since then, the Network &lt;br/&gt;of Clubhouses has grown rapidly; with the support of Intel Corporation and other&lt;br/&gt;sponsors, more Clubhouses are now being planned and implemented. Based on community&lt;br/&gt;interest and the success of the Clubhouse learning model in transforming young people's&lt;br/&gt;lives, current plans call for growth to more than 100 Clubhouses by 2004. Located&lt;br/&gt;primarily in youth-serving organizations such as Boys &amp; Girls Clubs and Urban Leagues,&lt;br/&gt;Computer Clubhouses serve inner-city neighborhoods as well as smaller communities &lt;br/&gt;with a high proportion of under-served populations. The Computer Clubhouse community&lt;br/&gt;is diverse, made up of African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans, Native&lt;br/&gt;Americans, recent immigrants, and Whites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to recruit and retain more girls and young women in a field that has a &lt;br/&gt;dearth of participation by women -computer technology - the flagship Computer Clubhouse&lt;br/&gt;in Boston since 1995 has pioneered several programs especially for girls, providing them&lt;br/&gt;with access to rich technology resources, female mentors and role models, a &lt;br/&gt;community of peers, and a positive, creative, and supportive learning environment. &lt;br/&gt;The new Hear Our Voices program will significantly expand the flagship Clubhouse's&lt;br/&gt;programming for girls and young women, to 20 new venues and with new, locally-designed&lt;br/&gt;programming. Specifically, it will enrich opportunities for girls in four ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Twenty of the Computer Clubhouses within the United States will receive funding and &lt;br/&gt;support to hire and train staff dedicated to gender equity and girls programming, and to&lt;br/&gt;launch locally-based Hear Our Voices programs at their Clubhouses, including at least &lt;br/&gt;one component of girls-only hours or days at each participating Clubhouse.&lt;br/&gt;*Leveraging the experience gained at the flagship Computer Clubhouse, Network staff&lt;br/&gt;from the Museum of Science will provide professional development and program assistance&lt;br/&gt;for girls'programming to Clubhouse Coordinators across the Network.&lt;br/&gt;*Building on the momentum and resources of the growing Clubhouse Network, a digital &lt;br/&gt;network called the Clubhouse Village will support both a real and a virtual community of&lt;br/&gt;Clubhouse youth. An area on the Village will be designated especially for girls'&lt;br/&gt;activities, and the Village will also support interaction among staff and mentors for&lt;br/&gt;mutual support and for sharing best practices. The Clubhouse Village will consist of a&lt;br/&gt;secure, private Intranet, using Internet technology and tools to enable Clubhouse youth &lt;br/&gt;to communicate with each other and collaborate on creative projects.&lt;br/&gt;*The virtual community will be made more viable by a face-to-face gathering of &lt;br/&gt;participating youth and staff at a Computer Clubhouse Youth Summit in the summer of&lt;br/&gt;2004.</AbstractNarration>
