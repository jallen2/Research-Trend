    <AbstractNarration>0214946&lt;br/&gt;Coleman&lt;br/&gt;Understanding many soil processes, including the accumulation of organic matter and&lt;br/&gt;the formation of soil aggregates, requires research that is conducted over decadal time&lt;br/&gt;periods. The dynamics of soil organic matter and soil fauna at the Horseshoe Bend&lt;br/&gt;(HSB) agroecosystem site in Georgia have been studied in replicated experimental&lt;br/&gt;plots since 1978. Analyses indicate that the experimental treatments (no-tillage and&lt;br/&gt;conventional-tillage regimes) are continuing to diverge. It is essential to continue the&lt;br/&gt;experiments for an additional six years, to enable prediction of what the long-term&lt;br/&gt;consequences of our manipulations will be. Consequently, a continuation of ongoing&lt;br/&gt;LTREB research on soil processes in no-till and conventional till plots at HSB is proposed, with&lt;br/&gt;some significant changes. The new research focuses on two related areas:&lt;br/&gt;1) long-term measurements of the gradually-increasing base of soil organic matter from&lt;br/&gt;C3-pathway plants, in crop rotations that have been in effect since 1997.&lt;br/&gt;2) following the production, accumulation, fate and ecological effects of the Bt proteins&lt;br/&gt;from the summer planting of Bt (and non-Bt) cotton in subplots within our main plots.&lt;br/&gt;The relationship between these focal areas is simple. The variation in the size of soil&lt;br/&gt;aggregates may influence the sequestration of Bt toxins, and their breakdown products,&lt;br/&gt;within soils. It has already been shown that no-tillage management systems at HSB&lt;br/&gt;generate an increasing representation of soil macroaggregates in comparison to the&lt;br/&gt;markedly reduced macroaggregates in our conventional tillage plots. Therefore, it is&lt;br/&gt;hypothesized that no-tillage systems will sequester more Bt-related products than will&lt;br/&gt;conventional-tillage plots.&lt;br/&gt;Several short-term studies (see references in Project Description) have failed to detect&lt;br/&gt;deleterious changes in non-target soil fauna as a result of Bt in crop residues. There&lt;br/&gt;are three possible explanations for this: a) that no deleterious effects exist, b) that short-&lt;br/&gt;term experiments do not adequately predict the long-term consequences of repeated&lt;br/&gt;exposure to Bt residues, and c) that effects are contingent upon properties of the soil&lt;br/&gt;such as aggregate size. It would seem prudent to be able to distinguish among these&lt;br/&gt;possibilities and the long-term plantings at HSB will allow that to occur.</AbstractNarration>
