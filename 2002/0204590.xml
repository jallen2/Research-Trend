    <AbstractNarration>NSF proposal DMS - 0204590&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Bo Guan, University of Tennessee &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: FULLY NONLINEAR ELLIPTIC AND PARABOLIC EQUATIONS &lt;br/&gt; IN DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations arise from many problems&lt;br/&gt;in differential geometry. In recent years these equations have attracted &lt;br/&gt;a lot of attention and significant progresses have been made to understand&lt;br/&gt;these equations and related geometric problems. In this project, the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator will continue his research in this direction. The problems to &lt;br/&gt;be investigated in this project include isometric embeddings of metrics of &lt;br/&gt;nonnegative curvature; questions about hypersurfaces of nonnegative constant &lt;br/&gt;Gauss curvature with boundary in Euclidean space and more general Riemannian &lt;br/&gt;manifolds, including existence, uniqueness and regularity; spacelike entire &lt;br/&gt;graphs of constant Gauss curvature in Minkowski space; Minkowski type problems&lt;br/&gt;of finding closed convex hypersurfaces of prescribed Weingarten curvatures;&lt;br/&gt;regularity of solutions to degenerate Monge-Ampere equations in non-convex &lt;br/&gt;domains; regularity of pluricomplex Green functions and existence of &lt;br/&gt;holomorphic functions in Kahler manifolds; Hessian equations on Riemannian &lt;br/&gt;manifolds and applications in geometric problems; hypersurfaces in hyperbolic &lt;br/&gt;space of constant mean curvature (or Weingarten hypersurfaces) with prescribed&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic boundary at infinity; and evolution of hypersurfaces by curvature &lt;br/&gt;functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equations arising from most of these problems are highly nonlinear. These &lt;br/&gt;equations also model various phenomena in sciences and engineering. Solving &lt;br/&gt;such equations heavily depends on establishing apriori estimates up to second &lt;br/&gt;order derivatives. For many of the proposed problems in this project, these &lt;br/&gt;estimates alone are often not enough to lead to existence of solutions; there &lt;br/&gt;are other obstructions from geometry and analysis. These all impose &lt;br/&gt;challenging questions. Research on these problems may also develop methods of &lt;br/&gt;numerical approximations to the solutions that are useful in engineering and&lt;br/&gt;science.</AbstractNarration>
