    <AbstractNarration>Several computationally di .cult optimization problems have a natural underlying discrete struc-&lt;br/&gt;ture:e.g.,design/routing problems in networking have appropriate graph-theoretic formulations.&lt;br/&gt;Discrete/combinatorial optimization is the study of how such combinatorial underpinnings can help&lt;br/&gt;us understand better and solve optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop improved algorithms for speci .c important problems in this .eld,&lt;br/&gt;and to develop general algorithmic paradigms for combinatorial optimization;one of the main gen-&lt;br/&gt;eral approaches will be probabilistic The powerful role played by randomness in the computational&lt;br/&gt;context has been among the major discoveries in the foundations of computer science.This project&lt;br/&gt;proposes to develop improved randomized algorithms for a family of hard combinatorial optimiza-&lt;br/&gt;tion problems,and to develop new probabilistic tools of independent nterest in the process.It also&lt;br/&gt;aims to conduct re .ned probabilistic (i.e.,average-case instead of worst-case)analyses of some of&lt;br/&gt;these problems where relevant.Two sub-themes of the proposed research are to study hard opti-&lt;br/&gt;mization problems that arise in the .eld of networking,and to approach di .cult problems through&lt;br/&gt;approximation algorithms where appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to study improved algorithmic approaches for fundamental problems&lt;br/&gt;(such as various design,routing,and scheduling problems in networks)as well as to develop improved&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic/algorithmic paradigms in general.This endeavor will help develop new principles for&lt;br/&gt;the design,analysis,and engineering of randomized/approximation algorithms in networking and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial optimization.</AbstractNarration>
