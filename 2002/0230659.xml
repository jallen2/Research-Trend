    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230659&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Evans, Edward&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Akron&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Planning Grant to Establish the Center for Engineering Learning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant presents a novel strategy for engaging teams comprised of faculty&lt;br/&gt;and students from engineering, education, and the sciences in structured collaborative learning of&lt;br/&gt;engineering and engineering pedagogy. Through collaboration between faculties of engineering and&lt;br/&gt;education, team design projects that involve pre-service elementary education students and engineers at&lt;br/&gt;the freshman through senior levels will be developed. Using planning grant funds, a working group will&lt;br/&gt;be formed to develop and pilot-test the multi-disciplinary team design project.. In the long run, the CEL will participate in developing 1) high quality teachers prepared to include engineering in the K-12 curriculum, 2)&lt;br/&gt;engineering faculty applying pedagogy, assessment and learning theory to engineering curriculum, and 3)&lt;br/&gt;a body of scholarship on how students learn engineering at every developmental level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our approach is that multi-disciplinary team design projects, when effectively mentored&lt;br/&gt;by engineering and education faculty and practicing engineers, will increase students' engineering&lt;br/&gt;competency and improve pedagogy in undergraduate engineering. The development of the&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary team design project will be driven by the input of in-service teachers and faculty from&lt;br/&gt;the College of Education. The engineering content of the design project will come from the expertise and&lt;br/&gt;resources of academic and industrial engineers. The administrators and industrial advisor on the working&lt;br/&gt;group will address issues regarding institutional policy and industrial involvement, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The starting point of our development will be the Vertically Integrated Team Design Project&lt;br/&gt;conducted in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Engineering design will be learned by solving an&lt;br/&gt;authentic engineering problem with a team of education students and engineers at all levels (students&lt;br/&gt;(freshman-senior), faculty, and industrial). Each team will be mentored by faculty members from&lt;br/&gt;education and engineering, a practicing engineer, and a teacher. In this planning grant activity, four teams&lt;br/&gt;will include pre-service elementary education teachers as active engineering members. Formative&lt;br/&gt;assessment of the project will be discussed and disseminated by all stakeholders within the working&lt;br/&gt;group. t our efforts will proceed at a rapid pace.</AbstractNarration>
