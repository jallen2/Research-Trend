    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Xu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study interactions between operator algebras and conformal&lt;br/&gt;field theories which have proved to be very fruitful lately. The main&lt;br/&gt;emphasis of this research is placed on the study of &lt;br/&gt;certain representation theory&lt;br/&gt;questions such as Kac-Wakimoto conjecture, orbifolds and boundary states in &lt;br/&gt;conformal field theories using operator algebraic techniques. &lt;br/&gt;The applications of these operator algebraic techniques&lt;br/&gt;will lead to proofs of representation theory questions&lt;br/&gt;and shed lights on exotic subfactors such as those coming from &lt;br/&gt;conformal inclusions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of operator algebras was introduced by John von Neumann &lt;br/&gt;in order to provide a proper mathematical framework for Quantum &lt;br/&gt;Mechanics. Conformal field theory was a theory &lt;br/&gt;describing critical phenomena in&lt;br/&gt;condensed matter physics, and it also plays an important role in &lt;br/&gt;string theory. The remarkable interactions between operator algebras&lt;br/&gt;and conformal field theory has led to many interesting mathematical&lt;br/&gt;issues. The aim of this research&lt;br/&gt;is to find solutions to some of the important mathematical issues that &lt;br/&gt;surface in this context which have a wide range of applications.</AbstractNarration>
