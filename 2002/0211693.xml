    <AbstractNarration>Professor Richard McCreery of Ohio State University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the structure and mechanisms of molecular tunneling junction systems. Monomolecular films of a compound tethered to a graphite surface are probed as a mercury drop approaches the surface. Raman spectroscopy is employed in an in-situ manner. Molecules such as nitroazobenzene are utilized as adsorbates. The mechanism of conduction and conductive switching of this system is being investigated. How does the molecular structure of the organic layer affect the electronic properties of carbon based junctions? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is relevant to the development of molecular electronics for applications such as high density data storage, molecular transistors, photodetectors, display technology and chemical sensors. Using molecules as electronic elements is a goal of nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
