    <AbstractNarration>PI: Vladimir Peller&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number 0200712&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will use vectorial Hankel and &lt;br/&gt;Toeplitz operators in noncommutative analysis. In&lt;br/&gt;spite of the recent progress of approximation theory for matrix&lt;br/&gt;and operator functions there are still many open problems&lt;br/&gt;important in applications such as control theory, multivariate&lt;br/&gt;stationary processes, etc. The principal investigator will &lt;br/&gt;look for a sharp estimate of the degree of the superoptimal&lt;br/&gt;approximant of a rational matrix function and sharp estimates of&lt;br/&gt;the resolvents of Toeplitz and Wiener-Hopf operators acting on&lt;br/&gt;spaces of vector functions, study properties of Wiener-Hopf,&lt;br/&gt;thematic, and canonical factorizations of matrix functions, study&lt;br/&gt;different regularity conditions for multivariate stationary&lt;br/&gt;processes in spectral terms, study Hankel-Schur multipliers, study&lt;br/&gt;Schatten--von Neumann properties of certain integral operators&lt;br/&gt;arising from Schrodinger operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among operators acting on spaces of analytic functions there are&lt;br/&gt;two classes that play an extremely important role. These are&lt;br/&gt;Hankel operators and Toeplitz operators. The theory of such&lt;br/&gt;operators has been rapidly developing for the last 20 years.&lt;br/&gt;Recently it has become clear that to satisfy the needs of control&lt;br/&gt;theory, prediction theory and other applications, it is necessary&lt;br/&gt;to study Toeplitz and Hankel operators on spaces of vector&lt;br/&gt;functions. This leads to a considerably more complicated theory,&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator has obtained recently interesting&lt;br/&gt;results that required a new technique. He is going to continue to&lt;br/&gt;work in this direction and apply Hankel and Toeplitz operators on&lt;br/&gt;spaces of vector functions to different problems in noncommutative&lt;br/&gt;analysis.</AbstractNarration>
