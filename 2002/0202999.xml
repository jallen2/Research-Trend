    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0202999&lt;br/&gt;PI: Huyi Hu &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is devoted to the study of ergodic properties of&lt;br/&gt;nonuniformly hyperbolic systems. We focus on almost&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic systems and some related systems. An smooth dynamical&lt;br/&gt;system is almost hyperbolic if it is hyperbolic everywhere except&lt;br/&gt;at a finite set of points. Such systems may have quite different&lt;br/&gt;ergodic behaviors from uniformly hyperbolic systems.&lt;br/&gt;In this project we will study existence of equilibrium states,&lt;br/&gt;including SRB measures and absolutely continuous invariant&lt;br/&gt;measures in multidimensional spaces; rates of convergence to the&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium states for both finite and infinite measure cases,&lt;br/&gt;and some related topics such as rates of decay of correlations of&lt;br/&gt;the systems and the central limit theorem; some other ergodic&lt;br/&gt;properties of the systems such as stochastic stability, Gibbs&lt;br/&gt;properties, topological conjugation. We are also interested in&lt;br/&gt;using these or similar systems to construct varies examples of&lt;br/&gt;systems that have given properties, for instance, diffeomorphisms&lt;br/&gt;or flows on any manifolds that preserve the Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;volume, have nonzero Lyapunov exponents almost everywhere, and&lt;br/&gt;have countably many ergodic components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ergodic theory concerns the statistic behavior of systems.&lt;br/&gt;Ergodic properties of uniformly hyperbolic systems were the main&lt;br/&gt;research subject in smooth dynamical systems from 60's to 80's.&lt;br/&gt;The behaviors of such systems are regarded as chaotic.&lt;br/&gt;Now nonuniformly hyperbolic systems become a main research topic&lt;br/&gt;in the field. This project is devoted to the study of ergodic&lt;br/&gt;properties of almost hyperbolic systems and some other related&lt;br/&gt;systems. Almost hyperbolic systems are smooth dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;in which hyperbolic conditions are violated at only finitely&lt;br/&gt;number of points. These systems lie on the boundary of the set&lt;br/&gt;of uniformly hyperbolic systems, and are the simplest but&lt;br/&gt;nontrivial nonuniformly hyperbolic systems. Earlier studies on&lt;br/&gt;examples of such systems, such as systems on the intervals and&lt;br/&gt;torus, show that some ergodic properties may change dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;In this project we try to develop some theorems for general&lt;br/&gt;almost hyperbolic systems rather than individual examples.</AbstractNarration>
