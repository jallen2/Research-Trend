    <AbstractNarration>0205093&lt;br/&gt;Ledzewicz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the project, optimal control problems will be investigated which arise as &lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for biomedical systems in the chemotherapy of &lt;br/&gt;diseases which have a strong cell proliferation aspect such as cancer or &lt;br/&gt;AIDS. Three directions of research will be pursued: the analysis of models &lt;br/&gt;in cancer chemotherapy, an analysis of models for HIV-infection and anti-&lt;br/&gt;viral treatment of AIDS, and the design and analysis of a general &lt;br/&gt;mathematical framework which combines common features of both cancer &lt;br/&gt;and HIV models. The investigators will use their previous experience &lt;br/&gt;working on cancer chemotherapy models and apply new tools based on &lt;br/&gt;the method of characteristics and high-order conditions for optimality. In &lt;br/&gt;compartmental models for cancer chemotherapy the cell-cycle is &lt;br/&gt;controlled by clustering its phases into compartments and using phase &lt;br/&gt;specific cytostatic killing and blocking agents. The goal is to maximize the &lt;br/&gt;number of cancer cells that the cytostatic agent in the drug kills while &lt;br/&gt;keeping the toxicity to the normal tissue acceptable. In this project a &lt;br/&gt;synthesis of optimal controls for these models will be constructed. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, more complex mathematical models that take into account &lt;br/&gt;additional aspects such as evolving drug resistance or bone marrow &lt;br/&gt;destruction will be analyzed. Due to the complexity of HIV infection, &lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for AIDS have only recently been developed and &lt;br/&gt;still are constantly being revised and updated taking new medical data into &lt;br/&gt;account. With the main attention so far given to the form of the dynamics &lt;br/&gt;that best models the interactions between the virus and the human immune &lt;br/&gt;system under drug treatment, many of these models still have not been &lt;br/&gt;formulated as optimal control problems. The investigators will analyze a &lt;br/&gt;variety of these models in the framework of optimal control and compare &lt;br/&gt;the solutions aiming at a design of optimal treatment protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the project, the investigators will consider mathematical models in the &lt;br/&gt;chemotherapy of diseases that have a strong cell proliferation aspect such &lt;br/&gt;a cancer or AIDS. These models will be analyzed as optimal control &lt;br/&gt;problems with the drug dosage serving as control parameter with the goal &lt;br/&gt;of maximizing the number of cancer cells killed by the drug in the case of &lt;br/&gt;cancer (respectively maximizing the number of uninfected cells in the case &lt;br/&gt;of chemotherapy for AIDS) while minimizing the harmful side effects and &lt;br/&gt;cost of the chemotherapy. Although individually these problems are very &lt;br/&gt;different in their specifics, they also have many aspects in common and &lt;br/&gt;can be put into one general mathematical model that encompasses them &lt;br/&gt;all. Thus, while on one side there is a need to consider these problems &lt;br/&gt;separately to understand the implications for the underlying disease, on the &lt;br/&gt;other side there are simplifications and insights to be gained by looking at &lt;br/&gt;the general properties common to these models. This project will address &lt;br/&gt;both directions. A biomedical interpretation of the conditions that optimal &lt;br/&gt;controls satisfy will be given in terms understandable by biomedical &lt;br/&gt;personnel and the conditions will be related to the underlying biological &lt;br/&gt;situation. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will be of interest &lt;br/&gt;to the medical community by giving some insights into the analysis of &lt;br/&gt;existing chemotherapy protocols for cancer or HIV and possibly aid in the &lt;br/&gt;design of new improved protocols. These results are particularly important &lt;br/&gt;for HIV treatments which so far do not cure the disease, but only provide a &lt;br/&gt;long-term maintenance program.</AbstractNarration>
