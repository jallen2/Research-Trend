    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to further improve an assistive device for reading that is currently under development at the company. The device, an electromechanical&lt;br/&gt;page turner, allows people with upper extremity impairment to conveniently and easily turn pages of a book in either direction. With the touch of a button, the page turner can automatically grab the next page, turn it, and keep the book opened flat during the entire process. If necessary, an alternate activation method can be employed, such as a sip-and-puff switch, chin switch, or foot pedal. There are three key phases of the page turning process : page engagement, page restraint, and page transport. In its current form, the page turner prototype offers superior solutions to each of these phases and addresses the limitations of commercially available systems. Several key research problems must now be addressed in order to improve the reliability of the apparatus. The problems center on the unit's turnstile element which serves two principle functions: page restraint and page transport. The turnstile is necessary to hold the book open flat, as well as to move a page from one side of the book to the other. The turnstile-on-paper and paper-on-paper frictional properties are important considerations for successful operation of the page turner. The goal of the Phase I Project is to investigate optimal contact pressure between the turnstile and the book page, as well as to exxamine the bending stiffness, coefficient of friction, and the mechanical characteristics of paper. To achieve the stated goals, experiments are proposed to test a variety of paper materials and book sizes, and to develop computer models that will help in parametric studies of the design. The experimental and computational results will be validated with the standard test methods recommended by the U.S. Trade Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) and Japan Industrial Standards (JIS). The results of this investigation will allow the company to optimize the design and thereby improve the performance and reliability of the page turner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are in the area of assistive home-care technology for the elderly and disabled. A page turner would be particularly beneficial to people with limited bilateral upper extremity function caused by neurological impairment, musculoskeletal problems, and generalized weakness. The proposed device would serve to enhance their quality of life by improving their independence in this activity of daily living.</AbstractNarration>
