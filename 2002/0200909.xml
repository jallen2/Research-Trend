    <AbstractNarration>0200909 &lt;br/&gt;Moore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many search and optimization problems that occur in the real world consist&lt;br/&gt;of "constraint satisfaction" tasks where we wish to simultaneously satisfy&lt;br/&gt;many demands. These problems occur in scheduling, manufacturing,&lt;br/&gt;compilers, and many other contexts. Many of these problems are&lt;br/&gt;"NP-complete," meaning that they can probably not be solved with less than&lt;br/&gt;an exponential amount of computational effort. However, this definition&lt;br/&gt;of computational complexity focuses on the worst case, not on the typical&lt;br/&gt;cases we might find in the real world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a mathematical bridge between the worst case and real-world problems,&lt;br/&gt;we will consider random, or average, cases of NP-complete problems. Many&lt;br/&gt;people have observed that when the density of constraints passes a&lt;br/&gt;critical threshold, these problems undergo a phase transition from&lt;br/&gt;solvability to unsolvability. Approaches from physics have already helped&lt;br/&gt;us understand this transition. We will prove rigorous upper and lower&lt;br/&gt;bounds on the value of this threshold, analyze the performance of&lt;br/&gt;heuristics that attempt to solve these problems quickly, and research the&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness of the "Replica Trick" of statistical physics in this area.</AbstractNarration>
