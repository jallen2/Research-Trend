    <AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: DMS-0204723&lt;br/&gt;PI: David Scott&lt;br/&gt;Title: Multivariate nonparametric methodology studies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will study new nonparametric methodology focusing on the mid-range and high-range dimensions to better understand data modeling, the curse of dimensionality, and problems associated with massive data sets in multivariate regression and density estimation as well as closely related problems in clustering, mixtures, pattern recognition, and dimension reduction. A new data-based parametric estimation algorithm, based upon integrated squared error, will be investigated for its flexibility and robustness. By applying the criterion to the fitting of local polynomials, a new robust nonparametric regression algorithm can be proposed, which will be applied to automatic detection of hundreds of overlapping tracks in subatomic detector experiments. This project will examine semiparametric models for density estimation that can work better than ordinary nonparametric algorithms, extending feasibility by several extra dimensions. Of special interest, this algorithm can be used to fit subsets of a full mixture model. Applications include regression, image processing, clustering, outlier detection, density estimation, and visualization. The project will extend work on spatial modeling and the combination of multiple data surveys into useful data modeling and maps of conditional estimators of factors and their covariates. Currently, simultaneous mapping of variables is difficult to interpret, due to the availability of data only in discrete spatial areas (e.g. census tracts) and cross-tabulation of the two variables of interest. By constructing a smooth map of one variable as a second variable varies, a more faithful and accurate understanding of the spatial relationship may be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonparametric methodology is widely used in one and two dimensions, but less so in higher dimensions. This research focuses on the mid-range and high-range dimensions and provides a deeper understanding of the implications to data modeling of the curse of dimensionality and problems associated with massive data sets. Particular emphasis will be given to multivariate regression and density estimation problems, and closely related applications such as clustering, mixture estimation, pattern recognition, and dimension reduction. This proposal examines new points of view, especially related to locally adaptive and spatial estimation, as well as some recent extensions of nonparametric criteria to parametric problems. The new parametric approach has potential for new nonparametric formulations and applications. At a recent National Research Council workshop, numerous scientists identified critical statistical needs in their work with massive data sets: alternatives to principal components, specialized visualization tools for exploring massive data, better clustering algorithms, and techniques for handling nonstationary data. Results from this research directly impact three of these four critical opportunities. This program represents a comprehensive and long-term attack on a host of important data analytic problems in multivariate estimation. The results will be of long-term theoretical interest and will provide near-term solutions to real-world problems.</AbstractNarration>
