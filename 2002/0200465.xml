    <AbstractNarration>In this project the principal investigator will apply methods&lt;br/&gt;from computability theory to study the effective content and&lt;br/&gt;proof-theoretic strength of various areas of mathematics. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, he will concentrate on computable model theory and&lt;br/&gt;algebra, reverse mathematics and effectiveness of combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;principles, and effective notions of randomness and relative&lt;br/&gt;randomness. In computable model theory, this project will&lt;br/&gt;continue the development of methods to address issues raised by&lt;br/&gt;effectivizing model-theoretic notions. These issues include the&lt;br/&gt;relationships between the different ways that a given structure&lt;br/&gt;may be effectivized, the relationships between the degree of&lt;br/&gt;effectivity of different models of theories with few models, and&lt;br/&gt;the differences between the computability-theoretic phenomena&lt;br/&gt;that can occur in general and those that can occur within&lt;br/&gt;well-known classes of structures. Hirschfeldt will also study&lt;br/&gt;computability-theoretic and proof-theoretic aspects of&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial principles, exploiting the connections between&lt;br/&gt;effective mathematics and the reverse mathematics&lt;br/&gt;program. Finally, the principal investigator will study the&lt;br/&gt;structure of (effectively approximable) reals under notions of&lt;br/&gt;relative effective randomness defined through the use of&lt;br/&gt;prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of initial segments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the effective content of mathematics has received&lt;br/&gt;increasing attention in the last few decades. It is a natural&lt;br/&gt;outgrowth of the efforts to understand and formalize the notions&lt;br/&gt;of algorithm and computable function undertaken in the early part&lt;br/&gt;of the twentieth century. It is of both pure mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;foundational interest, and has important connections with&lt;br/&gt;computer science. This project aims to further our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of how structure affects computability, and how computability&lt;br/&gt;interacts with other fundamental notions of modern mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and foundations of mathematics, such as randomness and&lt;br/&gt;proof-theoretic strength. Computability theorists have developed&lt;br/&gt;a highly successful theory of relative computational complexity&lt;br/&gt;of sets of numbers, which, in addition to its intrinsic&lt;br/&gt;mathematical interest, has been influential in theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science. One of the goals of this project is to continue&lt;br/&gt;the development of an emerging parallel theory of relative&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic randomness, which can act as a theoretical framework&lt;br/&gt;in which to consider questions such as: When should we say that&lt;br/&gt;an infinite set is more random than another, and what&lt;br/&gt;consequences does the relative randomness of sets have for their&lt;br/&gt;relative computational complexity?</AbstractNarration>
