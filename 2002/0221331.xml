    <AbstractNarration>This dissertation will investigate the cultural frames that state policy makers use when advocating change in laws regarding social welfare and criminal justice: Are criminals and welfare recipients portrayed as rational actors, as victims, or as morally deficient? Is criminal law described as intended to rehabilitate, deter, punish, or incapacitate? How is race included in these debates? The research will collect texts from hearings, legislation, speeches, op-eds, editorials, and other advocacy surrounding proposals to change eight laws in each of four states (New Jersey, Minnesota, Indiana, and California) that vary on their welfare generosity and criminal law. Computerized content analysis will be used to identify themes and compare them across states, time, legislative outcome, and advocacy source.</AbstractNarration>
