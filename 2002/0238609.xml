    <AbstractNarration>CSTB would convene an expert committee to conduct a comprehensive assessment of telecommunications research and development. The study would develop a picture of telecommunications research in the United States, including areas that are and are not being emphasized, the interplay between telecommunications and neighboring fields such as computer science and electrical engineering, and the relationships between pre-competitive research and standards-setting efforts. The study would examine changes in the level of support, research focus, and research time horizon at the major U.S. industrial labs as well as more broadly across the industry, including startups. The study would also examine telecommunications research within universities, considering how much is done, where, and under what conditions. It would assess the implications of these changes for the U.S. telecommunications industry--recognizing that that industry itself is changing and considering possible future trajectories for the industry--and compare the U.S. research model to research initiatives being undertaken in other countries (especially Europe and Japan) and bythe European Union. Looking across industry and academia, it would consider future research directions, the interplay between telecommunications and computer science, and assess whether new institutional arrangements or programs are needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project would culminate in a consensus report recommending ways to strengthen the U.S. research base, sustain education and training of future telecommunications researchers, and enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. telecommunications sector. The report would be distributed to key decision-makers in government, industry, academia; as well as congressional staff and the general public. The report would be made available on the Web as well as in hard copy. The completed report would be briefed to interested parties in government, industry, and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project and its broader impacts both would flow from its focusing attention on an area of critical national (and international) importance. Historically, telecommunications R&amp;D has been the province of private industry(with comparatively little effort in academia), notably the former Ma Bell and other companies that were leaders in different telecommunications segments--actors that have suffered with recent economic conditions. Intellectually, the project would explore and characterize telecommunications as a field and a focus for different kinds of research. It will address what it would take to grow a more significant academic research capability. In addition to stimulating research, boosting academic interest and activity, the project will have broader impacts by helping to sustain and enhance an arena that is important to national security, economic competitiveness, and the larger base of information technology capability and use of which telecommunications is a vital part. The technical opportunities it will discuss will be linked to benefits among the public and large and specific segments as users of different kinds of telecommunications capabilities.</AbstractNarration>
