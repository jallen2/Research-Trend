    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0200322&lt;br/&gt;Lynne Cassimeris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. Lynne Cassimeris at Lehigh University to purchase a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. This microscope will support a research community that includes faculty in biological sciences, physics, chemical engineering, earth and environmental sciences, materials science, and biology faculty at nearby colleges and universities. The confocal microscope will facilitate rapid three-dimensional imaging of microscopic structures, allowing researchers to examine specimens in ways that are not possible with conventional light microscopes. The confocal microscope images will be used to answer questions about where and when specific molecules are active during biological processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The confocal microscope will have a major impact on the research programs of numerous faculty at Lehigh University, ranging from cell biology and neuroscience to the structure and dynamics of colloidal crystals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies in the research areas conducted at hehigh will not only contribute to our understanding of basic cellular and organismal processes, but may also have future practical applications to human health. The microscope system will also provide valuable training to young researchers by exposing undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to state-of-the-art light microscopy.</AbstractNarration>
