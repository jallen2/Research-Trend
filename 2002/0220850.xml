    <AbstractNarration>This project encourages and assists qualified financially needy students majoring in computer science, engineering, and mathematics in the completion their degrees. Central to the project is the fostering of socially cohesive cohorts of students progressing together through their programs in an academically enriched, interdisciplinary, supportive environment. A special effort is made to increase the participation and retention of underrepresented groups. The project supports an initial group of 10 students, recruited in the first year, through four years of study. A second group of 10 students, recruited in the second year of funding, are supported for three years of study with their final year of study funded by other sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An outstanding feature of the project is the coupling of this very individualized environment typical of a liberal arts college with a high quality School of Engineering. Existing university programs are integrated into the project. Activities for the CSEMS students include a weekly interdisciplinary seminar and social gathering, the opportunity for shared housing, opportunities to work together as peer-leaders in courses relevant to their disciplines, shared volunteer projects that use their academic expertise, and group interactions with professionals in their fields of interest. Students work closely with an academic advisor, have the opportunity to work with an industry contact, and participate in internships in his or her field of study.</AbstractNarration>
