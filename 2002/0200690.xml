    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS-0200690&lt;br/&gt;William B. Johnson and Gilles Pisier, PIs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators will investigate problems in the &lt;br/&gt;theories of Banach spaces and operator spaces. The problems &lt;br/&gt;to be considered fall into several subcategories; namely,&lt;br/&gt;affine approximation of Lipschitz functions, non linear&lt;br/&gt;infinite dimensional and finite dimensional geometry, finite &lt;br/&gt;dimensional subspaces of Lebesgue spaces, measures on infinite &lt;br/&gt;dimensional spaces, similarity theory, tensor products of &lt;br/&gt;operator spaces, bounded and completely bounded approximation &lt;br/&gt;properties, and amenability of spaces of operators. There will &lt;br/&gt;be coordination of the proposed project with the existing &lt;br/&gt;Workshop in Linear Analysis and Probability Theory at Texas A&amp;M &lt;br/&gt;University. This Workshop encourages interactions among &lt;br/&gt;researchers and apprentices in different mathematical &lt;br/&gt;fields by bringing together graduate students, young &lt;br/&gt;investigators, and junior and senior postdoctoral participants &lt;br/&gt;in several areas of analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banach space theory, the study of notions of "distance" which &lt;br/&gt;are not necessarily Euclidean on both finite and infinite &lt;br/&gt;dimensional vector spaces, forms the basis for both Euclidean &lt;br/&gt;and non-Euclidean geometry and the analytic geometry of infinite &lt;br/&gt;dimensional function spaces, including the space of continuous &lt;br/&gt;numerical functions on an interval as well as more complicated &lt;br/&gt;classes of functions. From the beginning, the ideas at the &lt;br/&gt;root of Quantum Mechanics have had a major impact on mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;stimulating the study of operators and their spectrum instead of &lt;br/&gt;numerical functions. These ideas have led recently to the new &lt;br/&gt;field of "Quantized Functional Analysis" or "Operator Space &lt;br/&gt;Theory" and this development has led to the solution of several &lt;br/&gt;major problems as well as opened new avenues of research. &lt;br/&gt;Analogously, the non linear geometry of Banach spaces &lt;br/&gt;also is a rather recent development which is beginning to have &lt;br/&gt;considerable impact in geometrical analysis in both the finite &lt;br/&gt;and infinite dimensional settings.</AbstractNarration>
