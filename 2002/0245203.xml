    <AbstractNarration>This project is devoted to the study of moduli spaces of Azumaya algebras&lt;br/&gt;over surfaces. As a first step we construct compactifications. A&lt;br/&gt;generalized Azumaya algebra is a perfect object in the derived&lt;br/&gt;category of the surface, endowed with a multiplication. It turns out&lt;br/&gt;that these objects can be used to give completely canonical&lt;br/&gt;compactifications. There is also a natural way to define stability of&lt;br/&gt;generalized Azumaya algebras (depending on some auxiliary&lt;br/&gt;choices). The result is what we would like to call a GIT stack&lt;br/&gt;compactifying the moduli space of Azumaya algebras. The project&lt;br/&gt;proposes to study these spaces and to use them to define ``Donaldson&lt;br/&gt;type invariants''. In addition the geometry of the moduli spaces will&lt;br/&gt;be studied for particular types of surfaces, e.g., elliptic surfaces&lt;br/&gt;and K3 surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complex projective surface can be viewed as a 4 dimensional space&lt;br/&gt;which is endowed with a lot of additional structure. The most&lt;br/&gt;important of these is a choice of a rotation map on the tangent&lt;br/&gt;spaces; it is a rotation over 90 degrees. A lot of research has been&lt;br/&gt;done to classify four dimensional spaces which are endowed with such a&lt;br/&gt;structure. This is usually done by defining invariants (for example&lt;br/&gt;numbers) of complex projective surfaces which can be used to tell them&lt;br/&gt;apart. A very basic example are the Betti numbers, which are&lt;br/&gt;dimensions of cohomology groups. To give you an idea, an element of&lt;br/&gt;the second cohomology group corresponds to a 2 dimensional subspace of&lt;br/&gt;the 4-fold. Of course we are not simply enumerating these; we use a&lt;br/&gt;coarser equivalence relation (deformation equivalence). &lt;br/&gt; Here is a question: How many of these 2 dimensional subspaces have&lt;br/&gt;the property that the tangent space at any point is preserved by the&lt;br/&gt;rotation that defines the complex structure on our 4-fold? Such a&lt;br/&gt;subspace is called a complex curve on the complex surface. This&lt;br/&gt;question has been much studied, and is related to the Hodge&lt;br/&gt;conjecture. However, in this project we go the other way. Namely, we&lt;br/&gt;look at other objects: Complex projective bundles over our 4-fold&lt;br/&gt;determine a degree 2 cohomology class as well, and they are typically&lt;br/&gt;not those which can be represented by complex curves. It turns out&lt;br/&gt;that by looking at all possible complex projective bundles&lt;br/&gt;representing the given cohomology class we get a new space which, if&lt;br/&gt;we can understand it, tells us a lot about the original 4-fold. All&lt;br/&gt;kinds of new invariants of the original complex projective surface can&lt;br/&gt;be defined in terms of these moduli spaces. It is the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;these moduli spaces that will be studied in this project. There is a&lt;br/&gt;lot of techincal machinery that has to be developed before we can&lt;br/&gt;begin the exploration of more geometrical properties and part of the&lt;br/&gt;project will be devoted to developing this machinery.</AbstractNarration>
