    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;What is the ``typical" traffic of a link? What constitutes ``abnormal" traffic, and therefore warrants an alert for suspicious behavior (intrusion)?&lt;br/&gt;How will the Internet look like next year? These are the questions that the project focuses on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has two major thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;The first is to find patterns in the network traffic, and the second is to find trends in the Internet evolution. The technical merit is in the synergy of the networking and data mining fields, pushing the envelope in both:&lt;br/&gt;The networking field will enjoy novel insights and fast tools to predict the network performance. The data mining field will benefit from new problems&lt;br/&gt;and new tools (using fractals, power laws, large-graph algorithms), that will be stress-tested on multiple Gigabytes of real, network data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work will be a novel insight of the network behavior at the micro and macro level. In addition, the work will explore our ability to predict the network behavior and its evolution. As a result, the work will provide new tools to identify abnormal behavior, that could be due to a security breach like a DDoS attack.</AbstractNarration>
