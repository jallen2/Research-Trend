    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Midwest Photosynthesis meeting on "Photosynthesis Research in the Post Genomic World" that will be held at the Turkey Run State Park, Marshall, IN from October 27-29, 2002. The intent of this meeting has been to foster interaction and cooperation among laboratories in the midwest involved with photosynthesis research and to provide a forum for oral and poster presentations by graduate students and post-doctoral scholars. In this regard, the annual meeting has been exquisitely successful and a large number of the students and post docs have gone on to successful scientific careers. Many have continued research in photosynthesis and have established laboratories around the country. Traditionally this meeting has emphasized biochemistry, biophysics, plant physiology and bioenergetics. This support will allow development of a meeting around new technologies inherent in genomics and structural biology and new approaches in systems biology. By bringing together photosynthetic researchers from around the country who are utilizing high throughput technologies and computational analyses for the study of photosynthesis or related topics, this forward looking meeting that will expose the participants to post-genomic systems biology. This support will broaden the range of participants and provide travel and living expenses for undergraduate students and will enhance the diversity of the participants.</AbstractNarration>
