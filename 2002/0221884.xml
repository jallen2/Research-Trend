    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the International Conference on High Performance P/M Components, to be held in April 28 to May 3, 2002 in Coimbra, Portugal. The object of the meeting is to provide a forum for discussions in the area of powder and particulate materials. Senior scientists and engineers from the United States and Europe, and from other parts of the world will participate. In addition, it is intended to encourage young professors and students to attend and funds are sought through this proposal. Both conventional powder metallurgy such as pressing and sintering for production of cost-effective components for use in various transportation and energy industries, as well as new and cutting edge particulate materials such as nanotechnology for structural and device uses, are covered. The conference is organized with United Engineering Foundation with mainly invited overview presentations by experts followed by shorter more specific papers and posters solicited and selected from submitted abstracts. The conference will thus provide a forum for young scientists and research students to learn the past and current aspects related to particulate materials. The NSF funds are used to pay for travel and registration expenses for the appropriate personnel to attend and participate in the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference addresses the production of high performance powder metallurgy components using traditional and new techniques that include rapid solidification, mechanical alloying, thermal spraying and sputtering, cold spraying, vapor deposition, laser forming, metal injection molding, hot isostatic pressing, high strain rate compaction, loose sintering and powder forging, etc. In addition, new grades of alloys with higher densities and enhanced behavior will be discussed. The conference is expected to have over l150 participants from different countries; about 120 participants from Europe, 30 from the USA, and 20 from other countries. This conference will allow Portuguese researchers to present their work on powder metallurgy, and hear of developments in other parts of the world, and this will probably give rise to new scientific collaborations between Portugal and the United States. Because of the format that includes mainly invited talks followed by shorter more specific papers, the young scientists and students will have an excellent opportunity to develop new ideas on the related subject.</AbstractNarration>
