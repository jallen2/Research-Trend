    <AbstractNarration>Many of the kinds of inquiry activities that have become increasingly prevalent as&lt;br/&gt;educational tools assume that certain basic understandings are in place, for example the&lt;br/&gt;understanding that multiple variables may act simultaneously to codetermine an outcome.&lt;br/&gt;Recent research, however, suggests instead that this and related forms of meta-level&lt;br/&gt;understanding are hard-won cognitive achievements that require support if they are to&lt;br/&gt;develop during the elementary and middle-school years and provide a needed foundation for&lt;br/&gt;more advanced inquiry learning. The goal of the proposed project is to better understand&lt;br/&gt;the basic cognitive skills that underlie inquiry learning and to examine how they develop.&lt;br/&gt;As part of their science curriculum, middle-school students will engage in a 10-week&lt;br/&gt;software-based inquiry curriculum under several different conditions offering different&lt;br/&gt;kinds of cognitive support. Employing a microgenetic method, researchers will closely&lt;br/&gt;observe development, maintenance and transfer of cognitive skills. The proposed work&lt;br/&gt;stands to inform both the design and use of educational technology to support inquiry&lt;br/&gt;learning, and in addition should help to provide a clearer conceptual base for teachers&lt;br/&gt;regarding the cognitive goals of inquiry curricula. The project is situated at the&lt;br/&gt;intersection of quadrant II and quadrant III in terms of the objectives identified in the&lt;br/&gt;ROLE RFP.</AbstractNarration>
