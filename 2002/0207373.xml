    <AbstractNarration>Descriptive Complexity measures the richness of a language or sentence&lt;br/&gt;needed to describe a given property. The languages are variants of&lt;br/&gt;first-order logic and their targets are finite, ordered structures. There&lt;br/&gt;is a profound relationship between the traditional computational complexity&lt;br/&gt;of a problem and the descriptive complexity of the problem; indeed, all&lt;br/&gt;major complexity classes have been shown to have natural descriptive&lt;br/&gt;characterizations. This means that complexity can be understood entirely&lt;br/&gt;from a logical point of view. As a consequence, important new&lt;br/&gt;understandings about complexity have arisen from the descriptive point of&lt;br/&gt;view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current research involves three major topics: (a) The theory of dynamic&lt;br/&gt;complexity, which is especially appropriate for database complexity, is&lt;br/&gt;being studied. Complete problems for dynamic complexity classes are being&lt;br/&gt;developed and the complexity of important dynamic problems such as graph&lt;br/&gt;reachability are being investigated; (b) Promising new methods for proving&lt;br/&gt;lower bounds techniques on the descriptive complexity of problems have been&lt;br/&gt;developed and are now being extended; and finally, (c) A Descriptive&lt;br/&gt;Programming environment is being developed in which the computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity of checking whether an input satisfies the properties being&lt;br/&gt;described can be read from the face of the description.</AbstractNarration>
