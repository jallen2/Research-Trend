    <AbstractNarration>Optical communication, in particular, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technique, has become a promising networking choice to meet ever-increasing demands on bandwidth from many emerging bandwidth-intensive computing/communication applications. As optics become a major networking media, optical interconnects will inevitably play an important role in interconnecting processors in parallel/distributed computing systems. This research focuses on fundamental challenges and issues &lt;br/&gt;on using optics in two converging areas: parallel/distributed computing and communications. The objective of this research is to design high-speed, cost-effective optical interconnects for current and future generation parallel/distributed computing and communication systems. Due to the unique characteristics of optics, many important issues of optical interconnects, different from those of &lt;br/&gt;electronic interconnects, need to be addressed. Specially, this research focuses on (1) explore unique properties and classifications of WDM interconnects; (2) optimal and cost-effective designs; (3) study the effect of wavelength conversion; (4) performance modeling; (5) fault-tolerance issues. The proposed research combines architecture/circuit design, algorithmic, probabilistic, combinatorial and simulation &lt;br/&gt;techniques to conduct comprehensive studies on the above issues. The research results will provide viable solutions for designing high-bandwidth, high-connectivity, low-latency and low-cost optical interconnects. The proposed research will have a significant impact on next generation arallel/distributed computing and communication systems and future networking infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
