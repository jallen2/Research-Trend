    <AbstractNarration>Anna Scaglione&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the size,the cost and the power consumption of communication devices and integrated circuits de-&lt;br/&gt;creases designing a system of autonomous sensors,that can monitor the environment and are capable&lt;br/&gt;of transporting and processing the information in any point of the controlled area,becomes a concrete&lt;br/&gt;goal.While the fabrication technology is mature to make intelligent sensors with wireless communication&lt;br/&gt;interfaces which are small and inexpensive,the main challenge in the design of these networks is at the&lt;br/&gt;system level. The scenario analyzed in [4 ]is radically di .erent from large networks such as the&lt;br/&gt;telephone network that have highly hierarchical architectures:in [4 ]all the nodes have identical function-&lt;br/&gt;alities,equal transmission bandwidth and are uniformly distributed over a circular region of .xed radius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However,[4 ]is neglecting one fundamental aspect of the problem:the nodes samples will be increas-&lt;br/&gt;ingly dependent as the density of the nodes increases [7 ].This observation was used in [8 ]where it was&lt;br/&gt;proven that distributed codes,that compress separately the correlated samples in each node,can reduce&lt;br/&gt;the amount of bits per node per square meter to an O (N .1 ),i.e.much faster than the transport capacity.&lt;br/&gt;The limitation of the approach in [8 ]is the high complexity required to have signi .cant compression gain&lt;br/&gt;without sharing one single bit of data among the nodes Fortunately,there is no need to impose such&lt;br/&gt;constraint.After all,the trademark of multi-hop networks is that power e .cient transmission is achieved&lt;br/&gt;when the data travel through several intermediate close-by nodes before reaching their .nal destination.&lt;br/&gt;If neighboring nodes were jointly compressing the data before forwarding them remotely,they could save&lt;br/&gt;many bits per sample while transmitting with the same or even greater precision.A good engineering&lt;br/&gt;design is compelled to exploit this fortunate coincidence by combining routing and and classical (not dis-&lt;br/&gt;tributed)source coding.This is the truly novel aspect of our project and,to the best of our knowledge,&lt;br/&gt;this connection has not been studied before.</AbstractNarration>
