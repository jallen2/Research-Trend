    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to aid in the purchase of a state-of-the-art nutrient autoanalyzer for use by researchers at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory (BMFL) in the measurement of nutrients such as ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate, urea and other chemical compounds found in the sea and in freshwater. Low nutrient concentrations often limit plant growth and productivity - the reason for adding fertilizers to crops - while elevated concentrations are often harmful to the environment and subsequently to humans. At BMFL, several ongoing research projects are examining how some nutrients cycle naturally within an ecosystem, and how changes in the types and quantities of nutrients influences primary (plant) and secondary (animal) production. Other projects are evaluating how various human activities affect nutrient concentrations in the environment. Nutrient analysis is also an integral component of a long-term ecosystem monitoring program at BFML, a program that allows investigators to evaluate the impact of climatic events such as the current drought, storms or El Nino. In addition, the importance of nutrient cycling to the health of the environment makes nutrient analysis an important emphasis in BMFL-sponsored educational activities that include undergraduates, graduate students and decision makers (e.g., natural resource managers and public officials). The purchase of a state-of-the-art nutrient autoanalyzer will the commitment of the BMFL to support the monitoring and experimental research of nutrient status and trends in coastal ecosystems while expanding research and education capabilities for visiting investigators and students.</AbstractNarration>
