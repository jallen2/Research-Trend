    <AbstractNarration>This is a Collaborative Proposal between Northwestern University and University of Florida which addresses the key research challenges associated with management of dynamic Virtual Machines (VM) and interfacing these mechanisms with existing grid middleware techniques. The project will develop novel solutions that will address&lt;br/&gt;- resource management for distributed virtualized end-resources that can be created dynamically,&lt;br/&gt;- image management for the on-demand transfer of data representing the entire state to create a dynamic VM instance, and&lt;br/&gt;- data management for the on-demand transfer of user and application data between decoupled compute and data servers on the grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach will lead to middleware solutions that will form an information processing foundation for grid computing. The software generated in this project will be sued to implement the next generation of network computing hubs currently being used to support simulation needs in nanotechnology, electronics CAD, computer architecture and parallel programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses key research challenges to allow the management of dynamic instances of virtual machine middleware and will lead to solutions that will form an information processing foundation for grid computing on virtualized end-resources.
