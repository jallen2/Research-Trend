    <AbstractNarration>The problem of computing patterns in sequences or strings of characters&lt;br/&gt;from a finite alphabet has important applications in numerous areas of&lt;br/&gt;computer science, notably in data compression, information theory, and&lt;br/&gt;pattern matching. This problem has also important applications in biology.&lt;br/&gt;The stimulus for such recent works is the study of biological sequences&lt;br/&gt;such as DNA and protein that play a central role in molecular biology. DNA&lt;br/&gt;sequences can be viewed as quite long but finite strings of nucleotides of&lt;br/&gt;4 different types, while protein sequences can be viewed as finite strings&lt;br/&gt;of amino acids of 20 possible types. Patterns such as periodicities and&lt;br/&gt;repetitions make up a significant fraction of both DNA and protein&lt;br/&gt;sequences. Although the functions of these patterns are not well&lt;br/&gt;understood, they appear important for understanding the expression,&lt;br/&gt;regulation and evolution of a biological sequence. These patterns can be&lt;br/&gt;used to identify the sequence among other sequences, an application that&lt;br/&gt;plays a role in genetic fingerprinting. Repetitions in biological&lt;br/&gt;sequences have been associated with human genetic diseases. They also&lt;br/&gt;complicate multiple sequence alignment because matches may be present in&lt;br/&gt;numerous places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The literature has generally considered problems in which a period u of a&lt;br/&gt;repetition is invariant. It has been required that occurrences of u match&lt;br/&gt;each other exactly. Due to the action of evolutionary mutation, patterns&lt;br/&gt;in biological strings are seldom exact but rather approximate. It&lt;br/&gt;therefore becomes necessary to recognize u' as an occurrence of u if the&lt;br/&gt;distance between u' and u is bounded by a certain threshold. Several&lt;br/&gt;definitions of distance have been proposed like the Hamming distance which&lt;br/&gt;counts the minimum number of character substitutions required to transform&lt;br/&gt;u' into u, and the edit distance which counts the minimum number of&lt;br/&gt;substitutions, insertions, and deletions of characters required to&lt;br/&gt;transform u' into u. Although there is an enormous literature dealing with&lt;br/&gt;approximate pattern matching according to these and other definitions of&lt;br/&gt;distance, very little is known on approximate repetitions, a version of&lt;br/&gt;repetitions where errors are allowed, and much remains to be done. Given&lt;br/&gt;the importance of patterns in biological strings and the exponential&lt;br/&gt;growth in the DNA database, it is important to develop efficient&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for detecting these patterns. The investigators study patterns&lt;br/&gt;such as periodicities, repetitions, covers, and seeds and their&lt;br/&gt;approximate versions built upon various commonly used distance measures.&lt;br/&gt;Techniques include recent combinatorial techniques related to partial&lt;br/&gt;strings which are strings where a number of gap characters are allowed.&lt;br/&gt;They also include the cover array, the highest scoring paths in weighted&lt;br/&gt;grid graphs, the probabilistic models that have been proposed for&lt;br/&gt;repetitions, and the subtree max gap problem which is a poweful tool in&lt;br/&gt;parallel algorithm design.</AbstractNarration>
