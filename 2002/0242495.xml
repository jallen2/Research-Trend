    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding to support minority-serving higher education institutions and schools develop competitive proposals for the Math and Science Partnerships. During the Fall of 2002, four workshops will be held. Teams will be invited to participate where the partnering higher education institution is recognized as an Hispanic Serving Institution, Tribal College, Historically Black College or University, or other minority-serving institution. These two-day workshops will focus on helping teams develop and refine their plans for a comprehensive or targeted MSP project. Particular emphasis will be placed on forming strong partnerships, developing a highly qualified teacher workforce, implementing a challenging curriculum and designing a rigorous evaluation. After the next round of MSP awards are made, QEM will hold a one-day workshop that will focus on next steps, either program implementation for successful projects or revisions of proposals for non-awarded projects.</AbstractNarration>
