    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conferences provide an international forum for the presentation and discussion of frontier research in the biological, chemical and physical sciences, and their related technologies. The GRC on Polymer Colloids to be held in Tilton Scholl, Tilton, NH, from June 29 to July 4 2003, will cover a wide range of scientific disciplines and technologies involving the ever-increasingly important field of polymer colloids. Colloid, interface and polymer sciences are the three most important scientific disciplines in this area. The 2003 GRC will also cover new applications of polymer colloids in bio- and nano-materials, in which they play an important role. Well-known world leaders in the field accept invitations to deliver talks and to be discussion facilitators. The conference will have 21 invited oral presentations and a session of about 60 poster presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will have broad international representation and is expected to advance interdisciplinary research and education in the field of polymer colloids.</AbstractNarration>
