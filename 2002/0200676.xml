    <AbstractNarration>The PI will continue observational and modeling research of pollution over Asia and neighboring oceans that he first conducted for the 1999 INDOEX field phase. The new research will provide a database for meteorological and aerosol histories covering the last decade. This database will be developed using variational data assimilation methodology, where satellite and surface based meteorological and aerosol data sets are incorporated in the global analysis. The data assimilation is designed to capture some details of vertical layering of aerosols from global modeling where the winds and atmospheric state are independently defined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major component of this study will be in the area of sulfate chemistry using the global model. Here the components of the modeling include data assimilation, inclusion of processes such as gas phase oxidation, aqueous-phase oxidation in clouds, wet removal of precipitating clouds, dry and wet deposition. The PI also proposes to participate in an international aerosol model inter-comparison exercise where several major modeling groups will explore the impacts of pollution on regional climate and circulation anomalies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important because aerosol-radiation-cloud processes represent a knowledge gap responsible for a major part of the uncertainty regarding future, human-induced climate change. This research will enrich our understanding of these processes and thus help scientists to develop improved climate models for prediction and projections.</AbstractNarration>
