    <AbstractNarration>EIA 02-24423&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Xiao, Jing&lt;br/&gt; Tolone, William J.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of North Carolina - Charlotte &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CISE RR: Acquisition of a Haptic Device &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, acquiring a PHANTOM haptic device that can display full force and torque feedback to the user, aims at supporting two haptic research projects inspired by applications such as virtual assembly, virtual prototyping, remote collaboration, and teleoperation. The following projects will benefit from the instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haptic Rendering of Complex Contact States and Compliant Motion and &lt;br/&gt;Cooperative Virtual Object Manipulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The former is concerned with how to simulate and render, with high fidelity and in real time, the effect felt by a human operator due to the contacts involving the part he/she holds and other parts during manual assembly in a virtual environment. The device will enable a human operator to feel the resulted collision and reaction forces and torques to test the quality and fidelity of simulation. The latter project is concerned with how to simulate, again with high fidelity and real time, the cooperative manipulation process of physical objects in a virtual world via haptic devices. With full force and torque display from the device, the collaborative parties can obtain the necessary cues for effective coordination. This project provides the opportunity for cross-discipline collaboration between the PIs.</AbstractNarration>
