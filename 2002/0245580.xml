    <AbstractNarration>This proposal concerns problems in number theory and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry in four specific areas. First, in joint work with Avner Ash&lt;br/&gt;and Mark McConnell, Gunnells is exploring conjectures in automorphic forms&lt;br/&gt;by studying the action of the Hecke operators on the cohomology of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic groups in different contexts. Second, jointly with Robert&lt;br/&gt;Sczech, Gunnells is studying the connections between special values of&lt;br/&gt;L-functions and group cocycles for the unimodular group. Third,&lt;br/&gt;jointly with Lev Borisov, Gunnells is investigating the construction&lt;br/&gt;of modular forms using toric varieties. Finally, jointly with Eric&lt;br/&gt;Babson and Richard Scott, Gunnells is studying the geometry of certain&lt;br/&gt;configuration varieties naturally arising in representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with number theory and algebraic geometry. Number&lt;br/&gt;theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the&lt;br/&gt;oldest branch of mathematics. Algebraic geometry studies geometric&lt;br/&gt;figures that can be defined by the simplest of equations, namely&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. The questions and phenomena which arise from combining &lt;br/&gt;these two subjects serve as driving forces in much of contemporary mathematics&lt;br/&gt;research. Moreover, the combination of these subjects has contributed many applications&lt;br/&gt;in such diverse areas as codes and data transmission, robotics, and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science.</AbstractNarration>
