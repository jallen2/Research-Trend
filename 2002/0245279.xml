    <AbstractNarration>NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0245279&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Variational Analysis and Geometric Methods in Optimal Control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0245279 Zhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control theory has numerous applications in various fields of science and engineering, and has stimulated the development of many new ideas and methods. In the past thirty years, two important lines of research in the study of optimal control and nonlinear control problems have been the so-called "differential-geometric" and "variational" approaches. During the last decade, these two approaches have been brought together in work by many researchers dealing with stabilization and optimal control. This award supports travel for participants in a special cluster of sessions devoted to work on these techniques within the setting offered by the 41st Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). The sessions will bring together American and foreign researchers working in this growing field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lectures will deal with geometric methods, variational methods, and diverse applications in the areas of aerodynamics, biomedical systems, semi-definite optimization, multi-objective optimal control, semi-conductor design, and approximations. The discussions will facilitate the exchange of ideas and collaborative research and will help identify research directions with significant potential applications in industry and other related fields.</AbstractNarration>
