    <AbstractNarration>0203433&lt;br/&gt;DeSalle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This UMEB project seeks to increase the participation of students from under-represented groups at two New York City colleges by engaging them in hands-on research projects in conservation genetics and environmental science in collaboration with scientists at their colleges and at the American Museum of Natural History. In order to accomplish this, each year a cohort of 4-6 students from each college will be recruited and the students will conduct research projects over a two year period. During the academic year, the research will be done on the home campuses. Over the winter breaks and summers, research will be conducted at the American Museum of Natural History. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These students will serve as a nucleus to get other students involved in environmental projects throughout the metropolitan area. This UMEB project will involve students in workshops in molecular biology techniques, seminars in population biology, and workshops that provide graduate school and career guidance. The students will be closely mentored and their progress monitored and assessed in order to help them become our future scientists in environmental biology and in order to develop additional programs capable of broadening participation in careers in environmental biology.</AbstractNarration>
