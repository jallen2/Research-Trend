    <AbstractNarration>MODULAR TOWERS AND THE IGP OVER THE RATIONALS: Often researchers use&lt;br/&gt;algebraic relations in two variables x and y over a field to describe&lt;br/&gt;significant data. Some examples are sets of values x having an (x,y)&lt;br/&gt;with entries in the field that satisfy the relation. One of these is the&lt;br/&gt;Davenport's problem of determining equivalence classes of polynomials&lt;br/&gt;according to their value sets over finite fields. Describing complex&lt;br/&gt;multiplication fields, generated by those x with (x,y) a special&lt;br/&gt;elliptic curve torsion point, is a variant. A relation with a data&lt;br/&gt;variable x produces a permutation group G: The Galois group. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator treats these as cases of the Inverse Galois&lt;br/&gt;Problem (IGP). One goal is to decide, from certain lists&lt;br/&gt;of relations, if some have the rational numbers as definition field.&lt;br/&gt;Serious group theory helped solve Davenport's 1965 problem and Schur's&lt;br/&gt;exceptional polynomial problem (1919; see below). Further, modular&lt;br/&gt;curves reveal complex multiplication to be a version of Schur's&lt;br/&gt;problem. Having command of all finite simple groups has many&lt;br/&gt;applications. One is to list those groups attached to exceptional&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. Knowing many characters of Chevalley groups showed Thompson&lt;br/&gt;and Voelklein where to find series of solutions to the IGP. Yet, it will&lt;br/&gt;require more than massive group theory to solve the whole IGP. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator uses Modular Towers, a modular curve generalization, to&lt;br/&gt;finesse unknowable group classifications. He and his students let a&lt;br/&gt;known group G, and a prime p dividing the order of G, seed the base level&lt;br/&gt;of a Modular Tower. Higher tower levels code relations with mysterious&lt;br/&gt;groups covering G related to p. Coherent maps between the tower levels&lt;br/&gt;replace details on these intricate covering groups. Work of Y. Ihara and&lt;br/&gt;J.P. Serre inspire showing that Modular Towers has many properties of&lt;br/&gt;their special, modular curve, case. For example, high tower levels for a&lt;br/&gt;G with no Z/p quotient should have no rational points. For certain groups G, &lt;br/&gt;and the prime p=2, this extends Serre's program on spin structures. The &lt;br/&gt;investigator applies new spin-like structures to all cases when p is 2 and &lt;br/&gt;to all primes p. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRACTICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY AND IGP OVER FINITE FIELDS: Modern cryptosystems&lt;br/&gt;aim to secure electronic transfers of data. Exceptional functions act as&lt;br/&gt;permutations on infinitely many finite fields. A special case of the&lt;br/&gt;Inverse Galois Problem over finite fields asks how to construct&lt;br/&gt;exceptional functions. These scrambling functions look simple. Users can&lt;br/&gt;easily apply them (up to 1993, all came from the 19th century). Still,&lt;br/&gt;finding them has been difficult. Fried (UCI), Guralnick (USC) and Saxl&lt;br/&gt;(Cambridge) nearly classify them. This solves old problems (Dickson 1896&lt;br/&gt;and Carlitz 1965). They also produce unexpected new examples. Their best&lt;br/&gt;discovery is that exceptional polyomial Galois groups (excluding now&lt;br/&gt;well-understood cases) have the affine geometric property. This is&lt;br/&gt;useful for it gives the degrees of exceptional polynomials. Yet, it is&lt;br/&gt;also a difficult challenge: There can be no final description of all&lt;br/&gt;affine groups. The investigator with A. Mezard approaches affine groups&lt;br/&gt;by generalizing to all algebraic relations over finite fields&lt;br/&gt;Grothendieck's famous results for tame relations. Applications for&lt;br/&gt;exceptional functions alone include ways to manipulate data for&lt;br/&gt;encryption and to assure integrity. This will mean faster, more&lt;br/&gt;efficient and accurate file back-ups; more stable software; and more&lt;br/&gt;secure data transfers.</AbstractNarration>
