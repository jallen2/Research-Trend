    <AbstractNarration>0242524&lt;br/&gt;Sussman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a two-year international collaborative research project between Professor Mark Sussman at Florida State University and Professor Mitsuhiro Ohta of the Muroran Institute of Technology in Hokkaido, Japan. They will undertake a computational study of bubble and drop dynamics in inelastic and viscoelastic non-Newtonian fluid systems. The researchers propose to extend numerical methods for complex moving boundary problems in Newtonian multi-phase flow to non-Newtonian multi-phase flows, implement the methods in software, and conduct computational simulations of the flows in the light of relevant experiments. These problems are important in industry. For example, modeling the break-up of fluids in microscale jetting devices (e.g. ink-jet devices), modeling coalescence of bubbles and drops in extraction processes, and modeling extrusion processes. Numerical validation studies and comparison with experiments will be used to test the validity of non-Newtonian constitutive relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. researchers provide expertise in numerical analyses and the Japanese researchers provide expertise in the experimental areas. The full scale, three dimensional, direct numerical simulations of jetting and extrusion processes will have direct applicability in the design of ink-jet printers and fiber spinning apparatus and provide valuable insight into the flow instability and interfacial morphology of the non-Newtonian fluids. The project advances international human resources through the participation of a number of graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. Results of the research will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in scientific journals on scientific computing, non-Newtonian fluid mechanics and chemical engineering.</AbstractNarration>
