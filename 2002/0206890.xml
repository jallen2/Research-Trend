    <AbstractNarration>The 44th Annual Maize Genetics Conference will be held March 14-17, 2002, at the Hyatt Orlando in Florida. The meeting offers members of the Maize Genetics community the opportunity to present and discuss their most recent research results. A wide range of topics will be covered including cytogenetics and chromosome mechanics, molecular genetics, biochemical genetics, cytoplasmic inheritance, genetic mapping and molecular markers, transposable element behavior and applications, gene identification and expression, plant development, tissue culture and genetic transformation, and new genomics approaches. In addition, two dedicated workshops will focus on grasses as a single genetic system and the promise of biotech foods. The Maize Genetics meeting provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers.</AbstractNarration>
