    <AbstractNarration>A new, completely-integrated processor-memory-interconnect (CI-PMI)&lt;br/&gt;architecture model suitable for a range of data-intensive&lt;br/&gt;applications is proposed. Compared to the existing processor-in-memory&lt;br/&gt;(PIM) architectures, the proposed CI-PMI approach integrates more&lt;br/&gt;completely the processing, memory, and interconnect. This is achieved&lt;br/&gt;by starting with the classical architecture of high capacity memory,&lt;br/&gt;namely, a binary tree of decoders with memory modules as leaves, laid&lt;br/&gt;out as an H-tree. In the proposed model, copies of one or more types&lt;br/&gt;of application-specific computing elements are added at different&lt;br/&gt;levels of the memory decoder tree, desired functionality added to the&lt;br/&gt;memory decoders to augment their role as interconnects as well as to&lt;br/&gt;support desired computation, and, if necessary, additional interconnects&lt;br/&gt;added between the application-specific processors, the memory modules,&lt;br/&gt;and the decoders. The proposed architecture will be developed and&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated for a data-intensive application, namely motion estimation&lt;br/&gt;for MPEG encoding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the proposed research will be used to augment one&lt;br/&gt;advanced class, to be taught at USC as well as UCI. The class will&lt;br/&gt;take a top-down view of advanced processor-in-memory architectures&lt;br/&gt;including those developed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance the state of the art in computer&lt;br/&gt;architecture, VLSI, and VLSI CAD, leading to faster and cheaper designs&lt;br/&gt;for day to day computation and information retrieval, exchange, and&lt;br/&gt;management.</AbstractNarration>
