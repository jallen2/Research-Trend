    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to develop an efficient general strategy for the asymmetric synthesis of pyranoid functionality found in numerous natural products. Malonate-derived anions will be added to chiral auxiliaries to produce unsaturated lactones common to several important antibiotics, including callystatin and leptomycin. Palladium catalyzed coupling will be explored to couple the lactone subunits. The methodology will also be applied to hennoxazole A, an antiviral marine natural product. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this RUI award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Thomas T. Smith of the Department of Chemistry at Williams College. Professor Smith will focus his work on the construction of important anti-viral and anti-biotic substances. The educational activities of the award will include teaching the art of organic synthesis to undergraduate students at Williams College.</AbstractNarration>
