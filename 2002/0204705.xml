    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this work involve a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of the atmospheric oxidation chemistry of isoprene. Isoprene is the major unsaturated organic compound emitted into the atmosphere by vegetation. Product analysis and kinetic studies will be performed on reactions of isoprene with oxygen and nitrogen radicals. These experimental results will be compared to theoretical predictions of yields and rates for these same reactions. Oxygen and nitrogen radical competititve reactions with isoprene will also be studied and the combined results used to develop a mechanistic understanding of isoprene oxidation reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program are supporting the research of Dr. Simon W. North and Dr. Renyi Zhang of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A &amp; M University. Drs. North and Zhang will work on a detailed study of the atmospheric oxidation chemistry of isoprene. Isoprene is the major unsaturated organic compound emitted into the atmosphere by vegetation. A better understanding of how isoprene interacts with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in our atmosphere could help future efforts to model and predict: 1) the role isoprene levels play in ozone formation; 2) long range transport of organic nitrates; and 3) carbon cycling in the atmosphere. Students trained during the course of this work will gain experience in environmental, atmospheric and organic chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
