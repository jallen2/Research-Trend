    <AbstractNarration>EIA-010931&lt;br/&gt;Villa, Ferdinando&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BDEI: Towards an Operational Semantics Diversity: Integrating Structure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the dynamics of biological diversity requires new approaches and&lt;br/&gt;integration between different disciplines. The development of a unitary body of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge about biodiversity is made difficult by the fragmentation and lack of&lt;br/&gt;interoperability between the diverse - and often informal and simplistic - semantics&lt;br/&gt;adopted for data and models. Different representational paradigms require conceptual, as&lt;br/&gt;well as technical, integration to enable reorganizing the body of knowledge and enable&lt;br/&gt;new ideas, theories, and higher-level paradigms to surface and be tested.&lt;br/&gt;Building on software and conceptual frameworks being developed at IEE/UMD, we&lt;br/&gt;propose to develop and deploy a web-accessible database where temporally- and&lt;br/&gt;spatially- explicit biodiversity data will coexist with dynamic modular models,&lt;br/&gt;potentially integrating multiple modeling paradigms and automatically enforcing their&lt;br/&gt;compatibility. The XML-based infrastructure used by the underlying software engine will&lt;br/&gt;enable us to store data and models (modules) adopting an extensible array of&lt;br/&gt;representations, and to link them together transparently and automatically. The&lt;br/&gt;integration will happen through explicit cross-cutting abstractions called domains, which&lt;br/&gt;represent various aspects of the world (such as time or space) as seen by each module,&lt;br/&gt;and are processed by the simulation engine to resolve conflicts related to different scales&lt;br/&gt;or representational paradigms.</AbstractNarration>
