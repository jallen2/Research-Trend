    <AbstractNarration>Handheld computing devices with wireless network connections&lt;br/&gt; have a great potential to be powerful mobile tools to&lt;br/&gt; access information and software resources in the networked&lt;br/&gt; world. Unfortunately, the computing power&lt;br/&gt; and connection time of current handheld devices&lt;br/&gt; are severely constrained by the short battery life.&lt;br/&gt; Moreover, the battery issue also places constraints on&lt;br/&gt; various design aspects including program memory and secondary&lt;br/&gt; storage, CPU, and operating system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; With connection to computing servers through wireless networks,&lt;br/&gt; there exist many opportunities for handheld devices to&lt;br/&gt; save battery by carefully utilizing the power of the servers.&lt;br/&gt; This project explores compiler and run-time techniques&lt;br/&gt; to assist the partitioning of application programs into&lt;br/&gt; server tasks and client tasks. The optimal partition&lt;br/&gt; depends on available network bandwidth and on the nature&lt;br/&gt; of applications. In order for handheld devices to optimally&lt;br/&gt; exploit servers for a wide range of applications, careful&lt;br/&gt; tradeoff is made between energy consumed by network communication&lt;br/&gt; versus computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed compiler techniques and run-time support&lt;br/&gt; include compile-time and run-time analysis of work and&lt;br/&gt; communication requirement, exploitation&lt;br/&gt; of low-power networking states on handhelds, run-time&lt;br/&gt; decision-making, and a light-weight software coherence mechanism.</AbstractNarration>
