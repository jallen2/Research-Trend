    <AbstractNarration>This award supports simultaneous mathematical and numerical study of&lt;br/&gt;various low Reynolds number sedimentation flows. These systems are&lt;br/&gt;complicated by the long range nature of the fluid flows generated by&lt;br/&gt;individual solid particles as they fall, requiring efficient&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for particle simulations, introducing variable nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;coefficients of different dependencies into model continuum partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, and leading to nontrivial distributions in the&lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanics of the interacting particles. In this work,&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms specialized to dilute wall-bounded sedimentation,&lt;br/&gt;previously developed to investigate the scaling of velocity&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations in monodisperse sedimentation, will be used to provide&lt;br/&gt;quantitative data for comparison with existing and newly-developed&lt;br/&gt;kinetic and fluid models. The simulations will be generalized to&lt;br/&gt;include effects due to inclined channels, polydispersity,&lt;br/&gt;non-spherical particles, and small non-zero Reynolds numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactions between solid particles sedimenting in a fluid are&lt;br/&gt;important in many natural and industrial processes, including the&lt;br/&gt;settling motions of silt in rivers and dust in the air, and in&lt;br/&gt;applications which use centrifugal or gravitational separation such as&lt;br/&gt;those for proteins, minerals, waste water, and recyclable plastics.&lt;br/&gt;While the mathematics describing the interactions between individual&lt;br/&gt;particles and the suspending fluid are well known, simulations of&lt;br/&gt;large scale flows based on these rules are computationally&lt;br/&gt;prohibitive. It would be far preferable to use macroscopic models&lt;br/&gt;which are less costly to solve because they neglect the detailed&lt;br/&gt;motion of individual particles. Unfortunately, existing macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;models for sedimentation have very limited ranges of validity. This&lt;br/&gt;work will consider restricted classes of sedimentation systems in&lt;br/&gt;which efficient computation of the interactions between large numbers&lt;br/&gt;of particles remains possible because of simplified geometries and&lt;br/&gt;limits for the mathematical rules describing particle motion. Results&lt;br/&gt;will be used to help identify improved macroscopic models to describe&lt;br/&gt;both these restricted classes and more general sedimentation flows.&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, this work will lead to improved equations for modeling&lt;br/&gt;sedimentation flows in nature and for better design of separation&lt;br/&gt;processes based on sedimentation.</AbstractNarration>
