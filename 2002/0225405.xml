    <AbstractNarration>The non-invasive imaging and quantitation of micro-scale flow within the body is still a challenge for current clinical imaging systems. The development of an ultrasound-based imaging system for detection and quantitation of micro-scale flows is proposed here. &lt;br/&gt;Two sets of commercially available phased-array broadband transducers will be used. These will be coupled to custom electronics and analysis systems to image gas-filled micro-bubbles (diameters: 3 - 8 microns) within the flow field. The first part of this problem is precise particle detection and tracking. The second part is the development of an imaging system that reveals local flow characteristics. The non linear components of backscatter from the highly reflective micro-bubbles will be analyzed in the RF domain to detect particles. Once the particle is detected, a particle tracking algorithm will be employed to track the particles over a specified distance. This will allow calculation of local particle velocity. The project aims are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Characterize the design specifications for an ultrasound-based micro-flow imaging system.&lt;br/&gt;2) Build a prototype version of this system using a combination of existing broadband ultrasound transducers, coupled with custom electronics and algorithm development.&lt;br/&gt;3) Validate the performance of this prototype system using a mock circulatory flow loop with velocity and flow quantified using independent reference techniques.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of this project, significant work toward the development of an ultrasound-based micro-flow imaging system will be complete. The work can then move toward implementation of the system in hardware for testing under in vivo conditions.</AbstractNarration>
