    <AbstractNarration>0203175&lt;br/&gt;Burke &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research we develop theoretical and numerical tools for &lt;br/&gt;understanding and exploiting the variational behavior of spectral &lt;br/&gt;functions. Briefly, spectral functions are mappings of the spectrum &lt;br/&gt;of real or complex valued matrices to the real numbers. Two &lt;br/&gt;examples are the spectral abscissa (the maximum real part of the &lt;br/&gt;spectrum) and the spectral radius (the maximum modulus of the &lt;br/&gt;spectrum). The spectral abscissa and the spectral radius play an &lt;br/&gt;important role in understanding the asymptotic behavior of &lt;br/&gt;continuous and discrete dynamical systems, respectively. For this &lt;br/&gt;reason, understanding their variational behavior will greatly impact &lt;br/&gt;a number of application areas. In general, spectral functions have a &lt;br/&gt;number of features that make them difficult to analyze. Foremost &lt;br/&gt;among these is that they are typically nondifferentiable, indeed &lt;br/&gt;non-Lipschitzian. These functions can be very poorly behaved &lt;br/&gt;especially in regions of interest for optimization. Thus, even &lt;br/&gt;though these functions have a classical history in mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;science, and engineering, intimate knowledge of their variational &lt;br/&gt;behavior has proven elusive. For this reason, new tools of analysis &lt;br/&gt;in conjunction with classical techniques are required. In this &lt;br/&gt;research we bring together the modern techniques of variational &lt;br/&gt;analysis and classical methods of Puiseux-Newton series, semi-&lt;br/&gt;algebraic sets, conformal mappings, and the geometry of &lt;br/&gt;polynomials. These tools have proven to be phenomenally &lt;br/&gt;successful in shedding new light on this very important class of &lt;br/&gt;functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In optimization theory and practice one tries to either minimize or &lt;br/&gt;maximize a performance measure subject to limitations on how the &lt;br/&gt;performance measure can be adjusted. Optimization is a &lt;br/&gt;fundamentally interdisciplinary area of research having a &lt;br/&gt;significant impact on a wide range of academic, industrial, and &lt;br/&gt;government research activities. Research in optimization requires &lt;br/&gt;theoretical advances, the development of numerical solution &lt;br/&gt;methods, and a firm grounding in applications. The particular &lt;br/&gt;research outlined in this proposal focuses on optimization &lt;br/&gt;problems that are closely related to the stability properties of &lt;br/&gt;systems that evolve with time. In particular, it impacts the design &lt;br/&gt;of structures such as buildings and aircraft that are subject to &lt;br/&gt;temporal deformations from environmental factors such as an &lt;br/&gt;earthquake or a wind-shear. The underlying optimization problem &lt;br/&gt;in this context is to make the structure as stable as possible in a &lt;br/&gt;potentially hostile environment while satisfying certain design &lt;br/&gt;limitations on such things as weight, size, and cost. The great &lt;br/&gt;difficulty in this research is that the performance measures under &lt;br/&gt;consideration, such as stability, do not vary in a smooth manner as &lt;br/&gt;the underlying parameters vary. Consequently fundamentally new &lt;br/&gt;methods of analysis are required to understand the variational &lt;br/&gt;behavior of these performance measures. Indeed, the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;tools necessary for this kind of analysis have only very recently &lt;br/&gt;been developed. In this research we intend to make significant &lt;br/&gt;inroads into the analysis of these kinds of problems and to develop &lt;br/&gt;a range of numerical methods that can be used to solve them.</AbstractNarration>
