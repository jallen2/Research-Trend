    <AbstractNarration>0230489&lt;br/&gt;Tadmor&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI and graduate students from Northeastern University in a collaboration with Bernd Noack of the Hermann Fottinger Institute for Fluid Engineering at the Technical University of Berlin, Germany. The combined efforts of the German and US groups will go toward research in control-oriented modeling and control flow for monitoring and controlling fluid flow systems. They will derive models that reduce the computational burden ordinarily inherent in computational fluid dynamics calculations and are also effective for on-line predictive control. Hybrid modeling techniques in combination with sensitivity analysis will lead to lighter-weight discrete and continuous models. The flow systems to be studied represents an important class of system problems that have proven extremely difficult to model and control. The progress the PIs achieve will have major implications for industrial control and scientific instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has an educational objective. The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing research in another country. They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new technical skills.</AbstractNarration>
