    <AbstractNarration>Research equipment will be provided for new experimental research in the area of particulate mechanics. With the invention of the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), it will be possible for the first time to view uncoated wet samples in their natural states, which will give a clearer insight into the phenomenon than has not been available previously. The newly manufactured ESEM will be used to perform advanced research on microstructure features of liquefaction of layered soils. The particulate materials to be considered are composed of sand, silt, gravel, and water. The long-term goal of this research is to provide fundamental understanding of the behavior of stratified silt-sand-gravel composites under seismic liquefaction conditions at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. The cyclic behavior of sand-silt-gravel composites is presently poorly understood, yet these materials are commonly found in alluvial deposits and hydraulic fill, which have a history of liquefaction during earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research to be accomplished with this equipment will not only provide a fundamental advancement of modeling of these stratified soils, but also will provide insight when dealing with high hazard civil systems such as large dams and other structures. If we could sharpen our understanding of these materials, we would greatly benefit during earthquake hazard mitigation process. This equipment will significantly improve the research capability of the Department of Civil Engineering at Jackson State University (a minority, and non-Ph.D. granting institution based on the NSF's definition) in Mississippi. The ESEM, having wide range applications, will also be used in the scanning microscopy of environmental and biological systems. In addition, based on agreements with other organizations, the equipment will be available for their use. The wide range of student activities in this project and the student exposure to the experiments will significantly enhance the representation of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program, by modern integration of research into education, provides research opportunities for students and thus enhances the existing research integration programs. A rigorous management, maintenance, and evaluation and assessment plan is implemented to monitor project development and outcomes, and to ensure the successful implementation of the project activities. The project activities and results will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding. The technology transfer, outreach programs and procedures will include the continuation of the existing collaboration with national research laboratories such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Engineering, Research, and Development Center (ERDC) Waterways Experiment Station (WES), publication of papers in refereed journals, presentations at the national or international conferences, undergraduate research presentations at the annual college research seminar, laboratory demonstration, pre-college outreach program, and the dissemination of the project activities through the university web site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this instrumentation acquisition project, by substantially improving the research and training infrastructure, and by making it available to wide range of programs, applications, and students, will have a very positive long-term impact on large numbers of underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>
