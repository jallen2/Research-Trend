    <AbstractNarration>This research investigates design and implement a framework for autonomous multiple mobile robots localization/navigation in a dynamic, partially known environment. The framework will integrate autonomous cooperative localization and navigation capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, autonomous cooperative sensor-based navigation capabilities will be explored, which integrate; extrapolated artificial potential field based path planning; consecutive sensing based localization methods with the aid of techniques for computing uncertainty regions; robust, safe techniques for distributive control suitable for dynamic, partially known environments that facilitate efficient, on-line adjustment and re-planning in the presence of unknown or moving obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mobile robots have variety of sensors and controllers to inform or take action in response to the environment. The ability to reconfigure sensors dynamically between data collection operations enables planning of sensing strategies. Each sensory action will improve knowledge of the environment; hence, each sensory action can be chosen utilizing a larger knowledge base than was available for previous actions. An immediate benefit from this work will be a direct use in sensor based control of mechanical systems. The approach will be a breakthrough in practical machine design and implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed cooperative, distributive, robust, and inexpensive multiple mobile robots will be used to many potential applications ranging from maintenance and repair of mechanical machinery, to clean up operations for accidents, to search and rescue operations, or to assisting the disabled or elderly around the home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's education component focuses on developing new interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate courses with an emphasis on robotics and mechatronics and involving undergraduate students in research. It also includes helping high school students understand technical concepts and principles, and providing students with a real-world engineering challenge offering students an academic experience that encourages abstract thought, self-directed learning, and decision-making through TexasBEST robot competition program.</AbstractNarration>
