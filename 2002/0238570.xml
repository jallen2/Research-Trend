    <AbstractNarration>Software reliability is one of the most important problems in computer&lt;br/&gt;science. A single operating system error can crash the machine. A single&lt;br/&gt;security hole can compromise the integrity of the entire system or, as&lt;br/&gt;software and its errors is replicated, the integrity of entire networks.&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on practical techniques to effectively find large&lt;br/&gt;numbers of such software errors. Initial results are promising: the&lt;br/&gt;approach has found hundreds of security holes and thousands of serious&lt;br/&gt;errors in the Linux operating system, as well as in large commercial&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research centers on using static analysis to find errors in source&lt;br/&gt;code. It uses two main techniques: (1) metacompilation (MC) to check&lt;br/&gt;correctness rules (such as ``a call to the lock() function must be paired&lt;br/&gt;with a call to unlock()'') and (2) belief analysis to infer such rules&lt;br/&gt;automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metacompilation uses programmer-written, system-specific static checkers&lt;br/&gt;to find software bugs. Because these extensions can be written by&lt;br/&gt;system implementors themselves, they can take into account the ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;(sometimes bizarre) semantics of a system. Because they are compiler&lt;br/&gt;based, they also get the benefits of automatic static analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Belief analysis: A major obstacle to finding program errors in a real&lt;br/&gt;system is knowing what correctness rules the system must obey. These&lt;br/&gt;rules are often undocumented or specified in an ad hoc manner.&lt;br/&gt;Belief analysis automatically infers such checking information from&lt;br/&gt;the source code itself, rather than the programmer, thereby avoiding&lt;br/&gt;the need for a priori knowledge of system rules. It works by analyzing&lt;br/&gt;source code to infer what programmers believe to be true and checking&lt;br/&gt;these beliefs for contradictions. For example, if a call to ``lock()''&lt;br/&gt;is paired with a call to ``unlock()'' 1000 times and not paired once,&lt;br/&gt;this is a good indication that the code believes these calls must be&lt;br/&gt;paired, and that the single deviation is an error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will also involve an educational component. The most&lt;br/&gt;significant feature will be heavily involving undergraduates in research.&lt;br/&gt;Empirically, doing so helps them think creatively, independently, as&lt;br/&gt;well as pushing them to go much deeper than a typical class.</AbstractNarration>
