    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Thomas Demere at the San Diego Natural History Museum (SDNHM) to study the fossil record of baleen whales and to document the dramatic anatomical modifications that members of this group have undergone over the past 35 million years. Given the popular interest in living baleen whales, it is surprising that we still lack a clear understanding of the genealogical relationships of the modern species. It is also surprising that the baleen whale "family tree" is so poorly resolved, with many fossil "branches" based on rather sketchy evidence or, even worse, currently unknown. Dr. Demere's study will include descriptions of critical new fossil specimens, a re-analysis of named fossil baleen whale specimens housed at foreign and domestic museums, and determination of specific anatomical features that document the evolutionary changes that have occurred to the baleen whale skull, lower jaw, "arm," and body. &lt;br/&gt;This study will be conducted within the context of a broader collaborative study of baleen whale evolution. The broader study will include analysis of genealogical relationships of all living species of baleen whales using data derived from molecular studies, soft anatomical studies, and osteological studies. When these results are combined with those based on the fossil record, the outcome will provide the most comprehensive view yet realized of the evolutionary history of baleen whales. A final aspect of this collaborative research will be to utilize the vastly improved genealogical history of baleen whales to track the anatomical and functional changes that occurred during the development of the diverse feeding styles exhibited by the modern species (i.e., surface skimming right whales, engulfment feeding fin whales, and suction feeding gray whales). Highlights of this research will be incorporated into public education efforts at SDNHM including website pages (www.sdnhm.org) and exhibit galleries.</AbstractNarration>
