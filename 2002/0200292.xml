    <AbstractNarration>This project involves the connections between generating functions &lt;br/&gt;for height pairings of arithmetic cycles on certain Shimura varieties, &lt;br/&gt;on the one hand, and second terms in the Laurent expansions of &lt;br/&gt;elliptic modular and Siegel modular Eisenstein series &lt;br/&gt;at certain critical points, on the other. The generating functions can be viewed as &lt;br/&gt;arithmetic analogues of theta functions and can be use to define &lt;br/&gt;arithmetic analogues of the classical theta correspondence, now taking certain &lt;br/&gt;types of modular forms to elements of arithmetic Chow groups. &lt;br/&gt;A main goal is to prove analogues of Rallis's inner product formula &lt;br/&gt;for these arithmetic theta lifts, which will now involve derivatives &lt;br/&gt;of L-functions. Thus, it is hoped that one may ultimately obtain &lt;br/&gt;information about higher dimensional analogues of the Gross-Zagier formula and the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer &lt;br/&gt;conjecture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the later part of the 20th century significant advances were &lt;br/&gt;made in developing a `number theoretic' geometry, in which an additional &lt;br/&gt;dimension is added to carry information involving the interaction &lt;br/&gt;between the geometry and prime numbers. To a point on such a space, &lt;br/&gt;one can attach a number call its height, which is a measure of its &lt;br/&gt;`arithmetic complexity'. More generally, heights can be defined &lt;br/&gt;for higher dimensional objects, curves on surfaces, for example. &lt;br/&gt;The present project studies combinatorial relations among such heights, &lt;br/&gt;which reflect hidden structure carried by the spaces &lt;br/&gt;of `number theoretic' geometry.</AbstractNarration>
