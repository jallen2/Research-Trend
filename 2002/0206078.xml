    <AbstractNarration>AST 0206078&lt;br/&gt;McGaugh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Stacy McGaugh, at the University of Maryland, will carry out a two-pronged investigation of the low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy population which constitutes the frontier of our knowledge. One aspect is the analysis of a large, very deep survey for local "ultra" LSB galaxies. The data for&lt;br/&gt;this survey exist, and Dr. McGaugh will now process and analyze these data The second aspect of this project is the acquisition and analysis of high accuracy, high spatial resolution rotation curves of known LSB galaxies. This topic has become exciting and controversial because of its potentially pivotal role in testing cold dark matter structure formation simulations. Such simulations predict dark matter halos with cusps which are difficult to reconcile with the observations to date. A number of outstanding questions have been raised over this issue, creating an enormous demand for more and better data on this subject.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
