    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0200186&lt;br/&gt;PI: Andreas Seeger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be concerned with several&lt;br/&gt;interrelated topics in Fourier analysis. In particular&lt;br/&gt;it is proposed to work on precise regularity properties&lt;br/&gt;of oscillatory integral and Fourier integral operators&lt;br/&gt;with degenerate canonical relations. The mapping&lt;br/&gt;properties are governed by the geometry of the canonical&lt;br/&gt;relations. Here we are, in particular, interested in&lt;br/&gt;the cases that come up when studying averaging operators&lt;br/&gt;associated to curves in higher dimensions. Other &lt;br/&gt;projects include the behavior of singular maximal&lt;br/&gt;functions and rough singular integrals on classes of&lt;br/&gt;integrable functions, the mapping properties of wave&lt;br/&gt;operators on nilpotent groups, and questions concerning&lt;br/&gt;the failure of weak amenability of Lie groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project is focused on some fundamental&lt;br/&gt;question in Fourier analysis, with an emphasis on &lt;br/&gt;estimates for various oscillatory integral operators.&lt;br/&gt;Such estimates are in particular crucial for&lt;br/&gt;understanding the qualitative and quantitative behavior&lt;br/&gt;of Radon transforms and related Fourier integral&lt;br/&gt;operators. These operators arise in various areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, such as partial differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;complex analysis and integral geometry, as well as in&lt;br/&gt;non-mathematical applications such as tomography and&lt;br/&gt;medical imaging. As an example we mention that X-ray&lt;br/&gt;tomography involves inverting a Radon transform&lt;br/&gt;operator; i.e. one seeks to determine an image from&lt;br/&gt;knowledge about the averages of a function for a&lt;br/&gt;prescribed family of lines. The operators involved in&lt;br/&gt;inverting this restricted X-ray transform tend to be&lt;br/&gt;Fourier integral operators as considered in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal.</AbstractNarration>
