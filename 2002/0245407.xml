    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to support the North Carolina A&amp;T&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Nuclear Physics groups students and senior personnel to&lt;br/&gt;work on the PrimEx experiment. Our group is currently playing a leading&lt;br/&gt;role in the PrimEx collaboration to develop and construct a&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art experimental setup, to perform a precise measurement of&lt;br/&gt;the neutral pion lifetime at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). Because the&lt;br/&gt;neutral pions are the lightest two quark system in nature, the&lt;br/&gt;prediction of theory is the most accurate and direct for this process. &lt;br/&gt;The present experimental knowledge of this decay rate is at the 10%&lt;br/&gt;level, which is about one order of magnitude poorer than the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;uncertainties. The PrimEx experiment at JLab, will significantly improve&lt;br/&gt;the experimental uncertainties associated with all the past&lt;br/&gt;experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will involve three undergraduate and three graduate students&lt;br/&gt;to work and to be trained on this project. It will provide them with&lt;br/&gt;unique research opportunities in experimental nuclear physics, and&lt;br/&gt;therefore will have a strong impact on their training and education. &lt;br/&gt;The program is highly interdisciplinary and includes work with both&lt;br/&gt;hardware and software (i.e., electronics, nuclear detector systems,&lt;br/&gt;computer simulation, and data analysis). It will allow them to work in&lt;br/&gt;a state-of-the-art facility and interact with scientists from other&lt;br/&gt;nationally recognized universities. Thus, it can be very effective in&lt;br/&gt;attracting African Americans and other underrepresented groups to study&lt;br/&gt;toward advanced degrees in physics.</AbstractNarration>
