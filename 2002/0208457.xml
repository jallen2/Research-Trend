    <AbstractNarration>EarthScope has the potential to change the way the public views Earth Science. The excitement of a continental scale experiment utilizing cutting-edge technology can change the image of 'geology' from a descriptive discipline focusing on a static Earth to one driven by physical and chemical models, dynamic processss and advanced technology. Scientists envision real-time data streams, automated analyses that convert the real-time data into products useful for the broad Earth science community, and development of community models that represent the integrated thinking of geophysicists, geochemists and geologists. This technology and data rich initiative provides a spectacular opportunity to engage the public and students of all ages in exploring the dynamic Earth and its impact on our lives. EarthScope will revolutionize how we do science; with a corresponding education and outreach effort, EarthScope will change how we communicate with a diverse American public, and how Americans perceive and use Earth science information. We propose to develop and maintain web and traditional print resources that educate a broad audience about the activities, discoveries, and societal impact of EarthScope. These resources will include (l) public relations information such as news items, notes on program activities, fact sheets, and presentation materials; (2) educational resources about our dynamic continent and the tools we use to discover it. These will be appropriate for the classroom, newsroom and boardroom; and (3) access to real-time data seismic data streams and visualization tools for the public. Much of the material will be organized under a cascading web site. Print materials for public relations will include an EarthScope poster to be distributed to K-12 educators and scientists at national meetings. We may also develop EarthScope fact sheets, bookmarks and other promotional materials or print versions of key Did You Know and In the News articles. The proposed activities and resources will provide a seamless interface to the multiple components of EarthScope for audiences ranging from policy makers, public, K-16 educators and the Earth science community.</AbstractNarration>
