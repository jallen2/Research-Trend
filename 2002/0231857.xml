    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Mexico State University is partnering with the three public school districts in south-central New Mexico and the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park (CDNP), a non-profit organization that provides environmental science experiences for K-12 teachers and students. The Fellows, graduate students in biology, chemistry, biochemistry and geology, partner with middle school science teachers and the CDNP to use weather software produced by AWS Convergence Technologies, Inc. to allow students, Fellows, teachers, and the CDNP staff to access, process and analyze weather data from over 6,000 locations nationwide. The teams are involved in both implementing existing CNDP and AWS learning modules and developing new modules that integrate weather data, geology, biology, and chemistry to fit curricular needs and address New Mexico and national science education standards. The broader impacts of this activity include the mentoring relationships developed between the middle school students and the Fellows who work with them; the increased interest of middle school students in pursuing STEM studies and careers; the enhanced abilities of participating teachers to develop climate focused classrooms modules reflecting the teachers' increased content knowledge and their increased comfort with inquiry-based learning techniques. The fellows are developing improved communication skills (especially with non-scientists), and knowledge of teaching methods and learning processes. In addition the interdisciplinary nature of the teams are resulting in increased Fellow appreciation for interdisciplinary research and an enhanced understanding of the broader scientific and social implications of their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title of Project: GK-12: Middle School Student Investigators in Environmental Science&lt;br/&gt;Institution: New Mexico State University&lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PI: Nancy J.
