    <AbstractNarration>022597&lt;br/&gt;Sivakumar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The convergence of micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, &lt;br/&gt;wireless communications and digital electronics have enabled the development &lt;br/&gt;of low cost, low power, multi-functional sensor nodes that are small in size &lt;br/&gt;and communicate un-tethered in short distances. They can perform tasks, which &lt;br/&gt;traditional stand along sensors are hard to match. Although sensor networks &lt;br/&gt;have some similarities with another class of wireless networks called ad-hoc &lt;br/&gt;networks, they have several distinguishing characteristics that necessitate &lt;br/&gt;dedicated communication protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs overall objective in the proposed project is to develop a system &lt;br/&gt;architecture, which includes new protocol entities and interfaces. Their focus &lt;br/&gt;will be on the integration of the proposed algorithms into an efficient &lt;br/&gt;overall system. While they propose to develop new algorithms and protocols for &lt;br/&gt;the transport and network layers, specifically, their deliverables will &lt;br/&gt;include: (a) a new transport protocol called SNTP (Sensor-Nets Transport &lt;br/&gt;Protocol) that is designed specifically for a sensor network environment, &lt;br/&gt;and (b) a power aware and scalable routing protocol that allow an end-user &lt;br/&gt;to control the sensors and reconfigure the interconnection of the sensor &lt;br/&gt;network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will evaluate their proposed protocols in a ns2 network simulator based &lt;br/&gt;simulation environment, and make available for public use any protocol &lt;br/&gt;simulation software. Since the ns2 simulator currently does not extensively &lt;br/&gt;support the simulation of sensor network environments, they will also develop &lt;br/&gt;such support and make it available for public use.</AbstractNarration>
