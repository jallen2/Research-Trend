    <AbstractNarration>Foltz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a rapidly growing trend toward embedding wireless capability into a&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of information technology products; recently in the form of&lt;br/&gt;single chip transceivers, and in the future perhaps integrated on-chip with&lt;br/&gt;the main product function. These devices must have low power consumption to&lt;br/&gt;satisfy battery conservation and thermal considerations. Good receiver&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity and signal handling are also essential in a crowded radio&lt;br/&gt;frequency (RF) spectrum; however, this requirement conflicts with low power&lt;br/&gt;circuit design. The PI proposes to develop low power CMOS circuits that improve&lt;br/&gt;the trade-off between power consumption and RF performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current CMOS low noise amplifiers (LNA) have noise figures as low as 0.8 dB,&lt;br/&gt;input intercept points up to +18dBm, and power as low as 1.5 mW; however,&lt;br/&gt;these specifications cannot be obtained simultaneously. Likewise, CMOS&lt;br/&gt;mixers can meet demanding CDMA communications standards for linearity and&lt;br/&gt;noise figure, but only at high power cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these problems the PI proposes a number of strategies for (a) reducing&lt;br/&gt;power consumption for a given level of performance, and (b) allowing a&lt;br/&gt;dynamic trade-off of power versus RF performance. These strategies include:&lt;br/&gt;(1) reuse of amplifier stages at two different frequencies through reflex&lt;br/&gt;arrangements, thus reducing the number of high performance, high current&lt;br/&gt;stages required in receivers, (2) dynamically controlled positive feedback&lt;br/&gt;and bias in LNA stages, to allow power, signal handling, and noise figure to&lt;br/&gt;be traded off based on signal strength and interference, and (3) integration&lt;br/&gt;of charge pumps into individual drain supplies, to optimize the voltage for&lt;br/&gt;RF-critical stages while allowing the non-critical portions of a CMOS chip&lt;br/&gt;to operate at low voltage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful implementation will lead to improved range and life for wireless&lt;br/&gt;sensors, more reliable communications under adverse interference conditions,&lt;br/&gt;and ultimately to wider application of information technology in industry&lt;br/&gt;and science.</AbstractNarration>
