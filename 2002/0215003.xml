    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish metabolic engineering approaches to increase the production of commercially relevant terpenoids in mint. This program will be directed toward high priority areas that will allow U.S. mint growers and processors to become more competitive in the production of existing products such as menthol, as well as the ability to produce novel high value compounds. The specific objectives include biochemical profiling of terpenoids in 150 different mint varieties, production of tissue-specific cDNA libraries and generation of 15,000 Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs), development of a mint DNA microarray and the use of this array to investigate gene expression patterns during trichome development, determination of protein function for one putative terpenoid biosynthetic enzyme, and improvement of mint transformation efficiency to the range of 50-100 percent. Completion of these objectives will provide a basis for the development of a robust system for metabolic engineering in mint that will allow the creation of improved lines that have enhanced production of commercially relevant terpenoids. This endeavor will create new products for U.S. mint producers and enhance their competitiveness in the world market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in the area of high value, plant derived compounds.</AbstractNarration>
