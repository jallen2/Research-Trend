    <AbstractNarration>This renewal proposal requests continued NSF funding of a research program currently sup-&lt;br/&gt;ported by the grant NSF-PHY-0070368. The major proposed topics lie in the area of \quark{&lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics," to study the quark sub{structure of strongly interacting particles. Particular&lt;br/&gt;attention is on approximate symmetries of QCD, particularly favor and charge symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry violation provides a \mirror" to identify and quantify non-perturbative physics.&lt;br/&gt;This research should shed light on the detailed properties of the fundamental constituents of&lt;br/&gt;matter, with emphasis on the validity of favor and charge symmetry, the spin dependence&lt;br/&gt;of parton distributions, and nuclear modification of parton properties. One product of this&lt;br/&gt;grant would be a comprehensive review of charge symmetry at both low and high energies,&lt;br/&gt;emphasizing our current understanding of the role of the up-down quark mass difference in&lt;br/&gt;generating charge symmetry violation over a wide variety of energies and physical processes.&lt;br/&gt;Models developed by the PI will be employed to investigate recent neutrino results, which are&lt;br/&gt;suggested to show physics beyond the Standard Model. The structure of baryon resonances&lt;br/&gt;will be investigated through a relativistic code developed explicitly to study these systems.&lt;br/&gt;New features of these calculations should allow a more realistic description of the structure of&lt;br/&gt;resonances in the .25N system. It is also proposed to study binding and scattering of particles&lt;br/&gt;in constrained 2-D systems, relevant to quantum wires and photonic crystals. Prior research in&lt;br/&gt;this area culminated in a monograph published by Springer-Verlag. Continuing studies involve&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with an experimental colleague combining theoretical studies of novel geometries&lt;br/&gt;with experiments on these systems.&lt;br/&gt;In all proposed areas, there is close linkage between theory and experiment. Some recent&lt;br/&gt;predictions by the PI are being studied at facilities such as LEP, HERA and the Tevatron.&lt;br/&gt;The baryon resonance work proposed here is relevant to data taken at the CLAS detector&lt;br/&gt;at Jefferson Lab. The PI is involved in studies for a possible new facility, an Electron-Ion&lt;br/&gt;Collider (EIC), which was favorably assessed in the recent NSAC Long-Range Plan for nuclear&lt;br/&gt;physics. The PI is a co-author on recent EIC planning efforts that include a Web site and CD-&lt;br/&gt;ROM containing a Whitepaper on EIC physics. The PI is Director of the Indiana University&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Theory Center (NTC). Currently the NTC has four postdocs and visitors, three of&lt;br/&gt;whom are women. In several instances, women working at NTC have received joint support&lt;br/&gt;from two or more sources, combining federal, university or foreign contributions. The PI has&lt;br/&gt;set up international collaborations between the NTC and physics institutes in Australia, Japan&lt;br/&gt;and Germany. The PI has mentored 9 undergraduate researchers in summer REU programs&lt;br/&gt;during the past 8 years. They have given talks on their research at subsequent workshops&lt;br/&gt;and professional meetings, and have collaborated on publications with the PI. The research&lt;br/&gt;proposed here will provide training and mentoring for both postdoctoral research associates,&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate physics majors.</AbstractNarration>
