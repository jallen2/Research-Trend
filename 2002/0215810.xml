    <AbstractNarration>Short abstract for proposal ECS-0215810 "Equipment Acquisition to Establish an Applied Electromagnetics and Communications Laboratory"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this NSF MRI proposal is to acquire the basic equipment necessary to establish a laboratory for research and research training in applied electromagnetics and communications at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T). Four instrument systems comprise this equipment request: a vector network analyzer system, a sampling oscilloscope and pulse generator system, a micro/millimeter-wave probe station and a microwave free space measurement system. &lt;br/&gt;Current and planned research activities at SDSM&amp;T that will be impacted by this equipment acquisition include electromagnetic propulsion and control of ultra-lightweight space sailcraft; space-based, gossamer zone-plate antennas; engineered electromagnetic materials incorporating active and passive circuit particles; ultra-wideband sensor webs; beam-steered, ultra-wideband radar; high speed circuits; compact antennas; ground penetrating radar; and electromagnetic properties of soils.&lt;br/&gt;There is little to no equipment at SDSM&amp;T (or anywhere in the region) for microwave or millimeter wave research work or for producing and detecting fast rise time signals. While computational electromagnetic methods and simulation are valuable components in our research, we rely heavily on experimental measurements to provide a critical dimension in our work. Such measurement capability is also a key element we expect will enhance our competitiveness in future funding opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;The requested equipment will also allow us to educate and train engineers in microwave and high-speed circuits, which are critical components in wireless communications and computer engineering. It will also complement a burgeoning regional telecommunications industry primarily based in Rapid City, and assist us in the recruitment of faculty, students and underrepresented groups</AbstractNarration>
