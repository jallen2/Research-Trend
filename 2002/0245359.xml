    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: DMS-0245359&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; PI: D DOLGOPYAT, U Maryland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smooth ergodic theory studies the long-time asymptotics of those autonomous systems&lt;br/&gt;which can be described by a finite number of parameters. Both analytic and&lt;br/&gt;numerical results suggest that most of systems fall in one of the following&lt;br/&gt;classes: elliptic (quasiperiodic) and hyperbolic (exhibiting &lt;br/&gt;sensitive dependence on initial conditions). Systems close to elliptic systems&lt;br/&gt;are described by the famous Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser theory. By contrast&lt;br/&gt;small perturbations of hyperbolic systems have been analyzed only&lt;br/&gt;in a few special cases. This proposal aims at the general perturbation&lt;br/&gt;theory for hyperbolic systems. This includes both the description of the&lt;br/&gt;perturbed dynamics up to the certain specific times as well as computing equilibrium characteristics of the perturbed&lt;br/&gt;system. Because there is sensitive dependence on &lt;br/&gt;initial conditions, it is hopeless to deal with perturbations of individual&lt;br/&gt;orbits. Rather, using the fact that hyperbolic systems usually have&lt;br/&gt;strong stochastic properties, I will study parameter dependence of frequencies&lt;br/&gt;of visits to a given domain in the phase space. My previous work on &lt;br/&gt;statistical properties of hyperbolic systems is essential to this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the recent years it has been understood that many systems&lt;br/&gt;we encounter have chaotic behavior. On the other hand there&lt;br/&gt;are several models of chaotic systems which can be exactly solved, which can&lt;br/&gt;be analyzed mathematically. However it can be asked how much one&lt;br/&gt;could trust predictions made on the basis of these models since &lt;br/&gt;the specific features which allow us to precisely solve these models might &lt;br/&gt;make them in some sense exceptional. In particular since chaotic systems are&lt;br/&gt;very sensitive to initial conditions it is conceivable that a slight&lt;br/&gt;change in the parameters of the system could drastically change their&lt;br/&gt;behavior. The goal of the current project is to describe the conditions&lt;br/&gt;when this drastic change does not happen. The main idea is that most&lt;br/&gt;chaotic systems are so complicated that changing parameters does not&lt;br/&gt;lead to an appearance of a new pattern of behavior but &lt;br/&gt;rather to changing slightly probabilities of already existing patterns.</AbstractNarration>
