    <AbstractNarration>What role do parties play in electoral competition? Why would parties exert discipline on their&lt;br/&gt;members? This investigation links these issues theoretically and empirically by modeling parties as&lt;br/&gt;informative brands to voters.&lt;br/&gt;As conventional wisdom suggests, most party labels carry fairly precise meanings. Democrats&lt;br/&gt;are generally liberal, Republicans are generally conservative, and Libertarians are basically conserva-&lt;br/&gt;tive but often socially liberal. The theoretical question is, how is this sustained as an equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon? In the basic model, the researchers assume there are a large number of constituencies, voters are risk averse and incompletely informed about candidate ideal policies, and candidates are unable to&lt;br/&gt;commit to a declared policy platform. In this environment, parties can play a critical role by ag-&lt;br/&gt;gregating ideologically similar candidates. Importantly, party membership is endogenous. Certain&lt;br/&gt;types of candidates thereby have an incentive to affiliate themselves with a party to reduce voter&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty about their preferences.&lt;br/&gt;The results of a pilot by the investigators are the following. (1) Parties can be effective screening devices for candidate preferences. Intuitively, this screening works because party membership imposes differential&lt;br/&gt;costs across candidate ideological types, so that only candidates whose preferences are sufficiently&lt;br/&gt;close to a party 's platform are willing to affiliate. Even in a single party system, voter welfare&lt;br/&gt;is increased by the information party candidates are able to convey relative to unaffiliated candi-&lt;br/&gt;dates. (2) In a two party system there is a direct link between the effectiveness of screening and&lt;br/&gt;platform choices. When the costs of joining parties is high-e.g., parties can effectively discipline&lt;br/&gt;their members or screen out certain type of candidates -party labels are very informative, and the&lt;br/&gt;parties' platforms converge in Downsian fashion. When party labels are less informative, however,&lt;br/&gt;the platforms diverge.This happens because taking an extreme position reduces a party's ideolog-&lt;br/&gt;ical heterogeneity, thus making its label more meaningful to voters. (3) Candidates do not always&lt;br/&gt;affiliate with the nearest party, since they also take the electoral benefits of party membership into&lt;br/&gt;account. These benefits may vary depending on constituency preferences. Thus even candidates&lt;br/&gt;with the same ideal policy may affiliate with different parties, depending on the preferences of their&lt;br/&gt;district's median voter.&lt;br/&gt;Extensions of the basic model provide additional predictions. Of particular interest is the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of hot races in which voters learn much more about candidates than we assume in our&lt;br/&gt;basic model. This extension can account for the fact that party labels sometimes mean different&lt;br/&gt;things in different places. Another extension is to model parties as democratic institutions that must&lt;br/&gt;choose platforms and screening mechanisms collectively, perhaps through a primary system. Others&lt;br/&gt;include endogenizing the number of parties, exploring alternate electoral systems, and determining&lt;br/&gt;the optimal level of screening or discipline.&lt;br/&gt;Both the initial results and the proposed extensions are amenable to empirical analysis. Among&lt;br/&gt;the topics we will pursue are the effectiveness of party branding, the relationship between party&lt;br/&gt;screening and platform choices, retirement and defection patterns, and the evolution of platforms&lt;br/&gt;over time.</AbstractNarration>
