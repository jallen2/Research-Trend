    <AbstractNarration>Golubitsky&lt;br/&gt;0244529&lt;br/&gt; A coupled cell system can be described by a collection of&lt;br/&gt;individual interacting differential equations. Cell systems are&lt;br/&gt;used as models in a variety of applications such as neuronal&lt;br/&gt;networks, speciation, arrays of Josephson junctions, and gene&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. In this Focused Research Group (FRG) project, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators develop a mathematical theory for coupled cell&lt;br/&gt;systems and with colleagues explore implications of that theory&lt;br/&gt;in applications. The network architecture is a graph that shows&lt;br/&gt;the couplings between cells and which cells and couplings are&lt;br/&gt;identical. Symmetries in the network architecture have been used&lt;br/&gt;previously to explore certain properties of solutions to cell&lt;br/&gt;systems, such as synchrony or traveling waves. Symmetry, however,&lt;br/&gt;applies directly only to the most regular of networks. For a&lt;br/&gt;larger class of coupled cell networks, local symmetries defined&lt;br/&gt;on part of the network can replace symmetries as a predictor of&lt;br/&gt;interesting and important dynamics. These local symmetries form&lt;br/&gt;a groupoid and it is this groupoid structure that is used to&lt;br/&gt;analyze properties of solutions and transitions between solutions&lt;br/&gt;in coupled cell systems. The investigators and students develop&lt;br/&gt;a theory of robust synchrony and investigate synchrony-breaking&lt;br/&gt;bifurcations in coupled cell systems (for example, network&lt;br/&gt;architecture often forces Takens-Bogdanov singularities to occur&lt;br/&gt;in codimension one at such bifurcations). They also investigate&lt;br/&gt;the consequences for coupled cell systems of particular features&lt;br/&gt;of the internal equations of single cells, such as symmetries and&lt;br/&gt;fast/slow variables.&lt;br/&gt; Symmetry and symmetry-breaking have been used widely by&lt;br/&gt;scientists and mathematicians to investigate a variety of&lt;br/&gt;physically and biologically interesting topics, including&lt;br/&gt;important types of fluid flows, crystal lattices, the existence&lt;br/&gt;of elementary particles, and the characteristic markings of the&lt;br/&gt;skins of tigers and leopards. The crucial feature of this&lt;br/&gt;approach is that it is model-independent in the sense that in&lt;br/&gt;appropriate situations symmetry permits the development of a menu&lt;br/&gt;of possible outcomes and the physics or chemistry or biology&lt;br/&gt;chooses from this menu. Indeed, the theory of coupled cell&lt;br/&gt;systems with symmetry has been applied succesfully to the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of different gaits in animals, pattern formation in the&lt;br/&gt;visual cortex, and speciation. Relaxing the requirement that the&lt;br/&gt;network under consideration has symmetries extends the&lt;br/&gt;applicability of this approach to a wider range of problems, in&lt;br/&gt;particular to models of gene networks, as well as other network&lt;br/&gt;models from neuroscience. In these applications it is rare that&lt;br/&gt;the exact model equations are known. It is therefore important&lt;br/&gt;to develop mathematical tools that study model-independent&lt;br/&gt;features of solutions, tools that focus on solution properties&lt;br/&gt;that are determined by the general structure of the equations&lt;br/&gt;(such as network architecture) rather than by the details of the&lt;br/&gt;equations. This approach will benefit researchers outside of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics by describing a menu of possible dynamics that a&lt;br/&gt;network can be expected to exhibit.</AbstractNarration>
