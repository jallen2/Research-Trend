    <AbstractNarration>Metabolic Engineering Conference IV is the fourth of a continuing conference series on the interdisciplinary field of metabolic engineering, and provides a new window into quantitative analysis and synthesis of metabolic networks. The increasing awareness of metabolic engineering in both the academic and industrial scene has been stimulated by some critical challenges of modern molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two most important elements of metabolic engineering, quantitative physiology (analysis) and metabolic design (synthesis), are aimed to address these problems. Concepts and methodologies of metabolic engineering have potential value in direct application of metabolic design of cellular systems for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants, production processes, and cell-based and gene therapies, which could provide critical insight in many areas of medicine.&lt;br/&gt;Themes to be discussed at this upcoming conference include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Systems analysis in metabolic engineering&lt;br/&gt;2) Metabolic engineering of cell cultures&lt;br/&gt;3) Metabolic engineering of prokaryotes&lt;br/&gt;4) Inverse metabolic engineering&lt;br/&gt;5) Human metabolic systems biology&lt;br/&gt;6) Metabolic engineering of quality traits in plants&lt;br/&gt;7) Metabolic engineering of primary and secondary metabolites&lt;br/&gt;8) Quantitative experimental analysis&lt;br/&gt;9) Computational methods&lt;br/&gt;10) Biocatalysts&lt;br/&gt;11) High-throughput analysis</AbstractNarration>
