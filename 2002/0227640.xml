    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UC Irvine requests funding to convene a workshop, in Irvine, on May 20-21, 2002, to produce a report that explores and recommends industry-academic-government infrastructure-building models for Experimental Infostructure Networks to help define new programs. This Workshop is being organized as a follow-on to a December 2001 workshop "Grand Challenges in e-Science" to add industry and private-sector input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infostructure encompasses the emerging computational, visualization, data storage, instrumentation and networking technologies that support our nation's major science and engineering research facilities. These facilities enable e-Science, large-scale networked science, that studies very complex micro to macro-scale problems over time and space. Infostructure includes computers and networks, and the middleware that enables coordinated resource sharing and problem solving among distributed facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networks are the key enabling technology for transforming infostructure from geographically separated computational facilities and instruments into a National Information Infrastructure. Three classes of Research &amp; Education R&amp;E networks beyond the commodity Internet are:&lt;br/&gt;Production Networks&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Networks&lt;br/&gt;Research Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this Workshop will be to answer the questions: Does the computer and telecommunications industry agree on a need for Experimental Infostructure Networks for e-Science? If yes, for what reasons, and what should they look like in the near and longer term? What roles should industry, government and academia play?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Workshop will result in the publication of a report that contains a list of recommendations with justification. All participants' names will appear as contributors to the report. Cal (IT) will manage the logistics as the host site and will assist the program committee in planning. The agenda and the final report will be produced by a team at UC San Diego, headed by Dr. Larry Smarr, under subcontract from UC Irvine. The budget includes costs for the workshop expenses, for the subcontract, and for staff and supplies at UC Irvine.</AbstractNarration>
