    <AbstractNarration>An interdisciplinary research team at Lehigh University is exploring melt manipulation during polymer processing. Melt manipulation is promising for the manufacturing of polymer-based products with enhanced properties. Because property enhancements can be realized the expanded usage of recycled materials also becomes possible. During melt manipulation, an otherwise conventional molding cycle is augmented by the application of oscillatory mechanical energy to the polymer melt during processing. This affects the material orientation and relaxation dynamics that occur during processing and in-turn the internal structure and overall properties of the final product. The project is focused on learning how, when, and where to apply the technique to yield beneficial results. The detailed sequential cause and effect relationships that connect applied melt manipulation conditions to final product quality attributes are being explored using a coupled experimental and analytical approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Components of the study are focusing on relationships between 1) applied machine processing conditions and localized processing conditions throughout the mold, 2) localized processing conditions and molecular orientation, 3) local molecular orientation and localized material response, and 4) localized material response and overall product performance. To assure the relevance and success of the effort, significant industrial involvement and guidance is included. The broad educational impact of the program is being enhanced by the inclusion of undergraduate students from a number of schools. In addition, a target group of middle school students from an under-represented minority population are being exposed to the research as part of an established and award winning cooperative education program.</AbstractNarration>
