    <AbstractNarration>This research characterizes siting conflicts in Japan and evaluates how Japanese siting approaches have addressed procedural equity. The research examines the view of fairness expressed by different parties involved in siting two underground rock laboratories (URLs), one at Mizunami and the other at Horonobe. These facilities are designed to study the technical feasibility of geologic disposal of high-level nuclear waste. Although neither of the URLs is intended to store any radiological materials, local residents have expressed strong opposition. By closely examining the siting processes of the two URLs through intensive analysis of public documents and in-depth interviews, the research will illuminate the role and significance of procedural equity. What are the key elements necessary to achieve procedural equity? What are the public's major concerns about the proposed facilities and the siting processes, and how have implementers and regulators evaluated and responded to these concerns? Are concerns different between host and neighboring communities? How do the key actors perceive the current institutional arrangements (e.g., compensation packages) that are designed to address procedural equity? How does the Japanese process and experience differ from that outside Japan?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These case studies will offer new theoretical insights about the role and significance of procedural equity. The research will contribute to scholarship on risk communication and public participation by refining our und3erstanding of the role of equity in environmental and risk decision-making processes.</AbstractNarration>
