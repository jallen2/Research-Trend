    <AbstractNarration>0218629&lt;br/&gt;Long&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on an innovative approach to develop radiation systems for wireless networks in which the antennas are effectively indiscernible in their local environment. It seeks to examine how both exterior and interior parts of existing buildings and structures might be used as transmitting and receiving systems for various wireless applications. The major issues that must be solved to successfully develop antenna systems that are essentially invisible, include understanding :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;how to effectively excite existing structures&lt;br/&gt;how to examine their basic radiation properties&lt;br/&gt;how to predict their radiated fields&lt;br/&gt;how to control their radiation characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some cases minor modifications may have to be made to the existing structures, but the visual and structural impact of such actions would be minimal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possible candidates for investigation include flashing and gutters around the tops of buildings, lightning protection systems, metallic window frames, building supports, power lines and supports, portions of existing towers and billboards, metal roofs or cupolas, portions of the metal structure interior to a building, and non-structural conductors such as door frames and ceiling tile support grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial phase of the proposed research program will address the following tasks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;development of appropriate feeding and matching techniques&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of the radiation properties for the proposed radiation elements&lt;br/&gt;investigation of the use of perturbing materials and modifications of the structures for&lt;br/&gt;current and pattern control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the successful implementation of such antenna systems on the world of telecommunications should be most significant. The final results of the proposed study should provide essential information on the feasibility of using existing structures as effective radiators, as well as providing preliminary tools and procedures for the design of this new class of antenna systems.</AbstractNarration>
