    <AbstractNarration>The most active antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are found in certain insects, such as larvae of the beetle Dendroides canadensis where they function to prevent inoculative freezing initiated by external ice across the cuticle and to promote supercooling by inhibiting potential ice nucleators in hemolymph and gut fluid. Overwintering D. canadensis produce 12 AFPs which consist of 12- and 13- mer repeat sequences which differ somewhat in sequence and number of repeats. Certain of these AFPs are produced in the fat body (analogous to the vertebrate liver) and secreted into the hemolymph, while others are produced in the midgut epithelium and secreted into the gut fluid. The single layer of epidermal cells, which lie under the cuticle and help to prevent inoculative freezing, also produces a unique combination of AFPs, as does the Malpighian tubule epithelium which produces the urine. The latter AFPs are presumable secreted into the tubule lumen to promote supercooling of the urine. The unique combinations of the different DAFPs present in these different sites suggest that certain D. canadensis AFPs (DAFPs) have evolved specifically to function in these tissues. This study will continue earlier work attempting to better understand the functions and mechanisms of the DAFPs in relation to those sites. In addition, this work will clarify the reasons for seasonal and yearly variations in antifreeze protein activity.&lt;br/&gt; Recent studies have shown that to achieve optimal levels of DAFP activity (freezing point depression, inhibition of ice nucleators, prevention of inoculative freezing) requires the presence of certain enhancers, protein enhancers and/or low molecular mass enhancers such as glycerol. While glycerol and certain protein enhancers have been identified in hemolymph, other unidentified protein enhancers are also present there, and the nature of the enhancers in other sites (midgut fluid, etc.) is unknown. This study will identify these enhancers.&lt;br/&gt; Because of their high specific activities, insect AFPs have tremendous potential for applications, such as agriculture and the cryopreservation of biomedical materials. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants have been produced which express DAFPs that lower the freezing temperatures of the plants. Improved understanding of the factors which control AFP activity in D. canadensis larvae has the potential to greatly improve the performance of the insect AFPs in these applications.</AbstractNarration>
