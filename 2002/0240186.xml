    <AbstractNarration>Although there is a rich literature exploring the logic of political competition over redistributive policies, there are few theoretical studies that include the existence of social cleavages other than the division by income level. Few observers, however, think that the politics of redistribution in the U.S. can be understood without consideration of the complications introduced by racial divisions. Moreover, the U.S. is not unique in being divided according to ascriptive characteristics. While salient cleavages differ from country to country, the existence of politically significant racial ethnic, religious, or linguistic divisions is widespread. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to study political conflict over redistributive policies in a society that is divided by race, religion, language, or other ascriptive characteristics. In the past, consideration of non-economic cleavages in theoretical work has been inhibited by the difficulty of modeling policy choices along two or more dimensions. Recent developments in formal theory now make it possible to develop a rigorous model of redistributive conflicts in a society divided by ascriptive traits as well as income. The research will build an integrated political economy model in which individuals are distinguished by earning ability and an ascriptive characteristic (here, race); the policy space is a proportional redistributive tax rate and an affirmative action constraint on firms in the labor market. The distribution of income and the policy are endogenous, with the latter being the outcome of a legislative bargaining game between three parties. This study will explore conditions under which the claim that social divisions reduce the support for redistributive policies is correct and study more generally the relationship between policy outcomes and the distribution of income in heterogeneous societies. Preliminary results suggest that the relative political weights given to different economic subgroups within the minority play an important role; in particular, the more weight accorded to low income members of the minority, the more emphasis there is on direct redistribution through the tax system relative to indirect redistribution through affirmative action in the labor market.</AbstractNarration>
