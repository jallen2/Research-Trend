    <AbstractNarration>0210257&lt;br/&gt;Fernandez&lt;br/&gt;The Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM) is a long-term paired, forested watershed research&lt;br/&gt;site with each watershed drained by a first order stream through a v-notch weir. One watershed&lt;br/&gt;(West Bear) has been treated bimonthly for 12 years with N and S by aerial helicopter&lt;br/&gt;applications, with the second watershed (East Bear) serving as the reference watershed. The&lt;br/&gt;objectives of this LTREB proposal are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Study the response of the calibrated East Bear Watershed to long-term patterns of ambient S,&lt;br/&gt;N, and base cation deposition. This will be accomplished by maintaining high quality&lt;br/&gt;deposition and stream export data from the reference watershed in support of research on&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem processes and change over time funded by this project and others.&lt;br/&gt;2. Study the temporal progression of N saturation at the West Bear Watershed. This will be&lt;br/&gt;accomplished by continuing the decadal-scale whole ecosystem N &amp; S addition experiment&lt;br/&gt;ongoing at the West Bear Watershed. &lt;br/&gt;3. Determine if a definable relationship exists between short and longer-term climate and the&lt;br/&gt;biogeochemical and hydrologic processes currently under study at both watersheds. This&lt;br/&gt;will be accomplished by establishing an air and soil temperature measurement program across major ecosystem compartments at BBWM. Studies will focus on the relationships between temperature, N dynamics (mineralization, nitrification), and surface water N export in both the reference and treated watersheds, and we will evaluate the efficacy of using heat units to predict ecosystem behavior with respect to these processes.&lt;br/&gt;4. Provide support to strengthen the data management efforts at the BBWM, thereby making&lt;br/&gt;this long-term record more accessible to the scientific community with an interpretive&lt;br/&gt;interface to be used by educators and policy makers through an expansive web presence. A&lt;br/&gt;major emphasis of this LTREB proposal is the development of a layered web presence on the&lt;br/&gt;BBWM project that provides access to data and highlights for policy makers, educators and&lt;br/&gt;researchers.&lt;br/&gt;5. Provide support for graduate student training and undergraduate student experiences in&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research have proven to be turnkey to date in regional and national debates on&lt;br/&gt;the effects of acid deposition and the risk of N saturation to forests and surface waters of New&lt;br/&gt;England. The compelling justification for supporting the long-term program of research at&lt;br/&gt;BBWM is that changes in response to changing ambient deposition of N and S (East Bear), long-&lt;br/&gt;term chemical manipulations (West Bear), and seasonal and inter-annual climate variation after&lt;br/&gt;11+ years are showing mechanisms of response that were not discernable within the first 2-3&lt;br/&gt;years of the study. These long-term mechanisms of response are frequently overlooked when&lt;br/&gt;research is conducted on short-term funding cycles. The long-term and unique responses being&lt;br/&gt;investigated at BBWM will be critical for adequately assessing policy and management options&lt;br/&gt;regarding air pollution and climate change in the 21 st century.</AbstractNarration>
