    <AbstractNarration>0205148&lt;br/&gt;Hansen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the proposed research is to analyze controllability and &lt;br/&gt;stabilization properties of systems of partial differential equations (PDE's) &lt;br/&gt;that model layered elastic media. Specific layered elastic systems we are &lt;br/&gt;concerned with include constrained-layer damping models, laminated &lt;br/&gt;plates, plates with surface-mounted and/or embedded actuators and &lt;br/&gt;general multilayer plate theory. For a given layered structure, generally &lt;br/&gt;there are many different PDE systems of varying complexity that could be &lt;br/&gt;used to model the vibrations. Often the various PDE's are connected &lt;br/&gt;through a perturbation, which may be singular. The central concern will be &lt;br/&gt;to determine the dependence of stability and controllability upon the &lt;br/&gt;perturbation parameters that connect the possible models. This way model &lt;br/&gt;dependence, accuracy, and robustness properties of control and feedback &lt;br/&gt;strategies can be tested. The plan is to apply this type of analysis to &lt;br/&gt;practical control applications such as optimal design for constrained-layer &lt;br/&gt;damping and the stabilization of elastic structures using surface-mounted &lt;br/&gt;and embedded piezoelectric actuators. Several theoretical challenges &lt;br/&gt;present themselves in attempting to develop control methods that are &lt;br/&gt;useful for multilayer plates. In particular, it is hoped to develop a theory &lt;br/&gt;of Carleman multipliers that is applicable to boundary control of layered &lt;br/&gt;systems. The objective is to obtain the sharpest possible results regarding &lt;br/&gt;boundary control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the modeling, control and stabilization of layered elastic &lt;br/&gt;systems is becoming increasingly important due to the rapid advances in &lt;br/&gt;material sciences, fabrication of composite materials, and speed of &lt;br/&gt;processing. The models considered are motivated by practical real-world &lt;br/&gt;applications involving composite layered structures. These include the &lt;br/&gt;design of ship hulls and airplane fuselage, sound-proofing in auto bodies &lt;br/&gt;and the design of sporting goods such as skis and tennis rackets. Often, it &lt;br/&gt;is possible to utilize a composite construction to achieve a far superior &lt;br/&gt;design compared to what is possible with a single material. Developing a &lt;br/&gt;theory for control and feedback of these structures is a challenging &lt;br/&gt;problem due the complicated nature of the coupling between the layers. &lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, for a model to be useful in practical engineering &lt;br/&gt;applications, various crude approximations need to be made to reduce the &lt;br/&gt;complexity. Thus, a large part of the goal is to quantify the connection &lt;br/&gt;between an accurate, but complex mathematical model and a simplified, &lt;br/&gt;but more useful engineering model. Specific problems of practical &lt;br/&gt;interest which will be addressed include: feedback control of vibrating &lt;br/&gt;structures using strategically placed actuators, optimal design and stability &lt;br/&gt;analysis for damping in layered and laminated composites.</AbstractNarration>
