    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: ITR-0081316&lt;br/&gt;PI: Xi, Hongwei&lt;br/&gt;Institution: West Campus, University of Cincinnati&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Imperative Programming with Dependent Types&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programming is notoriously error-prone. As a consequence, a great&lt;br/&gt;number of approaches have been developed to facilitate program error&lt;br/&gt;detection. The proposed research intends to enrich practical imperative&lt;br/&gt;programming with a type discipline that allows for specification and&lt;br/&gt;inference of significantly more precise information on programs than&lt;br/&gt;those enforced in languages such as Java and Standard ML. The primary&lt;br/&gt;motivation for developing such a type discipline is to enable the&lt;br/&gt;programmer to capture with types more program properties such as&lt;br/&gt;memory safety and then enforce these captured properties through&lt;br/&gt;type-checking. This practice allows for detecting more program errors&lt;br/&gt;in less time. Another motivation is to use the type discipline to&lt;br/&gt;generate memory safety proofs for low-level code and thus effectively&lt;br/&gt;produce proof-carrying code that asserts its own memory safety. In&lt;br/&gt;short, the research studies a type discipline for practical imperative&lt;br/&gt;programming at both high and low levels, aiming for producing software&lt;br/&gt;that is not only more robust to run but also less costly to maintain.</AbstractNarration>
