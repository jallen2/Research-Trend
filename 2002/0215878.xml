    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof. Peter C. Chen of Spelman College will develop a high resolution universal resonance Raman probe for studies in chemistry and materials science. The probe, which would use nonlinear resonance Raman spectroscopy for the selective identification and studies of species, would be able to provide resonance Raman spectra over an exceptionally broad range of input wavelengths (220-1800 nm). Furthermore, this instrument will be able to provide this information with very high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The universal resonance Raman probe will be useful for non-intrusive probing of challenging but important samples such as high temperature, highly reactive gas phase samples that may contain complex mixtures and interfering species. Such challenging conditions are found in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and related processes for creating new high-tech materials. Undergraduate students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences (Spelman College is an historically black women's college) will help design, construct and test this new instrument on a CVD system. These CVD experiments will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at Microcoating Technologies, a private company that specializes in combustion CVD.</AbstractNarration>
