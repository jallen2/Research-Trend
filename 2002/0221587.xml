    <AbstractNarration>A 5-day symposium will be convened to explore how biocomplexity controls the sensitivity and stability of tundra systems over decadal time scales. Experts in the field will be invited to give keynote presentations and participate in appraising existing knowledge and prepare a science plan to identify avenues of research examining the complexity, function and dynamics of tundra systems. Five themes and primary questions related to climate and the tundra will be addressed across multiple spatial and temporal scales. This includes drivers of change; patterns of change; sensitivity to change; responses to change; and implication of change. This symposium will bring together scientists involved in the North American tundra Experiment (NATEX) that is part of a larger network of scientists known as the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The ARCSS program supports ITEX work as part of the Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions (LAII) component. To enhance international and student participation, real time video web casting and teleconferencing will take place. These broadcasts will be forwarded to the Joint Office of Scientific Support for ultimate inclusion in the ARCSS Data Coordination Center. A synthesis report will be prepared and circulated. Key personnel identified during the symposium will draft a science plan similar to the LAII science plan and will include an outline for biocomplexity related research in Arctic terrestrial systems. A manuscript for publication in an appropriate internationally recognized journal is planned.</AbstractNarration>
