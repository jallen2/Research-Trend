    <AbstractNarration>There is considerable literature in the area of human judgment and&lt;br/&gt;decision making demonstrating systematic use of simplifying heuristics and&lt;br/&gt;the biases that can arise from them. For example, "framing effects" are&lt;br/&gt;common in which people react to the manner in which information is labelled&lt;br/&gt;by assigning more favorable evaluations to, say, a medical treatment that&lt;br/&gt;is described as having a "75% success rate" as opposed to a "25% failure&lt;br/&gt;rate". However, research by the Principal Investigator and others has&lt;br/&gt;uncovered considerable variation in the extent to which different&lt;br/&gt;individuals display such biases. Most recently, this research, which has&lt;br/&gt;been done almost exclusively with adults, has linked these individual&lt;br/&gt;differences to stable personality traits and decision styles. This&lt;br/&gt;naturally brings up the dual questions of when such biases develop and&lt;br/&gt;whether they can be linked to distinctive childhood dispositions. The&lt;br/&gt;present series of studies is proposed to address these questions.&lt;br/&gt; A major resource for these studies is an available population of 5-6&lt;br/&gt;year-olds whose social and emotional development and cognitive capacity&lt;br/&gt;have been tracked since they were toddlers. Thus, we have the capability of&lt;br/&gt;relating children's decision making behavior to measures such as shyness,&lt;br/&gt;impulsivity, and intelligence. In an initial study we showed that these&lt;br/&gt;traits are related to risk-taking in a gambling-type game. We are in the&lt;br/&gt;process of developing a battery of tasks/games which are "child-friendly"&lt;br/&gt;yet capture the essence of the decision processes observed in adults. An&lt;br/&gt;innovation of the new studies is that the parent as well as the child will&lt;br/&gt;complete the tasks so that we can correlate the two sets of responses to&lt;br/&gt;learn more about the development of decision biases.</AbstractNarration>
