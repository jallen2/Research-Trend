    <AbstractNarration>0086363&lt;br/&gt;Podila&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Gopia Podila and students from the Michigan Technological University in a collaboration Robin Sen of the Department of Biology at the University of Helsinki, Finland. The project will focus on the molecular characterization of cellular development and functioning processes in conifer ectomycorrhizae, which are symbiotic root-fungal organs essential for seedling establishment and tree growth in nutrient-limited soils. The essence of the symbiosis is that the fungus provides roots with needed nitrogen and phosphorus in exchange for carbon at the root-fungus interface. A deeper understanding of the functional genomics of the symbiosis is an essential part of forest science and has considerable potential in future forest biotechnology applications the U.S. and Finland. Each lab brings unique equipment and expertise to the research, and the collaboration is a perfect match for advancing fundamental knowledge of the molecular bases of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. Exchange of junior researchers is emphasized to add an international dimension to their training and to allow them to establish international connections early in their careers.</AbstractNarration>
