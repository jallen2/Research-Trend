    <AbstractNarration>Disseration Research: The Influences of Ecological Condtions on Maternal Antibody Transmission: Consequences for Offspring Immunity and Growth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Ellen D. Ketterson &amp; Jennifer Grindstaff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to resist disease is an important component of survival and reproductive success. Previous research has addressed the influences of genes and physiology on adult immune function. However, early in life, offspring immunity may be determined largely by antibodies transmitted by the mother during egg production, gestation, or lactation. The amount and types of antibodies transmitted to offspring may be determined by the mother's physiological condition. Through experimental manipulation of two ecological factors, resource availability and disease exposure, the effect of maternal physiological condition on offspring immunity and growth will be addressed. The PIs will examine the influence of resource limitation on immunity in adult females of a well-studied songbird species, the great tit (Parus major), by asking whether food supplementation enhances antibody transmission to offspring. In a second experiment, they will vary pathogen exposure in females prior to egg laying. They anticipate that food shortage will reduce the ability of females to protect their offspring and that exposure to specific diseases will render offspring better able to withstand infection. Both findings would suggest a larger role of the mother's environment in offspring development than has previously been appreciated.</AbstractNarration>
