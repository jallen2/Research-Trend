    <AbstractNarration>Cluster computing systems are becoming increasingly popular for&lt;br/&gt;providing cost-effective and affordable computing environments for a&lt;br/&gt;range of applications (such as databases, data mining, visualization,&lt;br/&gt;collaborative computing, and high performance computing). These&lt;br/&gt;applications require four fundamental communication services from the&lt;br/&gt;underlying communication subsystem: point-to-point communication,&lt;br/&gt;collective communication, synchronization, and Quality of Service&lt;br/&gt;(QoS). Modern Network Interface Cards (NICs) for clusters incorporate&lt;br/&gt;one or more programmable processors, DMA channels, and large amount of&lt;br/&gt;memory. The NICs are becoming faster, smarter, and intelligent and are&lt;br/&gt;being designated as Active Network Interfaces. Research is proposed&lt;br/&gt;along the following directions to take advantage of such active&lt;br/&gt;network interfaces for implementing and delivering scalable&lt;br/&gt;communication services for next generation clusters: 1) Using&lt;br/&gt;multi-CPU NICs and their architectural features to provide fast&lt;br/&gt;point-to-point communication, 2) Designing NIC-level support for&lt;br/&gt;high-performance and scalable collective communication and&lt;br/&gt;synchronization, 3) Taking advantage of programmable NIC-level&lt;br/&gt;features to provide QoS support, and 4) Experimentally evaluating the&lt;br/&gt;benefits of the new/enhanced communication services for a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of applications using message passing programming model. Through&lt;br/&gt;extensive theoretical, experimental, and simulation studies, NIC-based&lt;br/&gt;solutions are planned to be designed, developed, implemented, and&lt;br/&gt;evaluated for clusters with Myrinet and Gigabit Ethernet&lt;br/&gt;interconnects.</AbstractNarration>
