    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project was motivated by the need for rapid in-line inspection of quality of nanometer-scale devices in a production environment. An efficient diagnostics instrument, like the proposed product, is a rudimentary requirement for improved business operation in related industries minimizing possibilities for loss of revenue. The proposed innovative approach aims at developing an integrated technology using both electron and ion beams. Unique to this work is the idea of incorporating very special merits of high-brightness negative ion beams in a critical technology for device inspection. A novel system will be built to (i) deliver high yield in device inspection, (ii) achieve nm-level resolution and (iii) insure device integrity. This research will identify the characteristics of appropriate ion species from proof-of-principles experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Application of this work would be the design and development of an optimized ion beam column for the microelectronics industry. The end product would be an integrated product with improved optical characteristics.</AbstractNarration>
