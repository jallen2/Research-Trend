    <AbstractNarration>During the first year, the project team plans to award scholarships to twelve first &lt;br/&gt;year students who are enrolled in a mathematics or a computer science major. &lt;br/&gt;The scholarships are renewed each year for up to a total of four years. During the &lt;br/&gt;second year of the project, an additional six scholarships are awarded to sophomore &lt;br/&gt;majors students to support and encourage them to change their majors to math or &lt;br/&gt;computer science. These scholarships are renewed for a total of three years. The `&lt;br/&gt;awards are renewed as long as students make satisfactory academic progress and &lt;br/&gt;remain within the major.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this scholarship program is to increase the number of and the&lt;br/&gt;retention of majors in computer science, computer information systems and &lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Because our curricula provide a solid theoretical and practical &lt;br/&gt;foundation for careers in these fields, increasing the number of majors will have &lt;br/&gt;the effect of increasing the number of skilled and knowledgeable workers &lt;br/&gt;qualified for many high-tech jobs. A secondary, but equally important, goal is to &lt;br/&gt;increase the number of women and minority majors. This is especially important &lt;br/&gt;in computing where women and minorities are traditionally under represented. To &lt;br/&gt;meet these goals, the project team is enhancing existing student support systems &lt;br/&gt;and extend existing research and project opportunities to provide training and job &lt;br/&gt;experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ithaca College has extensive recruiting programs through the admissions office &lt;br/&gt;and the Higher Educational Opportunity Program (HEOP). The latter program &lt;br/&gt;specifically targets minority recruiting. Both of these programs provide additional &lt;br/&gt;support for new initiatives such as this scholarship program. Faculty members are &lt;br/&gt;traveling to selected high schools to inform faculty and staff about these &lt;br/&gt;scholarships. The project team is providing printed and on-line materials to &lt;br/&gt;prospective students, and is encouraging prospective students to communicate &lt;br/&gt;directly with mathematics and computer science faculty. The selection of students &lt;br/&gt;for the program is made by a team that is composed of two faculty from mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;two faculty from computer science and one academic advisor staff member from &lt;br/&gt;the student Adacemic Advising office . Students Academic qualifications data are &lt;br/&gt;provided by the admissions office, and financial need data are provided by the financial &lt;br/&gt;aid office. Combining the requested scholarships with college funds and other federal &lt;br/&gt;funds, we aim to meet 100% of financial need while minimizing loans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for matriculated students to remain in a mathematics or computer science &lt;br/&gt;major is provided through many venues. Upper level students serve as teaching and &lt;br/&gt;lab assistants in open labs during evening and weekend hours and in walk-in &lt;br/&gt;help rooms. Courses are available to provide academic prerequisites for students who &lt;br/&gt;are lacking some specific skills. Additional opportunities for faculty and upper-level &lt;br/&gt;student mentoring especially for women and minorities have been established. &lt;br/&gt;Real-world experiences are provided within courses and by providing the students &lt;br/&gt;with relevant work experiences, e.g., as assistants in courses and computer laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;The project team plans to establish a networking program between recent graduates &lt;br/&gt;and current undergraduates to provide regular communication channels to support &lt;br/&gt;mentoring. Processes are in place to aid and ensure that students effectively use the &lt;br/&gt;services provided by career planning function at Ithaca College.</AbstractNarration>
