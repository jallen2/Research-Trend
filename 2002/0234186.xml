    <AbstractNarration>There is a great deal of disagreement about the causes and extent of desertification and about what part of&lt;br/&gt;its impact on human well-being is manageable, and how. A new synthetic paradigm for&lt;br/&gt;desertification must be developed, one that is based on the simultaneous roles of the meteorological and&lt;br/&gt;ecological dimensions of desertification (the biophysical factors) and the human dimensions of&lt;br/&gt;desertification (the socio-economic factors). This proposal will establish ARIDnet to provide the&lt;br/&gt;intellectual leadership for developing and testing this new paradigm. Planned activities: ARIDnet will (i)&lt;br/&gt;conduct workshops to debate the Dahlem Desertification Paradigm (DDP)a product of the 2001&lt;br/&gt;Dahlem Conference on desertificationfor critical evaluation and refinement; (ii) formulate working&lt;br/&gt;groups to develop comparative case studies to test the DDP; (iii) conduct a quantitative synthesis of what&lt;br/&gt;matters in desertification, when and where it matters, and why; (iv) recruit new researchers and&lt;br/&gt;stakeholders into ARIDnet so a broad-based and useful approach to desertification problems can be&lt;br/&gt;developed; and (v) maintain a website to support networking activity. Anticipated impact: Arguments&lt;br/&gt;surrounding the topic of desertification create confusion in policy and management programs intended to&lt;br/&gt;help many of the worlds poorest people. Hence, there is an urgent need for new, interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;approaches for addressing this global problem. ARIDnet will provide the leadership to support on-going&lt;br/&gt;international discussions and strengthen recruitment of researchers, including undergraduate students, to&lt;br/&gt;study the principles, criteria, and policies related to global desertification, especially as outlined under the&lt;br/&gt;UN Convention to Combat Desertification.</AbstractNarration>
