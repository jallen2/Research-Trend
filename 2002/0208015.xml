    <AbstractNarration>This project concerns the development and analysis of efficient&lt;br/&gt;numerical algorithms for problems arising in computational modeling,&lt;br/&gt;with emphasis on two main topics: algorithms for systems of equations&lt;br/&gt;arising from the stochastic finite element method, and algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;algebraic systems arising in models of fluid dynamics. The first of&lt;br/&gt;these addresses the fact that models of physical phenomena often&lt;br/&gt;contain parameters or equation coefficients whose precise properties&lt;br/&gt;are not well understood. Examples include permeability properties of&lt;br/&gt;media in which quantities (e.g., pollutants in groundwater) are&lt;br/&gt;flowing or diffusing, and boundary conditions (e.g., along the ocean&lt;br/&gt;bottom). In the stochastic finite element method, the random aspects&lt;br/&gt;of problems are handled in a manner analogous to the introduction of&lt;br/&gt;new spatial dimensions. This methodology appears to have the&lt;br/&gt;potential to be more efficient than Monte-Carlo methods, provided&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms are available for the algebraic systems that are&lt;br/&gt;generated after discretization. Our aim is to study the algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;issues that arise from this approach. For the second project, we will&lt;br/&gt;develop and study efficient algorithms for solving systems of&lt;br/&gt;equations arising in models of incompressible flow, principally,&lt;br/&gt;methods for eigenvalue problems derived from linear stability analysis&lt;br/&gt;of steady solutions, and multigrid algorithms for the discrete&lt;br/&gt;convection-diffusion equation. These are fundamental problems arising&lt;br/&gt;throughout fluid dynamics, and their efficient solution is critical&lt;br/&gt;for development of effective computational models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general aim of this project is to enhance the utility and&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness of mathematical modeling for understanding scientific&lt;br/&gt;and engineering phenomena. There are useful models for many disparate&lt;br/&gt;physical processes, including blood flows, dispersal of environmental&lt;br/&gt;pollutants, performance of aerospace vehicles, and atmospheric and&lt;br/&gt;oceanographic phenomena. Understanding such processes through purely&lt;br/&gt;experimental techniques is prohibitively expensive or impossible,&lt;br/&gt;whereas the use of modeling and together with algorithmic solution&lt;br/&gt;introduces a basic understanding of the physics by providing&lt;br/&gt;approximations to quantities such as flow rates and pressures.&lt;br/&gt;Accurate solutions are only available, however, if reliable and fast&lt;br/&gt;solution algorithms can be used. Moreover, it is often the case that&lt;br/&gt;certain aspects of models, such as the geologic properties of&lt;br/&gt;transporting media or the velocities of flows along boundaries, are&lt;br/&gt;not known with certainty. Our goal for this work is to develop fast&lt;br/&gt;solution algorithms for mathematical models and to ensure that the&lt;br/&gt;solution strategies are able to handle uncertainty and to produce&lt;br/&gt;reliable statistical information about solutions at low computational&lt;br/&gt;cost.</AbstractNarration>
