    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to develop an integrated software package for the design and optimization of novel Simulated Moving Bed processes for multi-component separation and purification. Innovative design methods, simulation software and equipment have been developed and tested at the laboratory-scale for a number of biological separations, including amino acids, sugars, a peptide drug, an antibiotic, an anticancer drug and an antiviral drug. Laboratory data show that the new technology can produce high purity (&gt;99%) chemicals at high yield (&gt;99%). When compared to conventional batch chromatography, this technology can increase product yield by 5% to 15%, increase throughput per bed volume and reduce solvent consumption by an order of magnitude. During this Phase I Project, new tools for parameter estimation and cost optimization will be developed and integrated with existing design and simulation tools. This will result in a user-friendly interface for the integrated package. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are in the area of recovery and purification of pharmaceuticals and other biochemicals. The proposed technology is expected to impact purification costs in a major way, resulting in annual savings of several million dollars per product.</AbstractNarration>
