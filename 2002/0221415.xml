    <AbstractNarration>This project attacks the problem of how to help those in states and districts understand and use data accurately and effectively. The project uses a multi-dimensional approach to achieve three goals. It: (1) targets training for 300 mathematics and science education reform leaders, (2) creates a national cadre of 50 data facilitators; and (3) provides intensive implementation support in four sites to build the knowledge base about the conditions that support the effective and collaborative use of data to guide educational improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on the publication "Using Data/Getting Results," developed by TERC, and the materials synthesized in this publication will inform the workshops that the project implements. Professional development activities will be carried out by WestEd, and the Goodman Research Group will conduct the summative evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are partnerships with the Eisenhower Consortia, TIMSS-R Benchmarking jurisdictions, and NSF-funded systemic initiatives, including local systemic change projects, and dissemination and implementation sites who will work with this project.</AbstractNarration>
