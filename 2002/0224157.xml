    <AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to the NSF Spin Electronics for the 2fl Century Initiative, Program Solicitation NSF 02-036. The proposal focuses on investigation of techniques to locally induce, control, and detect electron spin in semiconductor microstructures by using properly located electrostatic gate voltages. Electrostatic gates are easily defined on a submicron scale and should provide switching and manipulations of spin currents. A variety of approaches to this goal will be pursued, including (i) gate-programmable nuclear polarization applied to single and double quantum dots, and the transfer of nuclear spin from dot to dot, (ii) gate-controlled spin-polarization in high-mobility GaAs/AlAs epitaxial layers; and (iii) electron-spin-resonance {ESR) measurements in AlAs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining state-of-the-art fabrication technology, careful measurements, and theoretical analysis, the proposed research is highly interdisciplinary. It relies on expertise of three experimentalists and one theorist in engineering and physics. It also entails the full participation of graduate and undergraduate students, who will gain invaluable experience and knowledge in cutting edge materials science and engineering, with a focus on the emerging and potentially rewarding field of spin electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will be centered at Princeton University with one investigator at Harvard University. Existing facilities at Princeton and Harvard will be adequate to carry out all the proposed work. The majority of requested funding will be used to support graduate students. Workshops at Princeton are planned to insure a focused research effort and to enhance interaction among students working on the common research goals.</AbstractNarration>
