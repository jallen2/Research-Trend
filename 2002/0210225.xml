    <AbstractNarration>NER Proposal0210225&lt;br/&gt;Exploring the Computational Limits Imposed by Nanotechnologies&lt;br/&gt;John E. Savage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has four goals: a) to develop realistic models for chips with&lt;br/&gt;nanometer-size dimensions, b) to explore the computational limits that apply&lt;br/&gt;under the physical constraints imposed by nanotechnologies, c) to develop&lt;br/&gt;architectures and algorithms reflecting these constraints, and d) to&lt;br/&gt;incorporate the knowledge acquired in advanced and early graduate instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While computational nanotechnologies exist only in the most primitive forms&lt;br/&gt;today, we have an opportunity to influence their use akin to that which arose&lt;br/&gt;when the VLSI model was developed in the late 1970s. In this model gates are&lt;br/&gt;so small that the area of wires is significant. Efficient use of this&lt;br/&gt;technology required new algorithms whose efficacy was demonstrated through the&lt;br/&gt;development of new complexity-theoretic lower bounds involving chip area and&lt;br/&gt;computation time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our approach will be a) to model technologies such as orthogonal arrays&lt;br/&gt;(crossbars) of nanowires and nanotubes and masses of nearly uniform&lt;br/&gt;self-assembled elements, b) to extend existing VLSI theory by incorporating&lt;br/&gt;the new constraints that emerge, c) to explore new architectures that cope&lt;br/&gt;with the complexity-theoretic constraints exhibited by the proposed highly&lt;br/&gt;regular architectures and ways of programming them, and d) to devise lectures&lt;br/&gt;and/or courses to bring nanocomputation to the attention of students.</AbstractNarration>
