    <AbstractNarration>CMS-0233543&lt;br/&gt;Philip Liu, Cornell U.&lt;br/&gt;"International Travel Grant: First International Symposium on Submarine Mass Movements and Their Consequences"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action is to support a US delegation to the First International Symposium on Submarine Mass Movements and Their Consequences. This symposium will be held as part of the 2003 EGS-AGU- EUG joint meeting in Nice, France, from 7-11 April 2003. The objective of this symposium is to advance our knowledge of:&lt;br/&gt; Potentially stable or unstable continental slopes - important to the health and safety of offshore and coastal regions;&lt;br/&gt; The possible presence of gas hydrates and free gas zones - so as to improve environmental protection during offshore activities such as cable, pipeline laying and drilling operations;&lt;br/&gt; Forces and release mechanisms of slope failures on margins, and of endangered areas - for a major contribution to sustainable development;&lt;br/&gt; Establish, describe and develop tools for evaluating the consequences of submarine mass movements to the sea floor, man-made structures or coastal communities;&lt;br/&gt; Links between the submarine mass movements and the generation of tsunamis.&lt;br/&gt; Predictive tools and risk assessment of continental slope activity for the next 100 - 1000 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A US delegation of six (6) researchers will participate in the symposium. Every effort will be made to invite junior researchers of the U.S. tsunami community as the members of the delegation.</AbstractNarration>
