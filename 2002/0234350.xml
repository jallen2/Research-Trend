    <AbstractNarration>Despite an abundance of research on gender bias, no prior work has examined the relationships among gender bias in evaluations, organizational mobility and final levels of organizational attainment. The aim of this project is to fill this gap in the literature by assessing four models of the processes by which gender bias could lead to the exclusion of women in senior levels of organizations. Computer simulation methods will be used to examine the impact of gender bias in performance evaluations on women's organizational mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By understanding how different models of mobility and other related organizational factors mediate the bias-to-exclusion relationship, policy-makers and organizational leaders will be better able to recognize the impact of gender bias, understand the organizational practices that lead to the exclusion of women, and develop research-based interventions to broaden the participation of women in the most senior ranks of management. Because gender segregation is the result of many small decisions, the cumulative impact of gender bias can be difficult to see. In this regard, a computer simulation is an excellent tool for classroom use, helping to clarify the real-world impact of gender bias and enabling students to manipulate organizational parameters so as to observe (in real-time) the resulting effects on women's organizational mobility. The computer simulation can also be used to demonstrate (and counter) people's tendency to dismiss the effects of very small amounts of gender bias.</AbstractNarration>
