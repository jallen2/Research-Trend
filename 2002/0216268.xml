    <AbstractNarration>With support from theMajor Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Simmons College will acquire a Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometer. This instrument will be used in a wide variety of studies, including a) the development and testing of organic light emitting diodes; and b) the investigation of cell signaling proteins associated with the activation of B lymphocytes in the humoral immune system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular weights on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with extremely high sensitivity. Use of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique in most DNA/protein core facilities. The ability to obtain very accurate molecular weights of biological molecules is fundamental to all biological and biomedical research and essential in a modern research and training environment. Simmons College is a member of the Colleges of the Fenway consortium of six neighboring colleges. One of these colleges, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, will also benefit from the use of the proposed instrument.</AbstractNarration>
