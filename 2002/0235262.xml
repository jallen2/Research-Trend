    <AbstractNarration>This project supports preliminary planning work to address the very large question of the integrating cognitive theory into teaching practice in undergraduate engineering education. This project proposes to both study and bridge the gaps among research, application and&lt;br/&gt;dissemination. Its goal is to facilitate more research-based teaching and curriculum and course design by making this research more relevant and widely accessible to faculty in engineering and related disciplines. The first steps are to identify (a) common problems across courses in engineering and associated fields and (b) the principles underlying these problems, based on findings from cognitive psychology. The next phase is to identify teaching strategies that successfully implement one or more research-based principles of learning. Once successful teaching strategies have been identified, then the task will be to find the best mechanisms for supporting faculty access to and implementation of these strategies. Furthermore, if this tool is to be effective in helping engineering faculty design their own teaching activities grounded in cognitive theory, then this mechanism will also need to facilitate the comprehension and implementation of sound learning principles within engineering and related domains. This process of developing a dissemination and support mechanism will be an iterative process, involving design, implementation, assessment and redesign as faculty feedback and other forms of formative assessment will be used to further improve the system. The assessment of this prototype will include tracking individual case studies to determine how faculty use this information in the design or redesign of their courses and teaching.</AbstractNarration>
