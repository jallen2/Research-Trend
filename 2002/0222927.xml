    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project addresses the development of a NEtwork ofAutonomous Robots (NEAR) with sensors and wireless network cardswith the goal of developing a distributed implementation of arobotic assistant. The key applications of NEARinclude: (a) transportation and retrieval of objects in asemi-structured environment; (b) organization and reconfiguration ofsensors for observations in dynamically changing environments; and (c) coordinated motion of multiple vehicles for cooperative manipulationor for efficient group locomotion. The NEAR robot network isalways "near" the human user, interacting with the user, andaugmenting her skills, providing a natural synergism.Our focus in this project is to leverage advances in automation andaugmentation and steer them in the direction of autonomy for servicerobotics. We will develop a network of simple mobile robots serving ahuman being. Each robot has some basic sensing capability (vision inour case) and the ability to communicate with other mobilerobots. Robots can be programmed to exhibit simple behaviors:controllers and estimators and policies that couplessensing/perception at a very low level. The ability to use multiplerobots enables autonomy without increasing the complexity ofindividual robot behaviors but by instead exploiting the distributedexecution of these behaviors in a network. Since the human isexplicitly involved in programming and commanding the robots, it ispossible to exploit this natural synergy by allowing humans toinfluence the assembly of the behaviors and the organization of theteam in a top-down fashion.</AbstractNarration>
