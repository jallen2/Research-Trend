    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: DMS-0204823, DMS-0204845&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigators: Benji Fisher, David Rabson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A B S T R A C T&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fisher and Rabson are classifying the symmetry types of quasicrystals&lt;br/&gt;in two and three dimensions and studying the physical consequences of&lt;br/&gt;these symmetries. The classification generalizes the work begun in&lt;br/&gt;the nineteenth century on space groups of crystals. The investigators&lt;br/&gt;follow the Fourier-space approach to crystallography, which has the&lt;br/&gt;advantage of avoiding space groups in higher dimensions. Thus the&lt;br/&gt;classification starts from the known list of finite subgroups of the&lt;br/&gt;orthogonal groups O(2) and O(3). They introduce techniques of group&lt;br/&gt;cohomology, some of which have long been used in "direct space," to&lt;br/&gt;the Fourier-space formulation. These techniques lead to both&lt;br/&gt;theoretical simplifications and efficient computational methods. One&lt;br/&gt;important application of these ideas is the description of certain&lt;br/&gt;gauge invariants in terms of group homology. The two simplest types&lt;br/&gt;of homology class are connected with known physical phenomena:&lt;br/&gt;systematic extinctions in diffraction patterns and crossing of&lt;br/&gt;electronic bands ("band sticking"). The next simplest type first&lt;br/&gt;occurs in a rank-five tetragonal modulated crystal and should be&lt;br/&gt;connected with some similar phenomenon. Tiling models are produced,&lt;br/&gt;and the ideas are also extended to magnetic and color groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystallography underlies and informs much of physics, chemistry, and&lt;br/&gt;geology. The present research has applications to recent experiments&lt;br/&gt;in liquid crystals (related to the popular LCD displays on&lt;br/&gt;wristwatches and other electronic equipment), plasmas, and modulated&lt;br/&gt;crystals, highly symmetric systems that cannot be described by the&lt;br/&gt;classical theory of crystals. Ever since 1784, when the French abbot&lt;br/&gt;Rene Just Hauy deduced the microscopic structure of crystals, it had&lt;br/&gt;been believed impossible for a crystal to have the symmetries of an&lt;br/&gt;icosahedron (or a soccer ball). Precisely 200 years later, such&lt;br/&gt;materials, called "quasicrystals," were discovered, and much research&lt;br/&gt;has ensued into their properties. Quasicrystals possess strange&lt;br/&gt;electronic and physical properties and have already found application&lt;br/&gt;as high-quality, non-stick coatings on electrosurgical blades. The&lt;br/&gt;present research aims to classify the symmetry types of crystals and&lt;br/&gt;to study physical properties associated with these symmetries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;and the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
