    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0205545.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of problems of elliptic and parabolic type in&lt;br/&gt;general relativity will be studied. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;will model rotating stars by a self-gravitating &lt;br/&gt;perfect fluid rigidly rotating on its own axis using a&lt;br/&gt;perturbation method. The perturbation parameter is the&lt;br/&gt;ratio of the angular velocity to the central density,&lt;br/&gt;allowing rapidly rotating solutions when the density&lt;br/&gt;is sufficiently high. The investigator will work on&lt;br/&gt;the uniqueness of the Kerr black holes, to rule out&lt;br/&gt;multiple black hole configurations, as conjectured by&lt;br/&gt;Roger Penrose. A new approach is proposed consisting&lt;br/&gt;of the investigation of the relation between&lt;br/&gt;uniqueness theorems for black holes in equilibrium and&lt;br/&gt;Penrose-type inequalities. The investigator will&lt;br/&gt;continue his work on the connectedness of the space of&lt;br/&gt;initial data for the Einstein vacuum equations,&lt;br/&gt;extending results obtained in the context of&lt;br/&gt;quasi-convex foliations, foliations with leaves of&lt;br/&gt;positive Gauss and mean curvature. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;will work, in collaboration with Y. Li and A. S.&lt;br/&gt;Tahvildar-Zadeh, on blow-up of wave maps, the&lt;br/&gt;dynamical counterparts of harmonic maps. These maps&lt;br/&gt;have attracted considerable attention by researchers&lt;br/&gt;in nonlinear hyperbolic equations mainly due to their&lt;br/&gt;similarity to the Einstein equations. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator will also work on the asymptotic behavior&lt;br/&gt;of harmonic maps with prescribed singularities into&lt;br/&gt;Hadamard manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical general relativity overlaps three&lt;br/&gt;disciplines: physics, geometry, and nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. As such, it is an ideal source&lt;br/&gt;of problems whose solutions have the potential to&lt;br/&gt;influence all three of these fields. The problems in&lt;br/&gt;this project fall in this category. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;study of Penrose-type inequalities is of interest both&lt;br/&gt;to mathematical relativists and to geometers studying&lt;br/&gt;spaces of dimension three. Developing a good&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model for dense rapidly rotating stars is&lt;br/&gt;an important goal in astrophysics, for example when&lt;br/&gt;trying to understand pulsars, and would also&lt;br/&gt;contribute new results in perturbation theory. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding wave maps should help the study of other&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear evolution equations governing various&lt;br/&gt;physical phenomena.</AbstractNarration>
