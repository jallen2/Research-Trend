    <AbstractNarration>AST-0201355&lt;br/&gt;Gonzalez, Anthony&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gonzalez is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Florida. He will conduct a multiwavelength survey for galaxies of intermediate redshift which he will use to constrain models of the formation and evolution of early-type cluster galaxies and assess the validity of estimators of cluster mass. This redshift regime is one in which the most dramatic evolution in the properties of galaxies and their clusters occur, and his observations are designed to provide constraints on cosmological parameters and models of the formation of structure in the universe. His educational program involves organizing a public seminar series designed to introduce the general public to recent discoveries in astrophysics and to serve as a forum for discussion of astronomical topics appearing in the news. He will also work with science teachers in local public schools to establish a Project Astro program in north central Florida. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
