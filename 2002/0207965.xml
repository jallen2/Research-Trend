    <AbstractNarration>The "Talladega College Science and Mathematics Improvement Program" addresses the problem of low levels of African American participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and workforce through enhanced STEM teaching and learning that will result from sustainable improvements of the institution's STEM instructional and research infrastructure. Infrastructure enhancements will address (1) student recruitment, enrollment, retention and graduation; (2) curriculum reform and improvement, infusion of technology to enhance instruction, undergraduate research; and, (3) faculty development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curriculum reform efforts include revision and enhancement of STEM gate keeper courses, development of honors courses in biology, chemistry and computer science; and the establishment of an Environmental Science Program.&lt;br/&gt; Faculty will be provided professional development opportunities to enhance their competence and currency within STEM disciplines and to effectively incorporate technology and active learning techniques into the learning process. Students will be provided opportunities to engage in research activity on-campus and at research institutions under the tutelage of research scientists.</AbstractNarration>
