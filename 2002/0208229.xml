    <AbstractNarration>This grant will host a two day workshop to investigate the current education programs and mission of Field Stations and Marine Laboratories and to develop recommendations on how this mission can be expanded. It is hoped that concerns on methods of increasing field biology in the undergraduate curriculum, increasing participation by underrepresented groups, collaborations with traditionally minority institutions, community colleges, and museums, and enhancing programs at field stations to cover all areas of biology will be addressed by the participants. Prior to the workshop, a survey will be conducted to assess the range and diversity of educational programs at field stations and marine labs. The outcome will be an oral presentation and paper and electronic brochures of the findings and discussions.</AbstractNarration>
