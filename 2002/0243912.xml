    <AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: AST-0243912&lt;br/&gt;PI: Balasubramaniam, K. S.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: AURA/NOAO/National Solar Observatory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Solar Observatory (NSO) will continue their Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in solar physics. Six students annually will work on research projects at one of the two NSO sites in Sunspot, NM or Tucson, AZ. The NSO performs research aimed at understanding the Sun as an astrophysical object, as a laboratory where the fundamental interactions between plasma and magnetic field can be viewed first hand, and as a driver of space-weather. Students will be given a choice of research projects such as measurement and analysis to help understand solar activity processes; solar seismology; physics of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration; hands-on experience with developing new instruments at the forefront of solar astrophysics such as real-time image enhancement, development of ultra narrow-band filters, synoptic telescopes, infrared filters and cameras. Other student activities will include presenting a seminar, creating an electronic presentation, giving occasional public tours, social activities, and a field trip to visit other astronomical research facilities in the southwest. Students whose research results in a viable paper will present findings at an annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society or American Geophysical Union. This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSO will also support four K-12 teachers annually in Research Experiences for Teachers (RET). The teachers will choose from the same set of research projects available to the REU students. In addition to their research projects and all of the REU activities, the RET participants will develop a classroom activity directly related to their research. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
