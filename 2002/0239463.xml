    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;DMS 0238463&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D Kleinbock(Brandeis): Career&lt;br/&gt;The research component of the project deals with algebraic&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems and their applications to number theory.&lt;br/&gt;A dynamical system here stands for an abstract set of points&lt;br/&gt;together with an evolution law which governs the way points&lt;br/&gt;move over time. It turns out that many problems concerning&lt;br/&gt;simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers&lt;br/&gt;can be cast in terms of the behavior of certain orbits, and&lt;br/&gt;various phenomena related to the theory of integer equations&lt;br/&gt;or inequalities can be better understood once they are phrased&lt;br/&gt;in dynamical systems language. Furthermore, systems that&lt;br/&gt;arise in this context are of algebraic nature, which makes&lt;br/&gt;it possible to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools for&lt;br/&gt;their investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component consists of several ingredients:&lt;br/&gt;developing new `creative thinking' courses and supervising&lt;br/&gt;summer research projects for both undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, and maintaining an introductory-style interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;seminar. The goals are to engage students in challenging research&lt;br/&gt;projects, encourage non-standard independent thinking, and to&lt;br/&gt;expose them to a broad spectrum of current mathematical research.</AbstractNarration>
