    <AbstractNarration>Considering the recent advances in plant genome analysis and functional genomics, proteomics research in plant systems requires integration of research activities from different fields. The symposium entitled "Plant Proteomes: Structure, Changes, Interactions and Functions" is designed as a "fusion conference" to initiate and foster interactions between proteomics researchers who are using computational and experimental approaches and plant scientists who are adopting, or who plan to adopt, proteomics technology in their research. To our knowledge, this symposium, to be held June 20-23, 2002, is the first to be devoted specifically to proteomics of plants. Speakers have been invited to present the results of their investigations of different aspects of proteomics and plant processes. The list of invited speakers includes a balance among different areas, backgrounds, career stages and genders. Each speaker will present cutting-edge research on the structure, function and interactions of proteins encoded by plant genomes; structural genomics; high-throughput analysis of protein functions, abundance and interactions; computational analysis of genome information to predict function and interactions; and functional analysis of gene families. The talks will cover many areas of plant biology, molecular physiology, enzymes and catalysis, signal transduction, metabolism, cell biology, and responses to abiotic and biotic stress conditions.&lt;br/&gt;The design of the symposium program is intended to: 1) foster collaborations between participants and speakers; 2) integrate research advances with education at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels; and 3) bring new ideas, new methods, and materials to researchers who are working in different fields. Therefore, this conference is inherently different from typical small conferences in which a group of researchers in one area meets regularly. This is a fusion conference where investigators in different areas of research will meet and discuss topics of mutual interest in the fast moving area of functional genomics.&lt;br/&gt;Attention to the educational impact has been given in the selection of speakers and during program development. In addition to the participation of students and postdoctoral researchers, special events during the conference will address educational challenges during the post-genomic era. Systematic and focused interactions with historically black institutions and undergraduate research experience programs will foster the attention of under-represented and under-served students.</AbstractNarration>
