    <AbstractNarration>This three-year project explores the influence of two modes of investigation, 1st- and 2nd-hand, on student development of scientific knowledge and reasoning. In 1st-hand investigations students have direct experience with phenomena. In the 2nd-hand investigations students interact with informal text, either in a traditional format or an innovative format modeled after the notebook of a scientist. The project proposes to conduct a series of three studies in schools with diverse populations: rural, urban-poor, and urban bilingual. In Study 1 and 2, the instruction of the unit will be done by the investigators and will be conducted with groups of 12 students during the school day. In Study 3 the instruction will be done by the teachers and it will involve four whole classes. Study 1 is a mixed experimental design in which 48 students will participate. Students, matched for general achievement, will be randomly assigned to four sequences. Sequence varies mode of instruction (1st- and 2nd-hand investigations) and topic (force- and mass-motion). Instruction will be videotaped, and interviews will be conducted to a randomly selected sample of 4 students on each group. Study 2 includes a third variable: mode of 2nd-hand investigations, traditional or notebook. It is a five-condition study involving different sequences. During this study, a classroom observation instrument will be developed. Study 3 will involve the implementation of the conditions that proved to have the best outcomes in Study 2. The study will try to identify individual differences that may interact with the type of condition. Instruction will be documented (taped) twice during the course of each mode of investigation. The classroom observation instrument will be administered during each investigation. A random sample of 8 students within each class will be interviewed twice in each instructional phase. The study will advance understanding of how instruction can maximize student learning in different inquiry contexts. A new classroom observation tool will be developed</AbstractNarration>
