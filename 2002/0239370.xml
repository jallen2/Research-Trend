    <AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: AST-0239370&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Colorado Boulder&lt;br/&gt;PI: Glenn, Jason&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jason Glenn will use his CAREER award at the University of Colorado, Boulder to develop new millimeter-wave instrumentation in order to measure the redshifts of submillimeter galaxies. These galaxies, discovered by their submillimeter or millimeter-wave dust emission, are found at high redshifts and are very luminous. With redshifts determined from the rotational lines of CO, it will be possible to measure the luminosity function and cosmic formation history of high star formation rate, dust-obscured galaxies. Dr. Glenn will use mature bolometer technology and an innovative waveguide-coupled diffraction grating to create a unique broadband spectrometer called Z-Spec. This new spectroscopic capability will make it possible to capitalize on ongoing and imminent submillimeter galaxy surveys. This award will enable Dr. Glenn to turn a laboratory demonstration facility into an instrument for ground-based submillimeter telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well as training graduate and undergraduate students in millimeter-wave instrumentation, Dr. Glenn will conduct an education and outreach program designed to expose high school students and the public to astronomy research through a set of classroom visits and lectures. Electronic presentations on our rapidly evolving understanding of the early universe will be developed for presentation at the University of Colorado's Fiske Planetarium and Boulder/Denver-area high schools. These presentations will be written and given with substantial participation by undergraduate students in the university's astronomy education track. Dr. Glenn will also work on developing active learning in the classroom and in the planetarium through the use of interactive teaching combined to provide real-time feedback on comprehension.</AbstractNarration>
