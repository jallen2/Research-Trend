    <AbstractNarration>The NSF-EC workshop in Grenoble entitled Workshop on Tools and Instrumentation for Nanoscale Research and Manufacturing is one of four joint events between the NSF and the European Commission (EC) held in 2002. The emphasis in this workshop is on tools and instrumentation for nanoscale research and manufacturing. The workshop will explore the synergy between instrumentation for nanoscale research, and its role in the areas of advanced materials and manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe. Information about the workshops are on http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/nano/start.htm. In addition, two of the other workshops in this series are The Puerto Rico Workshop on Nanomanufacturing and Processing, which is on the web at http://www1.eng.iastate.edu/nsf2002/nsf-ec.html and The Workshop on Societal and Educational Impacts of Nanotechnology which is posted at http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/nano/start.htm. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Materials research is a huge driving force for innovations that serve to educate and train future scientists and engineers, while advancing economic growth and social progress. Frontier areas of nanoscience and technology are generating scientific breakthroughs that revolutionize existing technologies as well a create new ones in areas that include health and medical services, transportation, environmental protection, energy efficiency, civil infrastructure, information technology, and homeland security.</AbstractNarration>
