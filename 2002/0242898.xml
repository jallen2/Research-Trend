    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is new methodology for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure organic phosphorous compounds. The reactivity of hypophosphorous derivatives [ROP(OH)H] with several classes of organic electrophiles, with and without transition metal catalysts will be explored. Phosphorous-carbon bond forming methods will be extended to other phosphinylidene-containing compounds (H-phosphonates and H-phosphinates). Desymmetrization of organophosphorous compounds will be explored to provide enantiomerically pure P-chiral compounds. Dr. Montchamp's educational focus is on the training of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Jean-Luc Montchamp in the Department of Chemistry at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, TX. Professor Montchamp will focus his work on the development of chemical processes that can produce phosphorus-containing molecules that are either right- or left-handed. The resulting "enantiomerically pure compounds" are expected to be of use in catalysis by chemical and pharmaceutical companies. The educational activities of the award will enhance opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate chemistry students.</AbstractNarration>
