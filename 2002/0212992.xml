    <AbstractNarration>0212992&lt;br/&gt;Harris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this project is to understand how nitrogen-fixing nodules develop on the roots of legumes. Since nodule formation is a plant developmental program, and is a normal part of the development of most legumes, this process should be studied within the context of normal root development. Why is it that only legumes form nitrogen-fixing nodules with rhizobia? Perhaps a difference in development lies at the root of their ability to interact with rhizobia. In particular, lateral roots have been proposed as a potential evolutionary precursor of nitrogen-fixing nodules, based on their developmental similarities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The immediate goal of this project is to examine the relationship between root development and nodulation. The specific aims of this project are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Determine the role of root development genes in the process of nodulation.&lt;br/&gt;This problem will be addressed using a combined genetic and molecular approach. The mutant screen for genes required both for nodule and root development will be continued. In parallel, the expression of known root development genes will be examined in the developing nodule. Finally, the phenotype of the lat1-1 mutant, identified in above screen, will be characterized in more detail. &lt;br/&gt;2. Map LAT1, a gene required for both nodule and root development and identify genomic BAC clones that span this genetic interval.&lt;br/&gt;LAT1 is one of the few genes currently identified that links lateral root development and nodule formation. Thus this gene provides a tool to examine the intersection between the genetic programs for nodulation and root development. During the period of this project, the LAT1 gene will be finely mapped and genomic BAC clones spanning this interval identified, laying the groundwork for the future cloning of the LAT1 gene. &lt;br/&gt;3. Characterize lateral root development in a legume using morphological and molecular markers: Are there any unique features? &lt;br/&gt;To address this question, molecular markers will be generated that label lateral roots at a very early stage and allow the observation of the marked cells through lateral root development. In this way, stages of lateral root development in M. truncatula will be identified, and can be used as a framework to examine lateral root development in mutants identified in response Specific Aim 1.</AbstractNarration>
