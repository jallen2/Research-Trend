    <AbstractNarration>When humans instruct each other h w to carry out particular tasks,nly a limited number of&lt;br/&gt;tokenized (linguistic)instructions are used.In contrast to this,classic control theory speci .es&lt;br/&gt;a control action to be carried out at each time instant.But,in a number f applications,such&lt;br/&gt;as semi-autonomous service robots for industrial and domestic use,intelligent appliances,and&lt;br/&gt;communication constrained embedded and/or teleoperated devices,the control procedures have&lt;br/&gt;a natural,linguistic .avor.The interpretation here is that linguistic control instructions specify&lt;br/&gt;particular modes f peration rather than explicit control values.&lt;br/&gt;The verall objective f this CAREER-prop sal is t develop and disseminate rational meth-&lt;br/&gt;ds for understanding how continuous devices,such as mobile rob ts,should be controlled using&lt;br/&gt;computer generated,linguistic inputs.In particular,it will be studied how these instructions&lt;br/&gt;should be de .ned,selected,and coded in rder to minimize the number of bits transmitted from&lt;br/&gt;the computer t the rob t,while guaranteeing that the system meets its speci .cations.F r this,&lt;br/&gt;an information theoretic approach t control theory will be developed,serving as a useful tool&lt;br/&gt;not nly for source coding of control signals,but also for describing how symb lic instructions&lt;br/&gt;should be interpreted and perated n by the continuous systems.Questions concerning what&lt;br/&gt;sensors and actuators to use in a given rob tic application can be addressed quite elegantly&lt;br/&gt;within this framew rk as well.&lt;br/&gt;The development of this program will serve as a foundation for a teaching and research career&lt;br/&gt;in electrical and computer engineering,with particular emphasis n control theory and rob tics.&lt;br/&gt;In particular,the e .ort will be focused n the following key areas:&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid Models: Control theoretic models will be developed for bridging the gap between the&lt;br/&gt;continuous (the device dynamics)and the discrete (the linguistic control inputs).The proposed&lt;br/&gt;models will give the symbolic inputs a clear,control theoretic interpretation,at the same time&lt;br/&gt;as the expressive p wers of di .erent sets f control inputs can be made explicit.&lt;br/&gt;Complexity Measures and Coding Theory: A complexity measure,corresp nding to the&lt;br/&gt;number of bits needed for c ding a particular control procedure,will be proposed.Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;by establishing probability distributions ver the set f control modes,optimal c ding algorithms&lt;br/&gt;can be derived.&lt;br/&gt;Multi-Modal and Multi-Agent Control Design: Strings of appropriate control modes will&lt;br/&gt;be constructed that make the systems meet given speci .cations while keeping the descriptions&lt;br/&gt;short.F r this we will design control laws that use the available sensory data in an e .cient&lt;br/&gt;way.These results will be extended t multi-agent control where formation maintenance and&lt;br/&gt;obstacle avoidance should be achieved while minimizing the inter-agent communications.&lt;br/&gt;Educational Plan: Due t the multidisciplinary nature f the proposed w rk,the under-&lt;br/&gt;graduate control curriculum will be modi .ed and tw senior level undergraduate courses will&lt;br/&gt;be included in the curriculum at the Georgia Institute of Technology.A multi-agent rob tic&lt;br/&gt;testbed where b th human and computer generated inputs can be used as a basis for the motion&lt;br/&gt;control will furthermore be developed.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
