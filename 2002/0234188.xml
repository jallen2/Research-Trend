    <AbstractNarration>Newman&lt;br/&gt;0109086&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator and his colleagues study the&lt;br/&gt;structure and function of real-world networked systems,&lt;br/&gt;particularly but not exclusively social networks. An empirical&lt;br/&gt;component is concerned with the discovery and analysis of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of networks, including networks of collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between scientists, networks of company directors, networks of&lt;br/&gt;personal preferences, and networks of citations between academic&lt;br/&gt;publications. Studied quantities include local observables such&lt;br/&gt;as transitivity and degree distribution, and nonlocal ones such&lt;br/&gt;as centrality and community structure. The investigator develops&lt;br/&gt;models to aid in the understanding of the effects of network&lt;br/&gt;structure. Of particular interest are random graph models of&lt;br/&gt;networks, percolation models of network resilience, and models of&lt;br/&gt;epidemics taking place on social networks. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;develops new algorithms for extracting and visualizing network&lt;br/&gt;structure, particularly the existence of communities in networks&lt;br/&gt;and structural properties related to network resilience, such as&lt;br/&gt;path counts and centrality measures.&lt;br/&gt; A knowledge of the structure of networks of acquaintance is&lt;br/&gt;crucial to the understanding of how information, such as news,&lt;br/&gt;rumors, consumer trends, etc., spreads through society.&lt;br/&gt;Similarly, networks of physical contact between people govern the&lt;br/&gt;way in which diseases spread. A proper understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;nature and progress of epidemics is impossible without good&lt;br/&gt;network models. In this project the investigator determines what&lt;br/&gt;the structure of the networks in question is, and also models the&lt;br/&gt;effect of that structure on, among other things, the spread of&lt;br/&gt;information and disease. As well as enhancing basic&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these problems, the project points to ways in&lt;br/&gt;which network structure or dynamics can be changed in order to&lt;br/&gt;either improve network transmission (in the case of information)&lt;br/&gt;or slow it down (in the case of epidemics). For disease&lt;br/&gt;transmission, for instance, it may be able to suggest effective&lt;br/&gt;targets for immunization or education campaigns to slow disease&lt;br/&gt;spread. The new data resources and analysis techniques developed&lt;br/&gt;can be used to study other problems in which network-structured&lt;br/&gt;processes arise.</AbstractNarration>
