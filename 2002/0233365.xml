    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the annual meetings of the West Coast Bacterial Physiologists (WCBP) is to &lt;br/&gt;foster communication among established investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate &lt;br/&gt;students working in the broad area of microbial physiology. Started in the 1940.s by C. B. van &lt;br/&gt;Niel for his associates on the West Coast, participants now come from Canada, the Midwest and &lt;br/&gt;the East Coast of the USA. This is one of the few conferences in North America that have &lt;br/&gt;retained a focus on microbial physiology, with a primary, but not exclusive, emphasis on the &lt;br/&gt;physiology of prokaryotic microorganisms. The conference especially provides a forum for &lt;br/&gt;graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to present and discuss the results of their research &lt;br/&gt;projects utilizing experimental systems ranging from model organisms to those of specific &lt;br/&gt;relevance to pathogenic and environmental microbiology. The conference has been held &lt;br/&gt;continuously since 1963 over a weekend in the middle of December at the Asilomar Conference &lt;br/&gt;Center in Pacific Grove, California. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual meeting is announced in August and September by direct mailings and by posting on &lt;br/&gt;the WCBP web site (http://wcbacterialphysiologists.ucdavis.edu). The meeting is organized with &lt;br/&gt;four formal sessions (Friday evening, Saturday morning and evening, and Sunday morning) and &lt;br/&gt;four unstructured informal sessions (Friday afternoon and late evening, and Saturday afternoon &lt;br/&gt;and late evening). Each of the four formal sessions is initiated with a 45 min overview lecture. &lt;br/&gt;The overview lectures are endowed by the Genentech Corporation and identified as the John &lt;br/&gt;Ingraham Lectures in Microbial Physiology. The John Ingraham Lecturers may be principle &lt;br/&gt;investigators, postdoctoral fellows or graduate students. They are selected by the conference co-&lt;br/&gt;directors on the basis of scientific merit and current high profile research topic of relevance to &lt;br/&gt;microbial physiologists. The overview lectures are followed by offered papers of 15 or 20 min &lt;br/&gt;duration. Typically, 7-9 and 5-7 offered papers are scheduled for the morning and evening &lt;br/&gt;sessions, respectively, depending on the number of abstracts submitted. No graduate student &lt;br/&gt;submitting an abstract has been denied a chance to present her/his data and conclusions. A &lt;br/&gt;registration fee covers lodging, food, meeting room expenses and support for the informal &lt;br/&gt;sessions. A differential between the registration fees for graduate students and all other &lt;br/&gt;participants has traditionally been preserved. NSF funding will be applied to maintain at least a &lt;br/&gt;20% lower registration fee for graduate students and go toward support of poster sessions, if the &lt;br/&gt;participants desire such sessions.</AbstractNarration>
