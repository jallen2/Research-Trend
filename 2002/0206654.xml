    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Current global climate change models predict increases in the frequency and intensity of&lt;br/&gt;drought in the southwestern U.S. In pinyon-juniper woodlands, we hypothesize that drought stress&lt;br/&gt;leads to increased competition between pinyon and juniper, greater dependence of pinyon on&lt;br/&gt;facilitative nurse plants, and changes in pinyon ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal abundance and&lt;br/&gt;community structure. Because EM fungi can alleviate environmental stress by increasing water and&lt;br/&gt;nutrient uptake by the host plant, it is important to understand factors that affect these mutualists.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to examine how competition and facilitation affect pinyon survival and&lt;br/&gt;growth, as well as their EM fungi. We will use a combination of field experiments, greenhouse&lt;br/&gt;studies, and molecular tools (RFLP analysis and DNA sequencing) to identify EM fungal species.&lt;br/&gt;The results of our study will 1) quantify EM fungal diversity and distribution in pinyon-juniper&lt;br/&gt;woodlands, 2) provide data on plant responses and EM fungal community shifts in response to&lt;br/&gt;competition and facilitation, and 3) contribute to the current library of EM fungal sequences.&lt;br/&gt;Because many of these fungi can only be identified with molecular tools, the latter objective is&lt;br/&gt;necessary to allow comparisons of ecological data on fungi from different locations to begin to&lt;br/&gt;understand the factors that affect their abundance and distribution.</AbstractNarration>
