    <AbstractNarration>A three-day workshop will be conducted to synthesize information and evaluate critically important unresolved issues, the means for pursuing those issues and the logistics and support needed to improve our understanding of the Arctic Ocean sea ice-snowpack-atmosphere interactions. The Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice-Interactions (OAII) Scientific Steering Committee, a component of the ARCSS science program, endorsed this workshop. A primary goal of the workshop is top plan a series of field campaigns, model development studies and laboratory studies aimed at understanding air-snow-ice-water chemical exchange and how this influences climate. Key scientists in the relevant sub-disciplines will be involved and will bring together investigators that would not normally interact. Linkages and leverages to the U.S. effort will also be identified. The workshop product will be a preliminary research plan defining the objectives and logistical needs for field, laboratory and modeling work. The meeting will further address the wider ARCSS goals pertaining to OAII type research and address the implementation issues in the context of the new thematic phase of ARCSS.</AbstractNarration>
