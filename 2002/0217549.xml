    <AbstractNarration>0217549&lt;br/&gt;Duman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: &lt;br/&gt;This award is for support of a cooperative project by Professor F. Tolga Duman, Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona and Dr. Ali Ghrayeb, Department of Electrical Engineering at the American University of Sharjah (AUS) in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. Their research deals with providing voice and data services over the wireless channel. They have shown that for a multiple transmit multiple receiver antenna system over a quasi-static fading channel, with antenna selection, regardless of the underlying space-time code, the diversity order remains the same as that of the full complexity system. In this project they plan to: extend their earlier results to the case of antenna selection principles for space-time codes over various realistic fading channel models (e.g., block fading, frequency selective fading), conduct performance analysis and develop optimal code design principles for space-time codes when antenna selection is employed, consider the use and design of turbo coded modulation schemes and low-density parity check codes for multiple antennas and address the antenna selection issues in that context, and study space-time coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems (to convert the frequency selective fading channel into a frequency flat one) when antenna selection is employed. The two scientists have studied the problem from a channel coding perspective and produced some initial promising results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: &lt;br/&gt;Transmitting voice and data services over the wireless channel is prone to several impairments such as fading and interference. "Diversity" is a most effective way of combating the adverse effects of fading. The research seeks to simplify the receiver complexity by employing antenna selection at the receiver that results in a great reduction in complexity, as only one receiver circuit is needed. Dr. Duman is presently carrying out research at his institute on coding for wireless communications and on smart antennas for wireless communications. This project will help his current research through the interaction with Dr. Ghrayeb (a Jordanian faculty member at AUS). Ghrayeb will visit Arizona State University during summers and Duman will visit the American University in Sharjah during winter break to continue the project. The proposed work will also have an educational impact both at ASU and the American University of Sharjah, and will result in a continued collaboration between the communications groups of the two institutions. The research results will be incorporated in educational material at both institutes.</AbstractNarration>
