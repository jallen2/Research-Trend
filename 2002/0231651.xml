    <AbstractNarration>\Proposal Title NSF/USDOT: Development and Testing of a Vehicle Based Zero-Public-Infrastructure (Zero-PI) Real-Time Traffic Information System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract: The research focuses on an innovative traffic information system, fully decentralized and based only on information exchanged by the vehicles themselves. The system (called Zero-PI) assumes that on-board devices are installed on vehicles, but no infrastructure installed on the network. Vehicles exchange traffic information as they move through the network, which allows drivers to adjust their routes and avoid or be prepared for congestion, incidents or other hazards. Since the system is solely based on in-vehicle devices, it will be market driven and self-maintained. It will work on all types of roadways, given sufficient market penetration. It will be upgraded as newer cars, with more advanced technologically capabilities for exchanging and processing information are introduced into the market. The only requirement will be for newer systems to be compatible downwards with the older systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feasibility and performance of the Zero-PI system (NSF/USDOT FY2001) both analytically and in a simulated environment provided very encouraging results. It was demonstrated that meaningful information is communicated to vehicles, even at low levels of market penetration. A preliminary feasibility analysis of the communications requirements of the system suggests that existing wireless technologies, such as the IEEE 802.11b/g provide sufficient bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop and test the necessary communication and computing devices and methods, the routing algorithms, and the data schemata that will enable relevant real-time traffic information to be exchanged, processed and used. &lt;br/&gt;To meet these objectives, a small number of prototype devices will be developed and tested in a limited field experiment. Efficient data structures will be designed to concisely store and exchange the experienced traffic data. Routing algorithms will be developed that take advantage of the exchanged data and produce navigational information. Finally, a large-scale traffic simulator will be modified to represent the behavior of the Zero-PI system. The simulator will allow investigating system-wide impacts and analyze issues of network equilibria and stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the system is successful, it can radically change the way traffic information is collected, disseminated and how the traffic network is managed. It can lead to a system that: &lt;br/&gt;does not require tax-payers' money to be implemented/maintained,&lt;br/&gt;is self-maintained,&lt;br/&gt;will work on all roads,&lt;br/&gt;will be market driven,&lt;br/&gt;will be totally decentralized (and more robust to failure and terrorist attacks).&lt;br/&gt;Finally, transportation agencies will benefit from such a system, since they can strategically locate receivers on the network and obtain information that, in turn, can be used for control, management and planning applications.</AbstractNarration>
