    <AbstractNarration>Identifying the mechanisms that structure local communities is a fundamental goal of community&lt;br/&gt;ecology. Historically, ecologists invoked local processes to explain community structure, but&lt;br/&gt;equivocal evidence has broadened debate to include the potential importance of regional&lt;br/&gt;processes in structuring communities. Though experimentation has proven critical in resolving&lt;br/&gt;issues in ecology, theoretical and observational studies have, thus far, been the primary tools used&lt;br/&gt;to examine the effects of regional processes. I propose a series of novel experiments to test&lt;br/&gt;theories that span the range between local and regional control of diversity. Local process,&lt;br/&gt;metapopulation competition, and neutral community theories make predictions about the effects&lt;br/&gt;of immigration that are qualitatively different, mutually exclusive, and testable in the same&lt;br/&gt;immigration experiments. Using a laboratory system of Tribolium flour beetles and a field system&lt;br/&gt;of Cecropia petiole beetles, I will experimentally test these theories by simultaneously&lt;br/&gt;manipulating immigration regime and interaction strength (lab), and exposure to immigration and&lt;br/&gt;distance from colonization source (field). Though recently developed theory suggests regional&lt;br/&gt;processes can have a dominant effect on community structure, the theory must first be confirmed&lt;br/&gt;empirically if community ecology is to gain insight from the regional process perspective.</AbstractNarration>
