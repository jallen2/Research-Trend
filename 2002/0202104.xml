    <AbstractNarration>This award will help support the Big Sky Conference on Discrete &lt;br/&gt;Mathematics which is held in Missoula, Montana. There are two &lt;br/&gt;main objectives of the conference. First, the conference is &lt;br/&gt;designed to bring together researchers and educators from the &lt;br/&gt;geographical area with interests in discrete mathematics in order &lt;br/&gt;for them to share ideas, present their work, and collaborate. &lt;br/&gt;Topics for the conference cover areas of discrete mathematics&lt;br/&gt;including combinatorics, graph theory, discrete geometry, design &lt;br/&gt;theory and theoretical computer science. The conference attracts &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and computer scientists from western US and Canada &lt;br/&gt;and in doing so has strengthened the discrete mathematics &lt;br/&gt;community in the region. The conference also includes two &lt;br/&gt;research-level invited addresses. One is given by a senior-level &lt;br/&gt;experienced mathematician and the other by a younger researcher &lt;br/&gt;who has made significant contributions to the field. The presence &lt;br/&gt;of these internationally-known researchers greatly enhances the &lt;br/&gt;conference. Secondly, the conference seeks to provide an &lt;br/&gt;opportunity for students, teachers, and others in the region to &lt;br/&gt;learn more about contemporary mathematics. This award provides &lt;br/&gt;support for undergraduate and graduate students to attend the &lt;br/&gt;conference and present their work. In addition, a public lecture &lt;br/&gt;(given by one of the invited speakers) is an integral part of the &lt;br/&gt;Big Sky Conference. The audience, comprised of people of all ages &lt;br/&gt;and many different walks of life, is treated to a dynamic lecture &lt;br/&gt;on the beauty and relevance of mathematics. The conference will &lt;br/&gt;be hosted by The University of Montana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Big Sky Conference on Discrete Math is held in the early fall &lt;br/&gt;at The University of Montana. The primary focus of the conference &lt;br/&gt;is stimulation and dissemination of research and creative ideas in &lt;br/&gt;discrete mathematics. This includes promoting collaboration among &lt;br/&gt;regional colleagues, supporting student research, and &lt;br/&gt;demonstrating to the general populace that mathematics is a &lt;br/&gt;dynamic evolving field with applications in modern society. The &lt;br/&gt;events of the conference include contributed talks by faculty and &lt;br/&gt;students and three invited addresses. One of the principle &lt;br/&gt;speakers is an internationally acclaimed specialist and &lt;br/&gt;outstanding expositor. This speaker gives a research level &lt;br/&gt;seminar and a public lecture. With attendance at the public &lt;br/&gt;lecture between 300 and 500 people, public awareness of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics has flourished during the years of the Big Sky &lt;br/&gt;Conference. The other speaker is a younger researcher who has made &lt;br/&gt;a significant contribution to an area of discrete mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;This person typically gives a specialized talk about a recent &lt;br/&gt;advancement in the field. The conference attracts researchers,&lt;br/&gt;educators, and students from the US and Canada, especially those &lt;br/&gt;in the northwest region.</AbstractNarration>
