    <AbstractNarration>Jack W. Davidson Illinois Institute of Technology Collaborative Research: Continuous Compilation: A New Approach to Aggressive and Adaptive Code Transformation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Today's challenge for optimization research is to develop new techniques and approaches that yield performance improvements that were typical of early optimization research-20 to 40 percent and more. In this research, we address this challenge by investigation and developing an innovative system or applying optimizations. Our system, the Continuous Compilation System (CoCo), applies optimizations both statically at compile-time and dynamically at run-time using optimization plans developed at compile time and adapted at run time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To demonstrate the practicality and utility of our approach, initially we will apply CoCo to several large, long-running applications. Examples of such applications include ecological simulations, weather simulation, architecture simulators, and VLSI routing and placement applications. As we gain insight and experience with the application of continuous compilation, we will investigate its effectiveness on other types of codes such as multimedia applications, signal processing applications, and web servers.</AbstractNarration>
