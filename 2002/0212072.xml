    <AbstractNarration>Champlin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of the development of adult-specific tissues during &lt;br/&gt;insect metamorphosis is providing a wealth of information regarding &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms used to coordinate growth, patterning and differentiation &lt;br/&gt;in animals. Adult development begins in the larva and precursors for &lt;br/&gt;adult-specific structures such as the wing and compound eye are &lt;br/&gt;typically present at the time of pupation in the form of discrete &lt;br/&gt;packets of cells called imaginal discs. The familiar and &lt;br/&gt;well-characterized example provided by the fruit fly, Drosophila &lt;br/&gt;melanogaster, in which the imaginal discs are present through the &lt;br/&gt;entire larval stage, appears to be a derived condition. In contrast, &lt;br/&gt;imaginal discs in apparently the majority of holometabolous species &lt;br/&gt;are not created until the final larval instar. Little is known about &lt;br/&gt;the development of these "late-forming" imaginal discs. The current &lt;br/&gt;studies focus on the late-forming imaginal eye disc of the moth, &lt;br/&gt;Manduca sexta. Prior to forming the imaginal eye disc early in the &lt;br/&gt;final larval instar, the adult eye precursor cells in Manduca &lt;br/&gt;function as fully-differentiated larval epidermal cells. Members of &lt;br/&gt;the Pax-6 and Six gene families are thought to play essential early &lt;br/&gt;roles in eye development of all animals. Portions of these genes &lt;br/&gt;have been isolated and their expression will be characterized as the &lt;br/&gt;eye disc is being formed. A combination of in vivo and in vitro &lt;br/&gt;studies will be done to follow gene expression as the larval &lt;br/&gt;epidermal program is turned off and the adult eye developmental &lt;br/&gt;program is activated. A central goal of these studies will be to &lt;br/&gt;establish the regulation of these events by the hormones that control &lt;br/&gt;insect metamorphosis, juvenile hormone and ecdysteroid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists and nonscientists of all ages and backgrounds find &lt;br/&gt;insect metamorphosis a particularly appealing issue. This attracts &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates from a variety of backgrounds to participate in the &lt;br/&gt;research program. Undergraduates as well as graduate students will &lt;br/&gt;be integral participants and it is anticipated that they will be &lt;br/&gt;coauthors on primary research papers. The proposed studies are &lt;br/&gt;expected to significantly broaden our understanding of the regulation &lt;br/&gt;of insect metamorphosis and the findings will be communicated to the &lt;br/&gt;general public as well as the scientific community</AbstractNarration>
