    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0228920&lt;br/&gt;Stanley Steinberg&lt;br/&gt;U of New Mexico&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to organize a workshop: Mimetic Methods for Discretizing Continuum Problems.&lt;br/&gt;There are several di.erent research groups and individual researchers that have rather&lt;br/&gt;recently realized that they working on discretization methods that have many common features&lt;br/&gt;that we refer here to as mimetic. This workshop will be the .rst organized to bring&lt;br/&gt;this group of people together for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;There are many powerful methods for discretizing problem in continuum mechanics:&lt;br/&gt;finite element, di.erence and volume methods;sp ectral methods;along with various generalizations&lt;br/&gt;and combinations of these. Typically, these methods start with a continuummechanics&lt;br/&gt;problem described in terms of partial-differential, ordinary-differential, integral,&lt;br/&gt;and algebraic equation and then discretize this description of the problem. Some methods&lt;br/&gt;may instead start with an integral description in terms of conservation laws or start with&lt;br/&gt;the problem described in terms of differential forms.</AbstractNarration>
