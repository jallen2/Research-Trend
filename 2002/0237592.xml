    <AbstractNarration>Future Internet backbones will have a two-layered architecture: MPLS-capable IP network on top of WDM-based optical network, where the optical layer offers ultra-high bandwidth and the IP layer provides quality of service and traffic engineering capabilities. As businesses and individuals increasingly rely on computer networks to carry mission-critical traffic and real-time traffic, survivability must be a key ingredient of the future Optical Internet. In this project we will investigate various resilience schemes that enable IP over WDM networks to recover from network component failures with minimum service disruption and with efficient use of network resources. &lt;br/&gt;The research work will focus on:&lt;br/&gt; Developing intelligent optical layer lightpath protection/restoration methods for dealing with single/multiple network failures; &lt;br/&gt; Developing a new scalable IP layer resilience framework that enbles fast IP flow restoration with low packet loss; &lt;br/&gt; Developing algorithms for dynamically enhancing capacity and connectivity of logical topology to combat congestion and network partition caused by network failures; &lt;br/&gt; Understanding various tradeoffs among restoration speed, spare capacity requirement, and algorithm/protocol complexity; &lt;br/&gt;Investigating whether handling multiple network failures requires significant amount of extra control complexity and network resources compared with handing single network failures. Performance of the developed algorithms and protocols will be evaluated via simulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research efforts will have a significant impact on the evolution of the future survivable optical Internet. The education part of the program is centered around motivating both graduate and undergraduate students to participate in networking research and training students to conduct quality research in the networking area. The findings of this research will be included in class materials and seminars.</AbstractNarration>
