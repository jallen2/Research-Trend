    <AbstractNarration>AST 0205789&lt;br/&gt;Terndrup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many outstanding issues concerning the formation and evolution of the Milky Way require improved&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the kinematics and chemical enrichment patterns of local metal-poor subdwarfs in the&lt;br/&gt;Galaxy's halo and thick disk, and how these compare to globular cluster stars. Even after several recent&lt;br/&gt;efforts, current samples do not adequately cover the range of metallicities and kinematics seen in globular&lt;br/&gt;clusters, while observations of local metal-poor giants give tantalizing evidence of significant differences&lt;br/&gt;between local halo stars and those in globular clusters of the same metallicity.&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve the observational situation by obtaining accurate and self-consistent&lt;br/&gt;measures of temperature, reddening, and composition for a critically selected sample of approximately&lt;br/&gt;150 subdwarfs identified in recent surveys for metal-poor stars. There will also be new theoretical efforts&lt;br/&gt;to explore the dependence of the main-sequence luminosity on detailed stellar chemical composition and&lt;br/&gt;on often-neglected physics such as helium diffusion and rotation. This project will also yield valuable&lt;br/&gt;information on the kinematics and star formation history of the halo and the metal-poor tail of the thick&lt;br/&gt;disk, identify samples of subdwarfs that are well matched in abundance patterns and kinematics to&lt;br/&gt;globular cluster stars, and improve the temperature and abundance scales of globular cluster main&lt;br/&gt;sequences for comparison to spectroscopic determinations on the giant branch. There will also be a&lt;br/&gt;systematic study of the relative and absolute ages of globular clusters, with a focus on reducing the errors&lt;br/&gt;in the theoretical plane.&lt;br/&gt;Importantly, this project will enable the community to take full advantage of the future FAME and&lt;br/&gt;SIM satellite missions, which will measure accurate parallaxes for the subdwarfs in the sample and&lt;br/&gt;thereby yield the absolute calibration of the main-sequence luminosity for globular clusters and hence&lt;br/&gt;their distances. Current distance estimates are only good to 10 - 15%, resulting in age errors of about&lt;br/&gt;30%, insufficient to reliably explore the age spread in the globular cluster system or even set lower limits&lt;br/&gt;to the age of the Universe by comparison with the predictions of stellar evolution theory.</AbstractNarration>
