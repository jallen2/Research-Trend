    <AbstractNarration>MohanKumar, Sheba 0236385&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to study how immune products that increase during stressful situations or inflammation affect reproductive hormones. The primary focus is on the reproductive hormone called luteinizing hormone (LH) , which is secreted by the anterior pituitary. This hormone stimulates the development of ovarian follicles and ovulation and helps in maintaining regular reproductive cycles. The secretion of this hormone is controlled by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) that is secreted by a group of neurons in the hypothalamus, which are influenced by a variety of neurotransmitters in the brain. Of these neurotranmitters, norepinephrine is believed to be stimulatory to LHRH secretion while gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) is believed to be inhibitory. Immune products are known to inhibit the secretion of LH, but the mechanism by which they do so is not clear. These immune products could affect two different classes of neurotransmitters to produce this effect. They could decrease the secretion of norepinephrine and stimulate the secretion of GABA, thereby decreasing LHRH production and subsequent luteinizing hormone secretion. The proposed studies will determine how these two neurotransmitters interact with each other to affect luteinizing hormone. These experiments will offer research opportunities for minority graduate and undergraduate students who will use state-of-the-art techniques such as push-pull perfusion in combination with high performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassay, in situ hybridization to accomplish their research goals.</AbstractNarration>
