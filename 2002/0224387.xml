    <AbstractNarration>EIA 0224387&lt;br/&gt;Czarkowski, Dariusz&lt;br/&gt; Erkip, Elza &lt;br/&gt;Goodman, Davis J.&lt;br/&gt;Karri, Ramesh.&lt;br/&gt;Wang, Yao&lt;br/&gt;Polytechnic University of New York &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CISE RR: Instrumentation for Research on Energy Aware Multimedia Information Terminals &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, performing studies related to minimizing the energy consumed by mobile cellular and wireless networking hardware, builds a framework to understand, model and measure power consumption, as well as dynamic allocation of resources to affect power consumption in portable multimedia communication devices. Three platforms constitute the focus for implementing signal processing algorithms (general microprocessors, e.g., Pentium and ARM), digital signal processors (DSP), and reconfigurable hardwarefine grain field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and coarse grain Application Specific Programmable Processors (ASPP). The work considers two communications systems that will carry the majority of traffic in wireless Internets: cellular networks and wireless local area networks (WLAN). Because battery life depends not only on total energy drain but also on the voltages employed in the terminal and the temporal profile of energy consumption, the research includes experiments with lithium batteries to determine the effects on battery life of continuous discharge and pulsed discharge with various peak-to-average ratios. The results of these experiments are then merged with the results of signal processing and communications studies in an energy-management testbed that verifies predictions and demonstrates the effects of the new adaptation techniques. Hence, the following four components form the research plan: &lt;br/&gt;Theoretical and simulation studies exploring power allocation among source coding, channel coding, encryption, and transmission in a multimedia, multiuser setting &lt;br/&gt;Measurement and design study examining the power and energy requirements of signal processing algorithms and producing a software library of software modules, FPGA configurations, and ASPPs that can be dynamically selected by a portable device &lt;br/&gt;Measurement and design study creating an intelligent power supply system that takes into account effects of battery discharge characteristics and demands of algorithms implemented on microprocessors, DSPs, FPGAs, and ASPPs.&lt;br/&gt;Creation of experimental testbed running in the WLAN network from the results of the first three studies &lt;br/&gt;The experimental testbed addresses three areas of research: &lt;br/&gt;Power allocation among different components of the processing pipeline (source coding, channel coding, encryption, transmission); &lt;br/&gt;Power and energy requirements of signal processing algorithms, producing a library of various granularity modules (software, FPGA, ASPP) to be selected dynamically; and&lt;br/&gt;Power supply system that takes into account both battery characteristics and algorithms needs.&lt;br/&gt;On the educational side, specific plans involve undergraduate students hands-on work, organization of workshop, and summer school. Industrial partners and international collaboration also form part of the research.</AbstractNarration>
