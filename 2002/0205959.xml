    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Land-use change and alterations of plant diversity and composition have been shown to&lt;br/&gt;influence ecosystem processes. Until recently, however, there has been little evaluation of&lt;br/&gt;the role of microbial community changes in mediating process change. Shifts in land-use&lt;br/&gt;and plant diversity may alter the composition, and thus collective physiology, of soil&lt;br/&gt;microbial communities, leading to differences in process rates. To understand more fully&lt;br/&gt;the factors that influence microbial communities and their functioning, our research&lt;br/&gt;addresses the following questions: 1) Does plant diversity and/or land-use influence soil&lt;br/&gt;microbial community composition? 2) Do these changes in microbial composition&lt;br/&gt;influence nutrient cycling rates? We are addressing these questions using an experiment&lt;br/&gt;in Costa Rica that manipulates plant community composition and diversity as well as a&lt;br/&gt;set of land-use sites, including forest and pasture. To address the first question, we are&lt;br/&gt;examining microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid analysis&lt;br/&gt;(PLFA) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP). PLFA data&lt;br/&gt;suggest that microbial communities differ significantly across plant diversity and land-&lt;br/&gt;use gradients. We request funds to proceed to the crucial second question and test, using&lt;br/&gt;controlled laboratory experiments, whether soils with distinct microbial communities&lt;br/&gt;differ in two critical ecosystem functions: nitrification and litter decomposition.</AbstractNarration>
