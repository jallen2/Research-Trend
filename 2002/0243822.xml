    <AbstractNarration>Drs. Albert Boggess (PI) and Jay Walton (co-PI) (in Math) together with Drs. Dave Larson (Math) and Tom Wehrly (in Statistics) propose to establish an NSF REU Site in mathematics and statistics at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. We seek funding for 60 student participants over a three year period starting in June, 2003. REU students will join A&amp;M undergraduate and graduate students who are participants in our VIGRE program, which runs vertically integrated research seminars covering topics of interest here to the faculty. During the summer of 2003, we intend to run two simultaneous eight-week programs; one in matrix analysis and wavelets, organized by Dave Larson in Math, and the other in the mathematics of ecology. The program in ecology will have at least two tracks - one involving statistical models, organized by Tom Wehrly in Statistics, and the other involving diffusion models, organized by Jay Walton in Math. Both Dave Larson and Jay Walton have played key roles in our current REU program and both have organized similar seminars during the academic year for our VIGRE program. In future summers (2004 and beyond), additional REU programs are planned and will likely arise from successful VIGRE seminars that run during the academic year. Participants will be paid a stipend of $250 per week plus a $25 per day food allowance. They will also stay in on-campus dormitories which will be charged directly to the grant.</AbstractNarration>
