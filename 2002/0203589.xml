    <AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the exact study of the statistical mechanics of model systems.&lt;br/&gt;Research concentrates on critical percolation in two-dimensions, and important and&lt;br/&gt;extensively studied statistical system, and the phase transition of the farey fraction spin&lt;br/&gt;chain, a new and interesting one-dimensional model with connections to multifractals and &lt;br/&gt;Monte Carol simulations, mathematically exact solutions of model statistical &lt;br/&gt;mechanical systems, and techniques from number theory. The goal is to gain new&lt;br/&gt;insights into, and understanding of, these systems. An important feature of the project is&lt;br/&gt;the use of techniques from pure mathematics and close collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the exact study of the statistical mechanics of model systems.&lt;br/&gt;Research concentrates on critical percolation in two-dimensions, and important and&lt;br/&gt;extensively studied statistical system, and the phase transition of the farey fraction spin&lt;br/&gt;chain, a new and interesting one-dimensional model with connections to multifractals and &lt;br/&gt;Monte Carol simulations, mathematically exact solutions of model statistical &lt;br/&gt;mechanical systems, and techniques from number theory.
