    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0245260&lt;br/&gt;Bent/Stanford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the fundamental chemistry needed to allow the integration of semiconductor and organic thin film materials. Synthetic strategies for the controlled attachment of organic molecules to semiconductor materials are being developed by Professor Bent and her coworkers in the Chemical Engineering Department at Stanford University. Approaches to first layer attachment are being examined, along with general strategies for the attachment of second layer molecules to the organic interface. The third focus of the research is on the controlled patterning of these semiconductor-organic interfaces. The results of this work provide the fundamental understanding necessary for the development of the processing chemistry for the next generation of molecular electronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Bent and her collaborators at Stanford University are exploring synthetic strategies for the attachment of organic layers to silicon and germanium surfaces. Using approaches developed in standard organic synthesis, they are investigating vacuum based methods for the controlled modification of semiconductor surfaces with a range of organic molecules. The results of this research provide the basis for the processing of molecular electronic devices.</AbstractNarration>
