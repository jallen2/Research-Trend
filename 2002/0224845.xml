    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for construction of new visitor housing at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratory (FHL). The housing will be used in support of an innovative scientific research apprenticeship training program that brings together teams composed of faculty mentors, graduate students and undergraduate apprentices who work in residence at the Laboratory for 10 weeks during the academic year. Teams are selected from a national pool of applicants by an external review committee on the basis of written applications. The success and growth of this program has created a need for additional, modern housing at the FHL, most of whose existing housing units were built to serve as summertime housing. The program has a major impact on the numbers and quality of undergraduate and graduate students who opt for professional contributions to very high quality research programs nationally and internationally. Through direct involvement with world-class mentors, students learn how leading edge research is done, what some of the key questions in marine science fields are, and what career opportunities exist.</AbstractNarration>
