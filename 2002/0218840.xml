    <AbstractNarration>The Materials Research Society Symposium on Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic Materials IV will be held in Boston, MA December 2-6, 2002. The goal of the conference is to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions information exchange within a broad spectrum of researchers, to include CAREER grantees, and top post doctoral scholars and graduate students working in priority areas of the broad field of solid-state chemistry. The NSF funds will be used exclusively to offset the expenses associated with attending the symposium for U.S. participants, specifically graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, junior faculty and selected plenary speakers in the area of solid state chemistry of inorganic materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solid State Chemistry community continues to have a direct impact on important technological areas that are crucial to advancing society through the design, synthesis and application new materials. Examples include porous solids for catalysis, thin films for electronics and electrooptic devices, and nanostructured materials for high-strength composite structural materials. Since these technical areas are of very high priority to industry, students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary areas involving solid-state chemistry compete very well in the job market and go on to contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.</AbstractNarration>
