    <AbstractNarration>The Fellows are familiarizing themselves with best-practices pedagogy as well as state and national standards for mathematics and science as they work with the local teachers to develop interdisciplinary mathematics and science materials for all classes at the K-8 level. These modules are consistent with state and national standards and try, as far as is possible, to incorporate the theme of the Mississippi River basin in order to provide continuity through the curriculum and help to bring home the impact of math and science on the student's lives; an example of the project's intellectual merit.. The Fellows work with six schools: Bramlett, Oxford, and Central Elementary schools and Oxford Middle School (City of Oxford Schools) and Lafayette Elementary and Middle Schools (Lafayette County Schools). There are two key/contact teachers (one math, one science) at each of the middle schools and one key/contact teacher at each of the elementary schools. The broader impacts of the activities reach a number of beneficiaries. The Fellows are developing: improved communication skills; an understanding of good pedagogy; and an ability to effectively use technology as a teaching / learning tool and to use inquiry-based teaching and learning tools. Participating teachers are increasing their understanding of STEM related subjects; are demonstrating an increased use of inquiry-based teaching and learning tools; and are gaining access to a variety of professional development opportunities (ASTM, NSTA and other conferences). In addition there is an increasingly strong relationship developing between the University of Mississippi STEM-related departments and local school systems. Part of the support for this project comes from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: The North Mississippi GK-8 Project &lt;br/&gt;Institution: The University of Mississippi &lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PIs: John O'Haver / Maurice Eftink, Cliff Ochs, David Rock &lt;br/&gt;Partner School Districts: Lafayette County, Oxford&lt;br/&gt;Funding: $1,499.832&lt;br/&gt;Number of Fellows / Year: 12 Graduate&lt;br/&gt;Target Audience K-8 &lt;br/&gt;NSF Supported Disciplines: Mathematics, chemistry, geology, biology, physics, engineering, computer science, economics</AbstractNarration>
