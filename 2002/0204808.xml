    <AbstractNarration>The work is concerned with the theory of free surface flows. Here a free&lt;br/&gt;surface refers to an interface between two fluids. The position of such a surface is not&lt;br/&gt;known a priori and has to be found as part of the solution. This leads&lt;br/&gt;to a highly nonlinear mathematical problem, for which the PI will&lt;br/&gt;develop new numerical and analytical approaches. &lt;br/&gt;The objective is to develop numerically and analytically theories for&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional nonlinear free surface flows and for two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;interfacial flows. Specifically:&lt;br/&gt;(A) Derive efficient and accurate numerical approaches for &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional nonlinear free surface flows. &lt;br/&gt;(B) Use these new schemes together with analytical techniques to further&lt;br/&gt;the understanding of three-dimensional free surface flows. This&lt;br/&gt;includes extending linear and weakly nonlinear theories to the&lt;br/&gt;fully nonlinear regime and discovering the limiting configurations&lt;br/&gt;of these flows.&lt;br/&gt;(C) Check the validity of existing approximations in ship &lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamics and improve them.&lt;br/&gt;(D) Investigate the existence of new types of waves propagating&lt;br/&gt;at the interface between two fluids of constant densities. These waves should&lt;br/&gt;have properties intermediate between those of ``generalized solitary waves"&lt;br/&gt;and those of ``classical fronts". Therefore it is appropriate to&lt;br/&gt;describe them as ``generalized fronts". &lt;br/&gt;Their existence is strongly suggested by previous work but they&lt;br/&gt;have not been calculated explicitly.&lt;br/&gt;(E) Calculate the generalized fronts and perform a numerical study of&lt;br/&gt;their stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free surface flows are common in many aspects of science and everyday life.&lt;br/&gt;Examples are waves on a beach, bubbles rising in a glass of champagne,&lt;br/&gt;melting ice, pouring flows from a container and sails blowing in the wind.&lt;br/&gt;In these examples the free surface is the surface of the sea, the interface&lt;br/&gt;between the gas and the champagne, the surface of the ice, the boundary&lt;br/&gt;of the pouring flow and the surface of the sail. The PI will concentrate&lt;br/&gt;on applications arising from fluid mechanics. However the methods developed are&lt;br/&gt;general and have applications outside fluid mechanics and the PI proposes to&lt;br/&gt;investigate them as well. The research will benefit applied mathematicians interested in nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;free surface flows and applied scientists in need of accurate schemes&lt;br/&gt;to solve three-dimensional free surface flows. The proposed application&lt;br/&gt;to the nonlinear wave pattern generated by a ship is relevant to&lt;br/&gt;ship hydrodynamics. The study of waves on sharp interfaces has &lt;br/&gt;applications in oceanography. Such sharp interfaces form in oceans, lakes&lt;br/&gt;and the atmosphere between adjacent masses of different density associated with&lt;br/&gt;differences in temperature, salinity or amount of suspension. One of the&lt;br/&gt;reasons for studying such sharp boundaries is that they appear at the surface as&lt;br/&gt;frontal lines where dust, foam, timber and others accumulate.&lt;br/&gt;Many of the problems proposed can be done in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
