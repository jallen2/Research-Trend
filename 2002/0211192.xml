    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: DMS-0211192&lt;br/&gt;PI: Chi-Sing Man&lt;br/&gt;Insitution: University of Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;Title: Symposium: Recent advances and new directions in mechanics, continuum thermodynamics, and kinetic theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A symposium entitled&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Recent Advances and New Directions in Mechanics, Continuum Thermodynamics, and Kinetic Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;will be held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, in conjunction with the 14th U.S. National Congress on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, June 23-28, 2002. The symposium will focus on current problems in three areas: rational mechanics, continuum thermodynamics, and kinetic theory, as they are practiced today in the spirit of the late Clifford Truesdell. The objectives of the symposium are&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (1) highlight recent advances in the three topic areas;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (2) provide the opportunity for communication and collaboration between senior and junior investigators;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (3) educate young researchers and advanced graduate students and expose them to the forefronts of current research; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (4) shape new directions of research among investigators who value an emphasis on foundations, structure, and logical implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "Journal of Elasticity and the Physical Science of Solids" has dedicated a special volume to the papers of the symposium. The publication of a hard-cover book is also planned. Details about the symposium can be found on the web at http://www.ms.uky.edu/~mcsxyh/ctsymp.htm.</AbstractNarration>
