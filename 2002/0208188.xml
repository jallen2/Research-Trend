    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research project builds on the previously demonstrated capability to retrieve O/N2 column density ratios from Far Ultraviolet (FUV) images obtained from the DE 1 satellite and the resulting demonstration of the correlation between large "clouds" of reduced O/N2 and reduced Nmax observed by ground based ionosondes. The proposed research will carry this program forward by making use of additional ionospheric data, specifically, topside soundings obtained from the ISIS 1 and 2 satellites, incoherent scatter radar (ISR) data, and satellite in situ data during 1981 and 1982. By providing topside electron density profiles during negative ionospheric storms, these data will constrain ionospheric and thermospheric models and allow the estimation of neutral density profiles during these events. The ultimate goal of the research program is to improve and enhance the ability to model thermospheric and ionospheric behavior during geomagnetic storms, and to increase the understanding of the impact of geomagnetic storms on the midlatitude thermosphere and ionosphere.</AbstractNarration>
