    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to design molecules to self assemble into one- and two-dimensional supramolecular motifs or aggregates that will serve as scaffolds with which to control three-dimensional structures. Cyclic diamides are targeted as the molecular building blocks . Among those to be studied are 2,5-diketopiperazines, 3,6-dioxo-1,2,4-triazines and 3,6-dioxo-1,2,4,5-tetrazines. The robust one-dimensional `tapes` obtained from these building blocks will then be used as precursors of interesting solid state materials. The educational focus of the project is the integration of supramolecular chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum. With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. G. Tayhas R. Palmore of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis. Professor Palmore will focus her research efforts on understanding how the self assembly of molecules into supramolecular motifs can be used to control solid state structure. Self assembly of nanostructures promises to be one of the most powerful approaches to device miniaturization. The aim of the proposed educational activities is to stimulate interdisciplinary discussion and research in supramolecular chemistry and to integrate supramolecular chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
