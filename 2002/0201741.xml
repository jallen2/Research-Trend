    <AbstractNarration>Although the role of magnesium (Mg2+) in biochemical and physiological processes is more widely appreciated now than it ever was, huge gaps remain in our understanding of normal Mg2+ physiology. Compared to our understanding of the multifarious roles of calcium, our understanding of the molecular, biochemical and physiological roles of Mg2+ are woefully inadequate. For example, Mg2+ concentrations are tightly regulated inside cells, but the mechanism of Mg2+ entry into cells is entirely unknown. No Mg2+-channel has been identified to this date, and the first membrane Mg2+ transporter (channel, carrier, or pump) has yet to be isolated. As to Mg2+ outside cells, Mg2+ concentrations in the blood (plasma) are tightly regulated (like calcium), but a Mg2+ hormone has not been discovered to date. Hence it is important that new, young investigators of magnesium biology are encouraged intellectually and supported financially. This award provides funds to support the travel of 12 young molecular biologists to present posters of their work at the 8th Gordon Conference on Magnesium in Biological Processes and Medicine to be held in Ventura CA from Feb. 3 to Feb. 8, 2002. In view of the promise that molecular biology holds for our understanding of magnesium in basic processes of life (photosynthesis, the stabilization of DNA and proteins, the activation of over 300 cell enzymes), the NSF funds will be earmarked for young investigators who study the basic science of magnesium. The funds will be used to subsidize their travel and/or conference fees at the level of $ 600 each. This new cadre of magnesium investigators will be selected according to three criteria: 1) they must have published a significant paper on the chemistry, physiology, or molecular biology of magnesium in the past 3 years, 2) they must be new to the Magnesium Gordon Research Conference, and 3) they are likely to make a long-term commitment to basic research on the physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology of magnesium. The recruitment and the nurturing of young investigators are particularly appropriate for the Gordon Conferences that focus on the Frontiers of Science.</AbstractNarration>
