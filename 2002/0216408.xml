    <AbstractNarration>Items requested in NSF email of 5/2/02:&lt;br/&gt;Neither this proposal nor a similar one is under review at NSF or any other agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF-MRI Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. Ken Belanger at Colgate University for the development of a fluorescence light microscopy facility to be used for research and undergraduate education. This award will allow the acquisition of four fluorescence light microscopes and accompanying high-resolution digital cameras, as well as a variable temperature, stage-mounted incubation chamber. This instrumentation will be used for faculty and student research projects as well as investigative teaching laboratory exercises in the Biology, Geology, and Neuroscience Departments at both Colgate University and Hamilton College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fluorescence microscopy facility funded by this proposal will initially support six research projects and seven undergraduate laboratory courses, and will be available for use by faculty members and laboratory courses not included in the original proposal. The research projects outlined in this proposal address a broad range of questions across a variety of disciplines, including examination of intracellular protein targeting (Belanger, project 1), Antarctic paleogeology (Leventer, project 2), dopamine-induced neuromodulation (Tierney, project 3), gene expression at temperature extremes (Hoopes, project 4), steroid hormone regulation of neurotransmission (Lehman, project 5), and intracellular signal transmission (Festin, project 6). In addition, the microscopy facility will be used for educational purposes for seven different laboratory courses (project 7), including Cell Biology, Environmental Studies, Genetics, Molecular Analysis, Neurophysiology, and Developmental Biology. Based on current research activities and course enrollments, approximately 30 independent research students and 180 - 200 lab course participants will utilize this microscopy facility annually. Thus, this facility will not only serve to enhance the quality of research performed within this consortium, but will also enhance the educational experience, technological preparedness, and enthusiasm for continued scientific research for a significant number of undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
