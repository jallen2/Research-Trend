    <AbstractNarration>PI: Dmitry Novikov / A. Gabrielov, Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0200861&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%&lt;br/&gt;D. Novikov and A. Gabrielov propose to investigate the global&lt;br/&gt;finiteness properties of solutions of Fuchsian systems of ordinary&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. The goal of this research is to establish&lt;br/&gt;effective upper bounds on the global oscillation of polynomial&lt;br/&gt;combinations of these solutions in terms of quantitative&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of the Fuchsian systems, and to apply these results&lt;br/&gt;to the infinitesimal Hilbert's sixteenth problem. The main interest&lt;br/&gt;is the oscillation of solutions near confluent singular points of&lt;br/&gt;the hypergeometric equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stable oscillations of many natural systems in biology, electronics,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, meteorology, etc., are described by limit cycles in the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding dynamical systems. If the dynamical system is close&lt;br/&gt;to a conservative one, its limit cycles correspond to zeros of&lt;br/&gt;an Abelian integral, a solution of an ordinary differential&lt;br/&gt;equation with polynomial coefficients. Unlike solutions of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic equations, such functions can have many zeros even&lt;br/&gt;when the coefficients are low-degree polynomials. The goal of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research is to give an effective upper bound on the number of&lt;br/&gt;these zeros in terms of the magnitude of the coefficients, and the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding upper bound on the number of limit cycles of the&lt;br/&gt;dynamical system. This can be considered as an effective version&lt;br/&gt;of the famous Hilbert's sixteenth problem.</AbstractNarration>
