    <AbstractNarration>Daniel J. Inman&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0200019&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title "Updating for Model-Based Simulation" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general aim of the research is to develop improved methods of model updating for normal and damped flexible structures. The improvement is expected to be in the algorithms themselves, in the numerical schemes that will realize them, and in tools for evaluating the outcome of the updating method. Specific issues that will be investigated are:&lt;br/&gt; Obtaining a physically meaningful updated model using reference basis model method.&lt;br/&gt; Mode shape correction and order matching.&lt;br/&gt; Deterministic and stochastic sensitivity analysis.&lt;br/&gt; Robust updating and reliability issues.&lt;br/&gt; Method validation and improvement by experiment.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual contribution is twofold. From a theoretical point of view such modification of the reference basis method has a clear scientific merit. Secondly, each one of the indicated issues corresponds to a genuine practical problem facing industries seeking model-based simulation. Solution of these will lead to better modeling and understanding of vibrating systems. To be more specific, it is our belief that the parametric reference basis method is a very promising approach to model updating and with the appropriate tuning it will perform better than any other method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort is expected to impact industry by providing algorithms to provide accurate simulation models, a long-standing problem of importance. Secondly, the proposed effort will improve graduate training of underrepresented groups, involve undergraduates in research and promote the pursuit of academic careers.</AbstractNarration>
