    <AbstractNarration>Under Phase I, BSCS has developed two semesters of instructional materials -- one for grade nine and one for grade ten -- using an assessment-driven development process. Classroom based field trials produced evidence that students had significant gains in student learning across different school settings and different ability groups. BSCS also developed a curriculum framework for materials for grade 6-11 that addresses the National Science Education Standards. Each year students learn fundamental concepts in life, Earth/space and physical science. In addition, in each year, there is a short unit on scientific inquiry and a unit that presents the learner with a new context for applying understandings and integrating the sciences. In this project BSCS completes the research based module development for grades nine and ten, and continues the work for grade eleven, so that the standards for high school science are addressed in a multidisciplinary approach that exposes students to both Earth/space science and physical science to greater depth than traditionally. In addition to the student materials, annotated teacher editions and a teacher resource CDROM are developed. A comprehensive teacher development guide for implementing multidisciplinary science is produced along with comprehensive implementation support for school districts.</AbstractNarration>
