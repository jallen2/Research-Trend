    <AbstractNarration>OBJECTIVES: Virtual environments are increasingly being called upon to advance science learning.&lt;br/&gt;With possibilities for interactive multimedia displays and learner customization, these environments hold&lt;br/&gt;great promise. But are these environments friendly to girls? Computer games, designed by young men for&lt;br/&gt;boys and young men, epitomize technology's exclusion of girls, their interests, and values. Less obvious&lt;br/&gt;but more devastating, this technological estrangement exacerbates girls' lack of interest and self confidence&lt;br/&gt;not just in computers but in science. Technology itself and even the design of technology-enhanced science&lt;br/&gt;experiences may disadvantage girls, turning them away from SMET instead of engaging them. Experts&lt;br/&gt;urge more women and girls to become involved in software and hardware design, to begin to transform&lt;br/&gt;computer culture. The ihInvolving Girls as Designerslg (IGD) project will look at what can happen when&lt;br/&gt;girls design their own technology-enhanced science learning experiences. Do girls and boys approach the&lt;br/&gt;design process differently? If so, what are the characteristics of a girl-friendly design process? Do all-girl&lt;br/&gt;design teams create products that are more appealing to other girls than products designed by all boy&lt;br/&gt;teams? Are gender differences more strongly polarized by the end of middle school, or are they equally&lt;br/&gt;evident even in fifth grade?&lt;br/&gt;METHODS: IGD will invite small teams of girls to experience and critically assess a series of high quality&lt;br/&gt;science-learning experiences diverse in their technology and extent and form of interactivity, ranging from&lt;br/&gt;planetarium show to role play simulated mission to Mars, from CD-ROM games to exploring space science&lt;br/&gt;on the web, television to immersive virtual reality. These young, newly expert technologists will then&lt;br/&gt;design their ideal science learning experience, with the goal of teaching science and inspiring kids to be&lt;br/&gt;interested in SMET. IGD will profile girl reactions to the diverse forms of science learning. The design&lt;br/&gt;process and design outcomes of the all-girl design teams will be analyzed and compared to all-boy teams.&lt;br/&gt;IGD will compare fifth grade girls (whose enthusiasm for science parallels boys) with eighth grade girls&lt;br/&gt;(whose enthusiasm and self confidence in science has declined), looking for similarities and differences in&lt;br/&gt;technology attitudes, design process, and design outcomes. Professional software developers will create&lt;br/&gt;visualizations of each team's prototype. With no indication of the gender of the designers, each set of&lt;br/&gt;visualizations will be shown to same-age students to discover whether boys and girls prefer prototypes&lt;br/&gt;developed by their own gender.&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: IGD will test the assertion that involving girls as designers can impact&lt;br/&gt;design process and product and describe gender and age differences. IGD will contribute concrete&lt;br/&gt;understanding of girls' attitudes toward diverse forms of technology-enhanced science learning.&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: IGD could provide compelling evidence to software developers about the critical&lt;br/&gt;importance of involving girls as designers and ways of enabling girl-friendly design processes. IGC could&lt;br/&gt;provide guidance to teachers and curriculum designers about choosing among technology-enhanced science&lt;br/&gt;learning experiences. The PIs teach graduate design research classes (in education and digital media&lt;br/&gt;design). They will involve their students in the research and integrate findings into their courses. New&lt;br/&gt;understanding about girl-friendly science education designs will be incorporated into the Mars Pioneer&lt;br/&gt;Learning Adventures initiative and into the overall Comm Tech Lab software design process and College&lt;br/&gt;of Education and Digital Media Arts curricula.</AbstractNarration>
