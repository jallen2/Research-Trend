    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will perform research aimed at&lt;br/&gt;characterizing subsurface residual stresses induced through surface treatments in single&lt;br/&gt;crystal and complex polycrystalline materials. Photon Induced Positron Annihilation&lt;br/&gt;(PIPA) will be used to quantify subsurface residual stress in single crystal materials and operational components subjected to high stress/high temperature environments. PIPA as a nondestructive material characterization technology has the potential to provide quantifiable, empirical data on atomic level, lattice structure changes in advanced metallic/intermetallic alloys used for critical component applications that result in failure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, government and industry spend billions of dollars each year in the maintenance and repair of components and systems. Many of the maintenance procedures are based upon conservative engineering models instead of actual empirical data, leading to early replacement of components, accelerated maintenance cycles, and a reactive versus proactive approach to failure mechanisms. PIPA provides real-time, empirical information on material characterization, redefining conservative prediction models and supplying decision makers with the hard data to evaluate materials and components for extension or replacement considerations, based upon the actual assessment of material damage.</AbstractNarration>
