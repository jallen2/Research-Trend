    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. John Gatesy at the University of California, Riverside to study the evolution of reproductive protein genes in mammals. Recently, "reproductive proteins" that are important for fertilization have been characterized in several mammalian species. Preliminary studies suggest that many of these proteins, both egg and sperm-specific, have evolved at a rapid rate. In this proposed research, modern molecular techniques will be used to survey reproductive protein gene sequences from several species of even-toed hoofed mammals. These data will be used to better characterize the pattern of molecular evolution in mammalian reproductive proteins, to determine which regions of these molecules are prone to mutation, and to test whether reproductive proteins are useful for reconstructing the evolutionary history of mammals.&lt;br/&gt; Dr. Gatesy will mentor teams of undergraduate students at the University of California, Riverside within the context of this multidisciplinary project. In addition to getting first-hand experience in a wet lab, the students will integrate their laboratory work with library research and computer analysis. The combined research group will produce basic data that are relevant to diverse biological sub-disciplines by exploring reproduction, a foundation of evolutionary biology, at the genetic level. A detailed understanding of reproductive proteins also is important for studies of human fertility and infertility. Some of the species utilized in this study (cow, sheep, goat) are standard model organisms for fertility research. Comparative analyses of reproductive molecules from these species and close relatives will facilitate experimental research on reproduction.</AbstractNarration>
