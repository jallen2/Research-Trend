    <AbstractNarration>0229657&lt;br/&gt;Shen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a five-year proposal submitted by Dr. Hung Tao Shen, Clarkson University, to support continual funding for the REU site on Marine Science and Engineering, in collaboration with Ocean University of Qingdao and Dalian University of Technology in China. The East Asia and Pacific Program first funded this REU site program in China in 2000. This program has been well received by student participants. Many participants indicated that this program has contributed to their selection of marine science or engineering as a career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an important part of activities to encourage American Workforce and Research and Education (AWARE) Experience in East Asia. This program has enabled U.S. students to gain research experience and interest in China, and developed their capabilities to participate in international scientific and engineering activities. This program also enable the Chinese participants, including mentors, graduate students, and undergraduates, to gain the experience of working with future U.S. scientists and engineers. The results of this program can enhance our mutual understanding of research environments and educational systems, and improve science teaching and learning in the U.S. and China.</AbstractNarration>
