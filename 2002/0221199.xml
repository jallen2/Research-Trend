    <AbstractNarration>0221199&lt;br/&gt;Werner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This recommendation for an award is being made as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER). This is a collaborative proposal among Principal Investigators at the Universities of Massachusetts and Illinois at Chicago, Bates College, and Mt. Holyoke College. The Principal Investigators will determine the feasibility of establishing an Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Svalbard that focuses on studying modern physical processes and proxy records of Holocene environmental change in glacial, lacustrine, fjord, and near shore marine environments. Svalbard is an important location for understanding climate and geophysical feedbacks on global scales where, in the 20th century, there have been profound reductions in sea ice and retreating glacier margins associated with atmospheric warming. Proxy records indicate that Svalbard experienced significant climatic fluctuations during the Late Holocene, culminating with the Little Ice Age at the end of the 19th century. This area should offer excellent opportunities for marine and terrestrial paleoenvironmental research to understand the ocean/atmosphere system on a variety of spatial and temporal timescales due to its excellent record of Late Holocene climate. There are currently no REU Sites in the Arctic that focus on Late Holocene environmental change. The Principal Investigators anticipate that students will participate in modules or projects at several sites and that the projects undertaken will become senior thesis projects during the subsequent academic year. They will conduct an annual symposium where the students will present their research results. An important goal is to inspire a diverse group of undergraduate students (especially women, underrepresented minorities, and if possible, persons with disabilities) to the rewards and challenges of conducting climate change research in the Arctic.</AbstractNarration>
