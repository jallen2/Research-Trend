    <AbstractNarration>Migratory birds are widely recognized as superb animal athletes. When flying, birds exercise at twice the maximum rate of oxygen consumption attained by running mammals, and migrants can maintain this high intensity exercise for three or more days without water, food or rest. Most notably, birds are able to use stored fat as the primary metabolic fuel for migratory flight - a capacity unexplained by models of fuel selection developed in running mammals. Extensive study of mammals shows that fatty acids stored in adipose tissue should contribute minimally (10 %) to exercise as intense as flight, suggesting that birds must have a much enhanced ability to utilize lipids. In spite of its many interesting characteristics, surprisingly little is known about avian exercise physiology because of the technical difficulties of conducting physiological studies of birds in flight. The immediate objectives of this research are: (1) to determine the surgical techniques and experimental protocols necessary to apply constant tracer infusion and indirect calorimetry to birds flying under controlled conditions in a wind tunnel, and (2) to make the first direct, real-time measurements of fuel substrate (e.g. glucose and fatty acids) utilization during endurance flight. Over the long term, this new experimental system will be used by the investigator to study how factors like diet nutrient composition, obesity and migratory season affect fuel selection in various bird species. Ruff sandpipers (Philomachus pugnatus) will be trained to fly continuously for up to four hours in a wind tunnel while fitted with a respirometry mask to measure oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Minute quantities of isotopically labelled tracers (e.g. glucose or fatty acids) will be infused through a catheter into the circulation at a known rate. Blood will be sampled periodically through a second catheter and expired carbon dioxide samples will be collected. Metabolic fuel transport and oxidation will be calculated from the rate of tracer infusion, the relative concentration of labelled substrate in the blood and the rate of production of isotopically labelled carbon dioxide. Successful completion of this study will mark a major advance in the basic understanding of avian exercise physiology. Equally important, this research will catalyze a wide variety of future investigations by the development of a new experimental model. Physiologists will for the first time be able to study processes like fuel metabolism, kidney function and gas exchange during flight, and to infuse hormones and pharmacological agents to examine the metabolic regulation of exercise in birds. Birds have a nearly unparalleled ability among vertebrates to metabolize fats and they may provide insight into human obesity and its treatment.</AbstractNarration>
