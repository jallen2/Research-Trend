    <AbstractNarration>This research program targets the design, preparation and characterization of novel conductive polymer / cuprate superconductor nano-composite assemblies. These hybrid structures will be generated in such a manner that the electrical communication between the two component conductors is maximized with the goal of fostering the flow of supercurrent into the polymer over macroscopically large distances. Novel low temperature transport measurements completed with superconductor / polymer / superconductor nano-bridges will allow for the exploration of the low temperature electron-transfer phenomena and proximity effects that occur in such hybrid systems. This new program will target experiments in the following four areas: a) molecular engineering of conductive polymer compounds for cryogenic applications; b) direct observation of polymeric proximity effects using scanning probe methods; c) supercurrent flow through polymer / superconductor nano-bridges; and d) suppression of superconductivity in conductive polymer coated ultra-thin high-Tc films. Through this highly interdisciplinary program, a series of scientists will be trained in the important emerging area of hybrid electronic materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of electronically conductive polymers into functional superconductor-based structures is leading to a variety of new sensors and devices which may exhibit enhanced sensitivity and selectivity that is not currently available with the conventional devices. This interdisciplinary program targets the preparation and characterization of a new class of conductive polymer / high-Tc superconductor nano-composite assemblies. In addition to the important knowledge base that will be derived from these studies, it should be emphasized that this program possesses an important educational component. Indeed, through this highly interdisciplinary program a series of scientists will be trained in the important emerging area of hybrid electronic materials with enhanced processibility, molecular tunability and interesting sensor / display capabilities available with such polymeric compounds.</AbstractNarration>
