    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0200241&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael Lacey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted on several aspects of phase plane&lt;br/&gt;analysis. The specific questions come from three different &lt;br/&gt;areas. One is to study a conjecture of E.M. Stein on a certain &lt;br/&gt;extension of Carleson's theorem. This conjecture seeks to place&lt;br/&gt;Carleson in a larger context. Consider this theorem as a &lt;br/&gt;supremum over all linear choices of phase functions. &lt;br/&gt;Stein's conjecture concerns a supremum over all polynomial &lt;br/&gt;choices of phase functions, with however the degree of the &lt;br/&gt;polynomial fixed. Advances on this question already suggest&lt;br/&gt;that it might be fruitful to consider certain discrete &lt;br/&gt;analogues of Carleson's theorem. Here, arithmetic aspects &lt;br/&gt;of Number Theory, as exemplified by the Hardy-Littlewood &lt;br/&gt;Circle Method should predominate. A third area is&lt;br/&gt;continued investigation into the question of the boundedness &lt;br/&gt;of the Hilbert transform on smooth families of lines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These investigations seek to deepen our understanding of &lt;br/&gt;phase plane analysis: The study of functions in the temporal &lt;br/&gt;and oscillatory variables simultaneously. Past successes &lt;br/&gt;in this area have lead to a broadening of the synthetic &lt;br/&gt;and analytic techniques that can be brought to bear on a &lt;br/&gt;wide range of questions. This is especially true for the&lt;br/&gt;bilinear Hilbert transform and Carleson's theorem. These &lt;br/&gt;new questions are far more subtle than those addressed in &lt;br/&gt;the past, and so the new techniques that we seek to develop&lt;br/&gt;are hoped to be more powerful than previous ones.</AbstractNarration>
