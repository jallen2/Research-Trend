    <AbstractNarration>Nanoparticles are among the most important nanomaterials in nanoscience and nanoengineering. Innovative applications of these nanoparticles in an engineering system such as nanosphere-enhanced photolithography are emerging. However, little is known about the physics of the process, especially the optical and thermal transport issues involving extremely small length and time scales. This project will offer comprehensive investigations on the laser-nanosphere interaction process by a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical simulation, including ultrafast laser interaction with the nanospheres resting on a solid substrate, conduction and radiative heat transfer between the nanopsheres and the substrate, as well as surface nanostructuring as a result of the nanoscale optical interaction and heat transfer. From this research, a practical nanolithography tool will be developed for massively parallel nanomanufacturing of a variety of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project will make a significant impact on the interdisciplinary field of nanoscale thermal transport, nanooptics, and nanomanufacturing. Moreover, the results of this work will provide exciting teaching materials and interesting lab projects for undergraduates, graduate students, and K-12 students and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award has been funded jointly by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division and by the Nanomanufacturing Program of the Division of Design, Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation.</AbstractNarration>
