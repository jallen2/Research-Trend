    <AbstractNarration>0203544&lt;br/&gt;Hynes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-UK cooperative research in atmospheric chemistry involves Anthony J. Hynes and his students at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and Michael J. Pilling at the University of Leeds' School of Chemistry. The project will focus on the role of complex intermediates in reactions of the hyroxyl radical (OH) in the atmosphere. The objective is to use theory to examine important OH reactions in the atmosphere and use the results to guide experimental procedures. Chemical reactions of OH and NO2 to form nitric acid will be studied along with the role of intermediates in recombination and impact in the troposphere and stratosphere. These reactions are of importance to understanding ozone production and causes of air pollution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each group brings unique complementary expertise to the project. The US investigator is an experimentalist and the British are expert theorists in atmospheric chemical kinetics. The project will advance doctoral research of US students and provide research training in an international environment.</AbstractNarration>
