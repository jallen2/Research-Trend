    <AbstractNarration>Laci Jalics, Delphi Research Labs&lt;br/&gt;Giorgio Rizzoni, The Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;Andrea Serrani, The Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;Ahmed Soliman, The Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hierarchical, Modular Fault Diagnosis in Complex Systems&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this GOALI project program are: 1) to develop a methodology that permits the design of modular, hierarchical, model-based diagnostic algorithms that can result in re-usable software modules, and that can be methodically organized into a complete, self-contained monitoring system; and 2) to demonstrate the methodology in collaboration with an industry partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fault tolerance is a critical element in complex automotive systems because of the introduction of "by-wire" systems in vehicles. "by-wire" systems generate electrical commands through driver input and transfer them to the computer-controlled electro-mechanical actuators. With respect to traditional systems, "by-wire" systems require complex control and diagnostic strategies to guarantee proper vehicle behavior and to prevent system malfunctions. A significant roadblock for safety-critical by-wire systems is the realization of a robust fault-diagnostic strategy that can be accomplished quickly and with limited or no additional hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these issues in three stages: 1) through the use of physically based system models to understand interactions and dependencies among subsystems in a complex system; 2) with the design of residual generator units that can locally diagnose faults in components, sensors and actuators; and 3) using a hierarchical structure that links components, systems, and subsystems through the use of fault propagation digraphs. The fault propagation digraph contains a hierarchical representation of available knowledge about the characteristics of fault propagation within the system. Each level in the hierarchy contains one or more structures that together represent a view of the system under a particular granularity. The granularity of view increases with levels. Thus as one traverses down the levels of the model, the resolution of view increases. If a high resolution of diagnosis is not required, failure analysis may be confined to the upper levels of the hierarchy, thereby preventing a slowdown of the diagnosis due to excessive detail.</AbstractNarration>
