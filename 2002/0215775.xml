    <AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. Robert A. Kurt at Lafayette College to purchase a Confocal Microscopy System. The confocal system is capable of three-color fluorescent imaging and three-dimensional cellular analysis. Consequently, three different proteins can be analyzed with respect to each other and their location within a cell. This is ideal for studying protein-protein or cell-cell interactions and to discern the potential function of recently identified proteins. With the acquisition of this instrument many exciting projects can be carried out. The Confocal Microscopy System will enable Lafayette faculty to modify and enhance courses to include training in sophisticated research techniques, expand the areas of research for both students and faculty, and finally contribute to the advancement of knowledge within the field of biological science by exploring molecular and cellular interactions as they occur within living cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects to be performed with this instrument will focus on a variety of biological sciences including cellular, molecular, developmental biology and immunology. Some of the projects supported in this proposal include an examination of the molecular organization of G protein coupled receptors and associated molecules during T cell migration. For this project proteins utilized by T cells for migration will be labeled so that protein-protein interactions can be investigated as the T cells respond to chemokines. The chemokine receptor signaling cascade in T cells is poorly defined, thus this project should uncover some of the basic steps utilized for T-cell migration. Another project that will be carried out with the microscope will be an examination of the cross-regulation between T cell and chemokine receptor signaling pathways. This project will examine the interactions between proteins utilized by both the TCR and chemokine receptor signaling pathways in order to understand how these different pathways influence each other. Neural development and communication in Drosophila melanogaster is another area of research and training that will be enhanced with the confocal microscopy system. In particular the instrument will aid in the studies of bang-sensitive mutants. One project will investigate the effects of these mutants on mitochondria and their function. Another set of experiments is to examine the ability of third instar larvae of bang-sensitive mitochondria to maintain their electrochemical gradient. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposal is that these projects will be carried out by undergraduate students and as a result facilitate the research, research training and education of students for careers in science. Some of the research training activities in the Department of Biology at Lafayette College include Independent Study, Honors Thesis, the Excel Scholar Program, and research-oriented courses such as Electron Microscopy and Tissue Culture courses. Thus, the Confocal Microscopy System will be utilized to further strengthen the curriculum and research in Biological Sciences at Lafayette College. The Biology Department has a long history of encouraging student participation in research. By graduation many majors have had at least two semesters of extensive research experience. Often, this in depth exposure to research fuels a desire to pursue post-graduate study. Additionally, several courses will be modified to include training in specimen preparation and analysis with confocal fluorescence microscopy. Consequently, it is anticipated that there will be three faculty members and approximately fifty students each year that will use the instrument.</AbstractNarration>
