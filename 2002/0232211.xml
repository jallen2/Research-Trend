    <AbstractNarration>EDUCAUSE has recently been asked by the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO) of the federal government to coordinate the contributions of the higher education community to the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. This report, scheduled to be delivered from the Critical Infrastructure Protection Board to the President of the United States this summer, will examine the following: government's role, private sector contributions, whether or not legislation is needed, and the impact of improved security education. The activities in this proposal will make a direct contribution toward this important national effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and education community faces a pressing need for effective and efficient&lt;br/&gt;strategies for securing its networked computers. The security of college and university&lt;br/&gt;computer systems has become a matter of critical importance for higher education and the greater Internet community. In one well-known example, vulnerable systems on campus networks have been implicated as unknowing participants in a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack on critical government and commercial Internet sites. College and university computer systems have also been the target of attacks, exposing confidential medical and student records. A comprehensive and systematic cybersecurity strategy is needed in the higher education community, including an executive-level appreciation for the critical importance of this problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a need for a coordinated approach on two fronts: (1) the examination and&lt;br/&gt;identification of best practices regarding available technologies, policies, and procedures to support secure operations, and (2) publications, presentations, and other communication methods to disseminate these best practices throughout the research and&lt;br/&gt;education community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish these tasks, EDUCAUSE will bring together the leading experts in both&lt;br/&gt;technology and higher education business practices and policies to develop the best&lt;br/&gt;practical approach to solving these problems in the higher education community. EDUCAUSE will distribute the best practices though extensive national and regional meetings,publications for IT staff as well as higher education executives, web libraries, and through partner organizations such as the American Council on Education (ACE), the&lt;br/&gt;National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), and the&lt;br/&gt;National Association of College and University Attorneys (NACUA). This proposed effort will build on previous work by the EDUCAUSE/Internet2 Security Taskforce, member institutions, SANS, and CERT and would seek to incorporate the best efforts of the federal government and private industry.</AbstractNarration>
