    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Michael Whiting and Mr. Matthew Terry at&lt;br/&gt;Brigham Young University to study the relationships among a group of insects known as Polyneoptera. This large group includes many commonly known insects with substantial economic impact such as termites, preying mantises, cockroaches, stick insects, grasshoppers, stoneflies and earwigs; and lesser known orders including webspinners, rock crawlers and angel insects. Most of these insects have representatives from every region of the earth and exemplars representing the diversity of each group will be examined. This study will concentrate on generating DNA sequence data from multiple genes for each group using state of the art methods such as polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and automated sequencing, but will also incorporate data based on a morphological analysis of each group.&lt;br/&gt; This work will provide a context for the evaluation of a wide range of biological, behavioral and developmental data, both within and between the groups mentioned above. One example of this is the development of sub-social and social behavior in cockroaches and termites; two groups that preliminary analyses indicate to be closely related to one another. The study will also provide a foundation for future researchers to address a host of questions that deal both directly and indirectly with this fascinating group of insects.</AbstractNarration>
