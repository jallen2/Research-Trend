    <AbstractNarration>This NSF project seeks to make measurements of nucleon structure&lt;br/&gt;using polarized gamma rays and polarized nucleons. The polarized&lt;br/&gt;gamma rays are created at LEGS by back scattering polarized laser&lt;br/&gt;light from the high energy electrons circulating in the storage ring&lt;br/&gt;of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory. In back scattering the polarization is unchanged. By&lt;br/&gt;detecting the scattered electron, the gamma ray energy is "tagged",&lt;br/&gt;and measurements at all energies can be made simultaneously. The&lt;br/&gt;polarized nucleons come from producing targets of frozen HD in a&lt;br/&gt;high magnetic field. Polarized H, D or both can be produced in&lt;br/&gt;targets of a size suitable for nuclear physics experiments and with&lt;br/&gt;relaxation times of two weeks in the case of H and longer for D. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These double polarization experiments allow measurements of&lt;br/&gt;pion-photo-production amplitudes that have not been previously&lt;br/&gt;measured. Such are important to completely describe the&lt;br/&gt;gamma-nucleon interaction. The difference in the absorption cross&lt;br/&gt;sections for gamma and nucleon spins parallel and anti-parallel are&lt;br/&gt;sensitive to the spin structure of the nucleon. We will be able to&lt;br/&gt;test the major part of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn Sum Rule and make&lt;br/&gt;direct determinations of nucleon spin polarizabilities. Due to the&lt;br/&gt;large energy range required to test the sum rule no single&lt;br/&gt;laboratory can accomplish the task. However, as the gamma energies&lt;br/&gt;in the LEGS case range from photo-production threshold to beyond the&lt;br/&gt;delta resonance, the major region of sensitivity is covered.</AbstractNarration>
