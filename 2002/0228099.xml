    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0228099&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Grigg, Neil&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Colorado State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Information technology in the integrated civil engineering curriculum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is to plan for integration of next generation information technology into the &lt;br/&gt;civil engineering curriculum at the department level. The rationale is that civil engineers &lt;br/&gt;have lead roles in infrastructure and environmental systems, and the power of &lt;br/&gt;information technology can be used in design, construction, and operations to relieve &lt;br/&gt;problems of traffic congestion, infrastructure integrity, construction productivity, &lt;br/&gt;environmental monitoring, systems security and other sectors of civil society. To address &lt;br/&gt;this rapidly changing field requires new thinking about the curriculum. Old curriculum &lt;br/&gt;organization, consisting of loosely connected subjects, will not provide the integration &lt;br/&gt;needed for expanding applications of information technology across civil society sectors. &lt;br/&gt;Twenty-first century problems require integration of new technologies and new &lt;br/&gt;approaches to the organization of engineering work, shaped by information technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early application of information technology in engineering education focused on &lt;br/&gt;computer programming, but only a few civil engineers engage in much programming. &lt;br/&gt;Most use software to apply wide bands of technology to problems with highly dispersed &lt;br/&gt;spatial, technological, and social dimensions. Teaching civil engineers how to apply the &lt;br/&gt;methods that underlie the software is a main goal of the integrated curriculum at &lt;br/&gt;Colorado State.</AbstractNarration>
