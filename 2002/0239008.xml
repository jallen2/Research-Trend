    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on developing nanocrystalline soft ferromagnetic materials for various end use applications such as Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) suppression, magnetic bearings and inductors. Phase I clearly established the feasibility of producing these materials via a patented microwave plasma technique. In addition, these nanomaterials were consolidated to near theoretical densities using a patented plasma pressure compaction technique and the compacts exhibited high magnetic strength and low coercivity. During Phase II, the process will be to develop these materials for specific applications. Our Industrial partners will evaluate the produced materials to evaluate parameters, which are critical for transitioning the technology to an immediate useful product. In addition, an IP protection and various avenues to commercialize the&lt;br/&gt;technology will be sought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are numerous applications for nanocrystalline soft magnetic materials with superior magnetic and mechanical properties and low core loss. This includes EMI prevention components, generators, transformers, data communication interface component, magnetic bearings (commercial high-performance applications in the domain of rotating machinery), magnetic recording heads, motors, sensors, and reactors. MMI plans to focus on three market segments including (1) EMI suppression (2) Magnetic Bearings and (3) Inductors.</AbstractNarration>
