    <AbstractNarration>Genetics is a fundamental unifying theme of biology. The Human Genome Project and&lt;br/&gt;advances in genetics and biotechnology are revolutionizing biology, medicine and industry.&lt;br/&gt;However, genetics is an intimidating challenge for college students across the full range of post-&lt;br/&gt;secondary institutions and the growing demand for genetics education outstrips the supply of&lt;br/&gt;qualified teachers.&lt;br/&gt;We are developing a genetics cognitive tutor to support active problem-based&lt;br/&gt;learning in undergraduate genetics courses and make genetics accessible to more students.&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive tutors are an educational technology that speeds learning and yields large achievement&lt;br/&gt;gains compared to conventional instruction by providing students "just-in-time" problem-solving&lt;br/&gt;help. Cognitive Tutor mathematics courses are currently in use by more than 125,000 students in&lt;br/&gt;over 700 middle and high schools. The genetics cognitive tutor is building on past successes in&lt;br/&gt;tutoring quantitative reasoning and using the cognitive tutoring technology in novel realms of&lt;br/&gt;scientific inference and experimental design.&lt;br/&gt;We are pilot testing and evaluating cognitive tutor lessons in six universities representing a&lt;br/&gt;diverse student population, and including large public universities, private research universities, a&lt;br/&gt;small liberal arts university and an historically black university. Pilot testing includes formative&lt;br/&gt;evaluations of tutor effectiveness and student learning rates. Summative evaluations of&lt;br/&gt;achievement outcomes are being conducted by Carnegie Mellon's Office of Technology for&lt;br/&gt;Education and Eberly Teaching Center. Cognitive tutor dissemination activities are focusing on&lt;br/&gt;summer workshops and conference workshops, and are facilitated by a project advisory&lt;br/&gt;board and Carnegie Mellon's Office of Innovation Transfer.</AbstractNarration>
