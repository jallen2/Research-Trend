    <AbstractNarration>0204390&lt;br/&gt;Krener&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for research on several promising new approaches to &lt;br/&gt;designing an observer for a nonlinear control system, including &lt;br/&gt;linearization of the state error dynamics, backstepping and multiple &lt;br/&gt;extended Kalman filters. In order to decide which type of observer is &lt;br/&gt;appropriate for a given nonlinear system, one needs a classification of the &lt;br/&gt;range of possibilities. Therefore a study of the normal forms of a nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;system under a group action that is appropriate to observer design is also &lt;br/&gt;proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A control system is a mathematical model of a real world process. It has &lt;br/&gt;inputs and outputs which model the way the way the system interacts with &lt;br/&gt;the external world and has state variables, which describe the internal &lt;br/&gt;memory of the system. The state evolves according to some dynamical &lt;br/&gt;model driven by the inputs and the output is some function of the state and &lt;br/&gt;possibly the input. The fundamental problem of control systems is to &lt;br/&gt;close the loop in such a way as to achieve stability. We wish to use &lt;br/&gt;negative feedback based on the current state to stabilize the system to &lt;br/&gt;some desirable operating regime. But usually the current state is not &lt;br/&gt;directly measurable so we must design an observer to estimate it from the &lt;br/&gt;past inputs and outputs. The development of nonlinear observer design &lt;br/&gt;methodologies is a paramount problem of systems theory and its &lt;br/&gt;applications. There is no current approach that is effective for all &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear systems.</AbstractNarration>
