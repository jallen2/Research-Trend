    <AbstractNarration>North Carolina Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation - Phase III&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The North Carolina Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NC-LSAMP) requests&lt;br/&gt;support for continuingits efforts during Phase III. The LS-NCAMP Alliance includes eight&lt;br/&gt;partner institutions - North Carolina A&amp;T State University (lead institution), Fayetteville&lt;br/&gt;State University, North Carolina Central University, North Carolina State University,&lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Charlotte, &lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina - Pembroke, and Winston Salem State University. The&lt;br/&gt;Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at North Carolina A&amp;T State University&lt;br/&gt;will lead the project with assistance from key administrators at all Alliance institutions. &lt;br/&gt;This will ensure the effective institutionalization of the strategies proposed here. The &lt;br/&gt;work proposed caps a decade long series of activities aimed primarily at increasing &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate degree production in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology &lt;br/&gt;(SMET). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underrepresented minorities comprise 30 percent of the college-age population &lt;br/&gt;but they represent only 11 percent of the baccalaureate engineering graduates resulting &lt;br/&gt;in a "parity gap" of 19 percent. The parity gap is even more pronounced at the master's&lt;br/&gt;and doctoral level. Clearly, more needs to be done to reduce this parity gap, more out of&lt;br/&gt;economic necessity and to meet global competitive pressures than any other reason. &lt;br/&gt;The efforts outlined in this proposal are aimed at meeting this challenge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities proposed in this proposal are driven by the need to increase substantially &lt;br/&gt;the number of underrepresented minorities who will contribute significantly in science,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, engineering and technology areas. While the baccalaureate degree programs &lt;br/&gt;will receive continued attention, special emphasis will be placed on amplifying the flow &lt;br/&gt;of minority students in the graduate and research pipeline. The primary goals of the&lt;br/&gt;proposal are (i) to increase the pool of competent underrepresented SMET graduates &lt;br/&gt;with bachelor's degrees (specific objectives include increasing the number of SMET &lt;br/&gt;graduates from bachelor's degree programs by 10% from allAlliance partner schools by&lt;br/&gt;2007 and increasing the quality of SMET bachelors degree graduates from all alliance&lt;br/&gt;partner schools based on their performance in college courses and national examinations&lt;br/&gt;by 50% by 2007) and (ii) to increase the number of students who matriculate into SMET &lt;br/&gt;graduate schools (specific objectives include increasing the number of SMET students&lt;br/&gt;who express an interest in graduate studies by 100% by 2007, increasing by 100%, the&lt;br/&gt;number of SMET graduates who are academically qualified for admission to graduate &lt;br/&gt;programs by 2007, increasing the number of SMET graduates from alliance partner&lt;br/&gt;institutions who are enrolled in graduate SMET programs by 100% by 2007, and increasing &lt;br/&gt;the retention rate by 10% of underrepresented students in graduate SMET programs). &lt;br/&gt;An additional goal of the project is to identify significant factors that promote &lt;br/&gt;baccalaureatedegree attainment, retention in academic programs and entry into graduate &lt;br/&gt;school in SMET areas (specific objectives are to identify significant factors that promote &lt;br/&gt;and hinder retention of minority students enrolled in SMETbaccalaureate degree programs, &lt;br/&gt;and to identify significant factors that promote and hinder entry of minority&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students into graduate SMET degree programs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategies for accomplishing project goals are based on published techniques that have &lt;br/&gt;proven successful in smaller samples. Specifically, the approaches to be employed include&lt;br/&gt;focused recruitment from school; bridge programs to manage the school-college transition;&lt;br/&gt;supplemental instruction, cohort scheduling and workshops for undergraduate students &lt;br/&gt;during the first year to enhance retention and preparation for upper-class coursework; &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research and professional development workshops aimed at motivating and&lt;br/&gt;preparing students for graduate study; and the development of networking and mentoring &lt;br/&gt;systems to improve retention in the first year in graduate school. A key emphasis during&lt;br/&gt;Phase III will be Alliance-wide institutionalization of proven strategies that have been&lt;br/&gt;known to improve the success rates of students in SMET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alliance partners together awarded over a thousand degrees and currently enroll over &lt;br/&gt;six thousand undergraduate minority students in SMET programs. In addition to students &lt;br/&gt;in the Alliance, dissemination activities under this proposal have the potential to impact&lt;br/&gt; several thousand students each year.</AbstractNarration>
