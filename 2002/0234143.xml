    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for the formation of the Environmental Signaling Network (Enviro Signal Net), an interactive network of scientists in the new, interdisciplinary field of environmental endocrine science, the integrated study of the interactions of endocrine signaling systems found in our natural and synthetic environment across many phyla including microbes, plants, invertebrate and vertebrate (amphibians, birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals) animals. This project will probe the mechanisms for environmental signal communication from the molecular to the population levels. The Enviro Signal Net will operate via interconnected fellowship, workshop, symposia, laboratory, and web-based activities to develop an environmental signaling knowledge base. A priority for the Net is to foster diversity in ethnicity, age, gender, and scientific discipline among all the investigators as well as to provide effective mentoring for young investigators. State of the art techniques in web based communication and collaboration will facilitate the global reach of the project. The resulting "laboratory without walls" will be an interactive forum in which new investigators are recruited and trained; collaborative research is fostered; a web-based workbook on environmental signaling is generated; and an interdisciplinary field is advanced.</AbstractNarration>
