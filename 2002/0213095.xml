    <AbstractNarration>The amount of investment that females place in their offspring (maternal investment), whether it is behavioral (such as protection from predators) or material (such as milk), must be balanced against future efforts at reproducing. Understanding how females of different species balance current and future investment in offspring provides insight on the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies. In mammals, quantifying maternal investment can be difficult. This occurs for several reasons: 1) it is difficult to assign value to maternal behaviors; 2) offspring may stay with their mothers for many years making observation periods unrealistically long; and, 3) the material directly transferred from mother to offspring through gestation and lactation may be hard to determine. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) provide a unique system within which to study maternal investment. The investment period for elephant seals is limited to the period of lactation. This period is brief (~ 25 days) and almost all investment is given in the form of milk making it more feasible to quantify maternal investment. Furthermore, elephant seal females do not eat or drink during lactation. This combination of fasting and lactation constrains the ability of females to invest in their pups because the nutrients (fat and protein) used to meet their own energy needs are also used to produce milk for the pup. Material and energy investment in elephant seal pups has been previously determined but its relationship to the energetic costs of the mother has not been characterized. The study proposed here will investigate how lactating elephant seals utilize nutrient reserves to support their metabolism, identify and quantify physiological mechanisms that protect maternal nutrients for milk production, and characterize the strategy for nutrient use that contributes to maximizing investment in pups. Isotopically labeled compounds will be used to study biochemical paths important to supplying energy to lactating female seals. Specifically, changes in the importance of glucose and fat as fuel sources over the time course of lactation will be estimated and the contribution of glycerol, a byproduct of fat breakdown, to the production of glucose (gluconeogenesis) will be determined. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones important in regulating how the body uses sugar and fat, will be manipulated to determine whether these hormones interact in a manner unique to this system. This information will provide insight on how elephant seals optimize investment in their offspring under fasting constraints, and thus, will provide insight on ultimate strategies that contribute to future reproductive effort. As part of the NSF-RUI initiative, undergraduates will be actively involved in field research and data analysis. A graduate student, who will derive a research question for a thesis from the proposed work, will also be financially supported through this program. Integration of undergraduate and graduate students into the research will insure that students experience an innovative and dynamic curriculum with an emphasis on integrative approaches to organismal biology.</AbstractNarration>
