    <AbstractNarration>This is a proposal for fundamental research in mathematical physics and applied mathematics fo-&lt;br/&gt;cused on the challenges presented by the incompressible Navier-Stokes and related equations of&lt;br/&gt;uid mechanics. The Navier-Stokes equations constitute the basic mathematical model of uid&lt;br/&gt;ow, and are believed to contain turbulent dynamics among their solutions. Turbulence in uid&lt;br/&gt;mechanics remains one of the outstanding challenges for theoretical physics and applied mathe-&lt;br/&gt;matics with important applications in, and implications for, many areas in the physical sciences&lt;br/&gt;and engineering. The work in this project will be carried out via modern applied analysis and&lt;br/&gt;numerical computation and simulation by the principal investigator (PI), Prof. Charles R. Doering&lt;br/&gt;of the University of Michigan, and graduate students performing doctoral dissertation work. This&lt;br/&gt;project has three specific objectives:&lt;br/&gt;For one, a mathematical technique for deriving rigorous bounds on turbulent dissipation and&lt;br/&gt;drag, which has come to be known as the \background method," will be developed and expanded&lt;br/&gt;to new areas including magnetohydrodynamics, drag-reducing polymer ows, and ows over rough&lt;br/&gt;boundaries. The background method was introduced by the PI and his collaborator a decade ago&lt;br/&gt;for the Navier-Stokes equations, and since then it has been developed and applied by the PI, his&lt;br/&gt;students, and many other researchers to a number of fundamental shear ow and thermal convection&lt;br/&gt;problems. One particular goal of this project will be to explore applications to a wider variety of&lt;br/&gt;problems of scientific interest.&lt;br/&gt;Another focus of this project is to continue the ongoing investigation of theoretical and mathe-&lt;br/&gt;matical issues in the analysis of thermal convection models where the background method is capable&lt;br/&gt;of putting limits on the heat transfer rate. Problems of concern here include laminar and turbulent&lt;br/&gt;convection with free-slip boundaries, xed-ux convection, ows driven by internal heating, and&lt;br/&gt;infinite Prandtl number models inspired by applications in geophysics.&lt;br/&gt;In a third direction of research, power consumption and enstrophy generation will be studied&lt;br/&gt;for forced ows and free ows in the absence of rigid boundaries. The PI and collaborators have&lt;br/&gt;recently developed a new approach for the analysis of turbulence driven by time-independent body-&lt;br/&gt;forces, and it is proposed to extend the results to time-dependent forces. A distinct problem for&lt;br/&gt;unforced ows is to solve a variational problem for the maximum enstrophy-generating configuration&lt;br/&gt;and study how it relates to structures observed in fully developed turbulence or the potential&lt;br/&gt;development of singularities.&lt;br/&gt;With regard to the intellectual merit of this activity, knowledge gained from this project will&lt;br/&gt;further our understanding of some basic mathematical models in uid dynamics of direct relevance&lt;br/&gt;to many branches of engineering and applied science. In the long term, this kind of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research could help the development of practical techniques for the prediction and/or control of&lt;br/&gt;physical processes ranging from meteorology to materials manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;And with regard to this activity's broader impacts, there are several significant advanced train-&lt;br/&gt;ing aspects to the project. For one, it provides research support and opportunities for graduate&lt;br/&gt;students within the University of Michigan's new Ph.D. program in Applied &amp; Interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics. Moreover, this project also involves other investigators|including graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral researchers from the University of Michigan as well as other institutions|who&lt;br/&gt;will collaborate in the research.</AbstractNarration>
