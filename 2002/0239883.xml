    <AbstractNarration>Spatial thinking and reasoning is common to most knowledge domains. It is central to geography and other geosciences, and it is important in domains ranging from astronomy to zoology where geospatial databases are common. Other knowledge areas, such as dance, music, painting, sculpture, genetics, biology, physics, and linguistics, all require spatial thinking and use spatial metaphors. The peculiar contribution of spatial thinking and reasoning to solve certain types of problems has been recognized by psychologists like Beck and Uttal, who claimed that preparing and using spatial representations of information (as in maps, graphs, and images) provides a perspective that is not matched by any other means. The purpose of this research project is to develop a spatial task ontology and a concept lexicon to assist in the development of spatial thinking and reasoning. The investigator will define spatial thinking and identify sets of tasks that will help people understand the nature and importance of spatial thinking and reasoning in everyday life. The task ontology will identify different levels and types of tasks ranging from those designed to identify spatial primitives and will illustrate how such primitives can be expanded into discrete levels. The levels range from simple derivations to more complex multiple combinations of primitives and derivations to form complex concepts, such as geographic association and spatial interpolation. When elaborated, these concepts assist in the understanding of everyday activities, such as learning a route to primary school, choosing a neighborhood in which to live, or selecting places to work, shop, or enjoy recreational activities. This project aims to synthesize theoretical work on spatial ontology with empirical work on spatial task performance in the world of everyday experience. To achieve the project's objectives, sets of innovative tasks will be developed and tested in both laboratory and field settings to evaluate whether or not developing an understanding of spatial concepts embedded in everyday living leads to enriched geographic understanding of neighborhood, city, region, nation, and the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the ways that people organize the ways they think about space and the forms of thinking and reasoning that they use when they are confronted with spatial information. The research should shed light on how enhanced understanding of geographic concepts influences the comprehensive of spatial information, and it will illustrate differences that result from formal training in geographic concepts. All of these developments have intellectual implications ranging from the formalization of geographic knowledge to the development of more effective geographic information systems. This project will influence the development of future enhancements of geographic information systems, and it could help identify new strategies for more effective geographic education at all levels.</AbstractNarration>
