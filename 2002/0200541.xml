    <AbstractNarration>Originating in the mid-1970's, Stark's Conjecture remains one of the &lt;br/&gt;deepest unsolved problems in number theory. Tate's 1984 book on the sub-&lt;br/&gt;ject provided a generation of researchers with a solid exposition of the &lt;br/&gt;state of the conjecture at that time, and a foundation for further in-&lt;br/&gt;vestigation. Work related to the conjecture has recently grown to in-&lt;br/&gt;volve more and more number theorists, but there has never been a major &lt;br/&gt;conference on the subject. This NSF award will provide major funding &lt;br/&gt;for a conference dedicated to Stark's conjecture and its variations to&lt;br/&gt;be held at John's Hopkins University in Baltimore August 4-9, 2002. &lt;br/&gt;Plans include plenary talks devoted to background and current research&lt;br/&gt;in the mornings, followed by contributed talks in the afternoons.&lt;br/&gt;The gathering of researchers from various strands of inquiry should&lt;br/&gt;lead to insight into the links between various conjectures and provide &lt;br/&gt;an ideal platform for further research on all aspects of Stark's Conj-&lt;br/&gt;ecture. In particular, one would expect that this conference would lead &lt;br/&gt;to a number of new and fruitful collaborations, and to the greater in-&lt;br/&gt;volvement of graduate students in this research. Indeed, graduate stu-&lt;br/&gt;dents, junior faculty members, women, and members of traditionally &lt;br/&gt;under-represented minorities are especially encouraged to attend and &lt;br/&gt;to apply for funding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Stark's conjecture in number theory suggests that there is astonishing &lt;br/&gt;and useful structure waiting to be discovered behind the fundamental &lt;br/&gt;concepts of higher arithmetic. In higher arithmetic, one seeks to de-&lt;br/&gt;scribe the solutions of polynomial equations and their properties. This &lt;br/&gt;is the algebraic side of number theory. The conjecture states that the &lt;br/&gt;solutions of certain polynomial equations can be obtained from the values &lt;br/&gt;of specific limits and infinite sums which naturally involve the methods &lt;br/&gt;of calculus. This is the analytic side of number theory. Thus Stark's &lt;br/&gt;conjecture makes a striking connection between two branches of mathematics:&lt;br/&gt;algebra and analysis. Understanding this type of connection is just what&lt;br/&gt;leads to major breakthroughs. Indeed, the conjecture has already led to &lt;br/&gt;new and more efficient methods of performing certain computations.</AbstractNarration>
