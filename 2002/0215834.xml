    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0215834&lt;br/&gt;David A. Berque&lt;br/&gt;Carl Singer&lt;br/&gt;DePauw University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI/RUI: Acquisition of Touch Sensitive Plasma Displays and Supporting Equipment for Research and Research Training in Multiple Machine Interfaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, studying multi-device classroom technology, centers on the design, implementation, and evaluation of pen-based computing groupware. The work, using touch sensitive plasma displays in research and research training in multiple machine interfaces, emphasizes the applications of such groupware to educational technology allowing for more display area in the classroom as well as the use of hand-held calculating devices. Along with the challenges associated with the multiple-machine interfaces that we deal with in everyday life, areas of particular interest to the investigators, such as performance modeling, data structures for storing information, databases, intercommunication of different computing devices, and educational technology are specifically addressed. The interfaces run simultaneously on co-located interconnected machines with varying sizes of screens. The research enhances and continues previous successful work of the principal investigators (PIs) in a primarily undergraduate university.</AbstractNarration>
