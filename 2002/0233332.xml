    <AbstractNarration>The NWCET Skill Standards for Information Technology are used by The Boston Area Advanced Technological Education Connections (BATEC) in a summer institute and follow on activities to understand industry requirements and to align academic curricula of the partner schools with them. Relevant curricula from the BATEC partner schools are cataloged, the academic outcomes and skill standards addressed within functional clusters, and gaps and redundancies are noted. This results in a "Roadmap of Opportunities" - a 2+2+2 mapping framework to ensure flexibility in and across information technology career clusters that serves as a foundation for future cooperation agreements between the schools. The "roadmap" also provides navigational guidance to facilitate student movement through various educational levels in a flexible, systematic manner with multiple entrance and exit points.</AbstractNarration>
