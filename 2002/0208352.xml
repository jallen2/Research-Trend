    <AbstractNarration>This proposal concerns the development of methods to allow a variety of uni-cast, multicast, geocast and location-based mobile ad-hoc routing protocols to adapt. It addresses specifically the ad-hoc routing protocol design related to quantification of the mobility by specific metrics, in particular mobility, which are used to solve various routing tasks. In this three-year project, the following research activities will be particularly pursued. The research team will address the development of local mobility metrics that are specific to individual nodes. For that purpose, a generic feedback agent that resides on a mobile node will be developed, which gathers the information required to compute the value of the mobility metrics, and present the information to an arbitrary type of protocol. The simulation studies under a wide variety of network conditions will be con-ducted to determine appropriate trade-offs between active and passive monitor-ing and optimal sampling times for estimating metrics such as node speed, link change rate, link duration, etc. The project activities will also include the devel-opment of example adaptive routing protocols utilizing the feedback agent. For example, the research team will explore a protocol that will combine location-based routing with localized flooding in an effort to enable successful packet delivery in times of extreme network mobility (low link duration times). Finally, the development of new mobility models that are more realistic will be consid-ered. For example, the networks in which node speeds vary among different parts of the network will be studied, e.g. for the case of regions where the mobil-ity dynamics vary widely throughout the network. In addition to the above ac-tivities the research team also plans to address a variety of other metrics such as link change rate and passive and active traffic monitoring metrics.</AbstractNarration>
