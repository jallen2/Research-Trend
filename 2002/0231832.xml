    <AbstractNarration>These activities build upon an existing collaboration between 1998, Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History and the New Haven Public School (NHPS) District, the Peabody Teachers Program, a professional development program. Participating teachers produce inquiry-based science curricula that use Peabody Museum specimens in the mobile BioAction Lab for hands-on exploration of biological diversity and its impacts on human affairs. This draws on the expertise and materials resident in Yale's Peabody Museum, and provides stimulating subject matter upon which basic science competencies can be developed. The project proposed here is designed to build upon the already-existing strengths of the Peabody Teachers Program to enhance the professional development of middle school teachers and Yale graduate students, as well as to enrich the science-learning environment for New Haven middle school students. The Fellows work closely with participating teachers throughout the year to provide technical assistance as they develop curriculum units, in part to help ensure the scientific accuracy of the content. Working with the teachers and with children in their classrooms improves the science communication skills of the Graduate Fellows. Training and on-site supervision of the Graduate Fellows is provided by the PIs, by the staff of the program, and by the Yale Teacher Preparation Program. In addition, Master Peabody Teachers serve as mentors for pedagogical and classroom management techniques. All curriculum units designed in connection with this program are being incorporated into the middle school science curriculum and will also be disseminated broadly via the Peabody Museum's website. All aspects of the program are overseen by an Advisory Council and a Working Committee, including evaluations of the efficacy of the program. The broader impacts of the project affect a spectrum of beneficiaries. Participating teachers are increasing their scientific knowledge and developing new content-rich curricula. Their students (90% minority, 50% female, 75% on subsidized lunch programs) are benefiting from exposure to scientific subject matter and approaches of relevance to their daily lives, as well as to new role models. Yale graduate students are directly exposed to educational issues at the middle school level, and to the challenges of communicating the wonder of nature and the excitement and importance of science. This initiative strengthens Yale University's graduate programs and its commitment to providing resources for the enhancement of science education in the local school system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Yale University Graduate Teaching Fellows in Biodiversity &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Yale University, Peabody Museum of Natural History &lt;br/&gt;School Partners: New Haven Public&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael J.
