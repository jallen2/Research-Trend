    <AbstractNarration>AST 0205969&lt;br/&gt;Katz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past ten years, our basic ideas about how galaxies form has reached a consensus. This "standard" model has been able to explain numerous and varied observations of galaxies. However, four vexing problems remain. These problems arise from predictions made using computer simulations. This has led some researchers to significantly alter or abandon this otherwise very successful standard model. However, computer simulations are not perfect, and it has recently been shown that correctly simulating the dynamics of galaxies and their dark matter halos is much more difficult than previously realized. Hence the cause of these problems could be purely numerical in nature. Alternatively, the cause of these problems could be physical effects which are not properly included in the simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Katz and his collaborators will study the origin of these problems and possible solutions to try and assess whether or not the standard model for galaxy formation should be changed or abandoned. They will use numerical simulations of ever increasing realism and novel numerical techniques to study these subtle dynamical processes and their impact on the above problems. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
