    <AbstractNarration>Michigan State University proposes a three-year grant supporting the research&lt;br/&gt;of a faculty group in nuclear theory, Professors B. A. Brown and V. Zelevinsky,&lt;br/&gt;together with M. Horoi (Central Michigan University). The research proposed&lt;br/&gt;encompasses a broad range of topics in nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics&lt;br/&gt;important for the ongoing program at the National Superconducting Cyclotron&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory. The main components are structural properties of nuclei, including&lt;br/&gt;those far from stability, and their manifestation in nuclear reactions and astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. The rich experience of the group and the support from MSU&lt;br/&gt;and NSCL provides the .rm basis for a diverse and topical research program.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is in the mainstream of modern nuclear physics that is&lt;br/&gt;directed to answering principal questions what are the limits of stability of nuclei,&lt;br/&gt;how did the chemical evolution of the Universe proceed, what are the&lt;br/&gt;ways of self-organization in interacting many-body systems - how does order coexist&lt;br/&gt;with chaos and complexity. Concrete directions of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;logically follow from the previous experience of the group. Suggested main topics&lt;br/&gt;are (i) development of new analytical and computational tools for the description&lt;br/&gt;of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions, especially for the nuclei far from&lt;br/&gt;stability; (ii) detailed consideration of speci.c nuclear phenomena and nuclear&lt;br/&gt;processes that shed light on the new features encountered with the advances into&lt;br/&gt;virgin territory of unstable nuclei; (iii) calculations and modeling of structural&lt;br/&gt;and dynamical aspects of nuclear processes of astrophysical interest; (iv) studies&lt;br/&gt;of many-body quantum chaos and its coexistence with collective and regular&lt;br/&gt;features in nuclear structure and reactions.&lt;br/&gt;The suggested program is expected to have appreciable impact on the development&lt;br/&gt;in the .eld of nuclear theory and nuclear astrophysics. It will also in.uence&lt;br/&gt;the direction of the experimental e.orts. In a broader context, successful progress&lt;br/&gt;in the program is important for our understanding of the basic constituents of&lt;br/&gt;matter and nucleosynthesis in the Universe. The studies of many-body properties,&lt;br/&gt;chaos and collectivity in nuclear structure, have a strong interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;aspect since the nucleus is an exemplary case of a self-sustaining .nite Fermisystem&lt;br/&gt;with strong interactions. Historically, many ideas .rst formulated in the&lt;br/&gt;context of nuclear theory fertilized other branches of physics. The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;is expected to help studies in physics of Bose- and Fermi-condensates,&lt;br/&gt;complex molecules, solid state microdevices and quantum computing. The proposal&lt;br/&gt;has a considerable educational component being part of the highly ranked&lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics program at NSCL/MSU.</AbstractNarration>
