    <AbstractNarration>Research will focus on four areas related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Experiment: 1) astrophysical analysis of initial LIGO data in a search for periodic sources of gravitational waves; 2) systematic understanding and characterization of the LIGO instruments; 3) commissioning of the interferometers to bring them to design sensitivity; and&lt;br/&gt;4) development of novel servo controls systems for future advanced LIGO interferometers. The LIGO data already has unprecedented sensitivity to potential gravitational waves. As the Michigan group helps improve that sensitivity further through detector characterization and commissioning, it will be examining the data closely to find evidence for undiscovered, electromagnetically quiet,&lt;br/&gt;rotating neutron stars in the galactic neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery of gravitational waves from astrophysical objects will mark a major milestone in science, simultaneously confirming one of the fundamental predictions of gravitational physics, while opening up an entirely new field of astronomy. The detection of such waves from rotating neutron stars would be especially interesting because many such sources are expected to continue emitting for long durations, allowing follow-up investigation of increasing precision. It is also believed that these waves will provide insight into the poorly known structure of these exotic stars. The research to be carried out, on both the instrumental and analytical sides, will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art science at the frontier of knowledge.</AbstractNarration>
