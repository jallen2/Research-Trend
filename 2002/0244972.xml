    <AbstractNarration>The neutron is a sub--atomic particle that&lt;br/&gt;comprises more than half of the matter in the&lt;br/&gt;world. Within the nuclei of most atoms, the&lt;br/&gt;neutron remains stable, but when freed from the&lt;br/&gt;nucleus, it is unstable. Free neutrons are thus&lt;br/&gt;an important tool for study of&lt;br/&gt;sub--atomic physics, because the decay and&lt;br/&gt;interactions of free neutrons reveal the&lt;br/&gt;interactions of its constituents and decay&lt;br/&gt;products. Neutrons also have spin, the quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanical property of the most fundamental&lt;br/&gt;pieces of matter that distinguishes two states called&lt;br/&gt;spin--up and spin--down. Spin is responsible&lt;br/&gt;for the nuclear magnetism exploited, for example,&lt;br/&gt;in NMR and MRI. The spin states also affect the&lt;br/&gt;decay and interactions of neutrons, and so the&lt;br/&gt;control of neutron spin becomes useful for more&lt;br/&gt;detailed study of sub--atomic interactions. In&lt;br/&gt;the proposed research, free neutrons produced by&lt;br/&gt;a particle accelerator at Los Alamos National&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory and at the nuclear reactor at NIST&lt;br/&gt;will be used in experiments that control the&lt;br/&gt;neutron spin to reveal weak interactions and&lt;br/&gt;possible new physics beyond the Standard Model that&lt;br/&gt; summarizes known elementary&lt;br/&gt;particle interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The neutron spins in a beam of neutron will be manipulated by&lt;br/&gt;selecting predominantly one spin state with a&lt;br/&gt;spin filter based on laser polarized $^3$He. The&lt;br/&gt;neutron spin can be reversed using&lt;br/&gt;magnetic fields that couple to the nuclear&lt;br/&gt;magnetic moment. Very precise measurement of the&lt;br/&gt;neutron polarization ({\it i.e.} the excess&lt;br/&gt;fraction of the selected spin state) and precise&lt;br/&gt;spin reversal are required to mitigate false&lt;br/&gt;effects that may arise. The techniques of&lt;br/&gt;$^3$He polarization, the spin filter, and spin&lt;br/&gt;flipping will be greatly improved as we undertake&lt;br/&gt;these experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the Los Alamos experiment is&lt;br/&gt;measurement of the weak interaction effects on&lt;br/&gt;the absorption of neutrons by hydrogen. The weak&lt;br/&gt;interaction&lt;br/&gt;is characterized by absorption and emission of&lt;br/&gt;particles that have a handedness that correlates&lt;br/&gt;the spin orientation with the direction of motion.&lt;br/&gt;This handedness allows observation of the weak&lt;br/&gt;interaction amidst the much stronger interactions&lt;br/&gt;of neutrons and protons. Definitive characterization of the weak&lt;br/&gt;interaction between the neutron and proton is&lt;br/&gt;crucial to fully understanding the forces that&lt;br/&gt;bind the nucleus. The experiment at NIST measures&lt;br/&gt;the dependence of neutron decays on the spin&lt;br/&gt;state. In a dedicated detector, neutron decays&lt;br/&gt;are observed by simultaneously detecting the proton and&lt;br/&gt;electron. The&lt;br/&gt;third particle emitted, the neutrino, is too elusive to&lt;br/&gt;detect with high efficiency. A dependence of&lt;br/&gt;the electron's and proton's relative motion on the neutron spin&lt;br/&gt;state would reveal interactions that are not&lt;br/&gt;symmetric under reversal of time, a special&lt;br/&gt;signature that could reveal new physics beyond&lt;br/&gt;the Standard Model, physics that may&lt;br/&gt;explain the origin of matter in the Big Bang. The advanced&lt;br/&gt;techniques of spin state selection, precision&lt;br/&gt;polarimetry, and spin flipping will be applied to&lt;br/&gt;a planned experiment with the objective of precisely&lt;br/&gt;measuring the handedness of neutron decays. When&lt;br/&gt;combined with other neutron decay measurements&lt;br/&gt;these measurements will also probe physics beyond the&lt;br/&gt;Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work probes deep intellectual questions&lt;br/&gt;about the most fundamental&lt;br/&gt;pieces of matter. The aim is to collect data&lt;br/&gt;that will help complete the picture of elementary&lt;br/&gt;particles and their interactions. The techniques&lt;br/&gt;have much broader impact. Laser polarized&lt;br/&gt;$^3$He and $^{129}$Xe used in related experiments&lt;br/&gt;are now used in biomedical research, materials&lt;br/&gt;science, and may be applied in advances of&lt;br/&gt;quantum computation. This research is a remarkable&lt;br/&gt;training ground for undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. The technical challenges combined with&lt;br/&gt;the deep intellectual issues provide motivation&lt;br/&gt;and develop technical skills. Several undergraduates will&lt;br/&gt;gain research experience working along with graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;senior researchers. Graduate students emerge&lt;br/&gt;broadly capable and move on to prepare for&lt;br/&gt;faculty positions as well as interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research. This work has also led to development&lt;br/&gt;of new courses for non--physics majors and to a&lt;br/&gt;set of public lectures on Nuclear Magnets.&lt;br/&gt;The theme for the public is&lt;br/&gt;that, in the context of probing fundamental&lt;br/&gt;problems of physics -- exciting in their own&lt;br/&gt;right, the hardest problems produce the most&lt;br/&gt;innovative solutions with spin--offs unimaginable&lt;br/&gt;at the outset. Atomic clocks, enhanced MRI, and&lt;br/&gt;probing the origin of matter all follow from the&lt;br/&gt;control of nuclear magnetism.</AbstractNarration>
