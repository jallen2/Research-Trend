    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this proposal is to develop systematic design tools that exploit, rather&lt;br/&gt;than override, nonlinearities and structural properties in feedback systems. Encouraged by our&lt;br/&gt;preliminary results, we address the problems of observer design and robustness to unmodeled&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, which are crucial for practical applicability of nonlinear control techniques. The variety of&lt;br/&gt;dynamic phenomena in nonlinear systems have hampered constructive solutions to these problems.&lt;br/&gt;In contrast, we pursue structure-specific designs which are tailored to inherent system properties&lt;br/&gt;and nonlinear phenomena. Our robust design tools exploit types of unmodeled dynamics and&lt;br/&gt;multivariable structures to recover stability and performance achievable with nominal designs. Our&lt;br/&gt;observers take advantage of nonlinearities to enhance observer convergence and to recover stability&lt;br/&gt;of full state-feedback designs in certainty-equivalence implementations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with United Technologies Research Center, the PI will apply these design tools&lt;br/&gt;to emerging feedback problems in fuel cell power systems. Fuel cell technology is particularly suit-&lt;br/&gt;able for United States, because the wide geography makes centralized power networks prone to&lt;br/&gt;failure, and the strict environmental regulations accentuate the necessity of clean power genera-&lt;br/&gt;tion.A major challenge for potential vehicular and portable power applications is the high-order,&lt;br/&gt;interconnected, system structure, and severe nonlinearities, which arise from tight integration of&lt;br/&gt;system components and wide variations in the electric load. Robustness to unmodeled dynamics&lt;br/&gt;is crucial for reliability of low-order designs. Nonlinear observers are of great importance because&lt;br/&gt;commercially available sensor technologies are not designed to operate in a fuel cell environment.&lt;br/&gt;The study of fuel cells will set the stage for abstractions and broad design methodologies which will&lt;br/&gt;also impact other technologies, such as computer networks, chemical processes, and fluid control&lt;br/&gt;problems in aeroengines, where high-order system models and severe nonlinearities constitute an&lt;br/&gt;obstacle to efficient and reliable feedback designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational objective of the proposal is to make nonlinear concepts accessible to a wider&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of students. The PI will introduce a new course for undergraduates, and graduate stu-&lt;br/&gt;dents who wish to study nonlinear systems at an introductory level. This course will enhance the&lt;br/&gt;appreciation of nonlinear systems among practitioners of the future, and attract more students&lt;br/&gt;to our graduate research program. In collaboration with the New Visions Program of local school&lt;br/&gt;districts and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, we will include high-school students in project teams&lt;br/&gt;with our undergraduates. Several pedagogical experiments and computer animations, detailed in&lt;br/&gt;the proposal, will give them a motivating real-life exposure to dynamic phenomena and control&lt;br/&gt;concepts.</AbstractNarration>
