    <AbstractNarration>Keener&lt;br/&gt;0211366&lt;br/&gt; The investigator uses mathematical models and analysis to&lt;br/&gt;study the dynamics of several physiological systems in which&lt;br/&gt;excitability is a common and fundamental feature. The three broad&lt;br/&gt;problem areas to be investigated are&lt;br/&gt; 1) The initiation and dynamics of cardiac arrhythmias;&lt;br/&gt; 2) The dynamics of defibrillation;&lt;br/&gt; 3) The dynamics of autoimmune disease.&lt;br/&gt;The study of these problems involves the development and use of&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated mathematical models and tools, including advanced&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods such as immersed boundary methods, bifurcation&lt;br/&gt;theory and dynamical systems theory, and asymptotic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;These tools are used to give theoretical understanding to problems&lt;br/&gt;of border zone and ischemia related cardiac arrhythmias, APD&lt;br/&gt;instabilities and their relationship to the onset and development&lt;br/&gt;of reentrant arrhythmias, mechanical alternans deriving from&lt;br/&gt;instabilities of the calcium handling system or crossbridge&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, the success or failure of defibrillation, and&lt;br/&gt;oscillatory autoimmune responses. Serious attention is given to&lt;br/&gt;obtaining agreement between theoretical results and experimental&lt;br/&gt;findings. To that end collaborations with experimentalists&lt;br/&gt;examine gap junction coupling of rabbit myocytes, the effect of&lt;br/&gt;hypertrophy on excitation-contraction coupling through the&lt;br/&gt;sodium-calcium exchanger, the effect of mutations on the delayed&lt;br/&gt;rectifier potassium channel that lead to increased proclivity&lt;br/&gt;for fatal arrhythmias, and the role of mimicry in oscillatory&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of cystic fibrosis in mice.&lt;br/&gt; Excitability is one of the most important features enabling&lt;br/&gt;signalling in physiological systems. It is crucial to the&lt;br/&gt;operation of nerves, muscle, the heart, the immune system, and&lt;br/&gt;blood clotting as well as numerous gene regulatory networks. The&lt;br/&gt;specific goal of this project is to gain an improved theoretical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how the normal function of systems that rely on&lt;br/&gt;excitability can go awry, exhibiting pathological behaviors, and&lt;br/&gt;how these pathological behaviors might be controlled or&lt;br/&gt;prevented. The behaviors that are studied here are the result of&lt;br/&gt;interwoven interactions of simpler behaviors, resulting in&lt;br/&gt;complex behaviors that defy understanding through intuition or&lt;br/&gt;simple means. The investigation therefore focuses on the&lt;br/&gt;development and analysis of mathematical models of these&lt;br/&gt;behaviors in the belief that substantial new and important&lt;br/&gt;insights can be gained, and new hypotheses formulated that are&lt;br/&gt;not apparent from phenomenological descriptions. While this&lt;br/&gt;project has as its main focus several problems relating to&lt;br/&gt;abnormalities of the cardiac cycle, it extends far beyond to many&lt;br/&gt;areas of physiology where common principles are involved. The&lt;br/&gt;project includes a significant training component for students.</AbstractNarration>
