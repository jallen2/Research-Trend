    <AbstractNarration>0231010&lt;br/&gt;Raikh&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI and postdoctoral and graduate students from the University of Utah in a collaboration with Felix von Oppen of the Department of Physics at the Free University of Berlin, Germany. Combining complementary expertise, the German and US groups will make a theoretical study of Coulomb drag between low-density electron systems. A crucial element of the research is the use of Monte Carlo methods in simulation, which is a technique the German side specializes, and the simulations will be carried out in Berlin. Coulomb drag has garnered interests from both theorists and experimentalists in the past few years because it reveals makes measurement of intra-layer electron correlation possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has an educational objective. The project will allow postdocs and graduate students from the University to gain experience with Monte Carlo simulations during the summer at the Free University. Besides exposing them to one of the foremost groups in Monte Carlo techniques, this will also make them more competitive in the global job market.</AbstractNarration>
