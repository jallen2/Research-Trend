    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER proposal from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) has three objectives: to strengthen the national effort in basic research in particle beam physics, to establish a sustainable infrastructure for this research at the newly established Center for Accelerator and Particle Physics (CAPP) at IIT and to integrate all aspects of this cutting-edge research into the teaching activities offered to a diverse population of graduate and undergraduate students on an ongoing basis throughout the coming decades. Particle accelerators and storage rings are now ubiquitous tools of the modern age, used for basic research in many fields, as well as for industrial, medical, and security-related applications. Scientists use high-energy particle accelerators to study the fundamental nature of matter; synchrotron light sources are used for studies in biology, solid-state physics, and materials science. Particle accelerators are used for the treatment of cancer, for food irradiation to kill bacteria, and for certain fabrication techniques in industry. Investigations are underway to see if particle beams can image items in large shipping containers without opening the containers. The use of particle beams continues to expand, and so the need for higher quality beams, more sophisticated machines, and more beam physicists is growing as well. There is a continuous effort to increase the particle density of beams in accelerators and storage rings for all applications. One portion of the proposed research addresses issues related to the generation of high intensity beams. Another key to the future is improving the technology to enhance the capability and accessibility of particle accelerators. The proposed research also addresses possible future machine technologies, through investigation of novel accelerating structures, such as new kinds of dielectrically loaded structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIT has recently established CAPP in response to the need to further develop beam physics research at the university level. A robust beam physics program at IIT will complement the programs at Fermilab and Argonne. The proposed research will bring students and new tools for beam physics research into CAPP, resources which are crucial to the healthy development of the fledgling organization. Beam physics is a discipline that does not have a strong tradition of formal programs at academic institutions. Only a few universities have broad curricula in beam physics and there is a need to recruit more students to the field. Finally, a component of the educational program will be oriented toward undergraduate students. By helping these students shape their career choices and gain experience, the greatest impact of this work will be through them.</AbstractNarration>
