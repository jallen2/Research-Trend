    <AbstractNarration>This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students pursuing careers in computer science. The goal is to encourage eligible students to study CS, and help them find a desirable job upon completion of their Associate Degree or transfer to a four-year university to enter in a baccalaureate program. Selected participants receive tuition, books and fees paid for by the grant. In addition to the financial assistance, they meet with the CS Advisor/Mentor on a bi-monthly basis during the semester. This helps monitor their progress and assure their success in the program. A series of workshops, offered throughout the program, allow students to improve their problem solving skills, interviewing skills, job-hunting techniques, and writing a resume. Students also receive individualized support and peer mentoring as they move through the program.</AbstractNarration>
