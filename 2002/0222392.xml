    <AbstractNarration>A National Workshop on Future Sensing Systems&lt;br/&gt;Summary and Objectives&lt;br/&gt;Recent technological advancements in material science, micro fabrication of MEMS, and&lt;br/&gt;bioengineered systems, have made the dream of inexpensive, powerful, ubiquitous sensing a&lt;br/&gt;readily achievable reality. With ubiquitous sensing comes extreme amounts of data, when the end&lt;br/&gt;user actually wants information (decisions and answers). Integration of distributed computing&lt;br/&gt;and extremely dispersed networking with new sensor technologies and wireless communications&lt;br/&gt;innovations, has the potential to overcome barriers of time, scale, materials and environment.&lt;br/&gt;Sensor informatics has not been seen as fundamental to the sensor community to date, although&lt;br/&gt;all experts polled for this document agreed it is central to real-time usability.&lt;br/&gt;We propose a National Workshop on future Sensing Systems - a vehicle to start researchers on&lt;br/&gt;the road to integrating the possibilities being developed by the many interests working in the&lt;br/&gt;common space. The workshop will focus on exposing future abilities of various disciplines&lt;br/&gt;working on new sensor science to other researchers possibly doing similar or complimentary&lt;br/&gt;work in their local space. Integration of industrial research and application development will&lt;br/&gt;provide that pull and an avenue to large-scale, inexpensive production. An example is the current&lt;br/&gt;availability of rugged, highly accurate, MEMS accelerometers due to their application as&lt;br/&gt;automotive air-bag triggers. It is hoped, for instance, that the medical researchers will become&lt;br/&gt;aware of advanced imaging technologies developed by DARPA to image non-metallic structural&lt;br/&gt;pieces, and can become an improvement on existing bio-imaging techniques. We hope to push&lt;br/&gt;the community to (1) move from merely providing data to providing information and answers; (2)&lt;br/&gt;build road maps for long-term research; (3) build broad partnerships; and (4) address educational&lt;br/&gt;needs.&lt;br/&gt;These opportunities and problems are common to many agencies of Government, as well as&lt;br/&gt;industry and academia, and is to be sponsored by Sensors Technology, NSF Division of Civil and&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical Systems, with co-sponsorship from Dynamic Systems and Control (CMS), DARPA,&lt;br/&gt;NIH, DOE, NIST, NASA, AFOSR, ONR, ARO, ARL, and NRL. We are expecting over 100&lt;br/&gt;attendees, with 70 of them university researchers for whom all expenses will be covered by this&lt;br/&gt;proposal. The hard deliverable to NSF will be a workshop report which will serve as the leading&lt;br/&gt;edge for future of sensor-oriented research at the Civil and Mechanical Systems Division, NSF.&lt;br/&gt;The report will be written by the co-PIs (Glaser and Pister) with extensive guidance and input&lt;br/&gt;from the steering committee and participants. The report will be presented to NSF by 15 January,&lt;br/&gt;2003.</AbstractNarration>
