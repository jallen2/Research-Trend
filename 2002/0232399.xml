    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of a new manufacturing improvement, planning and execution system that combines the data of a supply chain management system with the incentives of the lean manufacturing philosophy along with the author's own Factory Physics knowledge base in a systematic manner. The result will be a system containing implementation methods, training, and software that is repeatable, portable, and will always result in predictable, improved manufacturing logistical performance. Understanding manufacturing measures such as cycle time, throughput, capacity, work in process, inventory, and variability allows one to develop effective control procedures that are uniquely suited for any particular manufacturing environment. This project attempts to create a system that includes benchmarking (diagnostic) tools, analysis (planning) tools, and execution tools. What makes the proposed approach different is Factory Physics, Inc.'s systematic way of improving the manufacturing operation and addressing the planning and control needs.&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact of this research will be a well-defined methodology to improve the effectiveness of production systems that can be marketed to the manufacturing sector. In addition, using the system will result in better-educated manufacturing managers and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
