    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of models for analysis of part-fixture dynamics in machining and application of these models to the synthesis of dedicated and flexible fixturing systems. The models developed in this research will enable part-fixture interaction to be considered in the stability analysis of multiple-point machining processes such as milling. In addition, the models will allow the impact of part-fixture dynamics on the final part quality to be analyzed and accounted for in the synthesis of both dedicated and flexible fixturing systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this goal, a dynamic model of the part-fixture system accounting for the effects of micro-slip induced damping will be developed. A simplified lumped parameter approach based on contact elasticity principles will be used to develop the model. The model will account for nonlinearities arising from unilateral contact conditions, micro-slip and gross stick-slip. In addition, a modified dynamic friction tester will be used to develop empirical models of part-fixture contact friction for use with the dynamic model. The dynamic part-fixture model will be applied to the analysis and synthesis of both dedicated and flexible machining fixtures such as the pin-array flexible fixture. On a fundamental level, the models developed in this research will complement the existing body of scientific knowledge in part fixturing. On a practical level, it will provide the necessary dynamic analysis and synthesis tools, heretofore unavailable, for designers and end-users of dedicated and flexible fixturing systems. Application of these models will lead to the development and implementation of truly process-capable fixtures.</AbstractNarration>
