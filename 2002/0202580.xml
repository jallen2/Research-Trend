    <AbstractNarration>0202580&lt;br/&gt;Zupan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support an eighteen-month research fellowship by Dr. Marc Zupan to work with Dr. Norman A. Fleck at the University of Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This goal of this project is to demonstrate strategies for minimum weight energy absorption systems based on egg-box panels and to develop a group of design parameters that allow egg-box panels to be adapted for specific protection needs. The realizations will be manifested in (1) characterizing the mechanical response of egg-box panels in both crash and blast situations; (2) analytical models will be developed so that minimum weight designs can be achieved for specific needs; (3) design maps will be produced and validated by the production and experimental analysis of new geometries to meet current industry demands. Egg-box panels are a new category of energy absorption devices. It is feasible that egg-box cores, when configured correctly, can be used in a broad range of protective situations for both crash and blast protection. Energy absorbers based on egg-box panels promise to have a significant influence on vehicle protection providing a novel minimum weight, low cost energy absorber leading to the combined goal of reduced weight, and superior energy absorption across widespread applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Cambridge's Micromechanics Centre will provide a diverse environment, providing direct partnerships not only with the host, but also with many others. The interdisciplinary facility currently maintains close international links with both European and American research groups.</AbstractNarration>
