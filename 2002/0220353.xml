    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 0220353&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kalpana Jain&lt;br/&gt;Institution: College of Aeronautics &lt;br/&gt;Title: Scholarship Opportunities for High Achieving Avionics Students&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides 20 scholarships per year to economically disadvantaged students who major in avionics technology or related engineering technology programs. Incoming freshmen pursuing an associate's in applied science degree in avionics technology or related engineering technology programs, and college students who have already completed 64 credits toward a bachelor's of science in avionics technology or related engineering technology programs, are eligible to compete for the scholarships. Admission into the program is based on the following criteria: grade point average, class standing, recommendations, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and an interview. The College provides support for the CSEMS recipients in their pursuit of a degree in engineering technology. There are programs such as faculty mentoring and a technology seminar series devised to assist the recipients to achieve academic success. In addition, the College sponsors many activities such as faculty/recipient socials, which reinforce the objectives the College hopes to accomplish through CSEMS. Finally, the College provides the recipients many opportunities to interact with industry representatives, both on and off campus, through internships, job fairs and industry- recipient luncheons.</AbstractNarration>
