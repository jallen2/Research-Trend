    <AbstractNarration>A one-year study of computer-assisted instruction in the third grade classroom at two urban schools is proposed. This project will use advanced technology to enhance mathematics and science instruction in elementary classrooms with computer activities that allow students to use the information problem-solving process. The Benjamin Banneker Project, named for a famous African American mathematician and scientist, involves the design and use of computer software that allows students the opportunity to engage in culturally relevant simulations, and an intelligent tutoring system will monitor their progress. The main objectives are to design and field-test culturally relevant computer simulations and to provide professional development to support computer usage in the classroom. To accomplish this goal, the Temple University PI/Co-PI team of mathematics, science, early childhood, and social policy teacher researchers will collaborate with software developers and elementary teachers to carry out this one-year project. During Phase I two engineers will design the software which will be pilot-tested with third graders. The software will provide students with grade-level specific simulations and intelligent tutoring. During Phase II the PI/Co-PI team will provide professional development activities for teachers participating in this study to help them learn how to use software to solve and integrate technology into culturally relevant lessons. The project will be conducted in two urban, predominantly African American, charter schools. In Phase III research (classroom observations) and project evaluation will occur to measure the effectiveness of the project. Findings will be reported to refereed journals and presented at conferences. This project has the potential to "hook" the interest of African American students by contextualizing mathematics and science computer tasks with the culture of the community.</AbstractNarration>
