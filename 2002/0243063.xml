    <AbstractNarration>This proposal from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) group seeks funding for the support of software and hardware projects that will enable a measurement of the branching ratio of the ultra-rare K-meson decay, K0L to p0+n+nbar. This decay is perhaps the single most incisive test of the minimal Standard Model explanation of CP violation. A much larger amount of CP violation than that presently observed is needed to explain why the universe is matter dominated. It is therefore important to search for exotic sources of CP violation. The experiment, called KOPIO, will be carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's Alternating Gradient Synchrotron that provides the most intense beams of low energy long-lived neutral K-mesons. The VT group plans to maintain, update and answer physics questions with the GEANT Monte Carlo simulation code and to design and construct the charged particle and gamma ray veto detectors that will catch particles from background decays emitted in the general direction of the beam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research program are expected to derive from the important engineering problems to be surpassed in the project and from the involvement of students at all levels from high school to graduate school.</AbstractNarration>
