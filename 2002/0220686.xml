    <AbstractNarration>0220686 Gregg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations suggest there exists a qualitative difference between deep ocean turbulence and turbulence in lakes and fjords. The Black Sea may represent an intermediate situation. A study to characterize the turbulence environment in this large sea, which is devoid of strong tidal flows, is proposed. An acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) will be implanted on the slope and a Lagrangian float released in the interior of the Black Sea to define the context of a series of microstructure measurements. Microstructure probe drops and a depth-cycling conductivity-temperature-depth recorder will be deployed around these to:&lt;br/&gt;1) quantify mixing produce by internal wave scattering at the slope in an environment where tide contamination is absent, &lt;br/&gt;2) measure and parameterize the diapycnal diffusivity in the upper 300 m of the Black Sea, and &lt;br/&gt;3) determine diapycnal diffusivity at the anoxic/oxic interface, when accompanying chemists are taking measurements to understand the associated reactions. (The processes have short time scales and appear sensitive to the choice of diapycnal diffusivity in models.) &lt;br/&gt;Some effort will also be made to control for three-dimensional effects. Field work will occur during the energetic winter season. Synergy with EPIC2001, an ongoing field program in the Pacific Ocean, will improve understanding of high stratification regions. Seasonal variability will be addressed by leaving the ADCP in place and collaborating with Steve Riser, who has ONR funding to deploy profiling floats in the Black Sea.</AbstractNarration>
