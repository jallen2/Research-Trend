    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to The Salk Institute to acquire a proteomics system.&lt;br/&gt;Proteomics, the rapid identification of large numbers of proteins in a short time frame, has been made possible by recent developments in mass spectroscopy equipment and by the development of powerful data interpretation software. The new Salk proteomics system consists of devices that allow the isolation and identification of small amounts of proteins involved in normal and abnormal events inside cells. The proteins are separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Fragments of the proteins are then identified by analysis in a mass spectrometer. The system includes robotic workstations that allow automated analysis of several hundred proteins per week.&lt;br/&gt;Numerous projects at The Salk Institute rely heavily on the ability to identify small&lt;br/&gt;amounts of proteins involved in cell growth and development. Changes in the level of specific proteins are associated with diseases such as cancer and nerve cell damage. Protein complexes regulate embryo development and gene activity throughout life. These complexes, often consisting of more than 50 proteins, can be analyzed in days with the new proteomics technology rather than years with previous methods. Plant development and plants' responses to parasites are also regulated by changes in the level of a variety of proteins. Understanding these events in plants not only has implication for agriculture but can also lead to discoveries about human biology.&lt;br/&gt;The Salk Institute has been at the forefront of biological research for more than three&lt;br/&gt;decades and the proteomics system will allow investigators to expand the scope of their investigation to pursue new avenues of research. The Salk Institute employs a highly diverse staff of scientists and support personnel. Students, both undergraduate and postgraduate, from many ethnic backgrounds are trained in its laboratories. The Salk Institute has an on-going outreach program designed to attract minority students and staff members. The addition of a proteomics facility will expand the research possibilities and attract new investigators to the Institute.</AbstractNarration>
