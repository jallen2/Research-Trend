    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will conduct research and develop prototypes of an Earth Systems science-learning program for secondary schools. The product will consist of a DVD-ROM that combines a library of high-resolution visualizations with an inquiry-based curriculum and the ability to update with new content from web sites on the Internet. Building on WorldLink Media's previously published CD product, Interactive Earth, the investigative team will research and prototype an advanced tool set for data analysis and image interpretation that will enable students to inquire, hypothesize, analyze, discover, and communicate with peers, replicating the work of real scientists. Using NASA's Earth Observatory and Visible Earth web sites as a test case, the Phase I research will define Web protocols that let users seamlessly upload data and imagery into the DVD-ROM interface. TERC, a research and education organization will evaluate teacher needs and develop a curriculum framework that aligns with the National Science Education Standards. This project recognizes the vital interplay between a curriculum developer (TERC), a data provider (NASA) and a tool-builder (WorldLink) in creating exemplary materials.&lt;br/&gt; Principal commercial applications include a DVD-ROM and curriculum package for schools, a DVD program for homes and libraries, and an interactive multimedia resource for museums and science centers. The proffered technology will not only contribute to earth science learning but also to solving information management problems: dealing with large amounts of data effectively in a classroom setting.</AbstractNarration>
