    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0203680&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer C. Schultens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research concerns the study of 3-manifolds. The notion&lt;br/&gt;of a 3-manifold constitutes the 3-dimensional analogue of the&lt;br/&gt;2-dimensional notion of a surface. The 2-dimensional notion of&lt;br/&gt;surface is to be understood in a rather broad (and rather technical)&lt;br/&gt;way. It includes the 2-dimensional sphere (that tends to be pictured&lt;br/&gt;as all points in 3-space at distance exactly 1 from the origin), the&lt;br/&gt;torus (often, jokingly, described as ``the icing on a doughnut''), the&lt;br/&gt;Klein bottle, and many others. The study of 3-manifolds is&lt;br/&gt;considerably more complex than that of surfaces. Surfaces are&lt;br/&gt;completely classified, 3-manifolds are not. In fact, it is at present&lt;br/&gt;unknown whether 3-manifolds can be classified (in an algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;sense). It is known that 4-manifolds cannot be classified. The&lt;br/&gt;research here endeavors to employ different types of surfaces lying in&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds and their relation to each other in a structural study of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research grows out of a study of the relation of Heegaard&lt;br/&gt;splittings to Haken decompositions. It turns out that the lessons&lt;br/&gt;learnt in that investigation have applications to a wider range of&lt;br/&gt;problems in 3-manifold topology ranging from additivity properties of&lt;br/&gt;the generalized bridge numbers of knots and additivity properties of&lt;br/&gt;the width of knots to questions about the genus of a Heegaard&lt;br/&gt;splitting that is a common stabilization of two given Heegaard&lt;br/&gt;splittings. The methods for this investigation include a counting&lt;br/&gt;technique developed by M. Scharlemann and the P.I along with the&lt;br/&gt;notion of an orbifold Heegaard splitting. The methods further include&lt;br/&gt;the notion of untelescoping of Heegaard splittings, Cerf theory, thin&lt;br/&gt;position arguments, and the analysis of foliations induced by Morse&lt;br/&gt;functions corresponding to Heegaard splittings or untelescopings of&lt;br/&gt;Heegaard splittings. The proposed research also includes a strategy&lt;br/&gt;to obtain a more structural theory of surfaces in knot complements.</AbstractNarration>
