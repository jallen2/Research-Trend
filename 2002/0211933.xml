    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to use novel polymer processing techniques to fabricate high quality, inexpensive polymer (plastic) optical fiber image guides and other highly customized endoscopic devices. Polymer based imaging guides have several distinct advantages over their glass counterparts. The key advantages include reduced cost, a smaller bend radius, and increased ruggedness. Additional benefits include the ability to dope the polymer matrix with molecules that can be used as environmental probes or indicators, to tailor the imaging guide for specialized applications, and to impart diverse functionality into a single imaging guide. The cost of the polymer imaging guide is expected to be significantly lower than those currently in use. This will allow the polymer guides to be used as disposables if desired. Disposable endoscopes for one-time use will eliminate the need for sterilization, which is costly, often unreliable and time-consuming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project will be in the area of medical devices and instrumentation.</AbstractNarration>
