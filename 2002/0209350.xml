    <AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor John Toscano, of the Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University, is studying the structure and reactivity of short-lived organic intermediates. Professor Toscano will use the technique of time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, combined with experimental and calculational studies, to examine the chemistry of arylnitrenium ions, oxynitrenes, and oxynitrenium ions. The biologically important reaction of arylnitrenium ions with guanine will be examined to clarify mechanistic details. New photochemical precursors to oxynitrenes and oxynitrenium ions will be developed, and the chemistry and spectroscopy of these reactive intermediates will be elucidated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic chemical reactions frequently proceed via the formation of relatively unstable intermediate compounds of only fleeting existence. Such intermediates are also involved in many biochemical reactions and play key roles in numerous processes, including chemical carcinogenesis. By studying the formation, structure, and reaction chemistry of reactive intermediates, one may obtain fundamental information about the nature of chemical reactivity and potential leads for the prevention of chemically-induced hazards such as carcinogenicity. Professor John Toscano, of the Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University, carries out studies of chemical reactions using the tool of time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, in which the powerful technique of infrared spectroscopy, which can provide key information about the structure of organic compounds, is used to follow the formation and disappearance of reactive intermediates during the course of a chemical reaction.</AbstractNarration>
