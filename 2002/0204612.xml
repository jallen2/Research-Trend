    <AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: DMS-0204612&lt;br/&gt;PI: Trevor Hastie&lt;br/&gt;Title: Flexible statistical modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his students will study the popular support vector machines from the viewpoint of the traditional logistic regression model (with regularization). While the latter exhibits very similar generalization performance to the SVM, it has several advantages: it estimates class probabilities, and generalizes to multiclass problems seamlessly. This and several other even simpler approaches will be developed for the classification of gene expression arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will thus develop useful models for making class predictions in a variety of high-dimensional situations, in particular for gene expression arrays. While the science journals abound with exotic statistical and computational algorithms for use in this fashionable domain, this investigator and his colleagues firmly believe that some very simple modifications of classical approaches perform as well or better, and are easier to understand.</AbstractNarration>
