    <AbstractNarration>In addition to being among the most energetic of astrophysical events, core collapse&lt;br/&gt;supernovae are the most productive factories of the heavy elements which are necessary for&lt;br/&gt;life. As a result, they are critical players in the origin and evolution of the chemical&lt;br/&gt;elements, a subject of study central to the Directorate of Mathematical \&amp; Physical&lt;br/&gt;Sciences' Origins of the Universe theme. Supernovae have also been, and continue to be,&lt;br/&gt;objects of great interest to a wide range of NSF-funded astronomical, nuclear and particle&lt;br/&gt;physics experiments and observatories, from radio and optical telescopes to nuclear&lt;br/&gt;accelerators and neutrino and gravity wave detectors. The theoretical study of core&lt;br/&gt;collapse supernovae has progressed greatly in recent years, however compelling questions&lt;br/&gt;remain.&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, we advance a plan to improve our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the nucleosynthesis which results when a core collapse supernovae explodes. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;builds on our current efforts and is complimentary to DoE funded research into the core&lt;br/&gt;collapse supernova mechanism at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. While the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;study of core collapse supernovae has progressed greatly in the past decade, fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions remain, including ''Can the neutrino reheating mechanism, when calculated&lt;br/&gt;accurately in multidimensions, successfully produce supernova explosions?'' Key to&lt;br/&gt;answering these questions is the ability to compare the computed models with observations.&lt;br/&gt;Since many of the important observations of supernovae highlight the elemental&lt;br/&gt;composition, accurate calculation of the nucleosynthesis of these multi-dimensional core&lt;br/&gt;collapse supernova simulations is needed. In particular, we need to see how realistic&lt;br/&gt;nucleosynthesis, calculated in a self-consistent multi-dimensional fashion, differs from&lt;br/&gt;current parameterized one dimensional models. We therefore propose to build on our&lt;br/&gt;world-leading neutrino radiation hydrodynamic capability and investigate the&lt;br/&gt;nucleosynthesis of these models. Our ultimate goal is self consistent nucleosynthesis,&lt;br/&gt;calculated in situ within the neutrino radiation hydrodynamic models, but we will also&lt;br/&gt;discuss interim steps that will give us some nucleosynthesis information more immediately.&lt;br/&gt;The realization that "we are star stuff", that the chemical elements that compose our&lt;br/&gt;bodies and our world originate in stars, has penetrated deep into the public awareness,&lt;br/&gt;reaching as far as pop culture and philosophy. Thus, the study of Cosmic Origins is&lt;br/&gt;science with broad societal impact and interest. In response to this public curiosity,&lt;br/&gt;Hix and Mezzacappa have given several public lectures on this topic in recent years and&lt;br/&gt;expect to continue to do so as part of this proposed effort. This proposal would further&lt;br/&gt;the interdisciplinary collaboration between nuclear physics and astrophysics. This&lt;br/&gt;proposal would also further educational and professional development on several fronts.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal would fund the involvement of a graduate student in supernova research&lt;br/&gt;efforts at ORNL, providing educational access to a world class scientific environment. We&lt;br/&gt;also anticipate the involvement in this research of summer undergraduate students, as we&lt;br/&gt;have in the past, through the Science Alliance funded by the state of Tennessee. Finally&lt;br/&gt;this proposal would allow Hix to develop his independent research agenda, furthering his&lt;br/&gt;development as a scientist.</AbstractNarration>
