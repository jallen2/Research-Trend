    <AbstractNarration>The College District in north central California is engaged in planning for the enlargement of its laser optics/photonics program into what will eventually be a regional center. Yuba's laser optics/photonics consortium involves industry partners Coherent Optics, Inc., and Spectra-Physics, Inc., in close association with their representative professional organizations LEOMA and SPIE. This basic consortium is building its capacity to serve the industry and the region through enhancements to the structure, functions, and size of the consortium and through improved curriculum design utilizing a Tech Prep-type format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning project covers (1) building the partnership to include two universities, three community colleges, six high schools, and approximately twenty industrial partners; (2) developing an infrastructure (a committee structure, the needs and roles of prospective staff, and the points of contact within each participating organization); and (3) developing plans for articulation, marketing, data collection/assessment, and staff development. The project's second year includes a teacher training component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The consortium has already received grants, equipment gifts, and cash to support the Marysville laser optics/photonics center.</AbstractNarration>
