    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With prior support from NSF, we have shown that TIMS (Thermal Ionization Mass &lt;br/&gt;Spectrometry) U-series dating of pedogenic carbonate can provide a precise chronology of &lt;br/&gt;pedogenesis and reliable ages for appropriate Quaternary alluvial deposits (Sharp et al., &lt;br/&gt;accepted). Though the U/Th ratios of pedogenic carbonate of carbonate-clast dominated &lt;br/&gt;alluvium at Kyle Canyon (Nevada) are too low for U-series dating, pedogenic carbonate in &lt;br/&gt;granitic-clast dominated gravels of the Wind River Basin (Wyoming) is highly suitable. &lt;br/&gt;Precise U-series ages (1-2 percent, 2) may be measured on a few cubic millimeters of &lt;br/&gt;pedogenic carbonate and require only very small corrections for detrital 230Th. Suites of &lt;br/&gt;ages may be screened for reliability using criteria inherent in the U-series results. The time &lt;br/&gt;lag between clast deposition and accumulation of datable carbonate.a critical parameter &lt;br/&gt;if U-series dates of innermost clast-rinds are to be used to date host Quaternary deposits.&lt;br/&gt;is estimated to be 5+ 5 kyr in the Wind River basin. O- and C-isotope analyses of a trial &lt;br/&gt;suite of pedogenic carbonate samples shows that a temporally resolved stable isotope &lt;br/&gt;paleoclimatic record can be constructed using pedogenic carbonate dated by U-series. &lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested to further develop U-series dating of pedogenic carbonate and its &lt;br/&gt;application to the refinement of a Rocky Mountain glacial chronology. Emphasis will be &lt;br/&gt;placed on resolving the timing of Bull Lake glacial advances (at their type locality) with &lt;br/&gt;respect to other regional and global climate records. Moreover, we propose to characterize &lt;br/&gt;the spatial and temporal accumulation of pedogenic carbonate in relict soils of Late-&lt;br/&gt;Middle to Late Pleistocene deposits, and measure the O- and C-isotopic compositions of &lt;br/&gt;carbonate samples dated by U-series. We will interpret these data to provide a &lt;br/&gt;comprehensive history of paleoenvironmental change in the Wind River Basin throughout &lt;br/&gt;much of the late Illinoian and Wisconsin glacial cycles. Ultimately, our goal is to correlate &lt;br/&gt;the soils-based paleoenvironmental record with the geomorphic expressions of &lt;br/&gt;paleoclimatic change.the well-preserved glacial moraines and glacio-fluvial terraces of &lt;br/&gt;the Basin.by establishing a common chronological framework based on precise U-series &lt;br/&gt;ages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative proposal. Warren Sharp and Ken Ludwig (Berkeley Geochronology &lt;br/&gt;Center) will be responsible for U-series analyses and age interpretations; Ron Amundson &lt;br/&gt;(U.C. Berkeley) will provide field and laboratory expertise in pedology and stable isotope &lt;br/&gt;analysis and interpretation; Oliver Chadwick (U.C. Santa Barbara) will provide expertise &lt;br/&gt;in Quaternary geology, geomorphology and soil stratigraphy as well as familiarity with the &lt;br/&gt;Wind River area.</AbstractNarration>
