    <AbstractNarration>The Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Meeting will be held in Pittsburgh, PA on May 13-14, 2002. Although, most of the speakers are faculty, this meeting also emphasizes presentations and participation by graduate students and postdoctoral scholars working in all areas of thermodynamics, including experimental and classical thermodynamics, molecular simulation, and statistical mechanics. Funding is requested to reimburse graduate students for travel and registration costs associated with the meeting. Funds for other aspects of running this meeting have been arranged from other sources, primarily donations from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. NST-CTS has provided student travel funds for this meeting several times in the past, and this action has been important in making attendance at this meeting widely accessible to graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
