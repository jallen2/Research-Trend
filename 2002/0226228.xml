    <AbstractNarration>This NSDL Collections project is aggregating the many science and mathematics education resources developed through Federal funding, to make them easily and meaningfully accessible by teachers, parents, and students. It is also laying the groundwork for ensuring that future resource and materials development adheres to standard metadata schema and tagging practices, on which efficient and relevant search, navigation, and access to content rests. Specific activities include: i) creating metadata for legacy collections as well as new digital content via a content management system; ii) systematically reviewing Federally-supported web sites to identify resources not yet part of the NSDL; iii) building awareness among grantees of the value of compliance with emerging metadata standards and best metadata tagging practices; iv) developing a portfolio of collection access tools including personalization; and v) working with grantees to secure rights to archive mathematics and science education digital resources so they are not lost at the end of a grant period. The project team is working closely with the NSDL Core Integration effort to ensure interoperability with other NSDL collections and services. Federal agency programs that are the initial focus of this project include the NSF's various instructional and materials development programs and related efforts housed within the Division of Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education and the Division of Undergraduate Education, and the Department of Education's Regional Laboratories and the Eisenhower Consortia. Progress on this project is also being shared with the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Science.gov Alliance.</AbstractNarration>
