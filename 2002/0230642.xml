    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0230642&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Gilbert, Thomas&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Northeastern University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Engineering Connections in Grades 11-13 Science and Math Courses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes a year-long planning process to develop a model of teaching &lt;br/&gt;that reflects current cognitive learning theory and that will create a common pedagogical framework for science and math courses taken by juniors and seniors in high school and college freshmen. The overarching goal of this project is to recruit and retain a large and diverse population of young people to programs of study leading to careers as: 1) engineering professions in which they are master problem solvers and developers of new solutions to engineering challenges; and 2) high school math and science teachers who understand and are critical consumers of technology, and who can extrapolate fundamental concepts to engineering applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning team consists of Northeastern University (NU) faculty from engineering, &lt;br/&gt;biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics and Boston Public School (BPS) math and science teachers. They will form a community of reflective teaching practitioners spanning across disciplines and the high school-university divide. These communities will meet to assess and enhance their own teaching practices and will collaboratively design: 1) a 3-week Urban Engineering Summer Camp for juniors from the John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science in Boston; 2) engineering activity modules for G11 and 12 math and science courses; 3) math and science courses taken by first-year engineering majors that are based on solving a series of engineering problems; 4) math and science courses taken by undergraduates in NU's School of Education that emphasize the connections between these courses and issues from engineering and technology; and 5) comprehensive, conceptual tests to assess student understanding of the principles of math and science and their abilities to apply these principles.</AbstractNarration>
