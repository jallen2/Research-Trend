    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is concerned with questions related to the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;solutions to nonlinear wave equations under perturbation. In particular we&lt;br/&gt;are concerned with geometric PDEs such as wave maps and Schrodinger maps.&lt;br/&gt;These equations can be viewed as constrained motion in space where the&lt;br/&gt;constraint forces the solution to lie on a subspace such as a manifold or&lt;br/&gt;a metric space. This leads to singularly perturbed wave and Schrodinger&lt;br/&gt;equations. We propose to study the relationship between the wave map&lt;br/&gt;equations and the constrained motion in terms of convergence and in terms&lt;br/&gt;of the dynamics of solutions. Specifically we propose to study: 1)&lt;br/&gt;Convergence of the constrained motion when the data are not "well prepared"&lt;br/&gt;leading to rapid oscillations; 2) the persistence of periodic,&lt;br/&gt;quasi-periodic, and homoclinic orbits that asymptote to quasi-periodic&lt;br/&gt;orbits; 3) wave maps into the Heisenberg Group, as a metric space; and&lt;br/&gt;finally 4) the relationship between Schrodinger maps and wave maps, where&lt;br/&gt;the wave map is considered as a constrained motion on a Lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;submanifold of the Schrodinger map into a Kahler manifold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of many physical systems can be described by geometric&lt;br/&gt;evolution equations. For example dynamics of the magnetization field in a&lt;br/&gt;ferromagnetic material is described by the Landau-Lifshitz equation; the&lt;br/&gt;study of a vibrating membrane in a crystalline structure where there is a&lt;br/&gt;uniform distribution of dislocations, is described by wave equations into&lt;br/&gt;the Heisenberg Group (which also arises in other physical applications such&lt;br/&gt;as control theory, and the motion of robot arms). These geometric evolution&lt;br/&gt;models need not be exact, but should be considered as a limit of a&lt;br/&gt;singularly perturbed system. The general questions that we propose to study&lt;br/&gt;are: What relationships exist between solutions of the geometric equations&lt;br/&gt;and the singularly perturbed equations? How much of the rich dynamical&lt;br/&gt;structure (periodic, quasi-periodic, and breather type solutions) that the&lt;br/&gt;geometric equations have will persist under this type of singular&lt;br/&gt;perturbation? One of the major goals of our work is to develop analytical&lt;br/&gt;methods to deal with convergence questions related to this type of&lt;br/&gt;perturbations. Another important goal is to develop and use infinite&lt;br/&gt;dimensional dynamical systems techniques in conjunction with analytical&lt;br/&gt;methods to answer the persistence question and ultimately to bridge the gap&lt;br/&gt;between finite dimensional dynamical systems and PDEs.</AbstractNarration>
