    <AbstractNarration>0211620&lt;br/&gt;Bayoumi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project by Dr. Magdy Bayoumi, Director, The Center for Advanced Computer Studies (CAS) at University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Louisiana and Dr. Samia Mashali, Professor of Computer Engineering at the Electronics Research Institute (ERI), Cairo, Egypt. They plan to focus on the development of novel algorithms, methods, and a hardware/software prototype for compressed-domain feature extraction using an existing wavelet coder infrastructure. Specifically, these investigators will develop algorithms and techniques for calculating texture and shape attributes from images and videos compressed with the JPEG2000 and motion-JPEG2000 compression standards. The novelty of the proposed method lies in its employment of a wavelet-based approach as opposed to the standard DCT methods, the addressing of texture and shape features which have received limited attention in the literature, and the emphasis on hardware solutions to further enhance the computation and memory reductions achieved with compressed-domain techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: &lt;br/&gt;The necessity of compression for storage coupled with the need to efficiently process the&lt;br/&gt;compacted data has led to a great need for compressed-domain methods in which data can be processed without decoding. The U.S. PI is well known in the area of VLSI Signal processing and has done work in architectures wavelet and other transforms. He and his students have demonstrated how to extract textual features for wavelet-compressed images. The project will involve training of students at the University of Louisiana and ERI. It will help ERI develop a video compression laboratory that will benefit industrial sectors in Egypt and other countries in the Middle East. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
