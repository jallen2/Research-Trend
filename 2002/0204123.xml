    <AbstractNarration>The Infinity Scholars program at Iowa Lakes Community College provides scholarship assistance to 32 academically talented, financially needy students enrolled full-time in computer science, computer technology, engineering and mathematics programs. The overarching goal of the program is to increase&lt;br/&gt;the number of talented, low-income students enrolled and retained in these degree programs&lt;br/&gt;enabling them to enter the high technology workforce. The program establishes and maintains an infrastructure of support services for Infinity Scholars that includes a one credit hour Infinity Scholars Course that concludes with the completion of a capstone project. The Infinity Scholars program focuses on &lt;br/&gt;delivering a menu of educational services and learning experiences that retain students and support a seamless transition to job placement upon degree attainment from the community college, or transfer of students to 4-year institutions.</AbstractNarration>
