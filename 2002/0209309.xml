    <AbstractNarration>The oceanic thermohaline circulation is strongly affected by localized&lt;br/&gt;dense-water formation in high-latitude oceans. Such dense water masses&lt;br/&gt;are released into the large-scale circulation in the form of ocean bottom&lt;br/&gt;density currents mostly from localized regions (e.g., Denmark Strait,&lt;br/&gt;Strait of Gibraltar for the Mediterranean overflow, Bab el Mandep Strait&lt;br/&gt;for the Red Sea overflow). Because of the small space and time scales&lt;br/&gt;required to resolve their dynamics, such density currents form the&lt;br/&gt;``bottle neck'' of the thermohaline circulation investigation. Despite their&lt;br/&gt;importance, we have a limited understanding of the dynamics of bottom&lt;br/&gt;density currents, and at present, the oceanic density currents are poorly&lt;br/&gt;represented in global climate simulations. The main goal of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;is to enhance the understanding of the dynamics of ocean bottom density&lt;br/&gt;currents from laboratory scale, to geophysical scale, through three-dimensional,&lt;br/&gt;nonhydrostatic numerical simulations. The investigators accomplish this&lt;br/&gt;in three stages. First, benchmark a parallel high-order spectral element&lt;br/&gt;Navier-Stokes solver, Nek5000, by reproducing existing laboratory results&lt;br/&gt;of bottom density currents by direct numerical simulations. Second,&lt;br/&gt;explore dynamics for which there are few or no laboratory results, in&lt;br/&gt;particular dynamics of bottom density currents protruding into a stratified&lt;br/&gt;fluid, and in a rotating environment. Third, bridge the gap between&lt;br/&gt;laboratory scale and geophysical scale by using large eddy simulations.&lt;br/&gt;Geophysical scale calculations are configured for the Red Sea overflow,&lt;br/&gt;and confirmed with data from the Red Sea Overflow Experiment. Various&lt;br/&gt;metrics are used to quantify density current dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variation of solar heating with latitude, and other factors, drive the&lt;br/&gt;so-called ``thermohaline'' circulation in the ocean, which is closely&lt;br/&gt;linked to the role that the ocean plays in climate dynamics. This complex&lt;br/&gt;geophysical problem, with its range of scales, physical, mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational constraints can only be approached through an orchestrated&lt;br/&gt;effort involving cross-disciplinary expertise. The investigators conduct&lt;br/&gt;physically-guided numerical simulations, quantify dynamical behavior of&lt;br/&gt;ocean density currents, and describe the impact of density currents on&lt;br/&gt;the climate. The investigators integrate this research project with&lt;br/&gt;education of three graduate students and contribute to the training of&lt;br/&gt;US technical workforce for the 21st century. This research project&lt;br/&gt;enhances the scientific understanding of oceanic density currents, and&lt;br/&gt;helps improve the representation of ocean density currents in global&lt;br/&gt;climate simulations and contribute to the climate change research.</AbstractNarration>
