    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The anaerobic oxidation of methane is a microbially-mediated process by which the &lt;br/&gt;reduction of sulfate is coupled to the oxidation of methane. This process is prevalent on a &lt;br/&gt;global scale and is estimated to consume between 12 and 50% the net modern &lt;br/&gt;atmospheric methane flux (70 to 300 Tg per year). The microbes responsible for this &lt;br/&gt;process are important as methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and their &lt;br/&gt;metabolism prevents large quantities of methane in the Earth from reaching the &lt;br/&gt;atmosphere. Despite the importance of this process, the responsible organisms have &lt;br/&gt;never been cultured in the laboratory. Recent studies conducted in our lab indicate that &lt;br/&gt;sustained growth of these organisms is possible in the laboratory given the appropriate &lt;br/&gt;conditions, especially elevated pressures of methane (50 to 150 atmospheres). We &lt;br/&gt;therefore propose to continue growth of these enrichment cultures, to characterize the &lt;br/&gt;microbial community composition and physiology of the enrichments, and to isolate the &lt;br/&gt;methane oxidizers. Specifically, we propose to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Characterize changes in microbial community structure as well as in methane and &lt;br/&gt;sulfate metabolism during growth of successive enrichment cultures, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Characterize growth of the CH4-oxidizing archaea in the enrichment cultures &lt;br/&gt;including species-specific analyses of growth rates, carbon conversion efficiencies, &lt;br/&gt;growth morphologies, and the impact of methane partial pressure, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Quantify isotope fractionation factors (for 13C and 2H) associated with methane &lt;br/&gt;oxidation and lipid biosynthesis, and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Isolate the responsible organisms using modified roll tubes at elevated (100 &lt;br/&gt;atmosphere) methane levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;In addition to the studies proposed above, this work will also lead to development of new &lt;br/&gt;methods for culturing strictly anaerobic bacteria and archaea at low temperatures with &lt;br/&gt;high gas pressures. These methods promise to enhance infrastructure for microbiological &lt;br/&gt;research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies also promise to enhance our understanding of anaerobic methane &lt;br/&gt;oxidation and to lay a foundation for future studies. The ability to grow the responsible &lt;br/&gt;organisms in the laboratory will allow for a variety of biochemical, genetic, physiological &lt;br/&gt;and molecular studies of this environmentally important process. Key questions that may &lt;br/&gt;be addressed in future studies include: 1) how is the stable methane molecule activated in &lt;br/&gt;the absence of oxygen?, 2) can this chemistry be applied to methane cracking in an &lt;br/&gt;industrial setting?, 3) what is the evolutionary history of anaerobic methane oxidation and &lt;br/&gt;how does it relate to the evolution of Earth.s climate system?, and 4) is the physiology of &lt;br/&gt;the isolate consistent with environmental observations of anaerobic methane oxidation? &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the physiology of these organisms and isolating them in the laboratory are &lt;br/&gt;the first steps in answering these and other important questions.</AbstractNarration>
