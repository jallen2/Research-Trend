    <AbstractNarration>This award is an Accomplishment-Based Renewal for the PIs to continue to develop mathematical models of seafloor hydrothermal processes. The award will support modeling studies divided into two main scientific themes: Stability and Temporal Variability. The models will be strongly linked to observations, and, hopefully, the model predictions will guide subsequent field efforts. The Stability theme addresses fundamental aspects of heat transfer across the basal boundary layer. The main objective is to develop a fracture mechanics model that yields heat and mass transfer in ridge crest systems that is consistent with observations and that addresses the stability and propagation of fractures at the base of the hydrothermal system. The Temporal Variability theme addresses processes of: (a) permeability evolution resulting from mixing between hot deep-circulating hydrothermal fluids and cooler, shallowly circulating seawater and (b) hydrothermal system response to earthquakes. Development of these models will be closely linked to various data sets including thermal and isotopic data from the EPR 9- 10N, the Souther EPR, and the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The Broader Implications of this research center on the training and education of both undergraduate students, suport of the RIDGE 2000 Integrated Studies (IS) program, and broa dissemination of research results.</AbstractNarration>
