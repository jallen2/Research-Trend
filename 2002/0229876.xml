    <AbstractNarration>EAR-0229876&lt;br/&gt;Susan Y. Schwartz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A first-order characterization of the seismogenic zone, including its geometry &lt;br/&gt;and up and down-dip limits is nearly established in northern and central Costa &lt;br/&gt;Rica. This was accomplished through the deployment of two onshore/offshore &lt;br/&gt;seismic networks directly above the seismogenic zone that were part of a &lt;br/&gt;MARGIN's funded multidisciplinary seismogenic zone experiment (CRSEIZE). This &lt;br/&gt;proposal seeks to: 1) use data collected during this experiment in conjunction &lt;br/&gt;with local network data to establish a similar first-order characterization of &lt;br/&gt;the seismogenic zone in Nicaragua; 2) perform a detailed investigation of the &lt;br/&gt;variations in the transition from inter to intra plate seismicity in northern &lt;br/&gt;Costa Rica and Nicaragua; and 3) evaluate thermal and mechanical models that &lt;br/&gt;have been proposed to control this transition. These golas will be accomplished &lt;br/&gt;by simultaneously inverting local travel time data in northern Costa Rica and &lt;br/&gt;Nicaragua to obtain an high resolution, three-dimensional, P and S wave velocity &lt;br/&gt;structure and accurate hypocentral locations. Earthquake locations coupled with &lt;br/&gt;focal mechanism determinations will allow the active seimogenic zone to be &lt;br/&gt;identified in southern Nicaragua, where the addition of stations from the &lt;br/&gt;northern Costa Rica (Nicoya) network greatly improves station coverage and &lt;br/&gt;hypocentral accuracy.</AbstractNarration>
