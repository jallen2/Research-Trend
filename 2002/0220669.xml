    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this program is to increase the number of economically disadvantaged&lt;br/&gt;students entering the technological workforce through the achievement of two specific&lt;br/&gt;objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1) increase the number of economically disadvantaged students graduating with&lt;br/&gt;mathematics degrees from Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) and&lt;br/&gt;2) increase the number of Northeastern Illinois University mathematics graduates&lt;br/&gt;going on to Ph.D. programs in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These objectives will be accomplished by creating a program at NEIU that&lt;br/&gt;supports, motivates and monitors student progress through their undergraduate or masters&lt;br/&gt;degree and by providing a bridge program to the doctoral degree in mathematics at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve students, ten undergraduate and two graduate students, have been selected as&lt;br/&gt;Chicago Math Scholars. Undergraduate scholars were recruited from undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;mathematics majors, from promising incoming high school students and from targeted&lt;br/&gt;community college transfer students. Scholars had GPA of 3.0 and were&lt;br/&gt;economically disadvantaged as determined by their eligibility for Pell grant awards.&lt;br/&gt;Graduate Chicago Math Scholars were selected from among those students admitted to&lt;br/&gt;the masters degree programs in mathematics at NEIU. Students were economically&lt;br/&gt;disadvantaged by virtue of their eligibility for Graduate Assistance in Areas of National&lt;br/&gt;Need (GANN) and express an interest in pursuing a Ph.D. degree in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Key strategies for achieving the program objectives include: the provision of&lt;br/&gt;tuition waivers and monetary stipends; mentoring of students by both undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate faculty; academic and personal support; career guidance and enrichment;&lt;br/&gt;technology training; professional development through activities such as membership in&lt;br/&gt;professional associations and conference attendance; job placement assistance;&lt;br/&gt;interaction with Ph.D. program faculty and students; GRE preparation courses; graduate&lt;br/&gt;seminars and orientation programs; and research participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northeastern Illinois University is an urban, comprehensive university, serving&lt;br/&gt;the northwest side of metropolitan Chicago. Seventy nine percent of its enrollment is&lt;br/&gt;comprised of first generation college students. Sixty four percent are female, 75.6%&lt;br/&gt;work full or part-time, and 60% receive some form of financial aid. NEIU is the only&lt;br/&gt;four year, federally designated, Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) in the Midwest. By&lt;br/&gt;virtue of its demographics, the students most likely to benefit from this program are&lt;br/&gt;under-represented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation's report "Science and Engineering Indicators&lt;br/&gt;2000l" notes that only 2.2% of all graduate students in mathematics and computer science&lt;br/&gt;are Hispanic. In 1997, only 34 Ph.D. degrees were awarded to Hispanics in math or&lt;br/&gt;computer science. By facilitating student retention, graduation and transfer to Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;programs in mathematics, this program has the potential to significantly impact the&lt;br/&gt;number of under-represented minorities attaining advanced degrees in mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;who are prepared to enter the U. S. technological workforce at the highest levels.</AbstractNarration>
