    <AbstractNarration>Since the seminal studies of Darwin and predecessors, multiple hypotheses have been proposed concerning evolutionary relationships among the barnacles of the world. However, because of the strange and diverse morphologies associated with this most interesting group of crustaceans, discerning evolutionary relationships has been particularly difficult. Furthermore, most modern attempts have been hampered by poor sampling of species diversity. This international collaborative study will examine a broad array of barnacle species from around the world by sequencing DNA from multiple gene regions to infer evolutionary relationships among the major groups of barnacles. The project will use state-of-the-art automated sequencing techniques combined with supercomputing applications for estimating genealogical relationships among the species sampled.&lt;br/&gt;The resulting genealogical relationships will then be used to explore biogeographic patterns of biodiversity among the barnacles. These biogeographic patterns allow global inferences of patterns of diversity (conspicuously absent for marine fauna in general) thus informing global conservation decisions. These results will be disseminated to the public through the Tree of Life web project (tolweb.org - also supported by NSF). This research represents a strong global collaboration, with co-Principal Investigators from the US, Denmark, and Australia and collaborators from many other countries including Brazil, Russia, and Spain, combining leading expertise in crustacean molecular systematics with barnacle morphology. This project will also provide educational/training opportunities for undergraduates, high school teachers, graduate students, post-docs, and international faculty through research experiences and lab exchanges of personnel.</AbstractNarration>
