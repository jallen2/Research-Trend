    <AbstractNarration>This dissertation investigates how sibling-headed households (SHH) in Namibia cope with the loss of both parents to AIDS. In 2000, 16% of Namibian children were orphans. The research will measure the actual and perceived support received by SHHs. How much instrumental, emotional, and informational support are provided by the children's networks? Which SHHs receive more support and how do contextual factors help explain those differences? Interviews, observation, and surveys will help map children's networks and the resources they receive from them.</AbstractNarration>
