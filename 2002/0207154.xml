    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #0207154&lt;br/&gt;PI: Yanni Zeng&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Alabama Birmingham&lt;br/&gt;Title: Conservation laws with partial dissipation in continuum mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with systems of conservation laws (balance laws), a broad class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) arising from continuum mechanics. Of special interest are equations with partial dissipation, including hyperbolic-parabolic systems, hyperbolic systems with fading memory, and hyperbolic systems with relaxation. The purpose of the research is to obtain a better understanding of the underlying physical phenomena through the study of the qualitative behavior of the solutions of the PDEs. The first objective is to obtain the nonlinear stability of shock profiles for hyperbolic systems with relaxation, including fully dissipative systems and those containing one non-decaying wave in a linearly degenerate field (systems of composite type). The second objective is to obtain a similar stability result for initial boundary-value problems for hyperbolic-parabolic systems, especially to understand the effect of the boundary. The third objective is to extend the study to contact discontinuities and rarefaction waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research conducted under this award is relevant for the study of compressible viscous flows, the motion of viscoelastic materials, gas dynamics in thermal nonequilibrium, and magnetohydrodynamics. By including viscosity, heat conduction, electrical resistivity, excited internal structures of molecules, chemical reactions, and so on we focus on mathematical models that are closer to the real world than the traditional ideal ones. The project has three specific objectives. The first objective is to understand the stability properties of shock profiles in, for example, high-temperature gas flows when the internal structure of molecules and chemical reactions are no longer negligible. This problem arises, for example, at the reentry of a space shuttle into the atmosphere and is quite different from the traditional supersonic flight of an airplane. The second objective is to better understand gas flows near a solid surface. The third objective is to study more complete wave patterns in several cases.</AbstractNarration>
