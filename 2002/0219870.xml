    <AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;0219870&lt;br/&gt;PI: Morris Chang&lt;br/&gt;Iowa State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thesis of this project is very simple: the performance of garbage collection is critical to the successful deployment of distributed Java embedded systems. Applications for such systems have different operating requirements than applications written for desktop or server environments. They include frequent software update, low power consumption, low resource availability, distributed computing capability, and real-time operating constraints. Therefore, garbage collectors for such devices must be designed to support those requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Garbage Collection (GC), or automatic dynamic memory management, is one of the many attractive features available in Java. It allows programmer to be more productive and software to be more robust. On the other hand, it is also notorious for being intrusive and consuming large amount of power due to frequent memory accesses. As a result, the garbage collection can severely degrade the performance and affect the viability of Java embedded devices.</AbstractNarration>
