    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will study combinatorial models of &lt;br/&gt;categories of perverse sheaves on spaces which carry important &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial and representation theoretic information, mainly &lt;br/&gt;flag varieties and toric varieties. The models use data obtained &lt;br/&gt;from natural symmetries on these spaces via the moment map. These &lt;br/&gt;methods will be applied to problems in representation theory, &lt;br/&gt;including Lusztig's conjecture on modular representations and &lt;br/&gt;Beilinson, Ginzburg and Soergel's theory of Koszul duality for &lt;br/&gt;Lie algebra representations. The PI and his collaborators will &lt;br/&gt;develop computer algebra software to do computations with these&lt;br/&gt;models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves geometry related to representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;Representation theory studies ways to present a given algebraic &lt;br/&gt;object, usually a group of symmetries, as a collection of linear &lt;br/&gt;transformations. It has applications to many fields, from number &lt;br/&gt;theory to mathematical physics. An important thread in modern &lt;br/&gt;representation theory involves extracting algebraic information &lt;br/&gt;from the geometry of an associated space, which is generally also &lt;br/&gt;intrinsically beautiful in its own right.</AbstractNarration>
