    <AbstractNarration>0217830&lt;br/&gt;Sengupta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is for support of a joint research project by Dr. Arun Sengupta, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Dr. Ulker Beker, Department of Chemical Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey. The primary area of collaboration will encompass the preparation and characterization of Magnetically Active Polymeric Particles (MAPPs) for passive environmental monitoring. Partially sulfonated polymer beads will be prepared and magnetized in Lehigh University using the three-step procedure. Magnetic susceptibility of the particles will be determined at Lehigh University. One portion of the MAPPs will be sent to Dr. Beker in Turkey where she will carry out a series of sorption equilibrium studies with MAPPs, using both simulated and industrial wastewaters containing chlorinated hydrocarbons and other volatile organic compounds. Sorption studies will be carried out for multiple cycles with different batches of MAPPs. Propanol will be used as the regenerant for desorption. Subsequently, these MAPPs will be brought to Lehigh University by Dr. Beker. Magnetic susceptibilities of MAPPs after various cycles will be determined at Lehigh University and compared with the magnetic susceptibility of the parent MAPPs. The resulting information on sorption isotherms along with magnetic susceptibility data will help evaluate the effectiveness of MAPPs as recyclable passive monitoring agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project will allow a US scientist to collaborate with a Turkish scientist in the area of nanoparticle development for environmental applications. The research could lead to the development of technologically important materials, and to products for environmental cleanups, especially of environmental hazards such as organics and metal ions from waste. The project will involve the training of a U.S. graduate student. The Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems provide funding for this project.</AbstractNarration>
