    <AbstractNarration>This is a proof of concept project in which software modules that support the development of a variety of computer game genres are developed. These software modules can be used to teach undergraduates computer game design and development. The software can also be used as a shell for explorations of many computer science disciplines for undergraduates where students can replace one of the modules with their own, thereby allowing them to concentrate on specific CS disciplines ranging from basic data structures and algorithms, to database management, issues in concurrent programming, design of network protocols, distributed systems and security, graphics programming, user interface design, and design of artificial intelligence algorithms; but still having the ability to create a computer game. The computer gaming context provides a very strong motivational construct to which most computer science students have a natural affinity. Placing these disciplines within the construct of a computer game helps students concretize and apply the concepts studied. The software is developed by University of Michigan undergraduate and graduate students. The results and software of this project are disseminated to the broader computer games and computer science community via appropriate conferences and the Internet. At the University of Michigan, the PI has been offering a Computer Games course since 1997 and the coPI has been teaching a Computer Networks course. Both PIs have developed pedagogical software packages in their respective fields that have been used by faculties in other universities nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
