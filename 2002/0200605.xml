    <AbstractNarration>The PI and his collaborators, will continue their investigation of the&lt;br/&gt;relations between periods and special values of&lt;br/&gt;L-functions. Specifically, those pertaining to the conjecture of Bloch&lt;br/&gt;and Beilinson for elliptic curves and those implied by Borel's theorem&lt;br/&gt;for a number field and their connection to the Mahler measure of&lt;br/&gt;Laurent polynomials and the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's research area is in Number Theory, a very old subject with&lt;br/&gt;connections to every other conceivable area of Mathematics as well as&lt;br/&gt;Physics. It is remarkable how the type of questions one would like to&lt;br/&gt;answer in Number Theory, for example, can we write the number 1 as the&lt;br/&gt;sum of the cubes of two rational numbers?, which at the time of Fermat&lt;br/&gt;(1600's) say, most likely had no direct implications to everyday life,&lt;br/&gt;have evolved into highly relevant issues today. In our current&lt;br/&gt;technology age, Number Theory is behind much of the safety of common&lt;br/&gt;activities like, for example, shopping on the internet. The PI's&lt;br/&gt;specific research concerns L-functions, certain analytic objects one&lt;br/&gt;associates to questions like the one above, which are central to&lt;br/&gt;modern Number Theory and from which one expects to, and often does,&lt;br/&gt;retrieve answers.</AbstractNarration>
