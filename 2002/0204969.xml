    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0204969&lt;br/&gt;Thomas G. Goodwillie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to continue our investigations in several versions &lt;br/&gt;of "functorial calculus". Each of these is a technique that &lt;br/&gt;exploits multirelative connectivity estimates to describe &lt;br/&gt;continuous functors in some context in terms of special values; &lt;br/&gt;for example a functor of spaces might be recovered from its &lt;br/&gt;values at highly connected spaces, or a functor of subspaces &lt;br/&gt;of a manifold from its values at low-dimensional subspaces, or&lt;br/&gt;a functor of real inner product spaces from its values at high-dimensional spaces. Part of the proposal is to refine &lt;br/&gt;the purely homotopy-theoretic version of "calculus". Other &lt;br/&gt;parts are concerned with combining several versions and &lt;br/&gt;applying them to various questions in both high- and&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional differential topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each "functorial calculus" mentioned above is so called &lt;br/&gt;because of a not-entirely-fanciful resemblance to the &lt;br/&gt;ordinary diferential calculus of Newton and Leibniz. &lt;br/&gt;Sometimes a fact about numbers is best proved by placing &lt;br/&gt;it in a context where the number is part of a huge family of&lt;br/&gt;numbers -- a numerical function. Properties of the function &lt;br/&gt;then lead, by general theorems of calculus that may seem a &lt;br/&gt;bit magical when encountered for the first time, to a &lt;br/&gt;computation of the number. So it is here: sometimes a fact &lt;br/&gt;about some geometrically defined object is best proved by&lt;br/&gt;placing it in a context where the object is part of a huge &lt;br/&gt;family of such objects -- a functor -- and using some magic &lt;br/&gt;of a more modern kind. This analogy may show something of &lt;br/&gt;the flavor of the work; the content is harder to get at, &lt;br/&gt;because most of the "geometric" objects in question are&lt;br/&gt;connected to everyday reality by rather long chains of &lt;br/&gt;abstract ideas.</AbstractNarration>
