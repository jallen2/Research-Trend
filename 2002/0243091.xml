    <AbstractNarration>Description: This award supports the US-India cooperative research project entitled &lt;br/&gt;Modeling of Physical Conditions in High Z Protogalaxies. Professors Gary Ferland, University of Kentucky and Raghunathan Srianand, Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics will jointly study star formation activity in proto-galaxies. The research objective is to develop a model of the physical conditions in high redshift proto-galaxies by combining high quality observational data with extensive modeling of the physical conditions. While there is a wealth of observational information, modeling efforts have thus far failed to take into account all of the relevant physical processes simultaneously in a cosmological setting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together the unique computer modeling expertise of the US investigator and the extensive observational experience of the Indian investigator. The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune is one of India's premier institutions. This joint project will allow computer simulations to directly address questions concerning the origin of galaxies and the establishment of the galactic environment around us today. India's Department of Science and Technology (DST) jointly supports this research under the NSF/DST program.</AbstractNarration>
