    <AbstractNarration>This work investigates the numerical and analytic solution of inverse&lt;br/&gt;spectral problems in one and two dimensions. In one dimension, the&lt;br/&gt;appearance of an eigenparameter in the boundary condition of a&lt;br/&gt;Sturm-Liouville problem causes a loss of self-adjointness. Although&lt;br/&gt;uniqueness of the inverse problem has been established, there are no&lt;br/&gt;constructive schemes available that lend themselves to numerical&lt;br/&gt;computation. This work (with William Rundell) develops and analyzes two&lt;br/&gt;constructive schemes involving to recover the potential in this type of&lt;br/&gt;problem. In two dimensions, the eigenvalues of particular membranes are used&lt;br/&gt;to find an approximation to a function representing the nonhomogeneity in&lt;br/&gt;the boundary value problem governing the elastic membrane. Projection of the&lt;br/&gt;boundary value problem and its coefficients onto appropriate vector spaces&lt;br/&gt;leads to a matrix inverse problem, which is solved using optimization&lt;br/&gt;techniques. This work will consider various domains and investigate the&lt;br/&gt;recovery of multiple coefficients. Theoretical questions regarding circular&lt;br/&gt;domains will also be investigated. In particular, the recovery of a radial&lt;br/&gt;density using techniques from differential geometry and the properties of&lt;br/&gt;the radial spectrum of a vibrating circular membrane will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many situations in which it is not practical to measure an object's&lt;br/&gt; properties directly. Doctors do not perform surgery to determine the size&lt;br/&gt;of a brain tumor prior to a patient's treatment. An engineer does not&lt;br/&gt;dismantle an airplane to determine the level of corrosion in its wing.&lt;br/&gt;Instead external measurements of an object are made and used to determine&lt;br/&gt;the internal properties of the object. This research focuses on the use of&lt;br/&gt;vibrational information to determine physical parameters of an object. If&lt;br/&gt;these parameters are known, the vibration is modeled mathematically by a&lt;br/&gt;boundary value problem. If the parameters are not known, but the vibration&lt;br/&gt;is known, then the problem to be solved is an inverse boundary value&lt;br/&gt;problem - also known as an inverse spectral problem. This project develops&lt;br/&gt;several constructive algorithms for the solution of this type of problem. It&lt;br/&gt;is important to realize that while mathematical inverse problems often have&lt;br/&gt;multiple solutions, their physical counterpart may not. Choosing the&lt;br/&gt;"correct" solution is also addressed in this work.</AbstractNarration>
