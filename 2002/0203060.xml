    <AbstractNarration>0203060&lt;br/&gt;Dillon, Laura&lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Automating Development of Interactive Distributed Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive distributed applications (IDAs) are software applications that involve direct interaction with users and are distributed across a computer network. IDA development is complicated by application characteristics such as interactivity, concurrency, non-determinism, heterogeneity, and severe resource constraints. Current software development tools address some of these complications, but development environments supporting integrated use of IDA development tools are lacking. The postdoctoral research associate will work on the integration and validation of Meridian, a collection of tools designed to help automate the development of IDAs. Specifically, the associate will 1) research the automated generation and integration of analysis tools that are easily and efficiently integrated into a comprehensive environment, and 2) perform case studies of different classes of IDAs and populate class-specific IDA information repositories for reuse.</AbstractNarration>
