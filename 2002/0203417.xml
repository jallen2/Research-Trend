    <AbstractNarration>Aschbacher and S. Smith recently completed the classification of the finite&lt;br/&gt;simple quasithin groups. This work fills a significant gap in the&lt;br/&gt; classification of the finite simple groups. Aschbacher and Smith are&lt;br/&gt; editing their manuscript to make it ready for publication. Aschbacher&lt;br/&gt; is continuing his project to produce a unified, accessible, and&lt;br/&gt;complete treatment of the existence, uniqueness, and structure of the&lt;br/&gt;sporadic groups. He is writing up his work on recognition theorems&lt;br/&gt; for small groups with one class of involutions. He is working with&lt;br/&gt; R. Guralnick and K. Magaard on lower bounds on the genus of coverings&lt;br/&gt; with a classical monodromy group. He is investigating the p-radical&lt;br/&gt;subgroups of the sporadic groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are algebraic objects of crucial importance in mathematics; for&lt;br/&gt;example they are the basis for the study of symmetry. Finite groups can&lt;br/&gt; be decomposed into building blocks know as ``simple groups"; the&lt;br/&gt; classification theorem lists the simple groups explicitly.&lt;br/&gt; Together with descriptions of the structure and representations of the&lt;br/&gt;simple groups, the classification theorem forms the foundation for the modern&lt;br/&gt;theory of finite groups. Several years ago it was discovered that an&lt;br/&gt; important case in the classification had not been completely treated.&lt;br/&gt; Aschbacher and his collaborator S. Smith have now dealt with this case and&lt;br/&gt;are readying their manuscript for publication, in order to place the&lt;br/&gt;classification theorem on solid ground. The completion of this work,&lt;br/&gt; together with efforts to answer certain questions about the structure&lt;br/&gt; and representations of the simple groups, make up the project.</AbstractNarration>
