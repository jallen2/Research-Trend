    <AbstractNarration>Exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a fact of life for organisms living in&lt;br/&gt;the photic zone of aquatic environments. It is increasingly evident that zooplankton,&lt;br/&gt;phytoplankton, protozoa, and bacterioplankton exhibit taxon-specific differences in&lt;br/&gt;physiological and behavioral responses to UVR exposure. Although competition for&lt;br/&gt;nutrients is recognized as a critical factor in structuring plankton community&lt;br/&gt;composition, nothing is known of the significance of UVR under natural conditions for the&lt;br/&gt;intensity of competition among plankton for limiting mineral nutrients. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will help to fill this gap in knowledge. We will examine the main and&lt;br/&gt;interaction effects of the nutrient and UVR regime on the growth rates and competition for&lt;br/&gt;phosphorus of naturally occurring phytoplankton and bacterioplankton. A model is&lt;br/&gt;presented and predictions made regarding the severity of nutrient competition under a&lt;br/&gt;range in conditions of nutrient (organic carbon and phosphorus) ratios and UVR exposure.&lt;br/&gt;We predict that, because of differential effects on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton&lt;br/&gt;growth rates, UVR will modify the severity of competition between phytoplankton and&lt;br/&gt;bacterioplankton for phosphorus. Using samples collected from a low-altitude reservoir in&lt;br/&gt;north Mississippi, experiments will be conducted to test the model predictions. This&lt;br/&gt;study fulfills two needs. It will be the first to evaluate by experimentation using&lt;br/&gt;natural sunlight the interaction effects of UVR and the nutrient regime on growth rates of&lt;br/&gt;autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton under various degrees of nutrient limitation.&lt;br/&gt;Second, it will provide knowledge of the influence of the UVR regime on the relative&lt;br/&gt;importance of autotrophic and bacterial heterotrophic production in a southern U.S.&lt;br/&gt;aquatic ecosystem, where, compared to higher latitudes, there has been very little&lt;br/&gt;research on the ecological significance of UVR. Students will be involved in all aspects&lt;br/&gt;of the project, from planning to sampling to data analysis to presentation. With&lt;br/&gt;anticipated continued increases of UVR in temperate regions due to ozone depletion, the&lt;br/&gt;effect of UVR on plankton trophic-level relationships constitutes a timely and important&lt;br/&gt;problem.</AbstractNarration>
