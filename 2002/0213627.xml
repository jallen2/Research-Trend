    <AbstractNarration>Over the past 6 years the principal investigators have developed a &lt;br/&gt;methodology for assessing the risk associated with maritime&lt;br/&gt;transportation. The methodology utilizes dynamic simulation of the&lt;br/&gt;maritime transportation system, expert judgment elicitation models and&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) techniques. The approach has proven&lt;br/&gt;useful in three major maritime ports in the United States i.e. Port of&lt;br/&gt;New Orleans (Mississippi River in Louisiana), Port Valdez (Prince&lt;br/&gt;William Sound in Alaska) and Port Seattle (Puget Sound in Washington&lt;br/&gt;State). Two of these studies focused on passenger safety, while the&lt;br/&gt;other focused on oil transportation risk. The National Research Council in&lt;br/&gt;1998 assessed the methodology and concluded that representation of uncertainty &lt;br/&gt;in the maritime risk assessment method is lacking. "The Prince William Sound &lt;br/&gt;Risk Assessment is an important step forward in using probabilistic risk &lt;br/&gt;assessment methods to assess the safety of transporting oil in large tankers&lt;br/&gt;in PWS. Because the data were very limited, the analysis results and the resulting&lt;br/&gt;conclusions are not robust and are necessarily uncertain [National Research&lt;br/&gt;Council, 1998]."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF project will allow the maritime risk assessment method to live&lt;br/&gt;up to its promise by developing a coherent theoretical framework to&lt;br/&gt;address uncertainty. The truth is that we are uncertain. Therefore,&lt;br/&gt;speaking the truth implies that we express our analysis results in terms&lt;br/&gt;of probability curves rather than fixed points estimates. [See, e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;Kaplan, 1997]. The intellectual merit of the research stems from the&lt;br/&gt;development of an overarching Bayesian framework for addressing&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty when simulation of systems states is combined with available&lt;br/&gt;data and expert judgment to assess risk and risk intervention&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness. The broader impact of the proposed work is primarily&lt;br/&gt;drawn from its applicability to areas other than maritime accident risk&lt;br/&gt;such as e.g. maritime security risk (intentional events as opposed to&lt;br/&gt;accidents). The framework and methodologies to be developed will be&lt;br/&gt;applicable to other transportation modes, such as aviation or road&lt;br/&gt;safety. Aside from aviation security and accident risk, the technique&lt;br/&gt;will be directly transferable to the ever-increasing problem of runway&lt;br/&gt;incursions as a result of increased traffic congestion at our national&lt;br/&gt;airports.</AbstractNarration>
