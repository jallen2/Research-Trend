    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will enable groundbreaking experiments that seek to apply the "bottom-up" approach of atomic and molecular manipulation to several focused areas in science and technology. The primary experimental apparatus for these investigations is a custom-built low-temperature scanning probe microscope capable of both studying and controlling matter at atomic length scales. The tunneling mode of the apparatus will be exploited to perform scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) within an environment comprised of ultra-high vacuum, ultra-low temperature down to 500 mK, a high magnetic field up to 14 T, and a multiple-probe sample stage for performing simultaneous electron transport measurements. Achieving these challenging conditions requires the acquisition of the specialized equipment described in this award. Undergraduate and graduate students working directly on these projects will integrate and operate the proposed instrumentation to perform state-of-the-art experiments. In synergy with these laboratory components, this instrumentation will critically augment a substantial educational and outreach program already being implemented by the PI and Stanford University.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will enable groundbreaking experiments that seek to apply the "bottom-up" approach of atomic and molecular manipulation to several focused areas in science and technology. This scientific effort is interdisciplinary in nature, centering on physics and materials science but involving ideas, techniques, and conundrums from other fields such as chemistry, engineering, and information technology. The primary experimental apparatus for these investigations is a custom-built scanning probe microscope capable of both studying and controlling matter at atomic length scales, requiring the acquisition of the specialized equipment described in this award. Undergraduate and graduate students working directly on these projects will integrate and operate the proposed instrumentation to perform state-of-the-art experiments. In synergy with these laboratory components, this instrumentation will critically augment a substantial educational and outreach program already being implemented by the PI and Stanford University. Through these multifaceted contacts between the research agenda, students, and people outside the laboratory, the proposed instrumentation will have a broad and unique impact beyond the traditional realm of experimental science. In recognition of the importance of this award, Stanford University is providing cost-sharing funds amounting to 50% of the funds provided by NSF.</AbstractNarration>
