    <AbstractNarration>Glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone (CORT), are an important group of steroid hormones that modulate cellular and behavioral responses to stress. Their action can involve genomic mechanisms in the cell nucleus, and also much faster non-genomic actions involving receptors on the cell membrane. The cellular mechanisms mediating responses to acute, as distinct from chronic, stress are still not well understood. Recent evidence suggests that CORT interactions with behaviorally important peptide hormones, in particular arginine vasotocin (AVT), are critical during acute stress. This project examines how CORT and AVT interact within brain cells in response to acute stress, using the salamander as a novel and accessible system to combine biochemistry with behavior. The interactions of the hormones in triggering intracellular biochemical signaling pathways will be tested in specific contexts, in terms of behavior and neuroendocrine state. Results will be important for understanding fundamental cellular mechanisms of stress hormone action in vertebrates.&lt;br/&gt; The impact will extend beyond neuroendocrinology to endocrinology and stress-related behavior, as well as cell biology related to signaling. Valuable training of students at several levels in this productive laboratory also will continue to include students with handicaps and those from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
