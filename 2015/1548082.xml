    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project represents a new approach to online academic competition, one that may perhaps incite a shift in the market-based reform movement's present focus on increasing competition at the institutional level toward cultivating it at the grass roots level, that is, at the level of the individual student. Prevailing academic theory suggests that academic competition, well-structured, not only can lead to healthier peer dynamics but also to significant improvement in learning outcomes. Given the importance of mathematics to all fields of fundamental science and engineering, and the tendency of mathematics competitions to attract participants in greater number than other subjects, this project may well become a vital ally to the NSF mission. And if the structure of competition contemplated here proves sound, if students increasingly replace the remote/joystick in their hands with a textbook, or a Chromebook more specifically, the benefit to society in terms of a more educated populace could be substantial. Moreover, the commercial potential of this product may be greater than almost any other approach imaginable. From connecting two U.S. first graders studying arithmetic in a 1-1 match to hosting a Physics championship where high school students from around the world take part, the possible reach of this application is remarkable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical innovation contemplated in this proposal will mark a fundamental advance on existing, generally available web-based technology focused on the delivery of academic competition in two ways. First, it will allow students to identify opponents of similar academic ability and then schedule mutually convenient competitions with them fueled by multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions stored in the system, a content database eventually spanning every grade level and course. In addition, it will make possible the hosting of massive online competition events where potentially millions of students might log in simultaneously to compete for the title of champion of any given subject, first nationally and eventually world-wide. Going forward, special emphasis will be placed on mobile optimization in anticipation of the growing trend toward such devices, especially given the likelihood that student utilization of the proposed functionality will more often occur outside the classroom. The ultimate goal of this project is to emerge with a platform that leverages classic game mechanics to motivate students to learn.</AbstractNarration>
