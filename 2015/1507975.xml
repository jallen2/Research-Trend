    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor McCarley of Louisiana State University is developing optical methods for detecting specific proteins in biological cells in a highly efficient and selective manner. To meet this challenge, the McCarley group is designing and making, and implementing in human cell studies, a new series of smart dye molecules that are sensitive to the presence of specific protein analytes within the cells. The highly interdisciplinary approach provides an enriched learning environment for a team whose training and diversity make it possible to capably address measurement science challenges that span the physical and biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is development and evaluation of new dye molecules whose fluorescent signal can be switched on, or the existing fluorescence can be changed to another energy, as a result of target analyte action on the dye molecules. The responsive dyes in this project are designed to selectively respond to the presence of particular enzymes, for example cancer-linked enzymes that are highly populated only within human cancer cells. High-integrity detection and differentiation of cancer cells from normal cells with the fluorescent dyes is being demonstrated by use of microscopy and cell counting methods. The broader impacts of this project include proven routes for the high-fidelity detection and imaging of cancer cells; the interdisciplinary training of scientists in a diverse, rich educational environment, that will enable them to address the ever-growing complexity of scientific challenges; dissemination of the work to scientific peers and the public through professional society meetings and public presentations; and the opportunity to influence female pK-12 students through high-impact outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
