    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on a new paradigm for Big Data computing, namely a Datacenter-on-a-Chip (DoC) consisting of thousands of cores that can run compute- and data-intensive applications, orders of magnitude more efficiently compared to existing platforms. Indeed, nowadays data centers and high performance computing clusters are dominated by power, thermal, and area constraints; they occupy large spaces and necessitate sophisticated cooling mechanisms to sustain the required performance levels. In contrast, this project relies on emerging many-core processors that can run Big Data applications while provisioning the system resources for the necessary power/performance/thermal trade-offs. Consequently, various big data applications like social computing, life sciences, networking, or entertainment, can benefit immensely from this new design paradigm that aims at achieving server-scale performance from hand-held devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work introduces a new direction in networked system design enabled by the emerging wireless on-chip interconnect paradigm. Indeed, achieving DoC level of massive integration requires significant innovation at multiple levels of abstraction, ranging from the design of the on-chip network and associated physical layer, all the way to mapping and runtime management of various applications. To this end, the research goals include:&lt;br/&gt;- Design of a small-world wireless network architecture as a communication backbone for manycore-enabled wireless DoC (WiDoC) &lt;br/&gt;- Design methods at physical layer for highly-integrated 3D wireless DoC suitable for low latency data communication &lt;br/&gt;- Evaluation of various latency-power-thermal (LPT) trade-offs for the proposed WiDoC platform with relevant big data applications.&lt;br/&gt;While most of the prior work considers 2D many-core platforms where communication happens through wired links, this proposal redefines the very foundations of on-chip communication via 3D small-world network architecture with sub-THZ wireless links in the planar layers and inductive coupling-based wireless interfaces in the vertical direction; this allows for full flexibility and reconfiguration and makes such platforms suitable for processing big data applications at unprecedented levels of energy efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is unique as it brings together highly novel and interdisciplinary concepts from network-on-chip (NoC), wireless, and complex networks, communication circuits, and optimization techniques aimed at single chip solutions for achieving data center-scale performance. The educational contribution of this work will help establishing an interdisciplinary research-based curriculum for high performance many-core system design meant to increase the number of students attracted to this area of engineering.</AbstractNarration>
