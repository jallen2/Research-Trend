    <AbstractNarration>The current unprecedented rate and scale of climate change has raised concern about the effects of climate on the biosphere and the onset of a "6th mass extinction" of life on Earth. Biologists have widely documented how plants are influenced by their local environment. Recent findings support the idea that the influence also flows in reverse: where plants grow and how they function can directly modify both local and global scale climate. Yet beyond a few specific examples, researchers have not explored the multiple roles plants play in the climate system. Swann's work to date has demonstrated that changes in where plants grow in the Arctic, mid-latitudes, and tropics can alter local climate and influence atmospheric circulation at global scales, causing changes in patterns of where rains with consequences for plants that live in locations far from the original change. In other words, there can be unanticipated, globally reaching effects from changes in where ecosystems are located and how they respond to changes in their local environment. However, the question remains, could the response of ecosystems alter climate enough to accelerate the Earth system's response to change or create oscillations? This research will focus on critical unanswered questions about when, where, how, and over what timescale ecosystems change the behavior of Earth in response to big changes including past and future climate change. Swann will address these questions using a numerical simulation models that range in complexity from primarily conceptual models to full global climate models that include dynamical interactions in ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific community currently lacks an understanding of where and how ecosystems modify the climate system. Knowing the role that ecosystems play in modifying how the Earth functions is crucial for predicting how climate will change under conditions that are different from today. Additionally, this research will help to identify the most impactful aspects of ecosystem dynamics and the most sensitive regions on Earth therefore guiding future research into aspects of the Earth system responsible for producing the greatest uncertainty. This project will integrate the scientific themes of Swann's research into teaching and outreach at all levels (K12, undergraduate, and graduate) through formal and informal education providing a strong foundation for career-long integration of research and teaching. The proposal will directly support the development of project-oriented approach in an out-of-school program for middle school girls (still underrepresented minorities in STEM) at the Burke Museum. The joint research and educational efforts aim to engage and inspire students of all ages in better understanding of the interaction between components of the Earth system as well as a greater appreciation for the scientific process itself.</AbstractNarration>
