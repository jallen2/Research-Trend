    <AbstractNarration>In this CAREER project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division and the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, Professor Amanda Morris of the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is exploring the optical and electronic properties of metal organic framework thin films arrays. The goal of the project is to learn how to control these properties and aid in the development of artificial photosynthetic assemblies capable of converting solar energy into chemical fuels for long-term storage and use. The project addresses critical, present-day environmental and energy technology challenges at the interface of many scientific disciplines (chemistry, physics, and biology). At the high school level, four laboratory modules are being developed to complement the Virginia Standards of Learning through the full sequence and scope of the high school science program. These modules provide laboratory experiences with real-world applications to a diverse population of students and afford the opportunity for teachers to apply the curriculum to one of today's most active research fields. This component feeds into a new undergraduate course entitled "Energy Sources of the Future," which promotes undergraduate research experiences, emphasizes the cross-disciplinary nature of energy science, and involves literature studies, guest lectures, and laboratory experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are a class of solid-state inorganic-organic hybrid materials that combine the stability of heterogeneous materials with the synthetic diversity of molecular complexes. The research aims to discover the relationship between the molecular and three-dimensional structure of metal organic frameworks and observed electron transport properties. In this project, a series of systematically varied metal organic framework structures are explored to: (1) Elucidate the mechanism of electrochemical electron transport through MOF thin films; (2) Determine the contributions of electronic and ionic diffusion to apparent ambipolar diffusion coefficients; (3) Uncover the guiding principles to efficient photo-induced charge transport in MOF arrays. These objectives are accomplished through the correlation of structure, as determined by crystallography, to efficiency and mechanism, as measured by electrochemistry and pulsed-laser spectroscopy. As part of the proposal, a hands-on educational program capitalizes on the breadth and appeal of the research area to educate future scientists and teachers at the high school level</AbstractNarration>
