    <AbstractNarration>This research program proposes to investigate substances sometimes found in sweat, such as protein, which can detect health and disease (biomarkers). The sweat is a biofluid that can provide a window to a person's health. At this time, there is no rapid method to measure the changes in proteins in the sweat that signal disease. The goal is to measure changes in these proteins in the sweat before, during, and after physical activity, including measuring levels of stress hormones and immune markers using a low cost and disposable point-of-care biosensor. In essence, the aim of this proposal is to develop a cheap and disposable patch sensor that can be worn on the skin, and eventually become as widely used as the box of bandages or oral thermometer found in most home medicine cabinets. One of the key engineering roadblocks to such a device is the availability of a low-cost manufacturing technology that can be combined with state-of-the-art biomarker proteomic detection technology to diagnose and monitor multiple diseases with medical laboratory level sensitivity. This proposal presents a new approach combining low-cost commercial display technology (found in your TV, computer monitor, or cell phone) with protein microarray printing technology to fabricate a low-cost, disposable skin patch for more effective self-management of patient health care in the home or in other non-clinical settings. The measurements will be available in real time for both patients and their caregivers using smart-phone technology. To meet this research objective, a fabric-like flexible skin patch is proposed that would provide non-invasive monitoring of multiple biomarkers in human sweat. This new approach is designed to use existing commercial manufacturing technology that can be readily adapted to produce hundreds of millions of devices per year at a cost of only a few dollars each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program proposes to utilize multiple proteomic research platforms (mass spectrometry, protein, and antibody microarrays) to establish a profile of the sweat proteome that will have a fundamental impact on furthering the biological understanding of sweat and skin, and transition high-cost fluorescent-based assay platforms into a low-cost, disposable, highly sensitive fluorescent point-of-care based assay that is minimally to non-invasive. Highlights of the proposed development effort include: a detailed proteomic analysis utilizing mass spectrometry as well as custom protein and antibody microarrays for the discovery of proteins and antibodies present in sweat; development and optimization of the biosensor's optical and electronic components for the utilization of low-cost fluorescent recognition lateral flow assay; development of fluorescent recognition lateral flow assays utilizing identified serum and sweat biomarkers and the integration of the assay with our optical biosensor. This research program accelerates the development of technology that will transform healthcare from reactive and hospital-centered to preventative, proactive, evidence-based, and person-centered. This next generation health care solution will provide breakthrough sensor technology for in-home monitoring. This transformation in healthcare is especially critical for immune-compromised individuals, such as organ transplant recipients, cancer patients, post-operative patients, and the elderly.</AbstractNarration>
