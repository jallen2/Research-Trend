    <AbstractNarration>Because faults can be barriers to underground fluid flow, they influence groundwater supply, contaminant transport, petroleum production, and underground waste storage. Natural cements commonly precipitate along fault zones; these cements can dramatically inhibit fluid flow across a fault. However, determining the distribution of fault zone cements is difficult. As a result, fault-zone cementation is typically not accounted for in estimates of the impact of faults on fluid flow. This study aims to take advantage of unique electrical properties of natural cements to characterize the three-dimensional spatial distribution of cement for an exceptionally well-exposed fault zone. Then, the hypothesis that the degree and continuity of fault-zone cementation is a key control on fluid flow will be tested by drawing water from wells adjacent to the fault. The results of this project can be applied to better understand contaminant transport in faulted aquifers, the characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs, and induced seismicity associated with wastewater injection. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved with all stages of the project, which will enhance education for underrepresented minorities at New Mexico Tech (NMT), a Hispanic-serving institution with a focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In addition, the geophysical equipment and groundwater wells used in this project will be long-lasting teaching resources both for NMT and for summer field courses sponsored by other universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to characterize field-scale permeability across a fault and link the hydrogeologic behavior of the fault to spatial variations in the degree of fault-zone cementation. The central hypotheses are: 1) there are more pronounced variations in the degree of cementation down-dip than along the strike of the fault because the up/down-section variations in grain size are larger than those along strike, and 2) extensive cementation does not reduce cross-fault permeability at the field-scale (i.e. the de facto hypothesis for hydrogeologic models that neglect the potential effects of fault-zone cementation). The proposed project comprises: 1) characterizing the degree and extent of cementation along the surface exposure of the fault; 2) collecting resistivity and chargeability data in transects across the fault, deriving empirical relationships between the degree of fault-zone cementation and normalized chargeability for shallow portions of the fault, and using those relationships to map the estimated degree of cementation for deeper portions of the fault; 3) coring the fault at depth to confirm the degree of cementation; and 4) conducting well tests to determine permeability across the fault in both strongly- and weakly-cemented sections. The study will generate geologically based geophysical observations, providing a unique 3D map of cementation patterns from the land surface to ~30 m depth, in transects covering &gt;700 m along the strike of the Loma Blanca fault. Interpreting well tests across the fault in the context provided by the geologic and geophysical observations will allow for the development of a holistic view of fault-zone permeability, improving predictive models of the hydrogeologic impacts of faults.</AbstractNarration>
