    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Groups, Geometry, and Three-manifolds" will be held May 21-22 at the University of California in Berkeley, California. This conference will bring together a number of experts in "Thurstonian" three-manifold topology and related areas to discuss their latest research, as well as to talk about where the subject may be headed. In addition to the speakers, the grant will fund the participation of a number of faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions, as well as early career researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proofs of the virtual Haken conjecture and the virtual fibering conjecture by Agol have moved the study of three-manifolds into an exciting new stage. Although these central problems have been resolved, there remain many exciting directions to pursue. At this conference experts in the field will give talks on topics such as: random methods in three-manifolds, deformations of geometric structures, algorithmic methods in three-manifolds, Dehn surgery and the space of all three-manifolds, and hyperbolic geometry. Participants will also be asked to contribute to a new problem list in Thurstonian geometry and topology, and this problem list will be published on the conference website: https://sites.google.com/site/groupsgeometry3manifolds/</AbstractNarration>
