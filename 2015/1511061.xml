    <AbstractNarration>The award will provide funding for U.S. student participation in the 19th Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference organized by the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute. The conference this year will be held in Bethesda, MD on July 14-16. The conference will focus on catalyzing innovation in the areas of environmental-friendly chemistry and chemical engineering. Student support will be directed toward travel scholarships to attend the conference, registration fees for students, a judged student poster session, and defraying expenses of instructors for a one-day free student workshop before the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference reaches beyond the normal curriculum for undergraduate and post-graduate students. It will introduce them to the broad range of technical innovations and opportunities available in the vitally important areas of energy sustainability and the environment. These are areas of extreme importance to our nation's future and quality of life in general. The conference will catch many of these students at a time when they are considering career paths, and it will open up a broad vista of exciting opportunities. In addition they will learn how to conduct outreach activities and advocate for green chemistry and chemical engineering in their local communities.</AbstractNarration>
