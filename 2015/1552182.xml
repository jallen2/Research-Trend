    <AbstractNarration>PI: Kelley, Douglas &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1552182&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this CAREER proposal is to explore the fluid dynamics effects that are important in the performance of batteries that utilize liquid metals as electrodes. Such batteries hold a strong promise for energy storage applications on an electrical grid with intermittent energy sources, such as one based on renewable energy sources. The PI proposes to use alloys that are liquid at lower temperatures (at about 160C) instead of currently applied options, where operations at temperatures in the range of 550C are used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The battery behavior is viewed from the transport phenomena point of view, where fluid flow, mass and heat transfer are limiting the battery performance. Prior work has focused on materials and chemistry. In a liquid metal battery, fluid flow brings reactants about 10 mm to the interface where primary reactions charge and discharge the battery, removes reacted material, and prevents the formation of undesirable solids. The questions to be addressed in this work include: Which boundary layer - viscous, thermal, or electromagnetic - mediates mass transport? How does flow affect growth and erosion of solid phases? How do solid phases affect flow? How do size and aspect ratio affect the relationship between inputs and outputs? How does the mass transfer rate depend on temperature difference and current density?</AbstractNarration>
