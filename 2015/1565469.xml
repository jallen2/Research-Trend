    <AbstractNarration>Nanomaterials can be designed and created with both imaging and therapeutic function for medical applications. These materials are expected to be important for future personalized medicine. This I-Corps team will explore the use of a new nanomaterials platform of light-emitting silicon nanocrystals as bioimaging markers and therapeutic agents for medicine. Silicon nanocrystals offer unique properties that might be used in humans to provide valuable medical information without toxic side-effects. The I-Corps team will determine the clinical need and market fit for biocompatible silicon nanocrystals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed biocompatible and non-toxic silicon nanocrystals that are bright emitters of near infrared light. The nanocrystals can be dispersed in water, tethered with molecular recognition molecules, or coated with surfactant for introduction into living systems with specifically engineered interactions with different cell types. The potential exists to use these materials for medical imaging and therapeutics. The silicon nanocrystals can be used to generate singlet oxygen or heat to trigger a therapeutic response or to act as a drug-release trigger. In this project, the I-Corps team intends to take the first step towards commercialization by identifying a possible formulation with a specific medical application with commercial potential by conducting market research.</AbstractNarration>
