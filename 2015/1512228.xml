    <AbstractNarration>PI Name: Susannah L. Scott&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1512228&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sustainable production of important chemicals and fuels at large scale can be achieved by using renewable resources such as non-food biomass. The selective conversion of biomass-derived carbohydrates to specific chemicals in liquid water using porous solid catalysts is controlled in part by the molecular movement of biomass derived carbohydrate molecules into the porous structure of the catalyst, as well as the movement of products out of the porous structure. This project will study the fundamental science underlying the interactions between water, catalyst pore structure, carbohydrates, and products using high resolution measurement techniques which probe the molecular interactions of these materials. The outcomes of the research may suggest ways to adjust the catalysis process to achieve higher yield and selectivity of products in shorter times. Through this research, students will be given opportunities for advanced training at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research is to understand the interactions between water, biomass-derived carbohydrates, and furan-based products within porous catalysts. The use of lignocellulosic biomass on the scale required for significant production of carbon-based fuels and chemicals will likely involve continuous liquid-phase processing with heterogeneous catalysts in many of the chemical conversion steps. Various components of the reaction medium, including solvent, reactants, intermediates and products, will partition within the porous catalyst material. Differential absorption of molecules into the pores and their specific adsorption onto the pore walls are hypothesized to have profound consequences for selectivity, based on observations of dramatic effects in mixed solvent systems where an organic solvent is combined with water. To elucidate the nature of the interface confinement at the molecular level and to quantify the extent of these interactions, the research will use ex-situ and in-situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) monitoring of solid-liquid interfaces, via the use of specially designed high temperature-high pressure magic-angle-spinning probes, to assess local structures of carbohydrate-derived molecules and their rates of transformations in porous materials such as zeolites, mesoporous silicas and organosilicas, and carbons. This information will be combined with calorimetric measurements that probe the thermodynamics of absorption/adsorption phenomena, and gravimetric measurements to probe their kinetics. As part of this research, students will be trained on advanced NMR techniques through the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Knowledge gained on the behavior of interface-confined species will identify pore structures that select for reactants, promote desired reactions and expel specific desired products, such as furanics.</AbstractNarration>
