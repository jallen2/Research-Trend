    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating III-V Nitride piezoresistive microcantilever based neutron detector technology to fill the critical technology gap in the neutron detection area arising out of severe worldwide shortage of He-3. The translated technology has the following unique features: (i) vacuum enclosure of the microcantilever sensors, which will result in highly sensitive detection of nuclear radiation, as well as protection of the sensor from environment and unwanted radiation enhancing sensor reliability; (ii) possibility of using arrays of sensors realized through microfabrication techniques, which can offer imaging capabilities and directionality information; (iii) the usage of bimodal detection technique and two functionalization layers to perform highly efficient and unique detection of neutrons. Thus, it provides exemplary performance, cost savings and efficiency when compared to the leading competing neutron detection technology based on Boron-10 in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by using a relatively inexpensive material with unique material properties and adopting a design strategy involving the design features mentioned above, resulting in a novel neutron detector prototype. The partnership engages Savannah River National Laboratory to provide guidance in the He-detection market space and other aspects including prototype testing and technology commercialization, as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be in several tens of millions of dollars in the next eight years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this highly critical neutron detection market space. The societal impact, long term, will be in the creation of high-tech workforce and a safer society with vastly mitigated nuclear related threats.</AbstractNarration>
