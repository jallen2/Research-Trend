    <AbstractNarration>T1554531 (Hoque)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER grant is aimed at developing an Integrated Urban Metabolism Analytical Tool (IUMAT) to evaluate and predict the impacts of energy and water use, land use, and transportation systems at an urban scale. IUMAT is designed to systematically quantify aggregate impacts in terms of performance metrics, such as GHG emissions and energy use.The PI will develop new methods and analytical tools for three different modules that operate within the IUMAT framework - Energy &amp; Water, Land Use, and Transportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will involve compiling and analyzing data from varied sources as well as developing statistical methods to identify the relationships between modules. An interdisciplinary team-based undergraduate course will be developed to evaluate the effectiveness of sustainable urban programs. Students will also have additional research opportunities to evaluate sustainability initiatives in collaboration with UMass Facilities. STEM workshops and internships on urban sustainability will be developed for middle and high school girls through a STEM program called Eureka! The modules will be tested and validated using real world contexts; and the PI will create case studies and develop decision tools that will inform the sustainable planning process. Collaborative partnerships with local planning agencies will be formalized through a Planning Stakeholders Advisory Board that will provide guidance and datasets for evaluating the credibility and usability of IUMAT modules.</AbstractNarration>
