    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to prepare a novel biodegradable magnesium alloy containing alkaline earth metals for commercialization by developing structure-property relationships between microstructure, degradation behavior, and mechanical behavior. With mechanical properties close to that of a traditional metal and the bioabsorbability of a polymer, magnesium has the potential to outcompete both classes of material as an orthopedic implant. These magnesium alloys can offer benefits to patients across a wide range of applications in the $50 billion implant market, and are particularly well suited to compete in the $500 million suture anchor market. Beyond advancing a particular alloy forward towards commercialization, this Phase I will result in a new understanding of how microstructure impacts degradation and mechanical properties, adding crucial data to the fledgling field of magnesium implants. In the near future, these medical devices will offer improved outcomes to patients, while becoming a dominant force in the implant market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is derived from the development of structure-property relationships between microstructure and both degradation and mechanical behavior. Sufficient mechanical integrity and an appropriate degradation rate are critical to the success of bioabsorbable mechanical implant, and these relationships must be established prior to broad in-vivo testing. The studies will consist of a suite of microstructural modification, in-vitro degradation testing, and bulk mechanical testing. The critical factors being considered are grain size, texture, precipitate morphology and volume fraction, degradation testing, compression, and tension testing. Once relationships between these variables are known, implants can be designed with optimized, and even tailored, properties for a given patient.</AbstractNarration>
