    <AbstractNarration>1550316&lt;br/&gt;Arias Chavez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membrane fouling limits achieving energy efficiency of membrane technologies for water treatment. This results in economic, environmental, and energetic penalties on potentially new applications of membranes for resource reclamation. The PI has recently determined that polyamide morphology can vary significantly across membrane surfaces and that some regions can have a very low surface roughness. The proposed study will improve the scientific understanding of the relationship between thin-film composite membrane structure and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An in-depth, localized evaluation of the low-roughness regions of these membranes is proposed to: (1) better understand and quantify the polyamide layer structure in these regions, and &lt;br/&gt;(2) demonstrate that high standards for membrane permeability and selectivity are maintained in these local regions. Electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and surface titration methods will be used to obtain additional quantitative information about the structure of the polyamide layer in low-roughness regions. New equipment for testing active layer membrane permeability and selectivity will be developed to allow membrane transport performance to be measured on the same scale (&lt; 1 cm2) as roughness characterization work. This work, if successful, will demonstrates that low-roughness polyamide regions retain excellent permeability and selectivity, and will serve as a proof-of-concept for the development of a new line of membranes effective against foulants of all types rather than just one type of foulant. To increase outreach and diversity, the PI will partner with a local high school to involve the students in thinking about decentralized water treatment technologies. Some of these technologies will also be used to make environmental engineering compelling and understandable to middle-school-aged girls at the annual Engineering the Future outreach event held at the</AbstractNarration>
