    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to better understand the final fates&lt;br/&gt;of massive stars. At the end of their lives, all stars more than&lt;br/&gt;roughly ten times the mass of our Sun build an iron core which&lt;br/&gt;collapses from the size of the Earth to the size of a city once&lt;br/&gt;its mass exceeds a critical limit. In many cases this results in an&lt;br/&gt;luminous, supernova explosion, but there is increasing evidence&lt;br/&gt;that this is not the only outcome. This work will (a) discover&lt;br/&gt;or set useful constraints on the fraction of massive stars that&lt;br/&gt;produce a black hole without a supernova explosion; (b) clarify&lt;br/&gt;the boundary between the least luminous supernova explosions and the&lt;br/&gt;variability of massive stars that does not lead a supernova explosion; and (c)&lt;br/&gt;measure the properties of these stars just before their deaths,&lt;br/&gt;including pioneering studies of their variability. The project&lt;br/&gt;will advance our scientific understanding of these massive stars&lt;br/&gt;while training the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research steps for a better understanding of the fates of&lt;br/&gt;massive stars include using unique, multifaceted observational and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical approaches. The centerpiece is a project using the&lt;br/&gt;twin 8.4m Large Binocular Telescope to monitor all the massive&lt;br/&gt;evolved stars in 27 nearby star-forming galaxies. The primary&lt;br/&gt;goals are to:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Discover or set interesting constraining limits on the&lt;br/&gt; fraction of core collapses that fail, producing a black&lt;br/&gt; hole without a supernova explosion;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Measure the properties of SN progenitors while pioneering&lt;br/&gt; studies of their variability and binarity;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Explore the boundary between the faintest SN and stellar&lt;br/&gt; outbursts, in particular by better understanding the nature of&lt;br/&gt; the SN "impostors" and the SN2008S class of dusty transients.&lt;br/&gt;While doing so, the project will advance the training of students and&lt;br/&gt;post-docs and broaden the public's understanding and interest in science,&lt;br/&gt;aided by their fascination with stars and their complicated roads to&lt;br/&gt;death.</AbstractNarration>
