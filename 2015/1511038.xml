    <AbstractNarration>1511038 &lt;br/&gt;Beckman, Eric J. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh and the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research at Carnegie Mellon University will host Engineering Sustainability 2015: Innovation and the Triple Bottom Line in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from April 19-21, 2015. This Engineering Sustainability conference will include participants from many professional realms, and will focus on issues related to engineering sustainable built environments and water infrastructure. These topical areas are inherently interdisciplinary, but also have engineering as the foundation for progress. Intellectual merit includes that this conference will bring together engineers and scientists from academia, government, industry, and non-profits to share results of cutting edge research and practice directed at development of environmentally sustainable buildings and infrastructure, especially urban water infrastructure. The conference is unique in its focus on environmentally sustainable engineering for the urban environment, and its ability to bring together engineers, architects, economists, and urban planners and managers. The attendance goal is 375 participants. Plenary talks and concurrent oral and poster sessions will be organized around the following themes: green building design and construction; greening the indoor environment; sustainable distributed power for the built environment; sustainable urban drinking water, stormwater, and wastewater infrastructure; design of more sustainable transportation grids; using principles of sustainability to foster innovation and new product development. There will also be numerous planned opportunities for informal exchanges and networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Sustainability 2015 will further the public interest in sustainable community infrastructure by advancing the state of scientific knowledge of issues affecting human health and the environment. This conference will also enhance interdisciplinary dialogue on environmental sustainability research with cross-cutting applications in both basic and applied sciences. The conference will have significant participation from students and young faculty members, who are so important to the next generation of innovations. The interdisciplinary presentations on cutting edge research in sustainable engineering for the built environment and infrastructure, the mixture of disciplines and backgrounds represented among the participants, and the networking opportunities provided by the conference will enable participants to leave the conference with new information and ideas about research needs and opportunities. This will strengthen the ability of the participants to develop novel and impactful proposals to NSF and other organizations funding research in sustainability science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
