    <AbstractNarration>The conference "New Techniques in Birational Geometry" will be held in the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University on April 7-11, 2015; it will be preceded by a one-day mini-school for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The conference is centered around recent advances on the "rationality problem" in algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies systems of polynomial equations -- ubiquitous in mathematics, science, and engineering -- by looking at the geometry of the set of solutions. A system of polynomial equations is called "rational" (respectively "unirational") if there is a polynomial function whose outputs always give solutions of the system, and such that a general solution occurs among the outputs of this function exactly once (respectively only a finite number of times). This property is of great practical value, but unfortunately it is notoriously difficult to tell whether a given system is rational or unirational. The conference will bring together experts to discuss recent progress on this open problem; it will foster interactions between experts in different fields, and it will train young mathematicians in these important techniques. This award supports participation, primarily by junior researchers, in the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the conference will explore four themes related to rationality questions:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Algebraic cycles and Hodge theory&lt;br/&gt;(2) Derived categories&lt;br/&gt;(3) Bridgeland stability conditions&lt;br/&gt;(4) Birational geometry&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature presentations by leading experts in these areas. Throughout the history of algebraic geometry, the "rationality problem" has been a touchstone, motivating major progress in Hodge theory (the Clemens-Griffiths theorem disproving the Lüroth conjecture), the minimal model program (the Iskovskikh-Manin theorem and Mori's proof of the Hartshorne conjecture), invariant theory (Saltman's negative solution of Noether's problem), and étale cohomology (the Artin-Mumford theorem solving the stable Lüroth problem). Although the problem has many direct applications, its main value has been inspiring new techniques and serving as a point of contact between different areas. There have been major recent advances on the rationality problem in several parts of algebraic geometry, and this is a rare moment of opportunity to bring together researchers with complementary expertise. Indeed, a complete solution, for instance in the case of cubic fourfolds, likely requires multiple approaches, and there are few mathematicians expert in all these areas. There will be a number of activities specifically for junior participants (such as a one-day mini-school introducing some of the topics), and an effort will be made to recruit a diverse body of participants.
