    <AbstractNarration>CBET - 1506072 McKenna, Gregory B.&lt;br/&gt;CBET - 1506079 Zia, Roseanna N.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colloids are dispersions of particles in a liquid, such as water, and the particles are so small that they do not separate for very long times. The materials are widely used in commercial products such as paints and inks. They are also believed to be a good model materials for glasses. The present work is a collaborative study that combines experiment and large scale computer simulations that will provide novel scientific understanding of the behavior of colloidal glasses and comparisons will be made with knowledge from the literature concerning molecular glasses in similar conditions. Graduate and high school students will participate in the research activities at both PIs' institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding dynamical arrest in complex matter is a great challenge in soft matter science. Most study of colloidal systems near jamming assumes parity with corresponding behavior in molecular glasses. Yet, recent studies reveal non-equilibrium responses in colloids that differ qualitatively from glassy dynamics as monitored via the Kovacs signatures, viz., the intrinsic isotherm, the asymmetry of approach, and the memory effect. The proposed study will illuminate the structural underpinnings of such differences through a novel combination of experiment and dynamic simulation. The structure and dynamics will be determined in experiments analogous to the Kovacs experiments for molecular glass-forming systems. Here stimulus-responsive particles will change diameter at constant number density to create concentration-jump conditions to mimic the temperature-jumps of the Kovacs signature experiments. Concurrent simulations will effect similar conditions in silico. Experiment and simulation will inform and validate each other and the joint interrogation of the colloid dynamics near to the jamming transition will potentially create a transformative understanding of arrested states in soft matter. In a broader sense, this is a collaboration of two very different PIs. One is an expert in the experimental physics of molecular glasses, especially aging. The other is an expert in large scale computer simulation, with emphasis on colloidal systems. The result provides unique cross-disciplinary training to graduate students in both computational and experimental physics, deepening their knowledge of the fundamentals of dynamics and aging of molecular and colloidal glasses. Further, women and under-represented minorities will play a central role as undergraduate and graduate researchers.</AbstractNarration>
