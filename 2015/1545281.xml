    <AbstractNarration>Mayflies represent more than 3000 species that occupy freshwater habitats on all continents except Antarctica and are an integral part of aquatic ecosystems, including serving as a major component of the diet of freshwater fish. Despite the roles they play in aquatic systems, and their popularity as a lure for fishing, many important biological aspects of this insect group remain unanswered. It is not known how the different branches on the mayfly tree of life fit together, and therefore the implications of their phylogenetic history are unclear. For example, it is uncertain if the first mayflies had movable or immobile gills running along their backs. Deciphering these patterns could provide insights into the evolution of insect wings and whether they came from ancient movable gill-like structures or not. This project will improve our knowledge of this important insect group by creating a diverse collection of species located around the world, from different aquatic habitats and environments. The morphology and genomics of these insects will be studied in greater detail than before, to understand their evolutionary history and adaptations. Outcomes of this project will further research in stream ecology, and water pollution, as mayflies are a key indicator of the health of aquatic environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of a robust mayfly phylogeny has limited the ability of researchers to test hypotheses concerning evolutionary adaptations. This project will enhance the understanding of mayfly phylogeny and evolution using novel and transformative methods to elucidate relationships and morphological during the history of the group. This project will reconstruct a robust mayfly phylogeny, using next generation sequencing methods and phylogenomic analyses, to better understand morphological and genetic trends within mayflies and gain insights regarding evolutionary adaptations. This project will provide excellent research opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in meaningful scholarly and creative activities. This will be accomplished by carrying out smaller research projects on a subset of mayfly taxa (e.g., a family or superfamily), which will ultimately contribute to the comprehensive phylogeny for the order. Students will be mentored in all phases of phylogenetic research, from collecting, generating data, analyzing data, and communicating results at scientific meetings, in publications, and in outreach efforts to the community. Thus, the main outcomes of the project will be: 1) increase in knowledge of mayfly evolution and phylogenetics; 2) opportunities for undergraduate evolutionary research; 3) development of state-of-the-art curriculum for the primarily undergraduate institution Utah Valley University; 4) partnerships with local public schools; 5) establishment of a strong international collaborative network in mayfly research; including coordinating efforts to contribute to efforts such as the online database Encyclopedia of Life, which provides species-level information to serve the scientific community, educators, and the general public; and 6) significant positive impact on the institution and the researcher's career.</AbstractNarration>
