    <AbstractNarration>A conference entitled, "Computational Biofluids in Physiology 2015 (CBP 2015)", will be held at the University of Utah on May 14-15, 2015. Computational biofluids is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of mathematics, physics, computing, engineering, and biology. Although classical biofluids problems such as low Reynolds number locomotion have been studied theoretically for decades, the studies were limited to problems that were analytically tractable. These problems can now be probed with greater depth and biological relevance using computational methods. The power of personal computing combined with development of new algorithms has led to a revival of research in biofluids. Problems in physiology relating to the function of heart valves, the mechanics of blood clotting, and the mechanics of motile cells are also now being investigated using novel applied mathematical techniques and computational models. Integrative research on these biological and physiological processes has the potential to lead to medical advances such as the prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer metastasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The applied mathematics community has played a central role in the resurgence of biofluids by developing theories, algorithms, and models aimed at answering fundamental biological and physical questions. While some in this community focus primarily on computation and numerics, others stay closer to the biology or physics of the problem at hand. This meeting on "Computational Biofluids in Physiology 2015" will bring together mix of senior and junior researchers from mathematics, computational science, and the life sciences in a small, exceptionally interactive setting. Invited speakers and poster contributors will present work on computational methods for fluid/structure interaction, cellular mechanics, locomotion, and systems physiology.</AbstractNarration>
