    <AbstractNarration>This project extends the frontier of search theory to shed light on three economic problems. The first asks how we should expect rejection rates at colleges to vary with caliber, and inquires whether they are informative measures of excellence. Preliminary research suggests that rejection rates might be reverse quality measures at the very best colleges. The second application explores the economics of optimal liquidation, such as transpired with the Resolution Trust Corporation in the 1990s or prior to the famous bankruptcy of Lehman-Brothers in 2008. Early work reveals, among other things, how an optimal selling strategy proceeds far more slowly at lower interest rates, formalizing an insight publicized by Alan Greenspan. The third develops a theoretical analysis of the economics of web search, such as occurs in web sites like Amazon; among early findings are that the seller need not find it most profitable to make a maximally informative search engine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project pursues two dynamic programming projects in search theory, and one directed search model. The first project incorporates insights from auction theory into a directed search problem that is motivated by the journal submission and college application processes. As the rank of the journal or college rises, its standards rise and its applicants improve. But it is not obvious that rejection rates must rise and in fact, with complete information, early results suggest that they do not. The two dynamic programming exercises explore two inherently nonstationary search models. The first is how does one optimally unwind a large position in an asset when facing periodic arrivals of buyers willing to buy portion at a specified price. Among many key results, most important is the "decreasing returns to optionality" that the value function is concave in the position - but the marginal value is convex. The second dynamic programming exercise explores how one optimally searches among many ranked options. This arises in web search, and this model is tractable enough to produce many novel usable comparative statics.</AbstractNarration>
