    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Colorado at Boulder to develop a massively parallel high spatio-temporal resolution scanning microscope subsystem. The objective of this project is to develop to the point of commercial transition a radically new microscopy concept suitable for quantitative live cell studies with single molecule sensitivity. The widespread dissemination of high spatio-temporal resolution high-sensitivity microscopy could impact multiple fields of science and engineering such as 3D biophysical and biomedical imaging of labeled biomolecules inside and outside of cells. The project will also stimulate cooperative relations with industry to transfer innovations into applications. The dissemination plan offers a pathway from proof of concept to commercial development. Partner biologists at the University of Colorado will help validate the new instrument. The project has identified commercialization pathways that include development through a startup company, partnering for manufacturing and distribution, and exploring licensing agreements. The project also integrates interdisciplinary education and outreach with research and development. It will provide training to young scientists and engineers with opportunities for interdisciplinary research in microscopy labs. The outcomes of the project will be widely disseminated in publications, via outreach to the general public and middle school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system overcomes limitations of traditional optical confocal scanning techniques by providing higher resolution and faster imaging. The new capabilities are realized using minimally invasive fluorescence techniques. Because biologists are currently constrained by the limited spatial - temporal resolution, and/or depth penetration of existing optical microscopes, the applications of the proposed instrument are far-reaching, with use in tracking changes within multi cellular structures, as well as in monitoring interactions between molecules.</AbstractNarration>
