    <AbstractNarration>A synthesis team (Integrated Carbon and Water for Ecological and Biogeochemical Synthesis, ICWEBS) will be established to evaluate and coordinate approaches for making best use of atmospheric data collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). This will be facilitated by organizing a symposium that will bring together 80-120 experts in the field, followed by workshops. The symposium will result in a series of recommendations for calibration and processing of data that is collected by NEON, as well as examples of how the NEON data can be integrated with other data sets. Several tangible outcomes will emerge form the proposed work: 1) video tutorials that will be open to students and early career scientists and made available via the internet, 2) articles that will be published in widely read scientific journals or an edited book. Through these communications, ideas on how to make best use of atmospheric data collected by NEON will be made available to a wide variety of institutions throughout the United States. The workshops will provide learning opportunities for early career scientists and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will provide the scientific community data on isotopes of water and carbon dioxide at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales. This data along with appropriate theoretical frameworks will enable the community to make significant advances in understanding carbon and water exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere. A synthesis team (Integrated Carbon and Water for Ecological and Biogeochemical Synthesis, ICWEBS) will be established to evaluate and coordinate approaches for making best use of isotopic data collected by NEON. The synthesis team will organize a symposium involving 80-120 participants to be held late September 2016 near a NEON core site. This symposium will be followed up with workshops with ca 20 people involved in each. By providing: 1) specific recommendations for calibration and processing approaches for the NEON isotopic data streams, 2) examples of the integration of NEON into models of varying levels of complexity, and by 3) broadening of the awareness and utilization of the isotopic data, the proposed workshops will provide the scientific community with the best approaches and most effective ways of using the isotopic data collected by NEON. Peer reviewed articles resulting from the workshops will be disseminated widely in journals and/or an edited book.</AbstractNarration>
