    <AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays. VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. This award supports scientists at California Polytech State University to carry out research with VERITAS. The group will work on improved gamma-ray detection algorithms for VERITAS and use the improved sensitivity to study acceleration mechanisms in active galaxies and to search for dark matter. Undergraduates will be involved in the research. The group will work with the Center for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education to communicate the physics of black holes and high energy gamma-ray emission to students. They will also work with teachers in the Student Teacher and Research program and develop teaching supplements that can be used in middle school curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VERITAS has embarked upon a broad program of Galactic and extragalactic source observations, as well as studies of signatures for new physics such as dark matter. With this award the California Polytech State University group will work on improvements to the stereo reconstruction algorithm, focusing on the gamma-ray shower impact position, zenith, azimuth, shower height, and energy. Undergraduates in the group will use the improved detection algorithms to analyze blazar data. The group will study observations of dwarf galaxies to look for signatures of dark matter.</AbstractNarration>
