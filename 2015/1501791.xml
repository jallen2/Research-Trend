    <AbstractNarration>As the western United States experiences continuing drought conditions, irrigation efficiency and water conservation are more critical than ever before, creating a need for irrigation technicians with state-of-the-art skills. To address this need, Modesto Junior College (MJC) will implement an Agriculture Irrigation Technology program. The project will increase the number, and improve the preparation and technical expertise of irrigation technicians and designers who are prepared to improve agriculture water management, increase irrigation delivery system efficiency, and enhance on-farm water conservation. Three specific objectives support the goal of the program: 1) Develop and deliver standardized curriculum that advances the efficient design and use of irrigation systems and can be replicated at other institutions; 2) Create a pipeline of skilled, certified technicians that meet current conservation, efficiency and water management regulations; and 3) Increase recruitment and success rates for underrepresented students in agricultural science technical programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific activities will include development of a new associate degree, an Irrigation Technology Summer Institute to increase the recruitment and retention of typically underrepresented students in this field, on-site student advising, hands-on experience with state-of-the-art technology, and industry internships. A new curriculum will combine a strong foundation in science, including critical components of plant science, soil science, hydrology, and meteorology with cutting edge technology that enables workers to accurately put water when and where it is needed. This program is contributing to the improvement of student learning and preparation in multiple agricultural science areas, and has relevance for animal science, plant and crop science, environmental horticulture, as well as other agriculture disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
