    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Protein Folding Dynamics "Folding: The Landscapes of Natural and Synthetic Life" will be held at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas, January 10-15, 2016. The meeting will bring together senior scientists, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students from a wide range of interests and approaches to protein folding dynamics. The nature of the conference allows close interaction among participants, who can share their ideas and results. By bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics and biology to explore recent exciting developments in this field in a concrete forum that encourages open discussions from researchers working on different systems, the new paradigm of cross-disciplinary research is strengthened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will assemble experimentalists and theoreticians to discuss basic issues in protein folding dynamics and their role in function, in the evolution of protein sequences and in disorders associated with protein misfolding. It has become increasingly clear that understanding the details of protein folding dynamics is crucial in describing virtually all processes of life, including protein synthesis, co-translational folding, protein allostery, protein function and diseases related to protein misfolding. The conference will cover a range of topics namely in vitro and in vivo folding, protein aggregation, protein evolution and design, and the role of protein dynamics in function. The 2016 conference is expanding to include complete formal sessions on protein evolution and the folding of non-biological foldamers and even complete chromosomes. This expansion was partly in response to requests from previous years' participants but also the current organizers believed that extending the range of topics would add to the intellectual merit of the conference. Participants will able to spend time together over a week of talks and presentations, thus allowing synergy of ideas and identification and solutions of a variety of problems.</AbstractNarration>
