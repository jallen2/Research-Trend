    <AbstractNarration>This project supports a small workshop that will provide opportunities for participants to discuss current research, address key outstanding questions, and stimulate future research ideas on the role of nitrate radical chemistry in the formation of small particles in the atmosphere in regions where there are emissions of volatile organics from the biosphere. A deeper understanding of this chemistry will provide improved constraints on model predictions of aerosol formation and their effects on climate and air quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will involve researchers with expertise in laboratory, field, and modeling together to identify laboratory studies (e.g., kinetics, mechanisms, products, etc.) to obtain a deeper understanding of the chemical interactions between biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) and nitrate radicals (NO3). The workshop will include early-career scientists and established scientists, as well as a number of younger researchers (post docs and students).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected results of the workshop are: (1) a review paper on BVOC+NO3 chemistry; (2) a list of key scientific questions to be addressed and directions for future fundamental studies on the oxidation of BVOCs with nitrate radicals; (3) a list of critical measurements and types of studies (e.g., chamber experiments, flow tube studies, wet chemistry, etc.) needed to address the key scientific questions; (4) collaborative research proposals that may be submitted to various funding agencies; and (5) the publication of new findings on key scientific topics identified at the workshop in a special issue in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.</AbstractNarration>
