    <AbstractNarration>This project provides funding for travel support for early career U.S. researchers and graduate students to attend a workshop on "Comparative Geodynamics and Tectonics of Venus, Earth, and Rocky Exoplanets" to be held in Pasadena, California, in early May of 2015. NASA missions to Earth-like planets, such as Venus, indicate that the geodynamic processes operative on these planets differ substantially from the plate tectonic processes that operate on Earth. Importantly, the tectonic processes on Venus may provide clues as to how tectonics operated on the early Earth more than 2.5 billion years ago. The evidence for the nature of early Earth tectonics is scant, having been either obliterated or substantially modified by younger events. This workshop will bring together scientists studying Earth, Venus, and rocky exoplanets to explore the role of key factors that control tectonic and geodynamic processes and to compare planetary evolutionary paths within the solar system. The proposed workshop has potential to benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women in STEM; (2) development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through involvement of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and early career researchers; and (3) increased partnerships between academia and NASA/Jet Propulsion Lab scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the grand challenges of Earth science research, few have implications as broad as understanding the origin of plate tectonics. Several models developed over the last few decades aim to simulate the development of plate boundaries, localization of large-scale deformation, as well as the link between internal circulation of the mantle and the presence of plates. Achieving the next level of understanding may require determining the conditions under which plate tectonics does not develop. The study of Venus, a planet similar in many respects to Earth, provides a point of reference for alternative global tectonics modes. It may be possible to find similarities between Venus and the geological record of the Archean eon on Earth. The "Comparative Geodynamics and Tectonics of Venus, Earth, and Rocky Exoplanets" workshop aims at building an interdisciplinary scientific community that joins Early Earth studies and planetary sciences. These communities are often separate, but have much to learn from each other. The workshop will be used as springboard to build new interdisciplinary collaborations and develop idea for developing an infrastructure to bridge these communities. The workshop paticipants will discuss: (1) salient geological evidence, especially tectonics, of Archean Earth and of Venus to draw comparisons; (2) global geodynamic processes that control the composition and thermal evolution of planets, including Early Earth; and (3) advances in planetary observations, geological observations, and modeling.</AbstractNarration>
