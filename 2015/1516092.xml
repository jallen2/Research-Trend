    <AbstractNarration>Cyber criminals are pushing Internet security and cybercrime prevention strategies to the limit. As attacks become more sophisticated, defenses must stay one step ahead. A cybersecurity workforce with an abundance of skilled workers is a key component of these defenses. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to produce cybersecurity workers equipped with the knowledge and skills to produce the next-generation defenses. Felician College has a rich source of students that includes underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students, women, non-traditional adults, and former military personnel. These populations will bring unique perspectives and experiences to the cybersecurity field, which are currently lacking. As a small private institution, Felician can also pilot cutting-edge cybersecurity educational programs and develop cyber security-specific pedagogical methods that work with small-school infrastructures. This knowledge has the potential to change the cybersecurity landscape nationally by extending opportunities to the many students who attend smaller colleges and universities willing to offer innovative programs in computer science and cybersecurity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of this project are designed to promote improvement in cybersecurity education and workforce development. Specifically, successful implementation of this program will allow Felician to apply for status as a Center for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense. To accomplish this goal, infrastructure and coursework will be improved through three specific aims: (1) Re-design existing and develop new coursework for the Bachelor of Science in cybersecurity; (2) Build a specialized computer laboratory for use by the undergraduate and graduate programs; (3) Develop a cybersecurity track within the Master Degree in Computer Science. Through these activities, two new undergraduate courses will be developed, seven existing courses will be mapped to required knowledge units, and six new graduate-level cybersecurity courses will be developed. All new and re-designed coursework will be developed in accordance with guidelines provided by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Rigorous formative and summative evaluation of course content and student learning outcomes will ensure programmatic success.</AbstractNarration>
