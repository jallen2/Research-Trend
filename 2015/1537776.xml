    <AbstractNarration>There is a continuing demand in the United States for sustainable and hazard-resilient but highly affordable low-rise buildings for households and businesses. The goal of this research project is to investigate the feasibility of high-quality reinforced earth masonry (REM) for seismic resistant low-rise buildings. This goal will be achieved by transforming sustainable and locally appropriate but brittle unfired earth masonry into a stronger and more ductile system by using non-biodegradable recycled plastic fibers combined with internal steel reinforcement. This research will investigate REM as a low-cost option for low-rise industrial buildings and sheds, with a vision of fostering the development of small plants and warehouses by reducing construction and maintenance costs, thus promoting economic development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives of this research are the following: (1) to engineer, prototype, and verify an affordable and high-quality REM system for seismic resistant low-rise buildings, and (2) to formulate, verify and implement a new numerical model to accurately and efficiently predict the structural response of REM walls. The hypotheses are:v(1) engineering of earth blocks and mortar stabilized with nine percent or less cement, and reinforced with one percent or less volume fraction of recycled plastic fibers, combined with internal steel reinforcement, will change the strength and ductility of REM, making it suitable for seismic resistant buildings, and (2) computationally efficient numerical models based on newly developed nonlinear macroelements (MEs), whose kinematics are described by the smallest possible number of degrees of freedom, will enable the accurate prediction of the response of REM structures subject to static and dynamic loads. This research will be conducted in three phases. First, selected prototype block-mortar combinations (unreinforced, fiber reinforced, and fiber reinforced with grouted steel bars) will be characterized through load testing of materials and assemblages. A candidate reinforced system will be selected for the second phase. Three-dimensional (3D) digital image correlation (3D-DIC) will be used to measure full-field deformation maps and inform the development of numerical models. The resulting constitutive models for materials, mortar joints, and REM assemblages will serve to formulate detailed finite element (FE) models. Second, performance data will be obtained through large-scale testing and 3D-DIC monitoring of REM walls subject to quasi-static cyclic loading. The results will inform the formulation and validation of new structural ME models and their FE code implementation. Third and final, ME-based FE models of the large-scale specimens will be developed based on the comparison between numerical and experimental results. The resulting first-generation ME models will be used for a preliminary estimate of seismic design coefficients and factors to establish feasibility. In addition, a preliminary quantification of sustainability-related parameters and construction cost for representative REM materials and buildings will be performed to provide a basis for comparison with alternative systems, for example, light-framed wood, as well as life-cycle cost analysis.</AbstractNarration>
