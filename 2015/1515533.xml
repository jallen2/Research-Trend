    <AbstractNarration>The analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) recovered from individuals excavated from archaeological contexts has become a valuable tool for improving understanding of past populations and their cultures. This research project will use aDNA as a tool to delineate the biological kinship relationships present, if any, amongst individuals excavated from the Hanshu II Burial Group 1 of the Houtaomuga cemetery in Da?an, Jilin Province, China. Analysis of genetic relatedness between the sampled individuals will determine if individuals buried at Houtaomuga are biologically related and, if so, whether kinship is socially stratified within the cemetery. As this culture marks a period of social transition from a pastoral economy to mixed agriculture subsistence, this is a particularly important research site for understanding social organization. The research will be conducted under the advisement of Dr. Yinqui Cui at the Jilin University Ancient DNA Laboratory, in collaboration with the Chinese Center for Frontier Archaeology at Jilin University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this period, individuals were buried in either joint burial catacomb tombs or single burial earthen graves, indicating social stratification between individuals. The proposed project will analyze aDNA extracted from individuals excavated from both tomb types to reveal the probability of biological kinship within burials, as well as the biological relationship, if any, between individuals interred in high-status and lower-status burials. The hypervariable region (HVRI) of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) will be sequenced for each individual, as well as the Y-chromosome of male individuals. If the rate of aDNA recovery is sufficient, analysis of biparental autosomal genetic markers will also be conducted. No genetic analysis of intracemetery kinship has thus far been performed on remains from the Hanshu II cultural period of Bronze Age China. Thus, this project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of Hanshu II culture at a time of economically significant social transition. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
