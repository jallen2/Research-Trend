    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Yi Liao and J. Clayton Baum of the Department of Chemistry at Florida Institute of Technology are investigating a class of molecules that can reversibly change acid concentrations when irradiated with light. These molecules, which are called metastable-state photoacids, allow the control of various chemical, biological and material processes with light. Applications of metastable-state photoacids include photoconductive, photomechanical, photochromic, antibacterial, and drug releasing materials. The materials can also be used to develop biosensors, microbial fuel cells, and molecular switches. The mechanisms by which they react, the structure property relationships, and the potential applications of these photoacids are being studied. The project lies at the interface of organic, photo, physical, biological, and materials chemistry. The research is well suited for the education of undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach activities to high school and middle school students are also part of the project activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous chemical, material, and biological processes are sensitive to proton concentration, from acid-catalyzed reactions to activities of many enzymes. Photoacids that reversibly undergo proton dissociation upon irradiation promise remote, spatial and temporal control of acid-sensitive processes. These compounds could provide a way to convert photoenergy into other types of energy. Although reversible photoacids have been studied, the photoinduced proton concentration change has not been high enough to drive or effectively control acid sensitive processes. One major problem in achieving large proton concentration changes is that the lifetime of the high-acidity state is limited by the excited-state lifetime. To solve this limitation, the investigators couple proton dissociation with a reversible intramolecular photoreactions so that long-lived photoacids can be obtained. In this approach, the high-acidity state is no longer an excited state, but a metastable state generated from the photoreaction. Metastable-state photoacids can possess a long-lived high-acidity state and produce a large acidity change under irradiation. The design of metastable-state photoacids and the photochemical behaviors and mechanisms of these photoacids are being studied both experimentally and theoretically.</AbstractNarration>
