    <AbstractNarration>Advances in science, are underpinned by matching individual scientists and engineers to jobs within science-based organizations. Mobility between jobs ensures optimal matches between individuals and jobs. However, the existing literature is largely silent on how individual characteristics pose as barriers to mobility. This project explores gender differences in the mobility patterns and earnings of U.S. scientists. The goal of this pilot project is to investigate how family-related mobility constraints, particularly those related to marital and child-rearing status, explain a considerable share of the earnings disparity. The results are important for policy aimed at increasing participation in the sciences and enabling individuals to realizing a full return on their and society's investment in scientific human capital. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the restricted access data-files in the National Science Foundation's Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), this project uses econometric techniques to understand in STEM education efforts of potential selection effects that may cause men and women of similar ability and preferences to sort into different science and engineering fields and labor force. This project adopts an integrative framework that analyses the interplay of gender, family status, mobility and earnings for scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
