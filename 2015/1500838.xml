    <AbstractNarration>This project studies problems at the interface of enumerative and algebraic combinatorics. Combinatorial questions arise in many areas of mathematics, and combinatorics has applications that include optimization, computer science, and statistical physics. The enumerative problems under study in this project are related to parking functions (which originally arose in the study of hash functions in computer science) and the cyclic sieving phenomenon (a concept in enumerative combinatorics that interprets certain polynomial evaluations as counts of fixed points). The research aims to both prove results in enumerative combinatorics and understand these results in terms of deeper algebraic structures. This interaction between combinatorics and algebra promises to yield new results in both fields. The enumerative side of the research is well-suited to broader impacts in the form of graduate and undergraduate research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies problems in algebraic combinatorics. The first of these is the cyclic sieving phenomenon as it applies to the action of a K-theoretic analog of the promotion operator on a K-generalization of rectangular standard Young tableaux. The idea is to prove new instances of the (enumerative) cyclic sieving phenomenon related to this action using representation theory. The second problem concerns a generalization of parking functions attached to the symmetric group to a wider class of "parking spaces" attached to a reflection group W. We study a family of conjectures regarding these objects which would yield uniform proofs of various facts in Coxeter-Catalan theory which are at present only understood in a case-by-case fashion. The third project studies rational Catalan combinatorics, which is a generalization of classical Catalan combinatorics motivated by the study of rational Cherednik algebras. We propose to both extend various results from the rich enumerative domain of the classical setting to the rational case and study a genuinely new feature of the rational case that we call "rational duality."</AbstractNarration>
