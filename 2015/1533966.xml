    <AbstractNarration>Huang, 1533966&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past two decades, industries have made tremendous efforts to improve energy and material efficiency in engineered systems, design greener products and sustainable supply chain, and become more responsible to the society through improving their business sustainability. In academia, sustainability science and engineering has become a very active area of research in various disciplines of engineering, natural and social sciences. Sustainability theories and sustainability assessment, analysis, design and decision making methodologies as well as tools have been developed, many of which are used to tackle real-world problems in collaboration with industries. To improve communications and promote experience sharing, networking, and collaboration between academia and industries, a variety of sustainability related conferences, symposiums, and workshops are organized around the world every year. To address much broader issues of sustainability science and engineering, facilitate discussions on scientific and technological development, and share research and practice experiences in industrial sustainability, a group of scientists, educators, and engineers, and governmental officers have decided to organize the fourth event of a conference series, namely The 4th International Congress on Sustainability Science and Engineering (ICOSSE). The conference will be held in Balatonfüred, Hungary on May 26-29, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first time for the ICOSSE series to organize an event in a foreign country. This conference should provide an excellent platform for scientist, researchers, and practitioners of various physical sciences, engineering fields, economics, and social sciences to discuss research and education challenges, share their research and practicing experience, and promote networking. The conference will be organized on four key themes in sustainability; they are: sustainable energy, sustainable manufacturing, energy for sustainability, and the nexus of food, energy, and water. The presentation focus will be on pursuing industrial sustainability from the systems perspective using scientific and engineering innovations. The conference should help bridge the gap between research and development and strengthen the linkage between industries and academia, and explore opportunities for broad international collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICOSSE becomes a major international conference series in the sustainability field. Different from the past three ICOSSEs, this 4th event is to be held in Europe. The travel grant should help US academic attendees take this opportunity to learn the cutting-age research in various fields of sustainability, share their experience with the world class leaders and other colleagues, especially those in Europe and near regions, and identify international collaboration opportunities in strengthening sustainable engineering research and education. Junior faculty members, young researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, especially those minorities underrepresented in science and engineering will be strongly encouraged to attend the conference. Student poster paper competitions will provide a great opportunity for them to present their research activities and receive advice from leading experts from different countries. It is planned that selected papers will be published in five technical journals.</AbstractNarration>
