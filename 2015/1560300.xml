    <AbstractNarration>Professors Pennington and Garcia and their colleagues in the Chemistry Department of Clemson University host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF Chemistry REU program. This Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) brings ten participants annually from regional Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), primarily undergraduate institutions, and two-year technical colleges. Undergraduates perform research in the areas of advanced materials and chemical biology. In addition, the undergraduates are provided many opportunities for personal and professional growth and development through numerous workshops, seminars, and panel discussions on topics ranging from the fundamentals of instrumentation techniques, research opportunities in the various disciplines of chemistry, career planning and preparation, and the role of women and underrepresented groups in the sciences. The recruitment and selection process targets female and underrepresented minority students who, despite having academic metrics that limit their opportunities in conventional REU programs, feature noncognitive factors (positive self-concept, realistic self-appraisal, long-range goals, system navigation, leadership, and demonstrated community service) that indicate a strong aptitude for research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students perform research in two high impact areas: advanced materials and chemical biology to improve the health and quality of life of our society. Some of the areas of study available to students include examination of carbon nanotube-peptide composite structures, the synthesis and characterization of plasmonic nanoparticle assemblies, the synthesis of proton conducting polymer electrodes with applications to fuel cells, the development of nanocomposites and biocompatible surfaces, the study of quantum dots with applications to sensors and imaging, and the development of peptide-based chiral catalysts. The research training students receive in the lab, the professional development fostered by the workshops, panel discussions, and seminars at Clemson University, and the subsequent presentation of their work at professional conferences contributes to students' ability to successfully pursue a productive career in chemistry and related sciences.</AbstractNarration>
