    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The properties of a material typically depend on how a fixed set of constituents are arranged and interact via intermolecular forces. In this research we study two types of materials that do not fit this paradigm. This first type of material is fibrous matter, made up of long, flexible filaments. The constraints of packing or weaving together can cause individual filaments to bend and twist thus modifying the way in which an individual filament interacts with other filaments. Fibrous materials are the main constituent of plant matter, as well as human products ranging from paper to fabrics and insulants, so a basic understanding of this ubiquitous class of materials is important. The second type of material is composed of assemblies of so-called active particles, which when energized have a tendency to move in some direction along their body. At one level, this is intended to illuminate behaviors seen in living systems such as flocking, swarming and group locomotion. On the other hand, we hope to use some of these behaviors to create materials with new functionalities. The proposed work gives graduate and undergraduate students exposure to a variety of techniques and the opportunity to work in emerging areas of physics. The PI is an organizer of an annual summer school hosted at UMass Amherst for early-career graduate students in soft matter and statistical physics. During the project, the PI will also create and disseminate lesson plans for introductory physics courses taught in a team-based format. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonequilibrium systems made up of macroscopic entities that do not undergo thermal fluctuations are an important part of our technological, physical and biological world. The experiments proposed here study two broad classes of model nonthermal systems. (i) Systems of flexible filaments, where in addition to the rich physics of rigid nonthermal packing, we gain new geometrical elements, such as the possibility of entanglements between filaments. A particular focus will be the roles of friction and elasticity in determining the strength of a mat of fibres. (ii) Systems of active particles, driven by external noise that provide propulsion at the level of individual particles. The central scientific question will be to identify the separate roles of the symmetry of the particle mobility and interaction, which in previous studies have been chosen to coincide. The PI will study bulk packings, assembled either spontaneously, or templated. These will be studied in 2D by imaging directly and in 3D, by laser-sheet or x-ray imaging. The proposed work gives graduate and undergraduate students exposure to a variety of techniques and the opportunity to work in newly-emerging areas of physics.
