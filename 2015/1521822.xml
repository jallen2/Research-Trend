    <AbstractNarration>Condensed matter physics has made tremendous contributions to society over the past several decades through the study and development of novel materials such as semiconductors and computer memory devices. Presently, however, the condensed matter physics community is at a crossroads, faced with challenges of understanding the fundamental behavior of increasingly complex materials. This workshop brings together leading experimentalists, both junior and senior faculty and researchers from across the US, to discuss emerging trends and ideas to better measure and understand such materials. &lt;br/&gt; The discovery of several new materials in recent years has highlighted the need for advanced experiments. The iron pnictide superconductors, for example, exhibit a complex interplay of electronic, spin and lattice degrees of freedom that give rise to difficulties of interpretation. In order to make progress, novel experiments to measure the response of these systems to non-traditional perturbations such as uniaxial or hydrostatic pressure, high magnetic fields, or large electric fields are vital. This workshop brings together experimentalists in these different fields with the goal to elucidate potential new opportunities that may emerge by combining techniques that traditionally have remained disparate. The workshop features a panel discussion on current and emerging trends, and will explore topics at the frontier of correlated electron research.</AbstractNarration>
