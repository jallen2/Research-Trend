    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Eric M. Johnson Chavarria is "Investigating force dependent release of regulatory proteins from actin filaments under tension." The host institution for this fellowship is Yale University and the sponsoring scientist is Enrique M. De La Cruz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cytoskeleton is dynamic protein network in living cells that generates forces that drive cell migration, division and transport of intracellular components. One of the protein components of the cytoskeleton, called actin, organizes into filaments. The research sponsored by this fellowship focuses on the growing ends of these filaments and the proteins within the gelsolin superfamily that cap those ends. Flightless I is a protein within this superfamily and was first isolated from fruit flies that could not fly. This protein expressed in eukaryotic cells has been shown to inhibit cell migration by capping actin and is a key component of normal actin function and also a potential therapeutic target. This single molecule system offers a powerful tool for quantifying actin filaments and capping proteins under applied tension by microfluidic shear flow and imaged directly by fluorescence microscopy in real-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals for this fellowship include acquiring expertise in protein purification, labeling, and single molecule microscopy techniques and career advancement activities for a member from a group underrepresented in biology at the postdoctoral level. Educational outreach includes mentoring graduate and undergraduate students and developing lesson plans on actin cytoskeleton using 3D printing for visual learning. Lesson plans and materials are being disseminated through summer workshops for local K-12 educators, website creation and web based videos.</AbstractNarration>
