    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;MRS Bulletin, a publication of the Materials Research Society (MRS), is conducting a half-day session at the 2015 MRS Fall Meeting in Boston on December 2, 2015 aimed at capturing the unique relationship between advanced materials and their engineering applications, which are closely intertwined. This session complements a special issue of MRS Bulletin titled Materials and Engineering: Propelling Innovation (December 2015 issue). With support from the Division of Materials Research, this special session will include two talks by well-known materials experts who have applied materials research in engineering applications, followed by a panel discussion with six participants. The discussion will focus on the state-of-the-art in advanced materials applications and translation of research, and how applications needs have pushed materials developments. The session emphasizes the importance of open dialogue between materials scientists involved in research and engineers who translate these ideas into real world products for the benefit of society. The discussions will span the broad spectrum of materials and applications. The larger goal is to promote dialogue between materials researchers and engineers, and to encourage early career researchers, including graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, to think about real applications of their research efforts for the larger benefit to Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The special session at the 2015 MRS Fall Meeting in Boston complements a special issue of MRS Bulletin titled Materials and Engineering: Propelling Innovation (December 2015 issue). Materials enable engineering; engineering applications in turn depend on materials to transform design concepts and equations into physical entities. This unique relationship continues to grow with expanding societal demand for new products and processes. The discussions will focus on the many interactions between materials science and technology development covering the entire materials cycle in a variety of applications. The goal is to describe the road traversed in establishing the relationship between materials and engineering, and to present a spectrum of new materials with enticing properties and relevant engineering applications. The session addresses how engineering accentuates the properties of materials, and how materials inspire innovations in engineering and technology.</AbstractNarration>
