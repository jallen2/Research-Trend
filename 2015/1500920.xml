    <AbstractNarration>This project supports participation by US-based researchers, particularly speakers, organizers, graduate students, and recent PhD recipients, at the conference "Model Theory, Difference/Differential Equations, and Applications" held at CIRM in Luminy, France, April 7th - 10th, 2015. This conference brings together researchers in model theory, in difference and differential algebra, and in allied fields (such as algebraic dynamics) in which theorems from model theoretic algebra have been applied. This workshop will foster research interactions and will provide an informal setting for graduate students and younger researchers to learn of the newest trends in this research area and interact with some of the most prominent researchers around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this project will provide financial support to a substantial number of graduate students and young researchers from the United States. Differential algebraic geometry, differential Galois theory and, more recently, algebraic dynamics have benefited from the close interaction with model theory, especially the model theory of fields with operators. The conference aims to catalyze further developments in this area. Details about the conference may be found at http://scientific-events.weebly.com/1194.html .</AbstractNarration>
