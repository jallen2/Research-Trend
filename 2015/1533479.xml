    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) seeks to provide new learning experiences in biomedical engineering to undergraduate students. The recruitment efforts include reaching out to high school students and students from community colleges to get them interested in the field of biomedical engineering. This project will ultimately diversify and contribute to the biomedical engineering workforce aimed at solving medical related problems through engineering techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to enhance the existing academic infrastructure at UDC by developing four new courses in biomedical engineering and integrating them into existing engineering curricula; by preparing prospective students at area community colleges towards the pursuit of a BS degree in biomedical engineering; and by educating high school students, undergraduate students, and faculty in current trends and research in biomedical engineering. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and the project is guided by a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
