    <AbstractNarration>CO2 appears as a contaminant or impurity in gas mixtures in oil industries, and because of the environmental impacts of CO2 emissions, lawmakers are beginning to require the separation of CO2 from combustion products. Consequently, CO2 separation is an issue in power plants, heavy industries, hydrogen production, natural gas sweetening, and air purification plants, among other industries. However, the currently available options for CO2 separation are limited and uneconomical. One contemporary method is absorption, a well-matured but energy-intensive and expensive approach. For example, the benchmark for chemical absorption based on monoethanolamine (MEA), a widely used absorbent, currently imposes costs of over $70 per metric ton of CO2 due to the high cost of solvent regeneration; overall, capturing CO2 emissions from power plants using conventional technologies requires 20-30% of the plant's energy output. This high cost is the single largest obstacle for the widespread industrial adoption of CO2 capture technologies. Therefore, industry has an urgent need for the development of high-performance and low-cost technologies and materials that enable capital-efficient CO2 capture. A promising alternative process for CO2 capture is adsorption by porous materials: candidate adsorbents for CO2 separation should selectively adsorb CO2 from gas mixtures and have large surface areas to accommodate CO2 molecules into the pores. Based on a novel, suitable adsorbent recently developed by members of the proposed I-Corps team, the aim of this project is to commercialize a new series of adsorbents (zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, or ZIFs) that exhibit superior selectivity for separating CO2 from other gases and that have significant surface area to store it. This technology has been developed at a critical time for the CO2 capture market. Strict emission standards have been imposed by the U.S. government and several other countries and entities such as Canada, China, and the European Union, but there is not yet an optimal or even existing product available to meet the required needs. The proposed ZIF, with its outstanding capability for high-selectivity CO2 capture, therefore provides a revolutionary solution at a time of severe market need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid porous materials constructed from organic linkers and metal-containing nodes. The typical specific surface areas - and hence, gas adsorption capacities - that MOFs provide are an order of magnitude higher than those of zeolites. ZIFs are a subfamily of MOFs. They have an M(Im)4 zeolite-type framework in which tetrahedral elements, M, are transition metals bridged by imidazolate (Im) moieties. ZIFs can adsorb CO2 emissions and store five times more than existing adsorbents before requiring regeneration. For example, each unit volume of ZIF-69 can store up to 83 times its volume in CO2. Moreover, ZIFs can exhibit high chemical and thermal stability, and therefore can be robust processes for CO2 capture. In this comprehensive study, we propose the synthesis of a new subclass of ZIFs that, as indicated by Monte-Carlo-based simulation, have a 100-fold-increased CO2 capture capacity compared to the isostructural ZIFs. This increase in CO2 capture capacity was accompanied by only negligible changes in capture capacity for CH4, H2, and N2; therefore, the uptake ratio of CO2 to the other gases increased significantly, indicating very high selectivity for CO2 separation in our novel ZIFs. This set of abilities could significantly reduce the cost of carbon separation and capture at combustion-based power plants, heavy industries, natural gas processing, and hydrogen production companies.</AbstractNarration>
