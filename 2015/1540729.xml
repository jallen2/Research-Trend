    <AbstractNarration>Few students enter undergraduate programs understanding what the geosciences are or that they are part of a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum. Yet, high paying, high demand jobs in the geosciences and the need for diversity in these fields means these students may miss an opportunity to put their interests in science to work. This is especially true of students beginning their undergraduate education at two year institutions, which are play an ever increasing role in the landscape of higher education. Nearly 54% of minority students in STEM begin their undergraduate education at a community college, making efforts to engage and support such students and better prepare them to transfer to and succeed at 4-year institutions is so important. The Geoscience Engagement and Outreach (GEO) project promotes progress in science for students through the recruitment, mentoring and support of a cohort of two-year college students from underrepresented populations. Activities include faculty mentored research in a sub-set of geoscience subdisciplines, as well as skill building for careers to produce graduates prepared for the expectations of future employers. Documenting the potential of cross-institutional, integrated research and education experiences being developed through this project for retaining diverse students in the geosciences contributes to the literature on STEM recruitment and retention. The project also is expected to increase the number and caliber of faculty available to mentor undergraduates and foster continued education in the geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEO project is addressing barriers to engagement, recruitment, and retention of diverse students in the geosciences pipeline through an innovative three-institution collaboration that combines and leverages the strengths of Santa Fe College, a two year teaching institution; the University of Florida, a four year research institution; and the Orlando Science Center, a nonprofit informal education and outreach venue. The GEO project offers students authentic geoscience research experiences explicitly integrated with practical applications and scaffolded to classroom work. Project goals include: (1) fostering retention of the participating GEO students at Santa Fe College and transfer into Bachelor's degree programs in the geosciences, (2) strengthening collaborations among Santa Fe College teaching faculty, University of Florida researchers, and Orlando Science Center informal science educators, and (3) increasing student interest in geoscience careers through public outreach development of resources for in-service teachers. GEO's three phases of seminar-style teaching, research mentoring with outreach project development and delivery, and a culminating capstone experience scaffold the program elements into an emerging geoscience Associates degree at Santa Fe College. The project is designed to support three annual cohorts of 6 students each, with integration of peer- and supervisor-mentoring and collaborations among the three institutions. The project is targeted toward recruitment of underrepresented populations and their retention in geoscience fields. University of Florida faculty are mentoring student research in the geoscience sub-disciplines of meteorology, soil hydrology, and geoscience and STEM education. The Orlando Science Center is supervising a paid 6-week summer internship that emphasizes communications and outreach skills development. GEO students are designing and conducting outreach with diverse public audiences, teachers and high school volunteers through OSC's Otronicon. Continuation of research and outreach activities during the Fall semester culminates in the completion of a two year degree by GEO cohort students and their transfer to a four year geosciences program, prepared to continue and thrive alongside their four year institution peers. Project evaluation is measuring student content gain, using the Geoscience Concept Inventory; in addition, increases in a student's science identity and potential interest in pursuing geoscience careers are being assessed.</AbstractNarration>
