    <AbstractNarration>The 49th Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference will take place May 14--16, 2015 at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. The conference will feature 7 plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks. In addition there will be five special sessions: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory, Geometric Topology, and Set-theoretic Topology. The conference will promote the dissemination of new results in Topology and Dynamics, and will facilitate interactions between different research fields as well as interactions between graduate students, junior researchers and senior mathematicians. The conference contributes to the training and professional development of graduate students and young researchers. Furthermore, the conference promotes applications of Topology/Dynamics in other areas of mathematics as well as scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, finance, data science, and robotics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference (STDC in short) is an annual conference that started in 1967, and regularly attracts 150 to 200 participants. STDC covers very diverse topics of current interests in Topology and Dynamics. A large portion of the talks at STDC touch upon interplays of Topology/Dynamics with other branches of mathematics. In recent years, STDC has featured several invited talks on applications of Topology and Dynamics in other scientific disciplines. STDC will bring together people from various fields related to Topology and Dynamics to discuss recent progresses and chart new directions. STDC seeks the active participation of graduate students, young researchers, women and under-represented groups. The grant provides funds to support travel for invited speakers, graduate students and researchers without external support.
