    <AbstractNarration>This award permits University at Albany, SUNY, to purchase an unmanned aircraft system. Researchers led by Dr. Alexander Buyantuev will use the system to conduct a multidisciplinary study focused on monitoring fast ecological and geophysical processes and advance the understanding of environmental changes at scales of individual trees to whole landscapes. Several projects that utilize near surface remote sensing made possible by the cutting edge drone technology and ground measurements will examine effects of climate warming and local anthropogenic impacts, such as soil acidification, wind power generation, and urbanization, on vegetation growth. Gaining insight into these effects is of great importance to predict more accurately the state of ecosystems in the future and to develop sound mitigation strategies. Researchers will also be committed to look closely into the use of the technology in identifying best practices and developing protocols for post-storm area analysis and future emergency management applications. Overall, these studies are expected to benefit a large number of students and the public by either their direct involvement in the work or through exposure to research during classwork or public presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Buyantuev with colleagues will use a professional grade unmanned aircraft system (UAS) outfitted with visual, multi (hyper-) spectral, thermal, and laser sensors to collect geospatial data at forested field sites and near developed areas. Such very high resolution data will provide the missing link in scaling between ground sampling and airborne and spaceborne remote sensing, primarily data from widely used Landsat and MODIS satellites. It will allow researchers to assess how climate warming and associated changes in timing of tree growth affect the dynamics of nonstructural carbon in spruce trees and understand better the effects of soil acidification and warming on growing season arrival and length for sugar maple stands in Upstate New York, USA. The team is also particularly interested in how wind turbines, being the sources of alternative and environmentally friendly power production, and the process of urbanization characterized by the expansion of built-up land, modify local climates and vegetation/crop growth. These effects will be studied by quantifying inter-annual growing seasons and biomass changes in the vicinity of an existing wind farm and along the gradient of land development in a suburban site. The research will generate valuable datasets and methods for processing high resolution imagery into important scientific information.</AbstractNarration>
