    <AbstractNarration>1541642 (Miralles-Wilhelm). This workshop will focus on development of principles, algorithms and model formulations for understanding and evaluating the potential of implementing approaches, developed through research, to handling food-energy-water (FEW) nexus challenges. The workshop will take a broad systems perspective, linking application of tools and areas of disciplinary expertise to optimization of engineered FEW systems. An objective is to address shared needs of FEW stakeholders, providing an interactive environment to explore trade-offs, explore potential synergies and evaluate alternatives among a broad list of FEW options and objectives including flexibility to facilitate tailored analyses over different geographical regions and scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to contribute to sustainable management and development of the food, energy and water sectors by increasing awareness and capacity of interdisciplinary modeling towards integrated planning and identifying/evaluating trade-offs and synergies. The focus of the workshop will be on exchanging insights, experiences and research results on innovative approaches and evidence-based operational tools to assess the economic and social tradeoffs of constraints in food, energy and water security. Designed tools may focus on upstream sector planning in order to identify primary opportunities and constraints to water, energy and food development, as well as evaluating opportunities to curb demand growth without compromising quality of service, thus indicating priorities for more detailed analysis as well as providing characterization of alternative scenarios of investment in each sector. This will also be an important step toward improved understanding of economic and social tradeoffs among competing uses (i.e., water for energy conversion versus food production, industrial and municipal uses, and environmental benefits of in situ water). The results of this exchange on research ideas and approaches thus aims at supporting decision-making in integrated food-energy-water planning and prioritization of research investments.</AbstractNarration>
