    <AbstractNarration>This project provides NSF support for students to attend and participate in the 34th IEEE 2015 International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS) to be held in Montreal, Canada on September 28-October 1, 2015. SRDS 2015 is a premier international technical event that brings together technical research papers, tutorials and workshops centered on various aspects of reliable distributed computing applications and platforms. Additionally, the conference will include multiple keynotes, panels on cutting edge topics, a Ph.D. forum and discussion sessions. The aims of the conference are manifold: 1) to provide a international forum for investigation of major challenges in addressing next-generation of mission critical distributed computing platforms; 2) to stimulate interactive discussions on research in distributed computing and reliability through panels, posters, tutorials, and discussion sessions (3) to motivate and engage future generations of researchers via conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, panel and breakout sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will promote the next generation of students and researchers to identify scientific foundations for building large scale distributed computing environments that can work reliably and efficiently. This travel support will permit a more qualified and diverse group of student attendees. Students attending the conference benefit from both the technical content of the conference and the professional interaction with senior researchers from other universities and with industry. A Student Scholar Roundtable will be organized where selected students will get a chance to informally interact with senior researchers in the community and get feedback on their research interests. SRDS 2015 will offer many opportunities for students to meet, interact, and exchange ideas in an informal atmosphere including members of the program committee, speakers and organizers.</AbstractNarration>
