    <AbstractNarration>This grant will support an effort to enhance the understanding of the formation processes for ionospheric plasma wave structures seen in regional distributions of Total Electron Content (TEC) events that exhibit circular patterns. These events are believed to be generated by deep convective processes within thunderstorm systems that launch gravity wave structures into the upper atmosphere region of 60 to 100 km where strong viscous dissipation of these wave packets occurs. Part of the wave energy of these primary waves is transformed into the production of secondary waves that are able to propagate higher into the region of atmospheric heights above 200 km. Here, the interaction of these waves with the ionospheric plasma (pushing or pulling plasma along magnetic field lines) would then generate structures called Traveling Ionosphere Disturbances (TIDs) that are so often seen in TEC data. The primary objective of the research is to compare the observed concentric TEC perturbations with those calculated from realistic modeling of the primary and secondary GWs from deep convection in order to strengthen and validate the models for the calculation of these TID structures. A secondary objective would be to utilize the amplitudes and scales of the observed secondary GWs to probe the dynamics of the 'dark' (but highly variable) region near 125-225 km where most of the primary GWs dissipate. A satisfactory explanation of these TID events in terms of gravity wave processes by reference to the successful modeling of the formation of these structures has never been achieved. Thus, the funded research has a significant potential for providing an enhanced understanding of the properties of these circular TID events that relate to the heating and cooling processes associated with the dissipation and transformation of the primary wave structure into the secondary wave output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant societal impact and transformative research outcomes for this award are expected to be achieved as a result of the success in modeling these circular TID events. Because GWs cause scintillation and plasma bubbles that can disrupt satellite communication and GPS signals, this study may lead to better predictions for the occurrence of these phenomena, which is nationally relevant. In order to enhance scientific understanding for the general public, the researcher will disseminate broadly the results via a web site, conference talks, and journal publications. Finally, this project would support the research of a woman scientist (PI).</AbstractNarration>
