    <AbstractNarration>1549614(Luo)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks funds to partially cover travel expenses of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty members from institutions in the United States to participate in the International Conference for Mesoscopic Methods in Engineering and Science (ICMMES) that will be held July 20-24, 2015 at the Beijing Computational Science Research Center, Beijing, China. An objective of this proposal is to increase US participation in ICMMES and to strengthen the leadership position of US in this fast-growing and promising research field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in the area of mesoscopic fluid dynamics. The conference organization is in direct response to the growing interest in multi-scale and multi-physics phenomena observed in nano- or micro-systems and biological systems, and the increasing importance of computational science to research in these disciplines. The conference will be attended by both prominent and young scientists in fluid dynamics, applied and computational mathematics, physics, and computer science, from around the world, who will be discussing research challenges in mesoscopic methods, the theory and modeling of bringing the scales from the molecular to the macroscopic. These methods are promising candidates to effectively connect microscopic and macroscopic physics and thereby substantially extend our analytical and computational capabilities. The focus of ICMMES is mesoscopic/kinetic methods (e.g., lattice Boltzmann equation, lattice gas cellular automata, discrete velocity models, gas-kinetic schemes, dissipative particle dynamics, smoothed particle hydrodynamics, and various novel methods) for computational mechanics in its broadest sense.The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. Special consideration will be given to under-represented minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and those in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI).</AbstractNarration>
