    <AbstractNarration>Professor Chuan-Jian Zhong of SUNY at Binghamton is supported by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Division of Chemistry to design and prepare alloy catalysts, consisting of combinations of two or three metals. The research discovers new and more robust and effective catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation by combining platinum, palladium, or gold with other transition metals in optimum compositions and structures. These catalysts are essential for several important practical applications, such as the elimination of hydrocarbon pollutants from vehicle emissions, the production of hydrogen for fuel cells, and the production of chemical building blocks for the manufacture of industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Course and laboratory modules are developed to engage students in clean energy and clean environment research and education. The energy and environmental sustainability theme of the project provides a platform for outreach through on-campus programs specifically designed to help students from underrepresented minorities, such as the Bridges to the Baccalaureate and the McNair Scholars programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to establish design principles for alloy nanocatalysts that exhibit synergistic, multifunctional activities for the catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons such as propane or ethanol. Nanocatalysts of noble metals, such as platinum, palladium, or gold, alloyed with other transition metals are synthesized with tunable compositions. Specifically, the investigation determines how alloy nanocatalyst composition, structure, and shape control surface reaction mechanisms, adsorption sites, and intermediate species. These fundamental issues are addressed by: (1) preparation of nanoalloy catalysts on different supports with controlled compositions and shapes; 2) characterization of surface species during the catalytic oxidation using in situ time-resolved diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and other complimentary techniques; and 3) correlating the structure and composition of surface sites with the catalytic properties.</AbstractNarration>
