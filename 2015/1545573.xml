    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to request support for the PI to organize the 2015 NSF CPS PI Meeting. This meeting convenes all Principal Investigators of the National Science Foundation Cyber-Physical Systems Program for the fifth time since the program began. The PI Meeting is to take place on November 16-17, 2015 in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia. The PI meeting is an annual opportunity for NSF-sponsored CPS researchers, industry representatives, and Federal agencies' representatives to gather and review new CPS developments, identify new and emerging applications, and to discuss technology gaps and barriers. The program agenda is community-drive and includes presentations (oral and poster) from PI's, reports of past year program activities, and showcase/pitch new CPS innovations and results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual PI Meeting serves as the only opportunity where the CPS researcher community gathers to share their research, discuss new research opportunities and challenges, and explore new ideas and partnerships for future work. Furthermore, the PI meeting is also an opportunity for the academic research community to interact with industry entities and government agencies with vested interest in CPS research and development. The PI Meeting is a forum for sharing ideas across the CPS community. It has played a major role in growing the community across broad range of sectors and technologies, and performing outreach to others who have interest in learning about the program and participating as future proposers, transition partners, or future sponsors.</AbstractNarration>
