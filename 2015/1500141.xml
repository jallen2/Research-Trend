    <AbstractNarration>This award supports U.S. participation in the workshop "Asymptotics in Integrable Systems, Random Matrices and Random Processes, and Universality" held at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques (CRM), Montreal, during June 7-11, 2015. In recent years there have been several important developments in the study of certain equations describing the motion of waves as well as of large time or large system-size randomly interacting systems (such as the spread of bacterial colonies or the interactions between many electrically charged particles). The mathematical methods underlying these developments have surprising commonalities. This workshop will feature presentations by over two dozen experts in these diverse fields to present their recent research results and discuss directions of future efforts. About 25 more participants are expected to be present, including many researchers in their early careers. The workshop aims to advance the field and also to help the young researchers to identify important and promising new research directions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics of workshop include integrable systems, random matrices andrandom processes, and their possible novel applications. These three areas have benefited from each other over the last two decades. In recent years all of them have seen new significant developments. This workshop aims to foster the exchange of these new ideas and developments by bringing together experts in these three areas to discuss progress and challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop web site: www.crm.umontreal.ca/2015/Deift15/index_e.php</AbstractNarration>
