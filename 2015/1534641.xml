    <AbstractNarration>The 2015 Barrett Lectures will be held May 13-16, 2015 at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee. This year's conference, entitled, "Stochastic filtering, Computations and Applications" will focus on exciting developments of stochastic filtering and its computational implementations and applications. Stochastic filtering has experienced a rapid development in recent years due to its flexibility to engage modeling predictions based on pertinent dynamics with experimental data. Moreover, complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big data lead to an urgent need for new theoretical establishments of filtering and novel computational implementations. The conference will feature, Dan Crisan, Tom Kurtz and Boris Rozovsky, who will each present three expository lectures within the realm of the thematic topic of the Lectures. Additionally, invited plenary talks by a dynamic group of international researchers at different stages of their career development and a poster session will take place. This project utilizes NSF funding to support travel and other participant costs for approximately 40 participants, giving high priority to graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career faculty members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2015 Barrett Lectures will be the 45th installment of a highly regarded lecture series that began as a tribute to the distinguished scientist John H. Barrett, head of our Mathematics Department at the time of his death in 1969. The Lectures are one of the longest-standing series of mathematical lectures in the country delivered by distinguished speakers. The focus of the 45th Lectures is the interdisciplinary impact of other mathematical methods into traditional topics of probability, and the increasing interdisciplinary penetration of complex physical phenomena and formidable engineering problems related to big data. A dynamic group of auspicious and prominent researchers will deliver talks and engage in discussions to deepen our understanding of the new stochastic filtering methodologies and theories which need to be further developed in order to meet the challenge of new complex scientific and engineering problems of the 21st century.
