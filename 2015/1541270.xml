    <AbstractNarration>Building on the University of California - Santa Cruz (UCSC) "100 Gb/s Science DMZ" project, the CyberInfrastructure (CI) Engineer coordinates the development of research CI (on-campus and in regional and national forums), and works with the CI community to disseminate new CI tools, techniques and models. The CI Engineer works directly with researchers to facilitate their use of CI, and with campus IT engineers in the design and development of new CI capabilities. The CI Engineer works on research projects involving the development of new CI-related technology, including the Pacific Research Platform project. The CI Engineer coordinates a continuous technology assessment for use in planning the development of campus CI, and the evolution of the campus CI plan while advising campus leadership on technology with potential impact on faculty and their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CI Engineer participates in regional, state and national level organizations, including California's Research and Education Network (CENIC), Internet2, and the OpenStack Foundation, sharing lessons learned at UCSC and to hear of new developments. These lessons are also disseminated via the web for access by the broader CI community. Through research projects or independent studies, the CI Engineer engages science and engineering students in the use and development of campus CI.</AbstractNarration>
