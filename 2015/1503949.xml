    <AbstractNarration>The Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute (JHUISI) proposes to add four new cohorts of graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity. JHUISI offers a Masters of Science in Security Informatics (MSSI) program focusing on immersive educational experience and often combining expertise in other areas such as healthcare or project management. The MSSI program and associated dual-degree programs are based on an integration of courses, labs, research projects, and internships stemming from the various academic cultures represented the Carey School of Business, Bloomberg School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, and Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. These partnerships developed a unique interdisciplinary framework supporting educational cross-training in cybersecurity technologies relative to various application areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFS students will complete the MSSI degree program with an option to earn a dual degree in Computer Science, Applied Math and Statistics, Health Sciences, or National Security Studies. These dual masters programs have proven to be valuable for various federal agencies. In particular, the project provides exposure to the increasingly critical field of healthcare security to a new generation of cybersecurity professionals. The relevance of this area is underscored at the federal and state health infrastructures by mandates to broaden utilization of information technology in the delivery of healthcare while protecting the security and privacy of health information exchanges and on-line databases. SFS students will help with the critical challenge of establishing trusted national healthcare information networks to unify health and medical computing infrastructures, streamline healthcare monitoring and delivery, and accelerate research and dissemination of health and medical data while assuring that privacy is systemically protected. The project will conduct a focused outreach to assure diversity by leveraging existing partnerships with HBCUs and MSIs.</AbstractNarration>
