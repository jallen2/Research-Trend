    <AbstractNarration>1552107 (Diwekar). The Trans-Atlantic Research and Development Interchange on Sustainability (TARDIS) workshops are a series of meetings on scientific topics related to environmental sustainability held every other year alternating between Austria and the United States. The first workshop was held on the subject of modeling for environmental sustainability at Schloss Seggau in Leibnitz, Austria in October 2004. Subsequent workshops were held in September of 2006 at the YMCA of the Rockies on the topic of underlying scientific principles of environmental sustainability, and in October 2008 again at Schloss Seggau on energy and environmental sustainability. The TARDIS 2012 workshop was held in April 2012 at Schloss Seggau in Leibnitz, Austria on the topic of time and time-frames for environmental sustainability. The most recent TARDIS workshop was held in June of 2014 at the YMCA of the Rockies in Colorado on the topic of social, economic, policy, and regulatory incentives to promote environmental sustainability in society. The next TARDIS workshop will be again held at Schloss Seggau in Leibnitz, Austria October 19 - 21, 2016 to explore the compatibility of economic growth and environmental sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The body of participants will be balanced to include adequate representation with respect to discipline (engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, policy, etc.), institutions (academic, government, private sector) and regional and national representation, and minorities and women will be encouraged to participate. Two reports will be produced: (1) a final report summarizing the results and conclusions and the presentations given, and (2) a briefer summary focused on policy. A WIKI site has been established and is currently being populated with the relevant information on all of the TARDIS workshops.</AbstractNarration>
