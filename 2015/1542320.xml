    <AbstractNarration>An AGU Chapman conference on transport in highly heterogeneous porous media, with a particular focus on the MADE site (MS, USA), will be held at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia October&lt;br/&gt;5-8, 2015. Transport of contaminants and other compounds in groundwater systems remains a serious research question as well as a pressing societal problem. This meeting will convene researchers in transport in highly heterogeneous aquifers at the field scale with those interested in aquifer characterization and solute transport modeling to: 1) discuss the latest advances in subsurface characterization and modeling research, 2) define unresolved questions about aquifer characterization and modeling in highly heterogeneous aquifers, and 3) identify promising avenues for future research in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dealing with heterogeneity, particularly high multi-scale degrees of heterogeneity, in flow&lt;br/&gt;and transport properties is one of the grand challenges in groundwater hydrology. Experiments&lt;br/&gt;and modeling on the Macrodispersion Experiment (MADE) site, have yielded significant advances.&lt;br/&gt;However, many questions and challenges remain regarding transport in highly heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;media, the scale for characterization of subsurface heterogeneity, and the effectiveness of&lt;br/&gt;various models to predict transport in such systems. There is an urgent need to gather the&lt;br/&gt;research community to synthesize the state of current knowledge, This conference will synthesize what has been learned, identify and prioritize key future challenges in this field, determine promising avenues for improved aquifer characterization and modeling efforts, and, most importantly, catalyze collaborative&lt;br/&gt;and synergistic research by bringing together researchers with a diverse range of expertise to focus on common goals.</AbstractNarration>
