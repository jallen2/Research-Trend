    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: The micro- and nano-structured metamaterials with periodic patterns in all three dimensions can enable novel optical properties that are not attainable in naturally occurring materials. However, these metamaterials are very challenging to fabricate at micrometer length scales required to engineer the optical properties in the infrared region. This project involves the design, assembly and characterization of three-dimensional materials composed of periodic units of 0.1 to 10 micrometer in size with polyhedral geometries and precisely patterned surfaces. These metamaterials are designed to display a variety of previously unrealized properties in the mid-infrared region with potential applications for environmental monitoring, sensing, and biomedical engineering. The research results are integrated into educational curricula such as Infrared, Micro and Nanotechnologies at Johns Hopkins University. Through a number of educational activities, the project incorporates research experiences and participation of K-12 students and undergraduates including those from under-represented groups in the local Baltimore community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This project aims to design and characterize 3D infrared metamaterials by the self-assembly of microsized self-folded units with polyhedral geometries. The research includes the development of novel concepts such as "photonic metalattices," which combine the attractive features of metamaterials and photonic crystals, and reconfigurable metamaterials. The latter explores metamaterials that feature a chemically induced metal-insulator transition. Experimental methods include state-of-the-art nano- and micro-scale lithographic patterning, origami inspired and aggregative three-dimensional self-assembly. Furthermore, characterization using optical and electron microscopy and spectroscopy is carried out in order to investigate structural and optical properties. Simultaneously, theoretical research, based on the recently developed coupled mode methods is performed, and augmented by numerical methods to model experimental results.</AbstractNarration>
