    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to support participation by students and early career researchers, including members of under-represented groups, in the mathematical and physical sciences at the 14th Experimental Chaos and Complexity Conference (ECC 2016) to be held May 16-19, 2016 in Alberta, Canada. ECC 2016 will bring together an international group of researchers to improve the scientific understanding of complex systems such as the cardiac electrical system, the brain, energy and the power grid, social systems, earthquakes, and climate. The objective of ECC 2016 is to encourage and facilitate the collaboration of experimental and applied research in mathematics, physics, engineering, neuroscience, chemistry, and biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECC 2016 highlights new results in the study of complex systems at a variety of scales. The goal is to bring together experimentalists and applied researchers to study various aspects of of nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and complexity. Examples of applications where this type of collaboration has been successful include the cardiac electrical system, the brain, energy and the power grid, social systems, earthquakes, and climate. These systems can display chaotic dynamics, in that small changes in inputs or features of the system can cause large changes in behavior. The study of complexity and chaos by mathematicians, physicists, engineers, chemists, biologists, and neuroscientists has led to the ability to understand and control chaotic systems in areas ranging from control of cardiac chaos to improved efficiency in combustion systems. The award gives students and early career researchers, including members of under-represented groups, the opportunity to attend and participate in this conference, with the hope that it inspires new research directions and collaborations for this group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://wcm.ucalgary.ca/ecc2016/</AbstractNarration>
