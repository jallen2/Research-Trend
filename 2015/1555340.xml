    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to reveal and control charge transport in structurally complex semiconductors to ultimately yield the next generation of thermoelectric materials. The development of advanced thermoelectric materials could have a considerable impact on the nation's energy portfolio through solar thermoelectric generators, cogeneration, and waste heat recovery. More broadly, this program will lead to a deep understanding of charge transport in complex semiconductors that impacts other applications (e.g. transparent conductors, photovoltaic materials, power electronics). These research efforts will be integrated into the classroom through data-driven active learning modules. Community college students will be engaged in solid state materials chemistry and physics through summer research on this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;In thermoelectric materials, the energy-dependence of charge carrier transport plays a key role in determining the thermopower. Further, the interplay between solid state chemistry and charge transport in semiconductors is particularly rich due to the profound effects that even dilute chemical perturbations exert on electronic properties. There is thus a grand challenge to understand and control the energy dependence charge transport. In this project, the goal is to combine recent advances in structural determination and first principles calculations, in concert with single crystal growth and advanced transport measurements, to yield deep insight into charge transport through the careful integration of these measurements. With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this understanding will reveal the energy-dependence of charge carrier transport and the associated structural perturbations which can dramatically alter these properties.</AbstractNarration>
