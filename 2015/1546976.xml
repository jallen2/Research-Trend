    <AbstractNarration>The goals of the workshop, Cell and Matrix Mechanobiology: Current State and Future Directions; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; October 26-28, 2015; are to (1) clearly define the important barriers to progress in understanding how living cells feel and change their mechanical environment, (2) to discuss and define possible experiments and computer programs that are the tools needed to understand how mechanical sensation creates changes in cell activity, migration and tissue growth, (3) to explore the potential societal impact from developing new engineering technologies that artificially mimic the ability of cells to sense mechanical loading and adapt material microstructure, and, finally, (4) to create a research roadmap to guide the field so that the important goals can be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considerable experimental evidence acquired during the last three decades has now established that extracellular biophysical cues, such as forces and matrix stiffness, have a profound influence on a wide range of cell behaviors such as growth, motility, differentiation, apoptosis, gene expression, adhesion and signal transduction. More recently, it has been appreciated that cells not only respond to these cues from the matrix, but also remodel the matrix and hence influence the subsequent cues. This dynamic reciprocity gives rise to emergent properties of the cell/matrix system, and both components co-evolve with time. This is particularly prevalent in embryogenesis, development and tumor growth. The precise role of mechanics in determining this reciprocity remains elusive. World experts in the field attending the workshop will develop a roadmap and white paper for members of the community and the National Science Foundation to help guide future research to maximize the effectiveness of investigations in the new and potentially highly important research field.</AbstractNarration>
