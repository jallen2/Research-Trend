    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: Design and engineering the properties of matter at the atomic level is a new frontier in materials research that seeks to revolutionize applications employing quantum devices. Examples include electronic and optoelectronic devices with improved power and bandwidth performance, which can enable high performance electronics, photonics, and efficient communications. This vision has received a boost by the discovery of truly two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, metal dichalcogenides, boron nitride, and their combinations. These structures provide a compelling material platform for basic research and applications. Because the two-dimensional materials reach the ultimate limit of thinness, being essentially one atom thick, they require new ways of synthesis and assembly into practical devices and they offer new challenges to our understanding of fundamental and practical aspects of physics in two dimensions. This research team focuses on fundamental understanding of the science of atomically thin materials and their stacked structures, seeking discoveries of novel physical phenomena and exploring new device concepts. The team also works on education and outreach projects, supporting undergraduates and public school teachers. Through these research and educational projects, graduate students and undergraduates are educated in a highly interdisciplinary environment. The team also develops an active outreach partnership with the Museum of Science, Boston, to promote public awareness of science and technology at the nanoscale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The research focus of this interdisciplinary team is on the demonstration of new techniques for designing and assembling two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures and the fundamental study of novel emergent properties of these quantum heterostructures. Through this research, scientists and engineers in this team develop characterization tools and innovate electronic, plasmonic and optical devices based on various quantum behaviors, such as resonant tunneling. They explore new modalities for tunable continuous-wave terahertz generation and gate-modulation of optical and optoelectronic properties. The research team also investigates the microscopic electronic and magnetic properties of atomically thin heterostructures and develops multi-scale modeling of layered heterostructure devices. The formation of interfaces of unconventional low-dimensional materials systems and engineering of their electronic, optoelectronic and magnetic properties, carried out by this interdisciplinary team, leads to new device paradigms.</AbstractNarration>
