    <AbstractNarration>People can feel stigmatized and discriminated against for a variety of reasons, including religious expression, political ideology, socioeconomic status, race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Although research has examined the structural implications (economic, educational, healthcare, legal) of high profile judicial decisions for members of stigmatized social groups, very little work has studied the psychological consequences. Perhaps the most high profile social issue currently debated in the courts is whether marriage rights should extend to same-sex couples. This is a complex issue with heartfelt viewpoints expressed by people on both sides. The Supreme Court is currently considering the legality of same-sex marriage bans. This case promises to be a significant moment in American history regardless of the direction of the verdict. Given that many gay and lesbian individuals feel stigmatized by prohibitions against same-sex marriage, the current research is designed to examine the social psychological effects of this ruling (whichever way it turns out) on gay and lesbian individuals and a heterosexual comparison group. Drawing on social psychological theories of stigma and discrimination, a mediational model will be tested in which the court ruling may lead to changes in well-being by shifting individuals' perceptions of their stigmatized identity and subjective feelings of discrimination-related stress. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to our understanding of the effect of historic government-level decisions on health-relevant psychological processes of Americans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To examine these questions, 1000 participants (500 self-identified gay and lesbian individuals and 500 heterosexual comparisons) will be recruited for a longitudinal study in which they complete a research survey prior to the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage, 2 months post-ruling, and 6 months post-ruling. Changes in psychological variables related to social attitudes and how participants experience their social identities will be examined, as well as the effects of these changes on psychological and physical well-being. This study will inform our understanding of the social psychological factors involved in people's responses to judicial decisions that are relevant to their standing in society. These results are likely to extend beyond this specific issue and provide a platform for understanding how other judicial decisions might have similar or different psychological consequences.</AbstractNarration>
