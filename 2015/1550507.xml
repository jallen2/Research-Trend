    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on techniques for survey analysis that can inform decision making -- potentially in a broad range of areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D-Ready will use contemporary machine learning techniques to process and filter the data the team will collate regarding such areas as choice preferences. The proposed technology will be deployed with two goals in mind. A survey design methodology will be used to help ensure that decision-selection guidelines are unbiased for individual user. This is important because the more unbiased the decision support product, the more widely it will be trusted and used. The team will also use cursor-tracking technology to develop an in-depth statistical picture of how individual users view decision-support site-apps. This will allow for the team to use nonlinear regression and classification methods to segment users into distinct types. The insights learned from these analyses will be valuable to support decision makers in a broad range of applications. Applying the customer discovery process during the I-Corps curriculum, the team intends to come up with a more complete value proposition that it will provide and refine the product features that will be most useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D-Ready is envisioned as an online and mobile decision support guide that creates customized information for users that is simple, convenient and unbiased. The proposed technology has potentially broad applications in several areas including marketing, for example, where a three-step strategy of 1) defining an attraction for a certain population, 2) harvesting detailed interactive behavior data while users react to that attraction, and finally 3) analyzing that data for the purpose of market segmentation, represents a powerful new form of survey collection.</AbstractNarration>
