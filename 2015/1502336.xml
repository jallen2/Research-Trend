    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Elementary, analytic, and algorithmic number theory: Research inspired by the mathematics of Carl Pomerance" will be held June 9-11, 2015 at the University of Georgia in Athens, GA. The focus of this meeting is on three subfields of number theory: elementary number theory (which studies the basic properties of the natural numbers), analytic number theory (which takes a statistical perspective on these questions), and algorithmic number theory (which investigates how computers can be of assistance in answering number-theoretic questions). These three areas of mathematics are highly interconnected, with results in one area often stemming from progress in the other. While of fundamental theoretical importance, ideas from these fields have also found numerous applications outside of pure mathematics, digital security being a prominent example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature six hour-long plenary talks and fourteen invited 30-minute talks by experts in these fields. The talks will highlight the current state of research in these fields and draw attention to the central open problems. On June 8, the day prior the start of the main conference activities, the organizers will host a special day of talks by young researchers. The goal here is to give visibility to up and coming mathematicians and to encourage interchange of ideas - both vertically (among students, junior faculty, and world-class researchers) and horizontally (among researchers in different fields of number theory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see the conference web-site: http://www.math.uga.edu/~cp70/CP70/Home.html</AbstractNarration>
