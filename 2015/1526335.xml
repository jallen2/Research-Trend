    <AbstractNarration>Computational geometry is the discipline that creates algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;design and manipulate shapes. It has wide application in science,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and industry -- CAD/CAM systems are a notable example.&lt;br/&gt;The problem is, where we see shapes and their spatial relations, the&lt;br/&gt;computer sees only numbers -- and usually, for speed, only&lt;br/&gt;approximate, "floating-point" numbers. E.g., points on a line that&lt;br/&gt;are represented as numerical coordinates, when rounded to the&lt;br/&gt;number of digits the computer stores, may no longer lie on any common&lt;br/&gt;line. Subsequent calculations that rely on a line being straight or&lt;br/&gt;two lines intersecting at most once can then go badly astray. Error&lt;br/&gt;in numerical computation can sometimes be limited by rounding, but&lt;br/&gt;there is no practical technique for rounding three-dimensional shapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates shape rounding by encasement:&lt;br/&gt;High-complexity shapes are encased in approximating polyhedra with&lt;br/&gt;floating-point vertex coordinates. Given an encasement, the PIs have&lt;br/&gt;described a rounding algorithm that projects input features to nearby&lt;br/&gt;encasement features. For dealing with intersections of surfaces, the&lt;br/&gt;project creates output-sensitive algorithms for another type of&lt;br/&gt;encasement, an isolating encasement that can have distant boundary&lt;br/&gt;vertices but cannot encase other features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encasement is only part of the solution, so the project also explores&lt;br/&gt;ways to compute topological structure using bounded-complexity&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic by avoiding numerical computation for the degenerate (zero)&lt;br/&gt;expressions. It investigates using graph theory to analyze explicit&lt;br/&gt;expressions and algebraic techniques to analyze expressions involving&lt;br/&gt;roots of polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome is to include a software library for implementing&lt;br/&gt;computational geometry algorithms with automated shape rounding. The&lt;br/&gt;project integrates education and research through an introductory&lt;br/&gt;computational geometry course in which standard algorithms are taught&lt;br/&gt;and implemented using the library. Previously, the computational cost&lt;br/&gt;of multi-step algorithms forced students to consider each algorithm in&lt;br/&gt;isolation.</AbstractNarration>
