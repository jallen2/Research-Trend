    <AbstractNarration>The importance of metagenomics arises from the fact that over 99% of&lt;br/&gt;the species yet to be discovered are resistant to cultivation. Unlike&lt;br/&gt;single genome sequencing, assembly of a metagenome is intractable and&lt;br/&gt;is in large part, an unsolved mystery. Moreover, the advent of high&lt;br/&gt;throughput sequencing is fueling rapid generation of enormous&lt;br/&gt;metagenomic datasets. There is no available sequenced genome for a&lt;br/&gt;majority of the species. There is a need to determine the number of species in&lt;br/&gt;a metagenomic dataset as well as the abundance of each of these&lt;br/&gt;species. The key steps (Assembly and Clustering) in the metagenomics&lt;br/&gt;analysis algorithms are compute-intensive, while the sheer amount of&lt;br/&gt;data the algorithms operate on is staggering. The most promising way&lt;br/&gt;to tackle the computational challenges is to build special purpose&lt;br/&gt;hardware, dedicated solely to suitable algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to develop a range of flexible,&lt;br/&gt;affordable, parallel, fast hardware-accelerated bioinformatics&lt;br/&gt;solutions, using GPGPU, FPGA, and ASIC, for metagenomic analytics to provide an alternative to&lt;br/&gt;expensive computer clusters. Specifically, hardware solutions for&lt;br/&gt;metagenomic clustering and assembly will be developed. Several&lt;br/&gt;acceleration methodologies, including parallel software mapping and&lt;br/&gt;special hardware design, are proposed to explore the parallelism&lt;br/&gt;inside the applications and to improve the data access bandwidth in&lt;br/&gt;the hardware running bioinformatics applications. The ideas proposed&lt;br/&gt;in this work will be evaluated in a multi-pronged manner using a&lt;br/&gt;combination of simulation, emulation and prototyping efforts. Further,&lt;br/&gt;the PIs will use a combination of commercial tools, collaborator&lt;br/&gt;resources and existing internal tools. The research will be &lt;br/&gt;conducted in collaboration with industrial partners. Through close&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with several industry partners, direct transfer of many&lt;br/&gt;ideas to industry is enabled. The outcome of this research will,&lt;br/&gt;therefore, have a direct impact on future bioinformatics application&lt;br/&gt;solutions. This project will involve graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students in all aspects of the research. The PIs will actively&lt;br/&gt;integrate the research results from this project into the graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate curricula, and develop new interdisciplinary courses on&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics and computer architecture to train the next generation&lt;br/&gt;work-force. Finally, the tools and techniques developed in this&lt;br/&gt;research will be made available through web-sites for use by other&lt;br/&gt;educators, researchers, and industry practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
