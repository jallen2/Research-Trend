    <AbstractNarration>The increasing emergence and spread of pathogens are serious concerns for both human and wildlife populations. The threat is substantially greater for populations of endangered species because they often have reduced genetic diversity, which could impair immune function and increase their susceptibility to disease. However, to date no studies have directly examined diversity at immune genes and their relationship to both disease resistance and survival. In greater prairie-chickens, we previously found that diversity at a variety of immune genes was reduced in small populations, but it remains unclear how that will affect individuals. The current study will extend that research and specifically examine how immune gene diversity in individuals is related to their immune function and survival in the wild. Thus, the results from this study will provide a broader understanding of the importance of immune gene diversity to individual survival and ultimately entire populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Attwater?s prairie-chicken is one of the most endangered birds in North America. The persistence of the remaining wild population relies entirely on a large captive breeding and release program in Texas. About 200 captive-bred juveniles are released each year, but 79% of them die within nine months. It is known that outbred individuals have greater survival, but previous work showed no relationship between genome-wide genetic diversity and four immunological assays for pathogen resistance. The intense captive breeding and release program provides an unparalleled opportunity to study how diversity at immune genes directly influences immune function and survival. This study will characterize immune gene diversity across a wide array of immune genes (encompassing both innate and acquired immunity) in prairie-chickens and correlate it with data on immune function and survival already obtained from previously released birds. The results from this study will provide a broader understanding of the links between immune genes and survival, and, therefore, help managers make informed decisions about which individuals to pair for breeding or release into the wild.</AbstractNarration>
