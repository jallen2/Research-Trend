    <AbstractNarration>This Noyce Teacher Scholarship and Stipend project will prepare 15 undergraduates with interest and ability in mathematics to teach in high-needs rural or urban-centered school districts. Each student who completes the program, will graduate with a bachelor's degree in mathematics as well as with a bachelor's degree in secondary education (mathematics) or a master's degree in mathematics education. The scholars will be provided with opportunities to (a) tutor students in an Upward Bound or a second-language learning program, (b) design and teach lessons, (c) do a variety of field placements, and (d) participate in seminars that focus on place-based teaching in high-needs schools. The project will be conducted in partnership with a variety of Pennsylvania schools in Bald Eagle, McKeesport Area, Moshannon Valley, Penns Valley, West Branch, West Mifflin Area, Woodland Hills, and in Pittsburgh City Schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key features of the project (multiple field placements, place-based pedagogy, and high school to college connections) are grounded on emerging research in the training of pre-service teachers. Throughout the project, students will be given the opportunity to participate in field experiences such as the Philadelphia Urban Seminar, a placement during which students, will be immersed in an urban high-needs community. The coursework related to linking high school and college mathematics should enable the new teachers to help their students become college-ready. Formative and summative evaluation will address the success of the program in reaching its retention, graduation, placement, and educational goals. Assessment will be performed through a series of interviews, focus groups, and classroom observations. Project results will be presented at meetings of the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators and the Mathematics Association of America group on Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education. Manuscripts will be submitted to the Journal of Teacher Education, the Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education, and the Mathematics Teacher Educator.</AbstractNarration>
