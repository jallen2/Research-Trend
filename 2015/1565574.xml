    <AbstractNarration>The California State University-San Bernardino (CSUSB) proposes to add four new cohorts of 10 undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity with dynamic curriculum, unique applied learning requirements, and a diverse student population. The curriculum is designed around the needs of government organizations seeking well-qualified students. CSUSB's service area is populated with residents from diverse ethnic backgrounds, including those groups that are currently underrepresented in cybersecurity field. Most SFS students are first generation minority students, transferring from community colleges, often from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds, coming to college less academically and socially prepared than their non-first generation peers. From tutoring to etiquette to professional behavior, CSUSB places great emphasis on ensuring that this diverse student cohort (50% Hispanic, and 43% female) learns the skills necessary to successfully obtain and retain professional employment. The program has achieved 100% placement rate of their graduates and has mentored other institutions as to the best practices in recruitment diversity, placement strategies, leveraging university resources, and program management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While many SFS programs across the country focus on policy, management of technology, or secure programming and development, CSUSB has created a curriculum that combines the elements of various programs, including some elements of national security studies. A typical CSUSB SFS student is well versed in cyber security policy, tactics, threat analysis, counter intelligence, networking, database, offensive and defensive penetration testing, and forensics, all with applied professional experiences. The project objectives include: 1) recruit four cohorts of Scholars, each with 10 graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds; 2) provide academic support and mentoring to the Scholars that result in a 100% retention rate; 3) facilitate the ongoing application of their knowledge and skills by participating in at least one workshop per quarter, two technology competitions per year and at least 50 hours per quarter in the Cyber Security Center Research Lab; and 4) place 100% of the Scholars in internships and employment in federal, state, local or tribal cyber service positions by summer 2021.</AbstractNarration>
