    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Hawaii at Hilo (UH-Hilo) Analytical Laboratory to acquire an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. This new instrument will be capable of analyzing solid samples like soils, as well as plant and animal tissues for stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen. It will also be able to analyze liquid samples for stable nitrogen and oxygen isotopes in nitrate, hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water, and stable carbon isotopes in dissolved organic carbon and carbon dioxide. This instrument will be the only one on Hawaii Island capable of these analyses, and the only one in the state and the greater tropical Pacific island region capable of measuring stable isotopes of sulfur and hydrogen in solid samples, as well as dissolved organic carbon. The Analytical Laboratory is integral to the UH-Hilo's mission to inspire learning, discovery, and creativity inside and outside of the classroom, and improve the quality of life in Hawaii, the Pacific region, and the world. It is the only facility on Hawaii Island that trains students, many of which are from underrepresented groups (Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and female), to use analytical instrumentation for environmental sample analysis. The expanded stable isotope analyses capability of the Laboratory will engage even more underrepresented students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, exposing them to cutting-edge technology, and allowing them to gain meaningful, employable research experience. These experiences will increase student retention and improve recruitment. Collaborations among UH system faculty, federal agencies, and researchers from other national and international institutions will be enhanced with this new instrument. Products resulting from use of this instrument will be disseminated via the Laboratory website, student symposia, as well as faculty conferences and peer-reviewed publications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of stable isotopes in ecology have grown exponentially in the last 20 years allowing for a greater understanding of biogeochemical cycles in natural and human-influenced ecosystems, food web structure and dynamics, animal migrations, paleoclimate, as well as the ability to identify pollution sources and track them. This instrument will allow for a new suite of elements in different forms to be analyzed, substantially increasing the types of studies and student training the UH-Hilo Analytical Laboratory can support in and out of state. Additionally, faculty and students across the UH-Hilo campus will have access to this state-of-the-art technology for their research projects and courses. UH-Hilo is located on Hawaii Island which is often referred to as a "Living Laboratory" because of its numerous climatic zones, active volcano, coral reefs, and high rate of endemism; therefore, the new types of cutting-edge stable isotope studies with this new instrument are endless.</AbstractNarration>
