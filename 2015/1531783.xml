    <AbstractNarration>Laser systems capable of generating ultra-short pulses have become a powerful tool for both fundamental research and advanced manufacturing processes. This MRI award supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art femtosecond laser system (FLS) capable of emitting coherent light over a broad spectral range. The FLS enables potentially transformative multidisciplinary research leading to new green energy technologies and enhanced medical imaging with more functional nanoparticles, more effective gene therapy through knowledge of how to introduce genetic material into cells, and enhanced performance of microelectronic devices through development of new processes for fabricating ultra-small 3D devices. The instrumentation will dramatically expand the scope and significance of laser processing work in southern New Jersey. Students from several STEM majors will be involved in the research and the instrumentation facilitates efforts at Rutgers University-Camden to reach out to traditionally under-represented groups within the STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects include: (1) a fundamental study of the laser-material interactions associated with a laser-based method for the synthesis of nanoparticles. The benefits of this approach, dubbed laser ablation in liquids (LAL), are its foundations in green technology and capability of producing a wide variety of nanoparticles. This work will combine experimental and computational efforts to better understand the mechanisms leading to particle size and composition, both of which are critical parameters in nanoparticle functionality. (2) An investigation of the interactions between photoexcited particles and cell membranes found in nanoparticle-meditated photoporation. Gene therapy is rapidly becoming one of the most powerful techniques that medical practitioners have to fight disease. An important process in this therapy is transfection, i.e. introduction of genetic material into the cells. This project will ascertain how photoexcited nanoparticles generate transient pores within the cell membrane permitting the targeted introduction of genetic material. (3) Development of a comprehensive understanding of the factors leading to successful formation of 3D microstructures using multiphoton absorption polymerization (MAP). As an example, the researchers will investigate the fabrication of micro-fluidic heat exchanges that have sub-wavelength features. In this regard, photosensitive resins will be formulated that polymerize under exposure to intense light with wavelengths otherwise transparent to material; hence, allowing ultra-small 3D structures to be manufactured.</AbstractNarration>
