    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to improve technician education and increase the number of skilled workers in STEM priority areas. The project will build upon the results of a pilot effort that evaluated several strategies to retain more female college students in two-year technician preparation programs. The specific goals of this scale-up project are to: (1) narrow the gender equity enrollment and persistence gap among female college students in targeted advanced technology education priority areas; and (2) improve all students' attainment of college course learning objectives in targeted advanced technology education priority areas. These goals will be accomplished through three main activity components: wider adaptation/implementation across six Partner Colleges in the Southern Appalachian Region (North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee); broader institutionalization at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College (A-B Tech); and execution of a learning community proof of concept effort at A-B Tech. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the project is that the unique combination of gender equity practices, problem-based learning, and a support network are critically important to recruitment and retention of all students - particularly under-represented populations, such as female students in technology and engineering programs. Through this project, a significant benefit to society will be realized as the STEM "pathway" is expanded. Dissemination of results will take place through presentations and other sharing activities at the local, regional and national level. A viable and reproducible model for high school, community college, and university pathway efforts is being developed, and the model is expected to address an increasing labor shortage of STEM technicians and professionals.</AbstractNarration>
