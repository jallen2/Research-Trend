    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: The behavior of electrons in a solid material is central to electrical and optical characteristics of the material and plays a critical role in determining the performance of electronic and optoelectronic devices such as transistors, photodetectors, and solar cells. Recently, two-dimensional materials, with the thickness down to a single atomic layer, have emerged as a new class of material systems with novel properties beyond conventional bulk materials. This project studies the charge carrier transport and dynamics in a technologically important two-dimensional material, indium selenide, and develops a fundamental understanding of the synthesis-structure-property relation. The research is integrated into education and outreach activities. In addition to providing research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including those from the underrepresented groups in science and engineering, the research results generated in this project are incorporated into the classroom teaching and hands-on experience with optics, electric circuits, and photovoltaics is offered to high school students through a summer workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This research project aims to establish a fundamental understanding of charge carrier transport and ultrafast carrier dynamics in two-dimensional indium selenide. This project involves patterned synthesis of atomically thin single-crystal indium selenide over a large area using van der Waals epitaxy, and property characterizations utilizing a combination of transmission electron microscopy, confocal Raman spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and spatially resolved ultrafast optical pump-probe techniques. This project addresses important issues in this material, particularly the transport properties and dynamics of both majority and minority charge carriers, and the correlation among the properties, structures, and material synthesis. The understanding of this synthesis-structure-property relation provides a fundamental materials science basis for innovative optoelectronic applications.</AbstractNarration>
