    <AbstractNarration>Non-marital births are an increasingly common occurrence around the world. In 2013, they accounted for two-fifths of births in the United States and an even higher proportion in much of the rest of the world. Marital dissolution also occurs at high rates and across cultures, infidelity is one of the most commonly cited reasons for divorce. Traditionally, marital dissolution has been associated with negative consequences for both mothers and children, including poorer health, lower socio-economic status, and lower educational attainment. This raises the question about why women choose to switch or maintain partners and whether there are circumstances under which doing one or the other might be beneficial. University of California-Los Angeles anthropologist, Dr. Brooke Scelza, will lead a team to conduct a bio-cultural investigation of the causes and consequences of female partnership selectivity to understand the significance of these worldwide shifts in 21st century family dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scientific study requires that the factors behind these behaviors be disaggregated from potentially confounding variables. This requires that the research be conducted in a smaller-scale and more isolated group than can be found in the United States. Therefore, the researchers will travel to northwest Namibia where they can study the Himba, a semi-nomadic pastoralist group. The Himba provide an appropriate research site because they have high rates of divorce, self-reported infidelity, and non-marital births. If these behaviors benefit women over their lifespans, these benefits should show up in Himba data. The research team will first document Himba cultural models of family and relationship dynamics. They will then compare these models to actual behaviors, using data from marital and reproductive histories. This will allow them to assess how often women's behaviors match preferences, which women are most likely to have partners that meet their ideals, and when alternative strategies of non-marital reproduction are most likely to occur. Finally, the consequences of having multiple partners will be assessed by tracking resource transfers and health outcomes. Findings from this research will help social scientists understand the significance of changing marital patterns and alternative reproductive strategies wherever they occur. The research will also provide insight into why women seek non-traditional partnerships, which is essential for developing practical and effective outreach and social services.</AbstractNarration>
