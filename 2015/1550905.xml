    <AbstractNarration>In June 2014, with support from NSF, the first ComputEL workshop was held in conjunction with the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) in Baltimore, Maryland. The goal of that workshop was to serve as an initial meeting point between computer scientists and computational linguists active in ACL and documentary linguists engaged in work on endangered languages. This proposal seeks to build on lessons learned in the first ComputEL workshop, and to encourage new collaborations between the two research communities. Contemporary efforts to document the world's endangered languages are dependent on the widespread availability of modern recording technologies, in particular digital audio and video recording devices and software to annotate the recordings that such devices produce. However, despite well over a decade of funding programs dedicated to the documentation of endangered languages, the technological landscape that supports the activities of those involved in this work remains fragmented, and the promises of new technology remain largely unfulfilled. Moreover, the efforts of computer scientists, on the whole, are mostly disconnected from the day-to-day work of documentary linguists, making it difficult for the knowledge of each group to inform the other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second ComputEL workshop will address this state of affairs by bringing together field linguists and computer scientists to explore how computational techniques and tools can be created to better aid in the analysis of endangered languages. A particular focus will be on how to facilitate the process through which research results in this domain can be developed into software that is well-supported for use by those documenting endangered languages in the field. The workshop will be co-located with the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) in Austin, Texas, in October 2016. This will allow it to reach a wider audience than would otherwise be possible, while taking advantage of its location to involve participants from nearby areas. On the first day, participants will take part in discussions as part of a closed meeting that will be designed to lay out a near-term agenda for the improved application of computational methods to the study of endangered languages. The second day will consist of research presentations scheduled jointly with the main EMNLP conference. The papers from the workshop will be published in the Association for Computational Linguistics conference proceedings, and an additional report will be produced summarizing the conclusions of the closed meeting. Smaller speaker communities worldwide will benefit from the results which will support better documentation and preservation of endangered languages.</AbstractNarration>
