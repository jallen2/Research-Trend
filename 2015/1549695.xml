    <AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator: Gary W Brudvig&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: 1549695&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solar fuel processes harness the energy in sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into chemicals fuels using catalysts inspired by photosynthesis processes in living plants. Although this process has the potential to replace petroleum fuels and provide an environmentally sustainable supply of transportation fuel, present processes do not work well - they cannot take carbon dioxide all the way to chemicals and fuels in a single step, and the catalysts are expensive and not very efficient. More fundamental research is needed to make solar fuels a viable technology. The 2016 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Solar Fuels focus on identifying the progress, challenges and opportunities of interdisciplinary scientific research for the development of new catalysts based on nature-inspired processes to advance scientific understanding and development of better solar fuel processes. The Solar Fuels GRC is an international conference under US leadership, and will be held on February 28 to March 4, 2016 at the Il Ciocco Hotel and Resort, Lucca (Barga), Italy. The 2016 Solar Fuels GRC has an associated GRS on Solar Fuels, which is a gathering dedicated exclusively to contributions from graduate students and post-doctoral research associates. The Solar Fuels GRS immediately precedes the GRC on February 27 &amp; 28, 2016 at the same location. This award will provide partial support for both the GRC and GRS. The GRC program will include invited oral presentations by early career researchers who are already showing potential for making new breakthroughs, as well as established researchers, and poster presentations from which some will be selected for short oral presentations. The award will be used support the registration fees of selected participants for the GRC and the GRS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solar Fuels GRC will focus on five fundamental scientific and technological challenges needed to realize solar fuels: 1) Efficient coupling of light-driven water oxidation catalysis with proton or carbon dioxide reduction; 2) Understanding of charge transport processes between photoactive components and across multiple interfaces of solid state inorganic or molecular integrated assemblies; 3) Carbon dioxide reduction at low overpotential, in particular to more deeply reduced products beyond CO or formate; 4) Novel materials for light capture and photocatalysis; 5) New design principles for biological photosystems with applications to artificial photosynthesis and integration artificial photosynthetic components with microbial catalysis. The Solar Fuels GRS will focus on artificial photosystems. Given the interdisciplinary nature of these challenges, the participants include chemists, physicists, materials and computational scientists, biophysicists, chemical engineers, and bioengineers. Furthermore, the fundamental experimental and theoretical topics underlying solar fuels - charge transfer, catalysis, materials discovery, nanoscience, molecular and biological dynamics, interface engineering, and others - discussed at the meeting go beyond just the chemical and materials sciences. The participants will share their recent results and ongoing effort in their specific area of work, and at the same time expose themselves to the challenges and progress in areas beyond their immediate expertise or field of specialization. The latter is a critical educational aspect for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early career scientists in particular who will meet and brainstorm with established scientists and leading members of this community.</AbstractNarration>
