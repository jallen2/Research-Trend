    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses the structural engineering of buildings by constructing engineering concepts through topology optimization. Structural topology relates to geometric configurations of components that fit in to the structural system of the building. The goal is to tailor topology optimization techniques to building systems and to use this technology as a means to connect architects and engineers in design of buildings. To achieve this goal, the challenges are to move away from traditional ?box-like? building shapes by exploring innovative bio-inspired and natural artistic designs as well as to enable a formal linkage between structural engineering and architecture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed techniques for tailored building design will be a novel addition to the realm of topology optimization. This research will explore natural load path topology optimization of tall buildings; will provide integration of structural engineering and architecture design optimization through the final design of buildings; will achieve new advances in lateral bracing systems; and will develop high-fidelity computational models. The computational framework will be formulated to provide both architects and engineers freedom to design innovative buildings that are artistic and yet with pragmatic consideration of economy. The Co-PI, a principal in a consulting engineering company, has background in design of super-tall buildings. The students working in the project will intern in the consulting company and the inter-disciplinary research team will work in close collaboration in all stages of the project.</AbstractNarration>
