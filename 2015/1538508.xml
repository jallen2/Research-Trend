    <AbstractNarration>As an engineered system ages, it becomes more prone to failure. Health management of aging engineered systems is the science that seeks to proactively prevent, mitigate and recover from potential system failures. It can potentially make an aging engineered system failure-resilient, thus substantially reducing its lifecycle costs. However, current approaches to engineering design have not taken advantage of such health management data. This award supports fundamental research to create the knowledge needed for health-management-informed design of resilient engineered systems. Specifically, it will develop new methods and tools for design that integrate health management into the design phase of an engineered system. The new design methods and tools can be used by designers to develop failure resilient engineered systems with reduced lifecycle costs. The outcome of this research is likely to stimulate growth in several technologically advanced industries, such as green energy or aviation, which currently often suffer from catastrophic failures and high maintenance costs. This research also offers unique research and educational experiences for researchers across the fields of engineering design, prognostics, and health management. Students will be trained in an interdisciplinary learning environment. An engineering resilience database will be created and made widely accessible to public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research pioneers a novel data-driven design model synchronization platform for resilient engineered systems development by integrating health management into systems design. Previously, quantitative analysis methods of health management were only used at the operating stage of a system and were not exploited for early-stage design. To enable health management being used for early-stage design, this research encompasses three thrusts: 1) time-variant design modeling, that models time-dependent system failures using novel modeling methods and tools to be created; 2) data-driven design model synchronization, which updates design models using sensory data acquired from actual aging engineered systems; and 3) model-based prognostics of remaining useful life, that enable updated design models being used for lifecycle health management. By introducing time-variant design models, this research offers a unique solution to consider system performance degradation in the design phase of engineered systems. The outcome of this research will open the door towards utilizing system design models to address post-design stage system failures, thereby leading to resilient design of aging engineered systems.</AbstractNarration>
