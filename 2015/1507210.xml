    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project intends to address the cost and supply issues of rare-earth element (REE)-based phosphors currently used in solid state lighting technologies through the development of alternative highly luminescent materials. These inorganic-organic hybrid materials are cost-effective, solution-processable, and 100% free of REEs. They show strong promise for general lighting and illumination applications. The ultimate objective is to achieve high luminous efficacy and color quality comparable to commercial products in the lighting market. Successful implementation of this project can contribute significantly to reducing dependence on REEs. This project also serves as an excellent platform for the research and training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, as well as an opportunity to develop other educational and outreach activities within and beyond the Rutgers community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Two types of REE-free hybrid phosphor materials will be the focus of this study: the MX(L) family (M = Cu, Ag; X = Cl, Br, I; L = N-ligand) built on strongly-luminescent MX cluster modules, with an emphasis on cuprous iodide hybrid structures; and the Zn(FP) family constructed from highly-emissive molecular fluorophores (FPs). The research team aims to gain a better understanding of the optical behavior of the two hybrid material families and specifically of the origin of photoluminescence, the nature of atomic and/or molecular interactions at the inorganic-organic interface, and the effect of such interactions on the absorption and emission efficiency, color quality, structural integrity, and moisture and thermal stability of these materials. This is achieved through a truly integrated and synergistic approach that combines state-of-the-art theoretical methods and experimental spectroscopic techniques to guide design, synthesis, and structure modification, and to evaluate and understand the photophysical properties. This approach allows the PI to optimize and enhance the targeted functionality in a systematic manner and to conduct an in-depth study to correlate the relationship between observed optical properties and structure, composition, and chemical bonding of the hybrid systems.</AbstractNarration>
