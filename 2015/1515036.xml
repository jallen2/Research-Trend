    <AbstractNarration>Apomictic reproduction is prevalent and important to the evolution of all plants. Apomictic plants are species that reproduce asexually; they are essentially clones of their parents. These species often arise from hybridization. In studying the evolution of groups in which apomixis is prevalent, it is critical to determine the progenitors, and therefore evolutionary origins, of apomicts to fully understand their relationships to other species, as well as their contribution to species diversity. This award supports research aimed at elucidating the role of apomictic reproduction in a group of ferns native to China. Specifically, the research uses molecular phylogenetic methods to investigate the potentially hybrid evolutionary origins of apomicts in Chinese holly ferns. By developing a better picture of how asexual ferns have evolved, scientists can better understand how much novel genetic diversity asexual ferns contribute to biodiversity. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Chunxiang Li of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology and Dr. Libing Zhang of the Chengdu Institute of Biology. The collaboration will offer insights into little known parts of China?s biodiversity and advance understanding of key questions in evolutionary biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genus Polystichum (Dryopteridaceae) is most diverse across Southern China, and includes several asexually reproducing lineages, most of which belong to the subgenus Xiphopolystichum. These species will be collected and genetic analysis performed to understand relationships among these lineages as well as their potential hybrid origins. Identifying the progenitors of hybrids in the subgenus will elucidate the extent to which asexually reproducing ferns belong to reticulate groups and share progenitors. Although asexual lineages contribute to extant biodiversity, by sharing progenitors they may also share entire genomes and may not be very genetically distinct. By understanding the evolution of plant asexuality, a phenomenon important across plants, in Xiphopolystichum, a better understanding of the evolution of plant biodiversity can be developed. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
