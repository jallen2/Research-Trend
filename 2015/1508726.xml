    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Isiah Warner and colleagues at Louisiana State University to develop novel composite materials derived from a Group of Uniform Materials Based on Organic Salts (GUMBOS) in combination with select polymers for detection and molecular weight determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). These GUMBOS-based composites are designed to provide selectivity for a general class of compounds or for a small group of closely related compounds. These composite materials have distinct advantages for rapid and sensitive sensing of compounds such as benzene, methanol, and other compounds important to environmental measurements. The broader impacts of this work are addressed scientifically in that the further development of the QCM will advance its use in many other fields where both molecular weight and chemical property information is desired. In addition, the research team is known for its recruitment, retention, and mentoring of STEM students and professionals that represent diverse populations, many of whom come from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is based on the discovery that by use of certain viscoelastic materials as sensors, the ratio of two parameters (delta-f/delta-R) simultaneously acquired during QCM Measurements can provide molecular weight estimates of absorbed molecules. The research is divided into three distinct areas: 1) examination of the detailed characteristics of the composite materials such that this information will be used to design and develop pure ionic liquids, GUMBOS, and composites for selective determination of certain classes or structures of analytes; 2) detailed studies of sensor arrays which will allow comprehensive characterization of mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs); and 3) development of the QCM for detection and analyses of VOCs separated by use of gas chromatographs and a novel portable QCM.</AbstractNarration>
