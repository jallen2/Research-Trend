    <AbstractNarration>The PLAN-D funding track is designed to expand the application of proven-successful gender-equity initiatives for STEM faculty in a specific disciplinary area through networked adaptation of a specific program or initiative. Careful evaluation is expected to expand understanding of such initiatives in a disciplinary context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create mutual mentoring eAlliances for professional development under the auspices of the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) by developing ten alliances of women physics faculty who are isolated in various ways. This intervention will directly impact the careers of the fifty women physics faculty members who participate in the mutual mentoring alliances supported by this project. eAlliance participants will meet initially in-person at professional meetings followed by regular electronic meetings. This project will reduce the isolation of participating physicists and provide support to enhance their career development. The project evaluation will identify the benefits of mutual mentoring networks, particularly for isolated faculty, and add to the research on the impact of mutual mentoring on career development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and test a cost-effective model for mentoring for physics educators which could be adapted for other academic scientists and other work environments. eAlliances of mutual mentors will aid in the professional development of participants who are isolated by virtue of gender, race, sexual orientation, and/or type of institution. This project is based on past ADVANCE projects and research on the effects of isolation and good mentoring practices. The project has the potential to enhance retention and job satisfaction of isolated physics faculty. This project will work toward institutionalizing these mentoring networks within AAPT. Because the project will be implemented by the AAPT, the project will help to professionalize and highlight the importance of mentoring within the physics community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF ADVANCE Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Networks (PLAN) program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers. PLAN projects also contribute to the knowledge base on gender equity in STEM academic careers.</AbstractNarration>
