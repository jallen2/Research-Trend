    <AbstractNarration>This Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship project seeks to provide activities for the development of 16 school-based leaders in mathematics, who are deeply grounded in sound content and research-based pedagogical, leadership, adult education, and mathematics advocacy skills. The master teachers will participate in coursework that highlights mathematics content and pedagogical techniques and complementary Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID) Path Trainings on classroom strategies that utilize writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, and reading (WICOR) and culturally relevant teaching. The master teachers will have a variety of opportunities to take leadership roles such as performing mathematics demonstrations, co-teaching courses, and acting as district advocates in their high-needs schools. The project involves collaboration between the Rice University School Mathematics Project, Tapia Center for Excellence and Equity, and Glasscock School of Continuing Studies, AVID, and educators from the Houston Independent School District.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship project will utilize Avid Path Trainings and complementary, content-rich graduate courses to develop master teachers ability to prepare college-ready, STEM students. The focus on WICOR and culturally relevant teaching are in response to an emerging body of research that recommends that training for instructional leaders integrate high-quality instructional methods in an equitable learning environment. A novel aspect of the project is the introduction to adult education skills that master teachers will receive, which they will then apply as they mentor other teachers. This work is grounded in the theory of andragogy, which has six principles that address adult learners' (1) need to know, (2) self-concept, (3) prior experiences, (4) readiness to learn, (5) orientation to learning, and (6) motivation to learn. Project evaluation will include assessment of the master teachers' effectiveness through Teaching for Robust Understanding of Mathematics classroom observation protocols, leadership through a modified version of the Survey for AVID Teachers, and adult education skills through the Andragogical Practices Inventory. The Diverse Disposition Index will be use to assess their understanding of diversity and equity issues. The results of the evaluation plan will be disseminated throughout the region through the Texas Education Agency, Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Charles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas Regional Education Service Centers, and the Harris County Department of Education.</AbstractNarration>
