    <AbstractNarration>NON TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $8,000 are recommended in partial support of the travel expenses and registration of ten underrepresented group scientists and junior faculty to attend the Pacific Polymer Conference (PPC)14, sponsored by the American Chemical Society?s Polymer Chemistry Division, to be held on 9-13 December 2015 in Kauai, Hawaii. The conference is the product of the Pacific Polymer Federation (PPF) which is a regional organization of individual polymer societies from around the Pacific Rim and Pacific islands currently numbering seventeen member societies from fourteen countries. The objective of the PPCs, which are held every two years and rotate among member societies, is to bring together polymer scientists from the Pacific region to discuss and exchange recent advances in polymer science, polymer technology, and the application of polymers. The last conference in the series organized by a US society was held in 2005. The planned conference which is scientifically and technologically comprehensive, is organized into six main sessions, each encompassing two or more subsessions. The main sessions are: (1) POLYMER SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY. (2) BIO-RELATED POLYMERS. (3) POLYMER PHYSICS and PROCESSING. (4) ENERGY. (5) ENVIRONMENT. (6) SPECIAL TOPICS. The proposal includes a running list of expert invited speakers for each session. The conference offers the opportunity for the development of closer ties among Pacific Rim polymer groups and individual scientists, to mutual benefit.</AbstractNarration>
