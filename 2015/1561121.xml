    <AbstractNarration>This award uses funds, under the auspices of the Rapid Response Research (RAPID)concept, to maintain long-term monitoring sites at Genovesa and Bainbridge crater lakes, Galápagos to capture the 2015/2016 El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event and identify the impact of a potentially strong El Niño events on key Galápagos lake sediment archives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sediment records from Genovesa and Bainbridge have provided long records of past changes in tropical Pacific climate variability, particularly variability associated with the ENSO. However, existing hypotheses for the impact of climate variability on sedimentation in these lakes have not been field tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2009, the PI and her research collaborators deployed weather stations and in-lake sondes, as well as simple sediment traps, to test existing hypotheses for sedimentation in these lakes. These instruments have produced nearly continuous daily data on the climate and limnology of the crater lakes from December 2009 to present, a period that covers more than five full seasonal cycles and includes a weak El Niño, a moderate El Niño, and sustained La Niña conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research results to date have prompted a re-thinking of published interpretations of lake-based climate reconstructions. However, the real-time monitoring has not captured the impact of a strong El Niño event on the climate, limnology and sedimentation of these lakes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher argues that it is therefore critical that she be able to isolate the impact of the strong 2015/16 El Niño on sedimentation in these lakes to test competing hypotheses for the impact of ENSO events on sedimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the funds will be used to support two trips for a team of three researchers to collect data and redeploy long-term monitoring instruments at Bainbridge and Genovesa crater lakes prior to and following the 2015/2016 El Niño event. This data will be used to address two key research questions regarding sedimentation in these key archives: (1) What is the signature of strong El Niño events? and (2) What is the primary driver of carbonate precipitation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts include providing a long-term monitoring dataset and improving reconstructions of the strength and frequency of ENSO events in the past, which will help constrain the range of variability observed in the region. This project will support an early-career female researcher and provide educational and research opportunities for U.S. and Ecuadorian graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
