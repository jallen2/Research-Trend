    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to facilitate a Maker summit that will serve as a catalyst to establish networks and communication channels amongst different stakeholders in the Maker community. Makers are a quickly growing community of innovators who embody characteristics such as ingenuity, creativity, and propensity toward lifelong learning; all of which are important for the Engineer of 2020. During the first-ever White House Maker Faire in June 2014, President Barack Obama petitioned mayors, federal agencies, educational institutions, companies, foundations, libraries and museums to support Makers. Encouraged by the potential impact Makers can have on innovation in the United States, many of those who were petitioned responded with tangible commitments to assist in the advancement of the Maker Movement. This proposed Maker summit will bring stakeholders together for the purpose of generating knowledge that all participants can utilize to strengthen the role of Makers in advancing the creation of innovative products. The proposed one-and-a-half day summit will take place in the Washington, DC metro area in Fall 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maker Summit provides leaders of the Maker Movement a unique opportunity to convene and share ideas and best practices. The summit will draw approximately thirty participants from five different sectors: informal learning in museum/library settings; making/hacking in community spaces; university maker spaces; engineering and science researchers who engage making; and education researchers who engage in making. Attendees from these communities will be afforded opportunities to forge connections with each other across different segments of the Maker Movement; envision the future of Making for the engineering and education communities; and identify how Maker spaces can be designed to foster inclusiveness and broaden participation. The summit will include Makers from communities as diverse as major museums and educational institutions to small nonprofit organizations and local libraries. These various groups will connect and learn from each other, generating the potential to enhance the STEM knowledge and of the U.S. citizenry. Opportunities to join forces and collaborate will be afforded to all attendees, who will both share and discover how to maximize the potential of the Maker movement in their sectors and local areas. Furthermore, the best practices that will be disseminated at the Summit (and beyond) - will benefit Makers on a global scale.</AbstractNarration>
