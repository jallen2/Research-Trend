    <AbstractNarration>1511646 &lt;br/&gt;Jarboe, Laura &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Naturally-occurring microbial consortia are communities of microorganisms that work together to perform complex tasks. This project aims to use a well-characterized series of genetic interactions to generate stable, tunable microbial consortia. &lt;br/&gt;The application of this idea will be demonstrated in two aspects of the production of biorenewables. In the first demonstration, the problem of simultaneous utilization of mixed sugars will be developed. Lignocellulosic biomass contains a variety of sugar types and conversion of these sugars to biorenewable fuels and chemicals would optimally utilize all of these sugars. A microbial consortium capable of utilizing the three most common biomass-derived sugars will be established. The second demonstration involves a consortium in which all members consume the same sugar (glucose), but produce two distinct products. This work will develop new technology that will enable improved production of biorenewable fuels and chemicals. This project will provide training for undergraduate and graduate researchers and provide a basis for K12 outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to redesign an existing consortium-generating Escherichia coli genetic circuit to form microbial consortia for utilization of mixed substrates and production of mixed products. This consortium will be distinct from existing consortia in that it will be (i) isogenic and (ii) self-tuning. While the consortium exists in discrete expression states, the members are all genetically identical and will not require the engineering of auxotrophic features in order to maintain a stable population. The self-tuning behavior will ensure that the population distribution will shift in response to external or metabolic signals. The ability of this isogenic population to attain such discrete and self-tuning behavior is based on a complex set of interactions that occur shortly after DNA replication in the pap and fim operons in the context of pathogenesis. This work involves fundamental engineering research of biomolecular processes that could lead to the development of enabling technology for biotechnology and bioenergy industries. Specifically, the utilization of biomass-derived sugars and the production of biorenewable chemicals will be demonstrated. The specific aims of this work include (i) the construction of reporter systems and characterization of the isogenic, self-tuning consortium in a variety of growth conditions; (ii) the engineering of the system for simultaneous, self-tuning consumption of glucose, xylose and arabinose; (iii) the engineering of the system for co-production of methylsuccinate and 1,4-butanediol (BDO).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.</AbstractNarration>
