    <AbstractNarration>Calls for improvement of undergraduate mathematics and science education have resulted in numerous initiatives that seek to improve student learning outcomes by promoting changes in teaching practices at the undergraduate level. Although many of these initiatives focus on individual instructors, contemporary theoretical approaches consider the academic department to be a highly productive unit for creating change because of the social nature of knowledge construction. The tools of social network analysis (SNA) can be productively used to determine the current state of academic departments, target participants for involvement in change initiatives, and inform higher education reform efforts to support quality teaching. The goal of this proposed two-workshop series is to accelerate knowledge development about the use of SNA in studying department-level change by bringing STEM education researchers who have been early users of these methods together with established SNA experts. Project aims are to: 1) develop a theoretical and practical foundation for SNA research related to department-level instructional change, 2) identify key metrics and measurement techniques, 3) develop a coherent research program among early users of SNA methods in undergraduate STEM education research and 4) pool several data sets to begin articulation of normal values for key metrics. The work will contribute to the intent of the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (IUSE-EHR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-workshops, punctuated by virtual meetings in between, will bring together STEM education researchers, who have been early adopters of these methods, as well as novices in SNA use, with recognized SNA experts. Four institutional teams (Oregon State University, San Diego State University, University of California-San Diego, and Western Michigan University) will comprise the core teams with a total of eight researchers. An additional eight participants from other institutions, who are less active in regard to SNA, will be invited to participate in order to provide for more diverse perspectives, as well as to expand their capacity and provide momentum for additional research in this area. These interactions will result in consensus on a theoretical framing for SNA related to departmental change, metrics for measurement in this regard, a research focus, and sharing of data sets. Ultimately, it is expected that a more robust research agenda in regard to the use of social network analysis (SNA) in studying departmental change will occur.</AbstractNarration>
