    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Workshop in Analysis and Probability held at Texas A&amp;M University during the period from July 1 to August 2, 2015, and during similar periods in the summers of 2016 and 2017. The Workshop brings together senior and junior researchers and advanced graduate students in analysis and probability and related fields of mathematics in order to broaden the education of the younger participants and to promote interaction among researchers working in different areas. It sponsors a yearly three-day conference (SUMIRFAS - Informal Regional Functional Analysis Seminar), Concentration Weeks, and mini-conferences. In 2015 SUMIRFAS will be held from July 31 to August 2, and the Concentration Week "From Commutators to BCP Operators" will take place July 27 to 31. In addition to advanced lectures for experts, Concentration Weeks include introductory lectures designed to acquaint junior researchers and non-experts with the basics of a topical area of current interest. All Workshop participants will be invited to disseminate their work through seminars, and past experience suggests that most will take advantage of this opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop activities have a wide impact by providing intellectual stimulation for all participants as well as giving an opportunity to a diverse group of junior participants to increase the breadth and depth of knowledge and to interact with senior researchers in several areas of mathematics. There is also significant outreach to applied mathematics and computer science. Indeed, an important goal of the Workshop is to promote cooperation among researchers in different fields, and every Concentration Week involves participants from two or more research areas. The website of the Workshop is located at &lt;http://www.math.tamu.edu/~kerr/workshop&gt;.</AbstractNarration>
