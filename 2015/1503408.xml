    <AbstractNarration>The Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology (CSN) enables fundamental studies of the specific molecular interactions expected to occur when the surfaces of engineered nanoparticles come into contact with biological interfaces and components. The chemical insight gained from molecular and mechanistic studies of nano-bio interactions is used to intentionally design nanomaterials that provide the desired technical functions while also minimizing potentially adverse consequences with the environment. CSN research leads to introduction of a new generation of safer nanomaterials that may impact multiple sectors of the economy including energy, transportation, electronics, food, and agriculture. The CSN prepares a new generation of scientific innovators by providing education and professional development opportunities focused on innovation, communication, leadership, and interdisciplinary scientific skills. CSN researchers actively encourage diversity within chemistry through CSN-run workshops on overcoming implicit bias, recruitment of graduate students and postdocs, and Center-sponsored research experiences for students and faculty from underrepresented groups as well as veteran undergraduates. CSN researchers encourage diversity in public engagement, develops and practices informal communication skills, and expands the highly successful sustainable-nano.com blog to include Spanish language content, K-12 activity materials, podcasts, and videos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSN integrates experiments with computation in three integrated research focus areas (RFAs). RFA1 develops new materials with precisely controlled structure and properties, molecular-level characterization tools such as advanced non-linear optical methods and sub-diffraction imaging, and novel computational methods spanning length scales from nanometers to millimeters. RFA2 uses the RFA1 tool kit to understand, control, and predict how nanomaterials attach to, penetrate, and alter cell surfaces using lipid bilayers as model systems for cell membranes. RFA3 determines the molecular processes by which pristine and environmentally transformed nanomaterials interact with living systems with diverse cellular chemistries, ranging from single cell to multi-cellular organisms. The integration of these three RFAs enables the Center to establish how nanomaterial properties and behavior impact biological outcomes. This knowledge leads to reliable predictions of biological responses to existing and future nanomaterials and guides the design and synthesis of safe, sustainable nanomaterials. In pursuing the project goals, the CSN puts particular emphasis on the synthesis, characterization, and molecular-level interactions initiated by complex, composite nanomaterials that are being used in emerging and future nano-enabled commercial technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology is funded as part of the Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) program.</AbstractNarration>
