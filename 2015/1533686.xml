    <AbstractNarration>Implementation Projects in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate program provide support to design, implement, study and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This implementation project at Bowie State University (BSU) seeks to transform the first two years of STEM teaching and learning. The project is grounded in theories of science identity and constructivism and will provide a student-centered learning environment that is integrated into the STEM curriculum at the institution. The evidence-based strategies for student success will serve as a reference and provide a framework for other institutions with whom BSU shares similar characteristics. The project is guided by an on-going evaluation, as well as an internal steering committee and an external advisory committee. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is implementing three goals and related interventions to support mainly first and second year STEM students and faculty as follows: to develop students' identity by building student learning communities, providing career-related mentoring and providing undergraduate research learning opportunities; to integrate problem-solving and entrepreneurship in the STEM curriculum by adapting technology commercialization into STEM courses, and expanding access to a maker space to support students' multidisciplinary learning; and to provide professional development to faculty on experiential learning and evidence-based instructional practices.</AbstractNarration>
