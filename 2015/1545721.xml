    <AbstractNarration>This proposal provides international and domestic travel support for U.S. based student participants to attend the 23rd International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR 2015), which will take place from the 28th to 30th of September 2015 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. ICCBR is the premier, annual meeting of the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) community and the primary international conference on this topic, bringing together researchers across artificial intelligence, machine learning, cognitive science, and domain application areas. The CBR community welcomes interdisciplinary participation and experts from industry and other related academic areas. ICCBR has a rich history of encouraging strong student participation in the conference program. Today's students are tomorrow's international leaders in the research community. As part of this, the ICCBR organizers aim to facilitate and encourage student participation by providing support for students to attend the conference. In addition to the main technical program, the conference features opportunities for student participation and mentoring, including themed workshops, an application domain challenge competition, and the 7th in a successful doctoral consortium series. A strong representation of U.S. based researchers, and students in particular, is useful in maintaining U.S. scientific and technical competitiveness in the field and also contributes to the career development of the students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICCBR is the premier conference in the field of Case-Based Reasoning and has contributed significantly to scientific and industry advances across the broader areas of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and cognate disciplines since 1993. ICCBR provides a dynamic and comprehensive program for research, education, publication, and interaction; it is a leading international forum for CBR researchers, students, and practitioners to exchange and discover leading-edge ideas, results, tools, techniques, and experiences. The intellectual merit of the proposal is to (1) expand the technical content, scope and depth of this forum by supporting and encouraging greater student attendance and participation; (2) foster technical advances in the field through the greater training and collaboration opportunities afforded by direct student participation in the conference. This project will provide partial support for students from U.S. institutions to attend and present research work at ICCBR 2015. ICCBR student travel support will encourage the research interests and involvement of students in the field, particularly those who are at early stages of their research or without current funding sources that might otherwise limit their participation. ICCBR 2015 students will have the opportunity to participate in the following interactive activities as partially supported by this project: main technical program, focus-area workshops, the computer cooking contest, face-to-face meetings with both peers and leading researchers, as well as a doctoral consortium. These opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the participants. The primary broader impact is to help train the future generation of leaders and workforce in the field; in turn, this will plant the seeds for future innovation and help to shape the field itself.</AbstractNarration>
