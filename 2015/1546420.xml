    <AbstractNarration>1546420&lt;br/&gt;Reible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the project is to organize, conduct and document a workshop focused on research needs for the safe and environmentally appropriate implementation of hydraulic fracturing and to help translate the lessons learned in the US to the UK. Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized oil and gas production in the United States but with some negative environmental consequences. Contributing to the environmental footprint of hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production are the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on water availability, concerns for potential impacts on surface and ground water quality, increased greenhouse gas emissions during production and use of the produced fuels, seismic activity as a result of produced water disposal and community impacts due to rapid growth in oil and gas activity in some areas. The workshop will explore the current state of understanding of these challenges, and research needs and opportunities to better understand these impacts and how to manage them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to develop a coherent research framework to overcome infrastructure, technical, and societal challenges posed by hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas and particularly to help manage the potential consequences of expanded use of hydraulic fracturing and increased oil and gas activity in the UK. The workshop will draw attendees from the US and the UK to understand both current activities and their relevance to the UK. The conflicts, opportunities and trade-offs being experienced in the US are likely to foretell what the UK is likely to face but critical differences are also likely and the workshop will explore both the similarities and the differences. The workshop is expected to lead to a clear definition of system research challenges that are critical to the economic and social vitality of hydraulic fracturing in the US and the UK. A particular advantage of the timing of this workshop is the ability to build upon almost a decade of experiences in the US and identify the remaining scientific and technological challenges to minimizing the environmental footprint of hydraulic fracturing. A goal of the workshop is to catalyze the formation of academic-government partnerships that are able to address these research challenges. The workshop will culminate in white papers that define and analyze scientific, technical and socio-economic research gaps needed for innovating the environmentally sustainable application of hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas development both in the US and the UK. Particular attention is directed to understanding the potential impacts on urban and high density rural areas that have previously faced little oil and gas development and the unique environmental consequences that might be posed by such development. Also of particular interest is under-represented groups that may perceive little direct benefit of hydraulic fracturing and a disproportionate cost and environmental impact.</AbstractNarration>
