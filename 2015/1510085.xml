    <AbstractNarration>PI: Jonghyun Park &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1510085&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lithium ion batteries support the development of sustainable energy systems by storing electricity generated by renewable resources such as wind and solar energy, or by powering zero-emission electric vehicles charged by electricity from renewable resources. However, current rechargeable lithium ion batteries can hold only about 10% of their theoretical energy content, and new concepts are needed to improve energy storage capacity and power discharge rate. The addition of the metal germanium to lithium ion battery electrodes offers the potential to improve both storage capacity and power. However, the germanium swells significantly upon charging and discharging, which cracks the battery and renders it useless. The goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms of the failure process, and then to use this fundamental understanding to develop coating materials and processes for the germanium particles that will control the swelling behavior. The educational activities associated with this project include efforts to broaden participation by involving undergraduates from nearly Lincoln University of Missouri in the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of geranium (Ge) metal in the solid interface layer of the anode of lithium ion batteries offers the potential for high theoretical electrochemical energy storage capacity and power discharge rate. However, upon repeated charge/discharge cycles, the solid electrolyte interface layer of the anode breaks down. The damage to the solid electrolyte layer is due to the mechanical volume change in Ge metal during lithium-ion insertion (charging) and extraction (discharge), which causes cracks and pulverization of this layer that lead to loss of electrode contact and dissolution of the solid electrolyte layer into the electrolyte. The goals of the research are to characterize the mechanisms of failure in the Ge anode, and then use this fundamental understanding to develop fabrication strategies for suppressing these damage processes by controlling internal structure of the solid electrolyte layer containing Ge nanoparticles, as well as its interface with active materials. The mechanisms of failure will be elucidated by characterizing mechanical strength and chemical dissolution rate of the solid interface layer components. The internal structure of the solid interface layer will be controlled by using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to coat additive materials, for example metal oxides, onto Ge nanoparticles in the attempt to reduce stress upon lithium ion insertion and extraction. A multiscale model will be developed that couples the nanoparticle level behavior in the solid interface layer to electrochemical cell operation to predict the conditions that trigger solid interface layer failure and its subsequent effect on battery performance. This model will then be used to identify strategies to optimize the ALD materials and process for improved mechanical stability and battery performance. To connect the research to education, the PI will introduce energy materials and battery design concepts in a capstone mechanical engineering capstone design course, and will give demonstrations on lithium-ion battery coin cell assembly for undergraduate and K-12 students at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
