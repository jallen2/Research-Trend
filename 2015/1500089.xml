    <AbstractNarration>The project will develop a variety of video and text-based cybersecurity educational materials for anyone who is interested or involved in public policy, and who would benefit from a greater familiarity with the constraints under which cybersecurity policy making occurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cybersecurity education has usually focused on individuals who must take action to improve their own capabilities to resist cybersecurity threats. But cybersecurity is also a major public policy issue today - and policy makers need to know about cybersecurity to make informed decisions. However, policy makers who need to learn about cybersecurity generally lack the time to learn it deeply - "just-in-time" learning is a much better way to characterize their approach. Under these circumstances, their learning framework deviates from that of traditional students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops cybersecurity education materials specifically targeted toward individuals who may not have subject matter expertise about cybersecurity, nor the time to be able to undertake in-depth, semester(s)-long coursework.</AbstractNarration>
