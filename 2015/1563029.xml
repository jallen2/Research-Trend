    <AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to enable the realization of reliable and ultra-high energy density batteries by low cost manufacturing methods. Research results can help in making electric vehicles cost-competitive with gasoline powered vehicles, thereby reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. This will have a broad and lasting impact on the environment. The research will also benefit the Internet of Things, the healthcare, and the consumer electronics industry, because many applications need robust and high capacity batteries. In addition, this project will help train US workforce in the interdisciplinary areas of energy, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing through the development of interdisciplinary curricula and various science activities for diverse youth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on making 3D electrodes using an aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing method along with nanoparticle sintering. The first research objective is to establish relationships between process parameters and the quality of 3D electrode architecture produced by the processes. Process parameters of aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing include carrier gas pressure, and nanoparticle size and dispersion; and sintering process parameters include sintering energy and time. The quality of 3D electrode architecture will be measured in terms of porosity level, pore geometry, specific capacity, and resistance to capacity fade. This objective will be achieved by carrying out experimental research guided by theoretical models. The solidification of nanoparticle solutions upon dispense and the consecutive sintering process will be modelled by using a discretized particle model and a diffusive model. Further, a model that solves the Li diffusion equation coupled with stress evolution and the cracking in the porous electrode will be developed using a multi-scale modeling approach. These models will guide the additive fabrication experiments using high specific capacity materials such as silicon and silicon dioxide. The second objective is to identify relationships between the characteristics of an artificial coating on the electrode and the resistance to electrode capacity fade. The characteristics of the coating include the thickness and uniformity of the coated layer. To achieve this objective, atomic layer deposition will be used to create an electrode-electrolyte interface layer over the 3D porous electrodes. Several microscopic analyses such as atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy will be used to measure the coating thickness and uniformity. Battery electrochemical experiments will then be carried out and the resistance to capacity fade will be measured using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>
