    <AbstractNarration>Adhesion characteristics of surfaces allow one to know the stability of bonded and coated surfaces, and to understand the wettability of various different surfaces. For example, adhesion characteristics of toner particles are a critical parameter for printing and copying industry. End-products based on stickiness of particles and surfaces (i. e. adhesion properties of single micro-particles) can be equipment and/or analytical services for key industries. Other potential industries are food processing, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, paints and dyes, and air-conditioning systems. Currently, there are only a few measurement options available for single micro-particle adhesion characterization, none of which is non-contact. Over the years, several statistical adhesion measurements techniques based on centrifuge, aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces, impact-spectrum, and ultrasonic vibration have been introduced for multi-particle systems. At present, no known adhesion characterization technique exists for single micro-particles. Accurate adhesion characterization of micro-particles at the micro/nano scales is a key technical challenge due to the small length-scale of associated objects and low force levels involved. The proposed technology has an edge over the contact techniques, as contact at micro-scale changes the properties of the bonds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the program is to explore and assess the commercial potential of a critical adhesion measurement and characterization technology based on NSF-supported research projects. The proposed technology is for making non-contact adhesion characterization of single micro-particles under various conditions, such as electric field, temperature, and humidity. This method is based on ultrasonic excitation of the motion of single particles and detecting its response using a laser vibrometer. The equipment eliminates various complications of the current equipment by making non-contact, non-invasive measurements in native environments. This method/technique will be unique and repeatable.</AbstractNarration>
