    <AbstractNarration>Multibeam sonars have become fundamental mapping tools for a wide range of oceanographic studies,&lt;br/&gt;and significant investments have been made in installing these systems on several ships in&lt;br/&gt;the U.S. Academic Research Fleet. The Multibeam Advisory Committee (MAC) was developed in 2011 to coordinate fleet-wide sonar calibration efforts, to perform consistent and routine assessment of system performance, and to provide tools and protocols for consistent data acquisition practices. The MAC has achieved its primary goals and seeks funding for continued support to maintain its support role for sonars across the fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNH and LDEO propose to continue the activities of the MAC, specifically to develop technical resources, tools, guidelines and expertise to optimize the operation and monitoring of multibeam sonars&lt;br/&gt;across the U.S. Academic Fleet. They will continue to facilitate communication among the community&lt;br/&gt;of stakeholders including representatives from operating institutions, complemented by key&lt;br/&gt;outside experts from the user and technical/engineering communities, and sonar manufacturers&lt;br/&gt;that can assist in providing guidance on the broad array of issues faced by the operators&lt;br/&gt;of the fleet's multibeam systems. They propose to maintain the activities of the MAC's technical&lt;br/&gt;teams by working closely with vessel operators, visiting ships periodically to review system&lt;br/&gt;performance and installing software tools, and providing training to seagoing personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
