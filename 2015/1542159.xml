    <AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology deals with man-made objects with sizes that are much smaller than everyday objects we deal with, but much larger than atoms or molecules, They can thus manifest novel and potentially useful properties that can have applications in diverse areas such as electronics, defense, and healthcare. Nanotechnology is projected to be a significant segment of the U.S. and world economy in the 21st century. However, since these objects are so tiny, fabricating them takes a tremendous investment in equipment and infrastructure, and in personnel to maintain and train users in these tools. Often, these are beyond the resources of academic institutions and startups, and support from the federal government is critical. The Texas Nanofabrication Facility (TNF), a National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) site at the University of Texas at Austin, builds upon a proven NSF-supported model, and will help train the next generation of engineers and scientists in this nascent field, with a strong focus on recruiting minorities and women in these STEM fields. It will also engender startups in nanotechnology, and will lead to advances in areas such as faster computers that would consume less energy, lasers and photonic devices for faster communication, and a dazzling array of products for the consumer market and defense applications. This effort will also have an impact on healthcare, and other major federal initiatives such as developing nanosensors for the Brain Initiative, better DNA and protein sequencing tools for personalized medicine, and nanostructures for targeted drug delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TNF will facilitate breakthroughs in nanoscience and technology, with applications in nanoelectronics/photonics, green energy and healthcare in the Southwest and in the Nation, by providing state-of-the-art capability in nanodevice prototyping, metrology and nanomanufacturing. The efforts in prototyping of nanoelectronic devices will be underpinned not only by tool-training-based approaches, as in the past, but also new holistic solutions-based schemes. Coupled with device fabrication, TNF will provide cutting-edge tools in nanoscale imaging and metrology at the atomic scale. The application of nano-in-healthcare will be bolstered by the recently established Dell Medical School at the University of Texas, one of very few new medical schools in recent decades, and one that is committed to re-inventing medical education. The TNF will mentor and foster start-ups in nanotechnology, and provide platforms for nanomanufacturing of prototypes at the NSF Engineering Research Center in Texas. It will establish educational activities in nanotechnology especially directed at underrepresented minorities and women, while making social and ethical implications (SEI) of nanotechnology an integral component of every activity. The growing Hispanic population in the Southwest makes it crucial that this segment of the population is well represented in STEM fields. The TNF is located centrally in the so-called Texas Triangle, which encompasses most of the population and the high-technology activity in Texas. This is one of eleven mega-population centers in the Nation, and a key hub of nanotechnology in the U.S. As such, this site should have a major impact on advancing nanoscience and technology in the 21st century in the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
