    <AbstractNarration>The 2015 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and associated Seminar (GRS) on Nuclear Chemistry will take place May 30 - June 5 2015 at Colby Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire. The seminar precedes the conference (May 30 - 31) and is intended for junior researchers to present their work and be involved in discussion among their peers. These meetings bring together scientists from around the world to focus on research at the forefront of nuclear structure and reactions. The conference and seminar are organized in a way to promote significant discussion and time for collaboration throughout the week. Additionally, they play a significant role in educating young researchers which is crucial to meeting the demand of highly-trained nuclear scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support for a limited number of junior researchers to attend the 2015 GRC and GRS on nuclear chemistry. The support for the participants will be selected by the chairs based on submitted abstracts of their research. This support will allow participants to attend these meetings who may otherwise not be able to attend. Participation of young researchers in these meetings plays a large role in the development of the future leaders of nuclear science.</AbstractNarration>
