    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the introduction of high-speed&lt;br/&gt;wireless modems usable subsea and significant cost reduction of deep-water operations ?&lt;br/&gt;industry experts estimate savings of nearly 20% of deep-water operations through the&lt;br/&gt;availability of subsea WiFi. Today, there is no broadband wireless communication available&lt;br/&gt;underwater. In the deep ocean, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) require a tether for&lt;br/&gt;communication and a support ship for tether management; sensors and systems must either be&lt;br/&gt;physically connected, or retrieved from the deep sea to exchange data. An ROV support ship&lt;br/&gt;costs about $120k/day leading to over $7B spent on ROV support ships in 2013. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;megabit-per-second technology would allow ROV manufacturers and operators to cut the&lt;br/&gt;tether on many of their vehicles. Wireless ROVs can move unencumbered throughout coverage&lt;br/&gt;area, piloted from anywhere (e.g. from Houston), without expensive surface vessels. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed wireless modem technology connects ROVs and machinery to wired infrastructure,&lt;br/&gt;enabling safe operation of heavy subsea machinery without the possibility of cables or tethers&lt;br/&gt;getting tangled, causing damage or worse. This project will create 10 new jobs in the next three&lt;br/&gt;years, with many more to be added as the production scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes to develop a faster&lt;br/&gt;and more reliable wireless communication system for the sub-sea industry. Current state of the&lt;br/&gt;art communication links for the deep ocean are either tethered, requiring long, bulky, and&lt;br/&gt;expensive cables to connect machinery and systems, or have extremely low data rates, enabling only &lt;br/&gt;the most rudimentary of tasks. The proposed underwater wireless communication&lt;br/&gt;system will provide WiFi-like data rates in the Mbps (megabits/sec) range ? 100 to 1,000 times&lt;br/&gt;faster than existing underwater wireless communication technologies - and enable video&lt;br/&gt;streaming and real-time control of subsea infrastructure, machinery, and mobile underwater&lt;br/&gt;vehicles. Since radio signals do not propagate far underwater, the proposed technology uses&lt;br/&gt;sound waves, as whales and dolphins do, for communication. The speed of sound is 200,000&lt;br/&gt;times slower than the speed of radio propagation, and mobile acoustic transmitters and&lt;br/&gt;receivers hence suffer from severe Doppler distortion. The proposed technology dynamically&lt;br/&gt;measures, tracks, and compensates for this distortion, to enable wireless communication at&lt;br/&gt;data rates never before possible underwater.</AbstractNarration>
