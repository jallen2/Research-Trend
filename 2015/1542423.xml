    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding in the amount of $ 5,000 in support of the attendance and participation of young US-based scientists in the "Symposium: NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy of Polymers and Biobased Materials Pacific Conference" to be held in Honolulu HI, December 15-20, 2015. The funds will cover approximately three full, and four student registration fees, as well as five housing grants. NMR spectroscopy is a premier technique for the study of polymers as well as biobased polymeric materials, i.e. polymers designed based on naturally occurring materials. The main purpose of this international conference is to report on the latest developments in NMR spectroscopy and their impact on the determination of the fundamental molecular and structural characteristics of polymers and their properties as well as in their specialized functions in a multitude of technological applications. Both fundamental and applied aspects will be covered is a planned set of eight session topics: (1) Polymer dynamics, interphases and crystallinity. (2) Diffusion and flow in polymers. (3) Blends, surfaces, and confined environments. (4) Polymer-focused advances in NMR instrumentation and methodology. (5) Solid state polymer structure. (6) Polymers in energy fields-batteries, fuel cells, biomass. (7) Polymers in solution phase. (8) Integration of NMR w/other techniques). The talks will be geared so that general polymer scientists can comprehend and exploit the studies presented.</AbstractNarration>
