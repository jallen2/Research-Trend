    <AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program, (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of a professional development program that helps teachers to improve the mathematics skills of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Children from certain economic backgrounds face greater challenges in graduating from school than just passing classes and earning good grades. To address this problem, the Designing for Equity by Thinking in and about Mathematics or "DEbT-M" program provides a meaningful solution to helping teachers and schools connect with marginalized student populations. DEbT-M helps teachers build the unique understandings and skills to support disadvantaged students in their classrooms. Students from urban settings in particular face challenges navigating educational systems that typically disadvantage and inhibit them from coming to see themselves as capable and successful students of mathematics. DEbT-M focuses on creating successful professional communities around mathematics teachers so they can reach and assist their struggling student to succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional development programs can improve the skills of individual educators. However professional development alone has been insufficient in helping K-12 districts solve systemic problems. Systemic and organizational issues such as racial equity, meeting needs of special populations, and overcoming educational obstacles associated with poverty require more complex levels of change. The DEbT-M innovation provides a systematic approach to identifying, creating awareness of, and progressively impacting these organizational and teaching challenges in collaboration with target urban districts. The DEbT-M project, has built a foundational experience for district teams that supports districts in uncovering systemic inequity and identifying key leverage areas within their systems. With this knowledge, districts have been shown to be able to act in conjunction with follow-up that emphasizes collaboration to tackle identified issues. Joint definition of measures of success and assessment of impact and change are also essential to the DEbT-M process. Through I-Corps L, the Educational Development Center (EDC) will work to expand the benefits of DebT-M to a greater number of K-12 teachers and develop methods to sustain the program in a self-supporting manner.</AbstractNarration>
