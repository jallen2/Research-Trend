    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating innovative single-view motion capture technology to fill the need of medical professionals to quantify a patient?s body movement. This single-view motion capture system is important because it will be a transformational technological improvement that is available to physicians and physical therapists to diagnosis, treat, and monitor patients with a movement disorder. The project will result in a prototype system that will provide a live demonstration to potential customers and investors. This prototype system will consist of a single Kinect camera and a laptop. It will acquire motion data, process the data close to real-time, and provide visual feedback to the patients as well as the clinicians. In particular the performance measures for the clinicians will be anatomically correct and accurate so progress in treating movement dysfunction can be quantified. Compared to the leading motion capture system in the market place today, this project will lead to a portable, low-cost single-camera system that will give medical professionals accurate and precise 3D measurements of movement dysfunction in any environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The first and foremost is the need to automatically identify anthropometric landmarks in the input data to define an anatomically correct coordinate system. A novel data-driven method is to going to be investigated. The second is the need to achieve faster processing speed and consolidate the processing pipeline. Simplified tracking algorithm and code optimization will be implemented to achieve the required real-time performance. In addition, personnel involved in this project, in particular both graduate and undergraduate students, will not only receive innovation experiences throughout the research and development cycles, but also cultivate their entrepreneurship through the business development activities.</AbstractNarration>
