    <AbstractNarration>This grant partially supports the participation of about 20 students from US institutions in the Doctoral Consortium at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2015. ICCV is the premier biennial conference in computer vision with about 2000 senior, junior and student participants. It is attended by members of the international research community. The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to highlight the work of senior PhD students who are who are close to finishing their degrees, or recent graduates, and to give these students an opportunity to discuss their research and career options with faculty and researchers who have relevant expertise. NSF support covers some of the costs for selected US graduate students to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project rests in the selection of top-quality PhD students whose research is showcased and to whom feedback is provided by senior researchers. The opportunity to receive advice on their research work and career plans from experts from different institutions, and with potentially different perspectives, is often not available internally at one's own institution. The broader impacts of this project include supporting the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computer vision, contributing to the research community in general by drawing attention to an important aspect of graduate student development, potentially increasing the number of active researchers and educators in STEM, and ensuring that the computer vision community, through its recent graduates, makes fast advances in solving problems that will benefit society as a whole. The Doctoral Consortium aims to have representation from a diverse group of participants in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location.</AbstractNarration>
