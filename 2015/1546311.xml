    <AbstractNarration>The "Workshop on Springer Theory and Related Topics" will be held on October 9-11, 2015, at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The webpage for the workshop is http://www.math.lsu.edu/~pramod/UMass2015/. The workshop will expose a large audience to the most important themes related to Springer theory and provide updates on its applications in representation theory and other domains. The goals of the workshop are: (1) to allow for cross-pollination of ideas among researchers working in Springer theory and related topics; (2) to facilitate exposure of the subject to young researchers in representation theory; and (3) to build up a regional network in representation theory in the Northeast. This award provides support for the travel and lodging of conference speakers, as well as US-based participants who are graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, scholars from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences, and researchers who do not have federal support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Springer theory was developed by T.A. Springer in the late 1970's and it helps explain the central role of a finite symmetry group (the Weyl group) in controlling the symmetries of more complicated related groups (finite groups of Lie type, real Lie groups, and others). Springer theory and its generalizations remain central to many modern developments in representation theory, as well as the application of representation theory in neighboring domains. Topics to be addressed at this workshop include Lusztig's theory of character sheaves, links between Springer theory and the representation theory of p-adic groups, affine Springer fibers and applications, the geometric Langlands program, global and elliptic Springer theory, modular Springer theory and connections to modular representation theory, and connections between Springer theory and knot theory.</AbstractNarration>
