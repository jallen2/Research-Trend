    <AbstractNarration>Quantum mechanics underlies much of our present technology, including computing. However, many questions about quantum mechanics remain unsolved or open, especially in the areas of dynamics and open systems. Exploring new regimes of quantum mechanics allows us to push towards next generation computing and other future technologies. A key experimental context to gain this insight is ultracold molecules, where we have an extraordinary degree of precise control over many aspects of the quantum problem. In this context, this project supports the development of a large scale open source code to push such experiments forward. The code is run on high performance computers. The training of students in rigorous numerical techniques and high-performance parallel computing is key to success in a number of arenas in society, from the materials genome initiative to the space program. This project will train students in a diverse research environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As more complex molecules approach quantum degeneracy, the number and complexity of many-body models to describe them will also increase substantially. Additionally, searching for emergent phenomena such as quantum phases and robust dynamical phenomena requires exploration of vast parameter spaces and extrapolation using many different system sizes. In order to meet these challenges, researchers seek new ways to design and dispatch simulations and collect and interpret data. Open source tools which are to have long-term impact must be flexible to adapt to different physical degrees of freedom, different Hamiltonians, and different dynamical processes; they must be efficient to manage large parameter exploration; and they must contain powerful tools for extracting data from large simulations. The matrix product density operator approach to be developed here will support innovative research in ultracold molecular physics.</AbstractNarration>
