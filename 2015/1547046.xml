    <AbstractNarration>Clumped isotopes are the combination of any two or more of the rare isotopes in a molecule. In the case of carbonate rocks, the combination of 13C and 18O in the CO2 released from carbonate during the dissolution by phosphoric acid has been the most extensively investigated. This has revolutionized the study of the stable isotope systematics of carbonate materials. The clumped isotope method allows scientists, with one measurement, to obtain information about the temperature of formation and the oxygen isotopic composition of the formation fluid at the same time. In addition to the clumped isotopes in carbonates, there is increasing interest in other clumped isotope systems (CH4 and O2 for example). This interest has spurred a revolution in mass spectrometric techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant progress has been made at the past four International Workshops on this topic, held in Seattle, London, Boston, and Zurich over the past six years. These meetings allow those interested in the analyses and applications of clumped isotopes to interact over a three to four day period, share methods and applications, and discuss the recent innovations in the science. The workshops have been a productive intermingling of early career and established scientists, and have resulted in significant papers and establishment of analytical best practices. Overall they have had significant positive impact upon the future of the field. Despite growing interest in and use of clumped isotopes, several problems remain to be solved. The 5th International Clumped Isotope Workshop, to be held in January, 2016, in St. Petersburg, Florida, will focus on coordinating inter-laboratory cross-calibration efforts, new clumped isotope systems, recognition of non-equilibrium clumped isotope systems, and progress in understanding clumped isotope systems in equilibrium. Exploring these topics is essential for the further development of clumped isotope techniques. NSF funding supports participants of ten or more early career scientists in this workshop.</AbstractNarration>
