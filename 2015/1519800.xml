    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a portable, low-cost plug and play mobile internet integrated sensor product catering to the needs of water quality monitoring market, a global market with a compounded annual growth rate of 4-6%. The water testing equipment market is divided into low-end, low-cost on-field test equipment (such as nitrate strip) that gives qualitative information about the analytes, and high-end testing devices used in labs (such as mass spectrometer) providing accurate quantitative information. If successful, this sensor technology will bridge the gap by providing low-cost, sensitive, accurate tools for quantitative measurement of analytes such as toxic ions. Consequently, successful demonstrations of the proposed sensor technology will facilitate wider market acceptance and penetration of personalized mobile-enabled water quality monitoring devices. Another aspect of the project is to enable ?citizen scientist? to partake in environmental data collection and spread sustainability education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a smartphone-based electrical sensor technology for real-time water quality monitoring. Currently, spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, chemical reduction methods, and gas chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy are some of the most widely used techniques for water quality analysis; however, these instruments are bulky and costly; the methods are time consuming, and involve laborious sample processing steps requiring well-trained personnel in a laboratory setting; In order to meet the market need for a portable, low-cost, and easy-to-use water analysis technology, the project will investigate a smartphone integrated electrical readout sensor platform which will be able to address all of the above issues by: 1) the development of a low-cost, portable sensor package consisting of an electrochemical sensor chip, a driver circuit, and rechargeable battery power for standalone operation; 2) the application of polymer immobilized ion sensing coatings to increase the selectivity during ion detection in a non-laboratory setting; 3) the use of algorithm against calibration curve to automatically detect and quantify toxic ion, and 4) the use of smartphone in-built GPS and mobile broadband function to combine the sensing results with geospatial information and uploaded to the Cloud for further analysis.</AbstractNarration>
