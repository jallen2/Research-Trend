    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Yolanda Vasquez at Oklahoma State University to generate fundamental knowledge on the synthesis of particles at the size of a billionth of a meter that contain the elements sulfur, selenium, and tellurium - collectively known as the chalcogens. These nanostructures have many uses including in television and cell phone displays and for sensitive biomedical imaging. Strategies to improve control of the newly developed structures and chemical compositions are sought. The new chemical combinations and structures are critical to achieving optimal performance in existing and new technological applications. The educational program prepares both graduate and undergraduate students for interdisciplinary research careers in nanoscience. Graduate and undergraduate students at the nanotechnology summer camp held on the OSU campus serve as student mentors to middle schoolers. Hands-on activities are geared towards children ages 10-12 with the goal of promoting early awareness and interest in science fields. A special topics undergraduate course supports the growing student interest in interdisciplinary research at OSU. Through research and outreach activities, Dr. Vasquez aims to broaden the participation of a diverse student population from K-12 through graduate school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binary chalcogenides are some of the most well-studied nanomaterials due to their applications in light emitting diodes, bio-labels, and catalysts, as well as in materials used in electro-optical and medical devices. Synthetic strategies with control over the composition, size, and morphology have been achieved thus, control over the resulting properties has been exploited. The composition, size, shape, and the crystalline phase of the nanoparticles are interdependent and the underlying synthetic mechanisms derived from these parameters are not always clear. Control over these variables at the molecular level continues to be one of the main challenges in the field. In this NSF CAREER award, Dr. Vasquez seeks to generate fundamental knowledge on the role of intermediates, such as chalcogen ionic clusters, and their effect on the composition, size, shape, and structure of the resulting nanoparticles in solution. Additionally, the robustness of the chalcogen lattice makes post-synthetic modification of the composition of the nanomaterials possible through anion and cation exchange reactions. The research group aims to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science through the implementation of a nanotechnology summer camp for children ages 10-12. A special topics undergraduate course supports the growing student interest in interdisciplinary research at OSU.</AbstractNarration>
