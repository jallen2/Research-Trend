    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $4,000 were requested and have been recommended to provide for travel support of ten teachers, graduate student and junior faculty presenters at a symposium entitled 'Integrating Polymer Science and Chemistry Research in the Classroom' to be held at the 249th ACS National meeting on March 22-26, 2015 in Denver CO. A similar symposium was last held at the ACS spring meeting in 2013.The Symposium is designed to bring together high school teachers, university faculty, and graduate students involved in creating research-based class-room activities, laboratory experiments, and lectures based on current polymer research for implementation in the classroom. The symposium will serve as a venue for educators to share best practices, exchange classroom activities, and build a network for continuing exchange and collaborative development of research based curricula. Special consideration for the awards will be given for institutions submitting for the first time, and those serving underrepresented populations.</AbstractNarration>
