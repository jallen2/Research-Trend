    <AbstractNarration>Utah Valley University (UVU) is implementing a high speed network connection in conjunction with the Utah Educational Network (UEN) that connects the university to other state and national research networks using dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) across existing fiber optic cable. Additionally, an on-campus research and science network is being created, separate from the regular campus network, to facilitate current and future research. The project is headed by UVU's CIO and implemented by UVU/UEN engineers; a Research Advisory Committee will help maximize the benefits of the new technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network upgrades provide the UVU community with cyberinfrastructure for scientific and education projects requiring high bandwidth capabilities. The project increases capacity for undergraduate research and experiential learning. As UVU is a major hub on the UEN network (one of the nation's premier education networks), the enhanced connectivity will improve STEM education in all Utah schools and many public education services; access to STEM education will be strengthened for rural, remote, and underserved populations in this vast state. Additionally, high bandwidth, high speed capabilities facilitate UVU's partnership in the US Ignite community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, UVU is installing networking hardware that will connect to the 4x10GE equipment previously installed by UEN. The networking equipment consists of switches capable of supporting 10, 40, and 100 Gigabit Ethernet ports with more than 83 terabits per second of overall switching capability. The switches support layer-2 routing, and IPv4 and IPv6 routing. A perfSONAR host is being deployed for network performance monitoring.</AbstractNarration>
