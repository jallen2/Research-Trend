    <AbstractNarration>This award provided support for the DIS2015 XXIII International Workshop on Deep-Inelastic Scattering and Related Subjects (DIS2015) to be held on the Southern Methodist Universiy campus, Dallas, TX during the period April 27-May 1, 2015. The conference covers a large spectrum of topics in high energy physics. A significant part of the program is devoted to the most recent results from large experiments at major research laboratories in the United States and abroad. Theoretical advances are included as well. The program is organized around seven working groups: Structure Functions and Parton Densities; Small-x, Diffraction and Vector Mesons; Electroweak Physics and Beyond the Standard Model; Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and Hadronic Final States; Heavy Flavors; Spin Physics; Future Experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has emerged as the premier venue for comprehensive discussions and debate between experimentalists and theorists. While the original DIS workshops had a strong emphasis on the Hadron Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) based physics, the topics of the workshop have now branched out to include the recent Large Hadron Collier (LHC) physics as well as the US-based measurements at Fermilab in Illinois, JLab in Virginia and RHIC in New York. This meeting draws approximately 300+ scientists from across the globe to discuss the latest results. Recent meetings were held in Poland, France, Germany, Japan and Russia. The 2014 meeting hosted 265 talks with participants from 32 countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has generally been based in Europe and visits the US every few years. Therefore, hosting this meeting in the US represents a special opportunity for US-based students to be exposed to this breadth of topics and also the leaders in their field. The group is making arrangements to allow students to participate in a cost-effective manner so as to expand the scope of participation.</AbstractNarration>
