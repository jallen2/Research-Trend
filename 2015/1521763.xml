    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of this proposal is to request travel support for graduate students from&lt;br/&gt;US institutions, who are co-authors of one or more accepted papers, to participate and present&lt;br/&gt;their work at the 3rd International Workshop on Compressed Sensing Theory and its Applications&lt;br/&gt;to Radar, Sonar and Remote Sensing (CoSeRa). This is the third edition of the CoSeRa workshop &lt;br/&gt;series, which will be held in Pisa, Italy, from June 16-19, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The 2015 CoSeRa Workshop will have a highly international profile, with participation from &lt;br/&gt;eminent scientists in the Compressing Sensing, Radar Signal Processing and Remote&lt;br/&gt;Sensing fields from all over the world. Every day, the conference will offer one plenary session,&lt;br/&gt;given by renowned scientists on key topics of research and development, and an oral and poster&lt;br/&gt;parallel scientific sessions, where participants can present their most recent results on&lt;br/&gt;the different topics of the conference. Using this approach, CoSeRa-2015 will serve as an&lt;br/&gt;invaluable occasion for US graduate students to get in touch with the worldwide leaders in&lt;br/&gt;signal processing research and optimum system development. More importantly, the students&lt;br/&gt;will gain new ideas leading to stronger and more complete theses, and can put their contributions&lt;br/&gt;in perspective and relative to the ongoing research activities. In essence, they will be exposed&lt;br/&gt;to the most recent and advanced findings in the aforementioned areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed graduate student participation is poised to have a positive impact on compressive&lt;br/&gt;sensing research in US institutions in the broad application areas of radar, sonar, and remote&lt;br/&gt;sensing. The broader impact of the proposed student participation will materialize in the&lt;br/&gt;near future, as these students joining the US workforce will be better positioned to spearhead&lt;br/&gt;research and development activities in diverse industrial sectors, such as those serving law&lt;br/&gt;enforcement, homeland security, and defense as well as the automotive industries. Compressive&lt;br/&gt;Sensing yields low cost system design, enables fast data acquisition, and simplifies operational&lt;br/&gt;logistics, which are crucial considerations in many such applications.</AbstractNarration>
