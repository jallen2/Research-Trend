    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop optimization and control techniques and integrate them with real-time simulation models to achieve load balancing in complex networks. The application case is the regional freight system. Freight moves on rail and road networks which are also shared by passengers. These networks today work independently, even though they are highly interdependent, and the result is inefficiencies in the form of congestion, pollution, and excess fuel consumption. These inefficiencies are observed for example by the peaks of demand across time and space. Inefficiencies exist in part due to lack of information and appropriate tools, and in part due to lack of policies and institutional structures that would promote more integrated operations. The problem is made even more complex due to the large quantities of real time data that will be available to inform the decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops the theoretical foundations of a new approach referred to as COSMO to balance loads across complex dynamical networks with temporal and spacial characteristics. In contrast to current practices where simple mathematical models are used to predict the states of the network the method employs computational simulation models that are far more accurate in estimating the states of the network by taking into account dynamics and complex interactions. The project develops the optimization and load balancing control segments of the cyber physical system and integrate them with real time network simulation models using freight transportation as the driving application area. The research also examines how identified barriers and policy issues/incentives can be incorporated as mathematical constraints and/or control variables in the optimized dynamic freight load balancing system. Data supporting the analysis may include freight characterization, traffic, weather, and other large data volumes. The project will utilize real time data from the port of Los Angeles /Long Beach area to validate the approach. The port of Los Angeles/Long Beach is the port of entry for much of the freight that enters the West Coast, and provides rich sets of data that will stimulate the model especially in regional transportation involving interaction between road/rail/port networks. This fundamental technology in this important transportation domain with direct applications to other large scale freight centers, can be applied to other application domains including networking and smart grid. Besides the broader impact derived from more efficient allocation of transportation resources, the project also provide educational outreach and produce course modules.</AbstractNarration>
