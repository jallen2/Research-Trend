    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in Organic Rankine Cycles for distributed solar power generation at micro scale and will offer a cheaper alternative to solar photovoltaic (PV), with a payback period of just 4.5 year without government incentives. The use of solar thermal to generate power at residential level would offer a renewed encouragement to the solar thermal industry. With the ability to provide heat and hot water plus electricity, the solar thermal powered product would fulfill the energy requirements of a home single handedly. Most are familiar with the traditional perspective on the societal impact of a system like the Compact ORC - lower energy demand and reduced greenhouse gas. In addition the CORC positively impacts health and wellbeing by improving indoor air quality and providing affordable access. A number of clinical studies connect improved indoor air quality from efficient systems with a reduction in respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. Combining the health benefits of clean indoor air and improved living conditions, the downstream impact on healthcare cost would be enormous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project attempts to solve the problem of high cost for renewable energy from solar energy, both PV and solar thermal, at the residential and light commercial level without government incentives. Solar thermal can provide heat and hot water but not electricity. PV can provide electricity but not heat and hot water. The Compact ORC concept can do both with Combined Heat and Power (CHP). Current ORC systems are bulky and inefficient and most importantly high cost. The objective of this research is to combine all of the components of the ORC in one compact, integrated, low cost package. The expander, pump, and generator will all be mounting on a common shaft. The evaporator and condenser heat exchangers will be mounted integral with the ORC reducing inefficiencies and packaging cost. There will be no external piping of components together. The result will be a compact unit that is cost and performance competitive with grid energy.</AbstractNarration>
