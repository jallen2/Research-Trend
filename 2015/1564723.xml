    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Albertus Magnus College in New Haven, Connecticut will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in biology, chemistry, or mathematics. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic and other support to increase the persistence of academically talented, low-income students. The project design includes a comprehensive program that incorporates critically influential aspects of student success: a strong academic curriculum, financial support, a wide array of student support services, and career planning. Additionally, a system of individual supports is provided by faculty and peer mentors to augment the institutional offerings. Scholarships and support for academically strong students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic vitality of the greater New Haven region and the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program organization is informed by research indicating that a significant reason for STEM attrition is poor classroom experiences of students. In addition to student support activities, the project will study the impact of a professional learning community of STEM faculty on persistence and retention. Select faculty at Albertus will participate in a collaborative faculty development program. The process will involve groups of faculty developing lessons, teaching these lessons while their colleagues and knowledgeable others observe, engaging in post-lesson discussions to reflect on how to improve the lesson, and finally revising and re-teaching the lessons. The project will study how a professional learning community approach in higher education can lead to improved retention and degree completion in STEM fields. The program expects to help talented, low-income students to complete bachelor's degrees and contribute to the growing bioscience industry in the region. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community and help increase understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs.</AbstractNarration>
