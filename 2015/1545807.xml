    <AbstractNarration>This project is a scientific conference (Phys-Fest) focused on plant physiological ecology at the Konza Prairie Biological Station, in Kansas. Participants will collaborate in data collection as an organized group, each with their own field research equipment to address the question: What is the physiological variability within plant species of the tallgrass prairie? This question has scientific value, as physiological ecologists are aware that statistical variability in physiological processes often exceeds the mean response. Without replicated scientific equipment and trained scientists, measuring the physiological variability within an ecosystem is impossible. The meeting format will also promote networking and interactions among participants through a series of scientific presentations and meeting with established leaders in the field. Participants at Phys-Fest will create a plant eco-physiology video teaching library for free distribution online. Participants (and others within the field) will be encouraged to create short video lectures on their research specialty. As this video library grows over time, the educational outreach potential will be high. The final objective of Phys-Fest includes strategic planning for activities that promote long-term coalescence of the field. These activities include mentorship of students and postdoctoral associates at the conference, planning for future symposia addressing key questions in ecological physiology, and planning for a second Phys-Fest meeting. At least half of the invitees to the conference will be students and post-docs, allowing them to be exposed to important training and networking opportunities as they become established in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on plant eco-physiology (Phys-Fest) and deviate from the typical conference format of short presentations and posters. Here, participants will collaborate in data collection to characterize the spatial and diurnal variability in leaf-level carbon and water traits of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. This question has important scientific value as leaf-level plant physiology data is variable - yet no one quantifies this variability because adequately characterizing such variability in an entire ecosystem is beyond the capacity of an individual investigator and the equipment and instrumentation in an individual's laboratory. Conference participants will characterize the inherent physiological variability in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem (1) spatially across resource gradients on site; (2) diurnally within functional group/species; (3) serve to assess linkages between response variables and environmental variability in both space and time. These data will provide multi-metric, high temporal and spatial coverage for key physiological plant traits in mesic grassland and will provide baseline assessments of variability for future measurements in other ecosystems. The organization of Phys-Fest is specifically designed to promote networking and professional development for student and post-doctoral participants. Nightly sessions with established scientists in this research field will be held to mentor junior scientists and initiate discussion addressing research frontiers within plant eco-physiology. Finally, attendees will develop short video presentations on subject material within their specialty for classroom teaching. This video library will be hosted on a YouTube channel and will be an invaluable teaching resource.</AbstractNarration>
