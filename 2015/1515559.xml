    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will study an important class of massive stars, which have bright eruptions of material from their surface. These stars are in the last stages of their stellar life cycle, sometimes just before stellar explosions as supernovae (SNe). The investigators will use telescopes of the University of Arizona to study Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars. They will study the material ejected around nearby LBVs and the connection between SNe brightnesses. The material from the LBVs appears as bright rings of gas surrounding the stars. The material is visible in observations with optical telescopes and sensitive cameras. These observations provide the only way to measure the ejected mass and speed, as well as the typical time period between large eruptions. The investigators will study the environments of LBVs in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will mentor in CAMPARE, a program that fosters diversity in science by recruiting minorities and statistically underrepresented groups for a summer undergraduate research experience at Steward Observatory. The investigator will continue as a Sky Ambassador, working with Tucson elementary and high-school science teachers. As part of this program, they will develop instructional materials concerning the Sun and stars, supernovae, and the origin of the elements. There research program will also fund one Ph.D. thesis and several undergraduate researchers, providing them with experience with complex multi-wavelength observational data and time-variable phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators focus on observations to understand the stellar life cycle and explosive deaths of massive stars, since SNe dominate feedback in galaxies. SNe enrich the interstellar medium with elements, and they can be used probe conditions in the distant universe. The use of SNe to estimate of distances to galaxies hinges upon understanding the connection between massive stars and the various types of SNe they produce. Eruptive mass loss is influential in stellar evolution, and violent eruptions preceding core collapse can lead to some of the most luminous SNe known. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This LBV/SNe connection was initially controversial because stellar models place massive LBVs in an earlier phase, but recently a dramatic confirmation of the connection between LBV stars and SNe was observed. In 2009 an LBV star was noted in a survey of massive stars, and then in 2012 this star became a core-collapse SNe. LBV-like eruptions may hold critical clues about stellar instability during the final phases of nuclear burning, vital to understanding core collapse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During these studies, the investigators will detect a large number of extragalactic transients, and constrain the luminosity, mass-loss rates, duration, and outflow speed of the eruptions. Some of these eruptive transients will soon explode as SNe, so the observations will have tremendous value for understanding the prelude to core collapse of massive stars.</AbstractNarration>
