    <AbstractNarration>Cape Cod Community College (CCCC) is developing a one-year accelerated program to train Aviation Maintenance Technicians. The program is being developed with partnerships with regional employers, community partners, industry and other entities to design and implement accelerated pathways for jobs requiring a Federal Aviation Administration Airframe &amp; Powerplant (FAA A&amp;P) certificate as well as other aviation and avionics occupations. With implementation, CCCC will be one of only six community colleges in the United States to offer FAA A&amp;P certification training in an accelerated format, and will be the only public institution of higher education offering the accelerated certificate in eastern New England. The program responds to a documented regional and national need for a stronger workforce in aviation and avionics. The proposed curriculum and training addresses industry needs and creates a model accelerated program. The program is recruiting underrepresented groups including first generation, low income students and veterans. CCCC is collaborating with K-12 partners within the region, generating a pipeline of students able to fulfill regional labor market needs, including a dual enrollment pathway which increases opportunities for students to enter a high demand, well-paid career field. The accelerated structure of the program allows participants to reach their professional goals faster, and meet the employer demand. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is structured around three goals: 1) Developing a set of stackable certificates and associate degree program informed by industry that prepares aviation maintenance technicians, 2) creating a viable, cost efficient and guided pathway for high school students who wish to obtain a certificate or associate degree in Aviation Maintenance utilizing a dual enrollment path, and 3) creating an online pathway for workers with experience in the field who wish to prepare for the FAA A&amp;P certification exam. The program builds upon best practices and utilizes open-source materials and evidence-based strategies, including NSF-funded curriculum materials developed by the South Texas Aviation Maintenance Partnership (STAMP). Five project activities are involved: 1) developing an innovative online curriculum in aviation maintenance for general portions of the program that can be disseminated to other institutions, 2) establishing articulation agreements with Bridgewater State University in Aviation Management, 3) training two initial cohorts of students during the project and grow program enrollment to over 100 students, 4) providing professional development opportunities for aviation program faculty, and 5) continuing to develop relationships with industry partners. Program evaluation includes both formative evaluation for refinement of project activities and summative evaluation to establish outcomes that will influence the scaling up of efforts beyond the planning phase. Plans include dissemination of program outcomes at regional, state and national conferences, leveraging the impact of the program, and the dissemination of online modules/courses and teaching materials developed.</AbstractNarration>
