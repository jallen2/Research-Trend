    <AbstractNarration>The 12th Brauer Group Meeting will be held Monday - Friday, June 8 -12, 2015 at the Pingree Park campus of Colorado State University. This location is approximately one hour outside of Ft. Collins, CO, USA. At the 12th Brauer group meeting formal talks will be given by senior level researchers as well as by young researchers, including graduate students, post-docs and young faculty. The primary goal of this conference is to bring together established and beginning researchers to collaborate and share insights on problems of interest involving the Brauer group in its many forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brauer group is an abstract algebraic group studied by mathematicians with a wide variety of interests. Algebraists often study the Brauer group in its role as a directory of division algebras over a field, ultimately with the goal of understanding arithmetic complexity in fields. Open questions relate to simplicity of description, expression in terms of cyclic classes, and the search for a reasonable definition of dimension for fields and for algebraic groups such as PGLn. Algebraic geometers study the Brauer group as an important invariant of a scheme arising from etale cohomology. This point of view goes back to the 1960's and Grothendieck, who suggested problems that are still actively being investigated. Recently deep connections have arisen between Brauer groups of schemes and stack theory, and these are being used not only to attack some longstanding open problems, but to serve as inspiration for new problems and approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see the conference web-site: http://torsor.github.io/brauer/</AbstractNarration>
