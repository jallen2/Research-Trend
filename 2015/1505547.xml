    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) Nontechnical &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 12th International Workshop on Nano mechanical Sensing (NMC2015) will be held in July 2015&lt;br/&gt;in Auckland, New Zealand: http://nmc2015.org. We anticipate 150-200 academic and industrial&lt;br/&gt;research scientists from around the world will attend. NMC has been held in Asia, Europe,&lt;br/&gt;and the U. S. annually since 2004. The organization promotes cross- pollination of ideas from&lt;br/&gt;all corners of the globe. The conference consists of oral presentations (invited and juried),&lt;br/&gt;poster sessions, and time for informal networking and discussion. All materials presented&lt;br/&gt;at the meeting are invited to submit a more comprehensive version of their work in a special&lt;br/&gt;edition of the IET journal Micro Nano Letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NMC workshop is focused on interdisciplinary research on and with nanoscale sensors. NMC&lt;br/&gt;started as a "Nano mechanical cantilever" meeting but has grown along with innovations in&lt;br/&gt;Nano mechanics and probing at the nanoscale. NMC Workshops are non-profit academic meetings&lt;br/&gt;which are self-supporting; the meetings rely on contributions and attendee tuition to offset&lt;br/&gt;all expenses. NSF support is requested to assist in keeping the tuition rate as low as possible&lt;br/&gt;to enable a larger number of students and postdoctoral trainees to attend. NMC2015 provides&lt;br/&gt;a single session technical program with the latest research on Nano sensing including renowned&lt;br/&gt;invited speakers, contributed oral and poster presentations and excellent networking opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;NMC aims to promote interaction among researchers in the micro and Nano sensing and device&lt;br/&gt;community interested in addressing high-impact issues in chemical, biological and physical&lt;br/&gt;detection e.g. applications from homeland security and health, to materials research for computing&lt;br/&gt;and energy. An important component of the meeting is discussion and exploration on bringing&lt;br/&gt;this research to the real world. Conference participants hail from major universities and &lt;br/&gt;research facilities in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be participating in this conference. Attending sessions, and discussing with the researchers in the fields. They will be able to present their technical papers and discuss the latest technology on nanosensors.</AbstractNarration>
