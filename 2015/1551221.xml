    <AbstractNarration>The University of Texas, El Paso proposes to extend the work of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) in collaboration with their partners: California State University-Dominguez Hills, California State University-San Marcos, Dade College, Florida International University, New Mexico State University, Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, University of Houston Downtown, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, and the University of Texas Pan American. Together these Hispanic-Serving institutions will work to adapt proven strategies that have positive impact on (1) the number of Hispanic students who enter the workforce with computing degrees; (2) the retention and advancement of Hispanic students and faculty in computing, and (3) the development of sustainable, competitive education and research programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish this, CAHSI has already implemented a number of programs, including Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) that creates an active learning experience for students and leadership experiences for undergraduates serving as peer leaders, the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model that emphasizes the deliberate and intentional development of technical, team and professional skills and knowledge required for research, and Mentor-Grad that engages undergraduates in experiences and activities that prepare them for graduate studies and the professoriate. CAHSI has a strong record of success: recent bachelor's graduation rates of Hispanics in computer science increased by nearly 25% within their member institution, while over the same time period, the national trend showed a 39% decline. This extension will further existing goals and intentionally develop a sustainable ecosystem to (1) institute a sustainable infrastructure that supports CAHSI's continued impact and (2) become recognized as an organization that affects decision-making and cultural change at the local, regional, and national levels. To achieve these goals CAHSI will establish the cyber infrastructure to support collaborations and dissemination of CAHSI practices, establish collaborations beyond the Alliance with organizations and institutions sharing common goals, and promote multicultural awareness in administrators, faculty, and students.</AbstractNarration>
