    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the period 2016-2018 for an annual series of conferences titled "February Fourier Talks" (FFT) at the University of Maryland in the general area of applied harmonic analysis - the 2016 meeting scheduled for February 18-19. In recent years, this area of mathematics has made important contributions in a number of application areas, including image analysis and signal processing - for example, members of this community were instrumental in the development of the JPEG 2000 image coding standard. The meetings are held in February, and they provide a high-level forum for harmonic analysts to bring their work to scientists from industry and government agencies. In addition, they allow experts in applied and pure harmonic analysis to become familiar with the latest problems in need of mathematical formulation and solution. Finally, they serve to introduce young mathematicians and scientists to applied and pure harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The February Fourier Talks directly encourage dialogue and collaboration between mathematicians and scientists working in industry and government. The structure of the conference consists of three main lectures, 30-minute invited talks, and a poster session that showcases the work of students (both undergraduate and graduate) as well as postdocs. The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent PhD recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. More information, including lists of speakers and abstracts, registration information, and an archive of past conferences, can be found at the conference webpage: www.norbertwiener.umd.edu/FFT/2016.</AbstractNarration>
