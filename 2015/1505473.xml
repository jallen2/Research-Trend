    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on Plant Metabolic Engineering provides a unique setting for developing multidisciplinary collaborations needed to unravel the chemical and biochemical diversity of plant metabolism and advance basic and applied research in plant metabolic engineering. The 2015 conference will be held July 18-24, 2015 at the Waterville Valley conference center in New Hampshire. The conference will focus on three critical areas: new areas of understanding of plant metabolic pathway and their control; new technologies for modifying metabolism and gene expression in plants; development of plant metabolic engineering from concept to the field and marketplace, as exemplified by case studies from industry and academia. The list of speakers includes leaders in the field of Plant Systems and Synthetic Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Conference and Seminar is known for its inclusion of graduate students and postdocs that in the past accounted for 44% of participants. These junior researchers have many opportunities to interact with the leading investigators in the field. The Gordon Conference and Seminar is mindful of the need to be inclusive. Ten female participants (6 as speakers, 4 as discussion leaders) have been confirmed. Additional female participants and scientists from underrepresented groups will be invited for additional regula and short talk presentations based on their submitted abstracts. The conference is widely advertised at organizations such as: the National Organization for Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers; SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science); American Chemical Society; AAAS Minority Scientists Network. The meeting location has facilities to provide access to persons with disabilities and provides for child-care.</AbstractNarration>
