    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project will support student participation in the 2015 International Microwave Symposium (IMS) Educational Initiatives: Workshop Support, which will be held in Phoenix, Arizona, May 18-21, 2015. Support will be provided in conjunction with a new educational program called IMS Connect which was initiated in the 2014 IMS Symposium and will be expanded in this year's event. The proposed work will focus on STEM education and has as objective to increase the participation of students from underrepresented minorities. The participating students will share their experience with others through video diaries, helping to increase awareness of the opportunity for other students in future years. IMS will address research areas in RF/microwave engineering and is the largest conference in the world in this field. IMS has played a key role in identifying new directions for research and development. It is one of the few conferences where participation from both the industry and academia is extremely strong. The participating students will share their experience with others through video diaries, helping to increase awareness of the opportunity for other students in future years. The program will also be described in professional magazines with the potential to encourage other conferences to adopt a similar type of program.</AbstractNarration>
