    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR), and by the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices Program (EPMD) in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical description: New ideas continuously emerge to address fundamental and technological challenges at the intersection of materials science, nano-optics, condensed matter physics, and nanotechnology. Particularly exciting is to uncover new material systems, as well as controlled defects in solid materials, that support robust electronic resonances and can serve as the optically active medium for next-generation nano-optoelectronic devices. A transformative approach to controllable realization of defect-based quantum dots in atomically thin semiconductors is pursued in this project. The unique electronic properties of two-dimensional semiconductors enable a novel source of quantum light. The research activities present opportunity to introduce and engage high school, undergraduate and graduate students to research at the forefront of materials science and nano-optoelectronic device technology. The PI works closely with the University of Rochester Kearns Center - a center focused on increasing the number of low-income and historically underrepresented individuals pursuing undergraduate, graduate and professional education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: The research component of this CAREER award explores a novel platform to realize semiconductor quantum dots, which are hosted in van der Waals heterostructures based on stacked two-dimensional atomically thin materials. Recent research shows that, in addition to supporting extended two-dimensional excitons, atomically thin semiconductors also exhibit quantum dot like defects that support localized, zero-dimensional excitons. The research objectives of this project are two-fold: (i) elucidation of the detailed electronic and fine structure of the two-dimensional-material quantum-dot excitons using state-of-the-art magneto-optical spectroscopy as well as time-resolved measurements of voltage controlled van der Waals heterostructures and (ii) incorporation of these defect-based quantum dots into photonic nanostructures to create a substrate for chip-based quantum information science and quantum metrology applications. The quantum dots in van der Waals heterostructures are expected to provide a novel platform for integrated solid-state quantum photonics, quantum information processing and quantum metrology as well as a rich condensed matter physics playground to explore the coupling of quantum dots and atomically thin semiconductors.</AbstractNarration>
