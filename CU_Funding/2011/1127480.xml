    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is exploit unique electrical and mechanical properties of materials at the nanoscale to develop novel sensors, energy-conversion devices and integrated systems with unprecedented sensitivity, efficiency and functionality. The approach is to develop advanced computational tools to seamlessly integrate electrical and mechanical physical phenomena ranging from the quantum to the chip-scale, and to employ these computational tools to not only understand fundamental aspects of coupled electrical and mechanical phenomena but also to enable rapid computational prototyping of a variety of devices and systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed research focuses on the development of fundamentally new multiscale approaches where physical theories accounting for quantum effects, nanoscopic electrical and mechanical behavior, and material in homogeneities will be developed. The multiscale computational tools will provide unique physical insights into electrical and mechanical properties and their coupling and enable development of innovative electrically-actuated nanoelectromechanical sensors, devices and systems. The proposed multiscale approaches have the potential to be many orders of magnitude faster than existing quantum and atomistic approaches for design of coupled electromechanical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed research on the development of novel nanoelectromechanical systems has the potential to revolutionize sensor, computer, energy and health care sectors there by creating new industry, economy and impacting the common person in the society. Proposed research will educate graduate and undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary area of computational nanotechnology. Educational modules focusing on fundamentals of nanoelectromechanical systems and multiscale computational methods will be developed and made available on the web.</AbstractNarration>
