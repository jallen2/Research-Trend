    <AbstractNarration>EAGER: Marrying Kinesthetic Tools and Cyberinfrastructure to Education Research in Large Populations of Middle School Science Students &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCI 1152814&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the effort is to determine how QR code technology embedded on a tangible kinesthetic tool, a so-called "combined tool", can be productively used to help people learn both individually and collectively. The role of this technology in science education is largely unexplored, although the values of kinesthetic learning and technology-mediated instruction are recognized. The target population is middle school science students. The tool focuses on the study of earth science concepts including plate tectonics. The combined tool will be assessed in multiple settings including K-12 classrooms, museums, home-school environments, and in special-needs groups. The project involves university faculty, undergraduates, teachers and other educators, and students with roles in tool development, both tangible and cyberinfrastructure and assessment.</AbstractNarration>
