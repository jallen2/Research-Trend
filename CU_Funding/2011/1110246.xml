    <AbstractNarration>This research investigates the genetic basis of pigmentation differences in fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. It is a part of an effort to develop Drosophila pigmentation as an evolutionary metamodel. Established metamodels are necessary for the elucidation of any general rules in evolution. They test whether certain traits and gene networks evolve in a reproducible fashion. Previously the regions involved in color pattern evolution in one species pair were identified, and the genes are in the process of being characterized. This grant will improve this dissertation through funding an analysis of the chromosomal regions involved in pigmentation differences in an additional species pair. This comparative component will be integral to the formation of an unbiased understanding of the dynamics of convergent evolution in this system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metamodels are being actively developed in several systems, such as sticklebacks and mice. None of these endeavors account for the effect of network structure in shaping the dynamics of parallel evolution. Within Drosophila this is possible as most, though not all, genes in the pathway have been characterized. Furthermore--in addition to its scientific merit--this research generates opportunities for training in research and includes individuals from underrepresented groups. Undergraduates from this lab have continued on to graduate school and participated in local and national research symposia. This research is also being used to develop to develop lesson plans that promote engaged learning and improve biology education.</AbstractNarration>
