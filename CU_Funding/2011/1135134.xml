    <AbstractNarration>This award will fund the 2011 season of 'Universe in the Park', an outreach program that is held throughout the State park system in Wisconsin. Each Universe in the Park session starts with a presentation on a current astronomical topic or a recent discovery by an undergraduate (or graduate) student form the University of Wisconsin. The students then lead an observing session for the public using large-aperture, but portable, telescopes. In addition to the broad impact on the public participants, the students learn how to prepare and make presentations to lay audiences, hone their knowledge of the sky, and keep current on recent astronomical events. This award will fund approximately 60 Universe in the Park sessions and will reach an audience of several thousand.
