    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Instrument Development for Biological Research program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure, Prof. Carlos Meriles and his group at the City University of New York - City College are devising new approaches to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This important analytical tool is used by scientists, health professionals, and lab technicians to address a broad range of questions such as the functioning of cells and proteins, the monitoring and optimization of chemical processes in industry, and the diagnosis of organ dysfunction in humans. Magnetic resonance as currently practiced lacks the sensitivity necessary to image samples with high (sub-micron) spatial resolution, a serious impediment. Dr. Meriles addresses this problem with a novel strategy ultimately aimed at probing small living systems with nanometer resolution. The strategy makes use of "NV centers"- imperfections in diamond crystals which are extremely sensitive to local magnetic fields. By integrating magnetic resonance with scanning and optical microscopy, individual NV centers near a sample surface will be manipulated and detected, providing chemical information about the sample surface. A unique aspect of this approach is that, unlike mainstream MRI, bulky superconducting magnets and strong field gradients are unnecessary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work promises broad scientific and technological impact, with potential applications including nanoscale imaging of single cells at virtually zero magnetic field, high-resolution NMR spectroscopy of microorganisms under ambient conditions, sensing of molecular diffusion in nanoporous or membranous systems, and the monitoring of cell activity in single muscle cells or neuron networks. Accompanying this effort is a broad educational plan, which, besides graduate student training, includes activities aimed at improving instructional laboratories and various research opportunities for underprivileged students through summer activities within CCNY and in host laboratories of partner institutions.</AbstractNarration>
