    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1104779&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Eric Zaslow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirror symmetry in string theory has, quite famously, linked&lt;br/&gt;disparate fields of mathematics. The central theorem in the&lt;br/&gt;subject is Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry (HMS)&lt;br/&gt;conjecture. The principal investigator proposes to prove this&lt;br/&gt;conjecture using his recent work with collaborators. Connections&lt;br/&gt;between mathematical physics and topology, representation theory,&lt;br/&gt;and combinatorics have been revealed through the PI's research&lt;br/&gt;with Nadler and with Fang, Liu and Treumann. What emerges is a&lt;br/&gt;language for studying mirror symmetry and other advances in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics from a simple, geometric viewpoint which&lt;br/&gt;easily lends itself to computation. This perspective renders&lt;br/&gt;some formidable hurdles of HMS rather tractable. The PI will,&lt;br/&gt;with collaborators and graduate students, aim to prove HMS in&lt;br/&gt;several stages. First, by defining a category, the Constructible&lt;br/&gt;Plumbing Model (CPM), which models the Fukaya category of a&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifold at its large radius limit by defining a&lt;br/&gt;formal Lagrangian skeleton and gluing together categories of&lt;br/&gt;constructible sheaves made from pieces of the skeleton. Second,&lt;br/&gt;by proving that CPM is equivalent to the category of perfect&lt;br/&gt;complexes on the mirror Calabi-Yau at its large complex limit&lt;br/&gt;point. After these steps, a deformation-of-categories argument&lt;br/&gt;can be made to establish a mirror map and prove HMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of string theory is to merge the two pillars of modern&lt;br/&gt;physics: Einstein's theory of gravity and the quantum theory of&lt;br/&gt;particles. Models of the universe from string theory rely on a&lt;br/&gt;class of geometric spaces called Calabi-Yau manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;Calculations in these models are quite formidable, but are often&lt;br/&gt;made tractable through the phenomenon of mirror symmetry. The&lt;br/&gt;idea of mirror symmetry is that one theory can look totally&lt;br/&gt;different from another theory, but the two lead to the same&lt;br/&gt;predictions. Hard calculations using one Calabi-Yau manifold can&lt;br/&gt;become easy calculations in the completely different "mirror"&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifold. But to be truly useful, one must have&lt;br/&gt;complete confidence in the equivalence, namely that the&lt;br/&gt;calculations in the mirror theory can be trusted. This requires&lt;br/&gt;a rigorous mathematical formulation of the model, a rigorous&lt;br/&gt;statement of how to apply the equivalence, and a rigorous proof&lt;br/&gt;that the equivalence is, in fact, true. The statements in mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry have been made rigorous by Fields Medal laureate Maxim&lt;br/&gt;Kontsevich. What is still lacking is a general proof of&lt;br/&gt;Kontsevich's conjecture. The principal investigator proposes to&lt;br/&gt;prove this conjecture in several steps, using a simple geometric&lt;br/&gt;model which easily lends itself to calculations. The model can&lt;br/&gt;also serve as a framework for exploring other predications and&lt;br/&gt;phenomena of modern theoretical physics.</AbstractNarration>
