    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly process to prepare organically functionalized layered double hydroxides (organoLDHs). Such organoLDHs feature a two-dimensional nano-platelet like morphology and are tuned to have good compatibility with organic polymers. In this project, organoLDHs will be studied as high-performance additives for tire innerliners, the inner-most layer of a pneumatic tire that holds the internal air pressure. The addition of organoLDHs, even in small amounts, is expected to significantly enhance the inflation pressure retention (gas barrier) properties of tire innerliners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to create a new class of additive products with great market potential in the tire industry. The values such products provide include (1) better tire performance, including enhanced inflation pressure retention, better tire durability and reduced rolling resistance; (2) helping tire and automobile manufacturers meet challenging regulations on vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions; and (3) potential savings on manufacturing cost. The potential addressable market size of this technology is about $100 million.</AbstractNarration>
