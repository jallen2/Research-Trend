    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award has been made to Marquette University that will provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. This award is supported by both the NSF Directorate for Biosciences and the Department of Defense ASSURE program (thru a Memorandum of Understanding with NSF). The REU program is intended to encourage students to pursue science- and research-related careers. The focus of this program is the understanding of biological processes in organisms ranging from microbes to mammals at the level of individual cells, proteins, and genes. Students will choose from among several faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences and will design and carry out a research project under the direct supervision of their faculty mentor, thereby developing a realistic view of the demands and excitement of scientific discovery. Besides full-time research, students will learn to read the scientific literature and develop written and verbal communication skills through weekly journal clubs, laboratory group meetings, and research discussions. Students will also participate in workshops on responsible conduct of research, career opportunities, and the graduate school application process. Students will present their findings at both a poster session and research symposium during the final weeks of the program. Social activities are interwoven throughout the program to promote camaraderie among faculty, Marquette students, and the REU participants. Housing, a stipend, and meal and travel allowances are provided. Students will be encouraged to present their work at national meetings during the following year. Students are selected based on their interest in research, academic record, and phone interviews with potential faculty mentors. Members of underrepresented minority groups and students from colleges with limited research opportunities are especially encouraged to apply. After the program, participants are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The program will be assessed using various means, including an REU common assessment tool available online to students.
