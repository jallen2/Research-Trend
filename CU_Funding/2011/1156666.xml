    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) at the National Science Foundation support a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professors John K. Snyder and Linda H. Doerrer both at Boston University (BU). The research projects supported in this site are in areas of basic chemical research that addresses biological problems. REU students can choose from among 27 groups in BU's Departments of Chemistry, Biology, or Physics. They will work in newly renovated laboratories, have access to the synthetic and computational resources of BU's leading research centers, and be trained on state-of-the art instrumentation. The goal of the program is to provide undergraduates from 4-year colleges and community colleges who have limited or no research opportunities at their home institutions with an intensive, interdisciplinary research experience. The demographic aim is to have at least 50% of the students to be underrepresented minorities and at least 50% to be women. The program will also give preference to veterans applying from the target institutions. By fully integrating the REU students into the daily life of the laboratories and through mentoring by faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates, the REU students will fully experience the breadth of chemistry research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research theme of basic research in the chemical sciences addressing biological problems represents one of the most important interdisciplinary scientific fields today. Advances in this area have implications for the life sciences, medicinal discoveries, and, ultimately, quality of life. The objective of this REU program site is to motivate students to pursue careers in the chemical sciences addressing societal problems in biology and molecular biology. It will especially focus on offering research opportunities for underrepresented minorities. Boston University has the necessary personnel and infrastructure to allow REU participants to be immersed in a genuine research environment. BU also has dedicated faculty who are eager to devote the necessary time and energy to mentor students from 4-year colleges and community colleges who do not have such research opportunities at their home institutions.</AbstractNarration>
