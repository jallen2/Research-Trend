    <AbstractNarration>1033426&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contemporary methods for cell cryopreservation often produce a low yield of viable cells due to the harmful effects of ice formation or use of a high concentration of cryoprotectant (CPA). This research seeks to achieve ice-free cryopreservation (vitrification) of cells using a low, nontoxic concentration of CPA (low-CPA). A quantitative understanding of the thermally driven, non-equilibrium phase transition of water in living cells into either a crystalline or a glassy solid, and its correlation with cell survival during low-CPA vitrification has not been achieved to date. Therefore, the objective of this project is to quantify the relevant fundamental phenomena by model development coupled with experimental verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: A coupled thermal and phase transition model will be developed which will facilitate quantitative understanding of the pertinent biotransport processes during low-CPA vitrification. Optimal low-CPA vitrification protocols for cryopreserving various living cells will be determined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research will assist the advancement of emerging cell-based medicine of which the eventual success relies upon the capability to preserve living cells for distribution to end users. Moreover, the proposed research will be integrated into education through (a) curriculum development, (b) training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, and (c) dissemination of the research findings including by a specialized web page.</AbstractNarration>
