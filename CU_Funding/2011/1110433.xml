    <AbstractNarration>Asexual reproduction via specialized propagules that contain both fungal and algal components occurs throughout the diverse lineages that comprise lichens, and is one of the most interesting aspects of lichen biology. Although lichens that reproduce this way represent up to ~50% of lichen biodiversity in any given area they have been chronically neglected. This project implements a novel methodology to remedy this problem using a revision of the lichen genus Lepraria in North America as a case study. This methodology relies on extensive field observations to reconcile the results of analyses of molecular data against those based on traditional characters such as morphology and chemistry. Lepraria is a unique group that has lost the ability to reproduce sexually yet continued to diversify. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a significant knowledge gap in lichenology by producing the first comprehensive treatment of Lepraria on a continental scale and introducing the first standardized morphological terminology for any group of sterile crustose lichens. Field studies in boreal/arctic North America will substantively increase the functionality of this treatment. Similarly, newly generated molecular data will shed light on the evolution of asexual reproduction in lichenized fungi while providing taxonomic placement for numerous species currently orphaned within Lepraria. Most notably the methodology implemented here is broadly applicable to other sterile lichens, providing a timely and cost-effective way to document and describe the biodiversity of this highly speciose but chronically neglected group. The project will train a doctoral student and results of the study will be disseminated through the development of websites, videos, and mass media public outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
