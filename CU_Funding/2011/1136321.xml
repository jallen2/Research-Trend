    <AbstractNarration>The nation needs more outstanding mathematics teachers, a need that is critical to its competitiveness in an increasingly global economy and important if it is to give all students the opportunity to succeed in quantitative disciplines. This project is developing the infrastructure at Boston College to allow this institution to increase its capacity and contributions in this area. As a joint effort of faculty in Boston College's Department of Mathematics (College of Arts and Sciences) and Department of Teacher Education (the Lynch School of Education), the project is redesigning Boston College's Master's of Science in Teaching degree so that mathematically able students can complete it in 12 months, with a curriculum that seamlessly interweaves content, pedagogical content knowledge, and pedagogy. The existing Boston College induction program for new graduates is being expanded and linked to the professional development efforts of Math for America Boston (MfA Boston), a non-profit organization, which seeks to provide new teachers with immersion experiences in mathematics and on-going Pedagogical Content Knowledge development. In addition to developing a strong relationship with MfA Boston, the project is laying the groundwork for a credentialed Master Teachers' track at Boston College in order to develop the next generation of teacher-leaders in mathematics. This project builds on the connections between Boston College and high-need school districts with the goal of ultimately providing a steady stream of top mathematics teachers who are committed to urban teaching and well prepared to succeed in these settings.</AbstractNarration>
