    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 July 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1118412&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;PI: W. Byam&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: [None]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support items for the University of Delaware for use aboard the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely replacement sheaves for the stern A-frame, a stainless steel docking head for the CTD handling system, additional airborne and underwater radiated noise treatments for the active stabilization fins, and a remote control for the port trawl winch. All items will either enhance safety or provide greatly improved support capabilities to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit: The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP. The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit. During operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Specifically, College of Marine and Earth Studies participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events (Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational cruises. The College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool. The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is scheduled to support over 110 NSF-funded days in CY 2011.</AbstractNarration>
