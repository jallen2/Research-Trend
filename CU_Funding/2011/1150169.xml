    <AbstractNarration>Handing dynamics has long since been a unique challenge in wireless network resource management. While the accelerated proliferation of smartphones and tablets has drawn considerable attention to the issue of efficient wireless resource management, the problem actually gets further exacerbated, resulting in inferior application performance at massive scale and negative societal impact to a larger user base. The objective of this project is to establish a solid theoretical foundation for wireless resource management that handles dynamics in its core design. It is based on a novel time-scale decomposition approach, in which dynamics play the foundational role in the clean-slate formulation of a new resource management optimization framework. Through diverse educational efforts and channels, including course development, on-line education systems, research and outreach programs, this project will reach a diverse group of students, influence and inspire them with inter-disciplinary thinking and enrich them with hands-on experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish a significant step towards the relief of "wireless data network congestion" problem. The results from this project will enrich and transform the field of wireless resource management from heuristic adaptations of static solutions into one that is oriented towards wireless network dynamics. In addition to the traditional knowledge distribution channel such as academic publications, this project will also disseminate its results through distribution of software packages and the collected network traces. The impact of this project will also be demonstrated in a remote medical care system.</AbstractNarration>
