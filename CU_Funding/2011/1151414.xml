    <AbstractNarration>This research project addresses three main topics:&lt;br/&gt;(1) The well-posedness theory of the initial value problem for the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchy,&lt;br/&gt;based on the approach initiated by the PI jointly with N. Pavlovic (UT Austin).&lt;br/&gt;A main motivation underlying our work is our aim at generalizing methods from nonlinear dispersive &lt;br/&gt;PDE's for the analysis of quantum field theories (QFT's). &lt;br/&gt;(2) Problems in non-relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), in particular relating to the &lt;br/&gt;semiclassical motion of electrons, radiation damping, and the problem of ultraviolet&lt;br/&gt;renormalization in QED.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Derivation of kinetic equations from kinetic scaling limits of the thermal momentum &lt;br/&gt;distribution function for interacting electron gases, modeled in dynamical Hartree-Fock theory. &lt;br/&gt;These projects involve several ongoing collaborations, including international ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Study of the GP hierarchy, which emerges in the analysis of interacting Bose gases, bridges&lt;br/&gt;some of the most exciting recent developments in physics (Bose-Einstein condensation)&lt;br/&gt;with some of the most impressive recent developments in mathematics (nonlinear dispersive PDE's).&lt;br/&gt;Non-relativistic QED is the physical theory of non-relativistic quantum mechanical matter &lt;br/&gt;(electrons, atoms, molecules) interacting with the energy quanta (photons) of light, and&lt;br/&gt;describes processes in a wide spectrum of quintessential areas in technology (chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;electronics, modeling of solar panels, etc). The derivation of kinetic equations from quantum&lt;br/&gt;dynamics leads to a precise mathematical understanding of classical physics (fluid dynamics) &lt;br/&gt;from quantum physics.&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this project involves the training of graduate students in highly multidisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;annual thematic programs that provide them with a integrative and specialized understanding of&lt;br/&gt;links between Analysis, Applied and Computational Mathematics, nonlinear PDE's, and Mathematical Physics. &lt;br/&gt;The goal is to provide graduate students with an exceptionally broad understanding of their research fields.</AbstractNarration>
