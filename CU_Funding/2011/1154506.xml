    <AbstractNarration>This comprehensive program supports strong academic skill building for scholarship recipients with activities and structures that enhance the living experience on campus in the first year, and career-building activities in the following three years. The overall objectives of the program are to increase achievement, retention, and interest in careers in the biosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freshmen and sophomores are required to live on campus in the Bio Living-Learning Community. In their fall semester freshmen year, students take a college success course taught by a Biology faculty member. In their second semester freshmen year, students take Careers in Biology, which is co-taught by a career counselor and a biology faculty member. Both courses are open to other students. Scholars benefit from block scheduling into science and mathematics courses for two years. In addition, tutors from the Pirate Tutoring Center at the college are being hired to attend courses with students and provide note-taking training and tutoring sessions as requested. A common academic advisor advises students until they declare their major in their sophomore year, after which they will be advised by the principal investigators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sophomores help recruit students for the next class. As upperclassmen, students are being guided and encouraged to undertake undergraduate research projects and/or internships. The academic performance of students is being assessed by their grades. Interviews and questionnaires given at the end of each academic year allow formative assessment of the program. A final questionnaire and follow-up assessment for two years after graduation is being used to collect data regarding future career plans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program with its combination of social, academic, and financial support is changing the culture of the university experience for these students and ensuring their success in bio-related careers and/or post-graduate education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The overall goal of the BioExcellence Scholarship program is to support academic achievement, so that recipients complete BS Biology or BS Biochemistry degrees in four years, leading to a career in the biosciences. Students with 3.0 or higher GPAs who are interested in majoring in Biology or Biochemistry are being supported in their coursework by intervention programs including peer tutoring, career information, and block scheduling for the first two years, followed by undergraduate research mentoring and internships in the biosciences to help guide students in career decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The program benefits 24 financially deserving students, primarily from eastern North Carolina. This region has a high poverty rate, low higher education achievement, and a large minority population. This student group can often struggle financially and academically. The program lends support structures to help them attain their goal of a university degree and career in the biosciences. Students enter a study to assess success of the interventions, and results are being disseminated to regional and national science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education conferences.</AbstractNarration>
