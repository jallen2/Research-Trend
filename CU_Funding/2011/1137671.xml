    <AbstractNarration>OCI 1137671&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will support funding of travel for US researchers, scientists and CIOs to attend the 2011 Chinese-American Network Symposium (CANS) to meet with Chinese counterparts to discuss design and use of high-performance research networks; explore areas for collaboration; and present results from prior collaborations. CANS meetings promote understanding between the US and China research networking communities, interoperability between research infrastructures from each country, and international collaborations across a broad range of disciplines. In China, CANS is organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences? (CAS) Computer Network Information Center (CNIC) unit which operates the CSTNet research network, and by the Chinese Education and Research Network (CERNET), the Chinese Ministry of Education-supported organization that provides and operates the major national research and education network for over 700 universities in China. Internet2 - the national research and education networking organization in the US that interconnects all US research universities and many US national laboratories in addition to other research and educational institutions ? is the US organizer along with the Chinese Association for Science and Technology USA (CAST-USA). CANS 2011 will be held in Kunming, China, co-hosted by CERNET and Yunnan University. The symposium will promote interoperability, seamless networking, and collaboration and emphasize network research and ?clean slate? efforts (NSF GENI initiative, IPv6, videoconferencing and telepresence, federated identity and authentication, integration of smart phones and tablets into university infrastructures, CCN, and advanced applications.) A special track will also feature US and Chinese CIOs. These areas and the symposium are consistent with Internet2?s global strategy, including supporting Internet2 members deploying campuses and global programs in China; fostering distributed educational capabilities on an international scale; timely deployment and joint development of applications supporting IPv6 globally; and transformative applications that leverage networks. CANS also is likely to complement NSF?s larger efforts promoting global networking.</AbstractNarration>
