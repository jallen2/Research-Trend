    <AbstractNarration>The Carroll University STEP Initiative (CUSI) addresses the shortage of engineers in Waukesha County, Wisconsin. A partnership between area high schools, universities, and industry, the project aims to increase student interest in STEM careers, particularly engineering, with a focus on attracting female students. CUSI strengthens existing programs involving recruitment, retention, and transition of graduates to engineering careers. Recruitment is enhanced by way of partnerships, career guidance and job placement. Retention is strengthened via learning communities, mentoring, and a program that provides hands-on learning opportunities and leadership development for pre-engineering students. Transition involves improved connections with local industry designed to increase graduates in the local workforce who are equipped with the necessary skills for continued success. Evaluation of the project is largely based on successful increase in enrollment and graduates of the engineering program, as well as alumni activity beyond graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is to serve as a model for other small, private, liberal arts institutions to partner with area high schools and local industry to expand and strengthen STEM pathways, to encourage more students to pursue engineering careers, and to address local workforce shortages and the Nation's need for more STEM graduates. Broader impacts include: broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields, enhancing collaborative infrastructure for education, and advancing discovery while promoting teaching and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination activities include presenting student projects to the broader community through annual engineering education exhibitions, and sharing project data and information via journals/publications and state/national conferences.</AbstractNarration>
