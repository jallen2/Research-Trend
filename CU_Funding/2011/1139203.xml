    <AbstractNarration>A significant unknown in our understanding of climate change and the chemical state of the ocean involves oceanic methane (CH4). Numerous studies have conducted measurements of the sea-air flux of methane. These studies were conducted primarily to assess the extent to which the massive reservoir of methane in ocean sediments is contributing to the atmospheric greenhouse gas budget. Most of these studies have relied on collecting discrete surface water samples and historic measurements of atmospheric methane concentration and meteorological data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER seeks to to design and test a small portable unit for assessing the sea-air flux of methane in natural water systems including the ocean, estuaries, and lakes. This instrument is based on the small footprint design of the pCO2 systems developed for use on volunteer observing ships and research vessels and described by Pierrot et al. [2009]. One of the modifications to the pCO2 system design will be the simultaneous monitoring of both the air and the recirculated headspace from the equilibrator rather than alternating the analysis and losing time to flushing out the cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential benefit to ocean community of having an accurate quantification of methane source strengths is important to future climate modeling. A graduate student from an underrepresented group in STEM fields will be trained during the development and field testing of this new instrument.</AbstractNarration>
