    <AbstractNarration>This research planning visit to the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) will enable Prof. Xiaofeng Liu from the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) to initiate collaboration with Danish counterpart, Prof. B. Mutlu Sumer, on the emerging topic of foundation scour protection for offshore wind farms. Prof. Liu, accompanied by one U.S. graduate student, will bring modeling and computational expertise to the envisioned joint research while the DTU research team headed by Prof. Sumer will contribute significant expertise in the area of erosion and scour effects on wind turbine foundations. Through a series of technical presentations, group discussions, and site visits to wind energy companies based in Denmark, the researchers intend to focus their plans for a more extensive examination of fluid dynamic mechanisms that are involved in the scouring of offshore foundations. Preliminary results should provide new insight into the turbulent flow structures around piles protected by porous stone layers, with the goal of defining new engineering solutions that address issues related to the stability and construction of off-shore wind farms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this award will catalyze a new US-Danish research collaboration. Broader impacts may include new knowledge applicable to future efforts to prevent damages to offshore installations on seabed. Furthermore, the U.S. student's early career involvement will provide a valuable professional introduction to individuals and Danish institutions with expertise in a wide range of topics associated with the generation of carbon-free wind energy.</AbstractNarration>
