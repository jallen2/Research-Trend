    <AbstractNarration>Recognizing speech or other auditory objects in adverse environments -- e.g. with noise, reverberation, and multiple speakers -- is essential for human and animal communication. Current speech recognition technologies work well in high signal-to-noise conditions, but perform orders of magnitude below human performance in adverse conditions. Converging evidence from neuroscience suggests that auditory information is encoded in sparse and precisely timed spikes of sub-cortical neurons. However, the extent to which codes based on spike timing might underlie the robustness of human auditory object recognition has not yet been fully investigated. This project bridges this gap by devising a biologically inspired computational model of auditory processing at the cortical level and extracting computational principles that are essential for the model to achieve robust auditory object recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach is to transform sounds into the spike sequences generated by feature-detecting thalamic auditory neurons, and to integrate these spikes spatially and temporally using the state-dependent dynamics of cortical neurons with active dendrites. In the proposed model, an auditory object first evokes sequential spiking of thalamic neurons that have been trained to detect useful features. Then, through feed-forward excitation and inhibition from the thalamus, and lateral excitation and inhibition from the cortical neurons, the state of the cortical network evolves, leading to temporal integration. Recognition of the auditory object is signaled when the cortical neurons reach a specific network state. The computational model is constrained by experimental results on the properties of cortical neurons, the organization principles of cortical networks, and the activity-dependent plasticity rules of the network structures. The project aims both to design feature detectors that can robustly represent auditory objects with spatiotemporal spike sequences, and to build a cortical network model that can recognize specific auditory objects using state transitions driven by the thalamic inputs, with neuron dynamics that can be compared with those observed in the auditory cortex. The recognition performance of the computational model will be evaluated and improved with auditory tasks designed to compare different approaches to speech recognition.</AbstractNarration>
