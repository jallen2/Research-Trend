    <AbstractNarration>SES-1128288 &lt;br/&gt;Ronald Eyerman &lt;br/&gt;Joseph Klett &lt;br/&gt;Yale University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: Cognition and Environmental Noise&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study investigates the social construction of sound or "noise" in the environment through analysis of how people interpret sound. This is a topic of theoretical interest to cognitive science, social psychology, and the arts. Given the cultural emphasis on vision in our society, less research has been done on the importance of the cognitive interpretation of sound and its consequences for urban life, the social environment, and mental health. This study examines what figures into how people listen and how the concept of noise is evaluated by personnel in a sound engineering firm. The debates and conflicts among such personnel come to define what is considered problematic noise as they aim to develop technology that focuses on improving the listening experience in modern society. Using ethnographic observation and discourse analysis, the investigator looks at perceptions which ultimately come to define the concept of noise. In the process, the study contributes to debates about constructivism and realism in social science by showing the way in which opinions compete to create facts. It also addresses concerns related to environmental stress and the utility of hearing and listening for enhanced social well-being. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This study should impact knowledge about hearing, an important component in understanding such diverse issues as the effect of noise in the environment on social stress and the utility of music in well-being and mental health. It should impact knowledge about listening, and consequently, point to how to improve social life through language, technology, and environment.</AbstractNarration>
