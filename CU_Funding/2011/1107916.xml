    <AbstractNarration>The DIG-Maps project is increasing the number of minority students pursuing undergraduate degrees in geoscience by leveraging a strong existing partnership between North Carolina State University and Wake Tech Community College, both located in Raleigh, NC. Collaboration between faculty from NC State's Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Wake Tech's Geology faculty is developing enhanced introductory geology courses, summer and regular term research opportunities for undergraduate students, career and academic advising, and creating a learning community for program participants from Wake Tech, who will be able to continue their education at NC State. A distance education lecture and laboratory course that incorporates research-based pedagogy and field components is extending opportunities to those unable to attend regular classes. Outreach to high schools through The Science House and a summer camp are being used to attract high school students to the program. Evaluation results are being used to establish the project as a model for collaboration between research universities and area community colleges. As an additional broader impact, the large number of participants taking the introductory geoscience course at Wake Tech are gaining valuable knowledge about Earth Systems that will make them better prepared citizens.</AbstractNarration>
