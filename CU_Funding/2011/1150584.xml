    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to reveal experimentally many unusual properties of graphene surface plasmon and to develop next-generation nanophotonic devices. This research will investigate localized surface plasmon resonances in doped graphene nanostructures, explore transverse electrical surface plasmon, and develop a pump-probe space-time-resolved spectroscopy method to study terahertz surface plasmon polaritons. Graphene-based active plasmonic devices including modulators, interferometers, and dynamic infrared frequency-selective surfaces will be demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to integrate fundamental research of graphene plasmonics with novel device applications. The research addresses the current needs and challenges of graphene plasmonics, designs and develops experimental techniques to understand basic properties of graphene surface plasmon. The development and demonstration of the proposed active plamsonic devices will further provide new understanding of manipulating light on a two-dimensional surface, paving the way for advanced applications of graphene as an active metamaterial. The proposed research is transformative in that it enables the development of a range of novel photonic devices with integration and functionality that cannot be achieved with conventional materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are to provide ultrasmall photonic devices and integrated electronic-photonic circuits for photonic industry and information technology, and to integrate cutting-edge research with education which provides a broader education opportunity for one of the most diverse student body in the nation. The education and outreach programs include the integration of the proposed research with the UH-based NSF programs, curriculum development for nanoengineering minor option, and providing summer camp and science projects for local high school students.</AbstractNarration>
