    <AbstractNarration>Proposal # 1144852&lt;br/&gt;Title: Building Partnerships and Pathways to Address the Foundational Grand&lt;br/&gt;Challenge for Engineering Education - Concrete Steps towards&lt;br/&gt;Broadening Participation.&lt;br/&gt;P.I. Amir Mirmiran&lt;br/&gt;Florida International University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College of Engineering and Computing at Florida International University (FIU) proposes to host a national workshop on Building Partnerships and Pathways to Address the Foundational Grand Challenge for Engineering Education Concrete Steps Towards Broadening Participation in February 2012 in Miami, Florida. The workshop will focus on identifying partnerships and pathways that will help increase the stagnant supply of the next generation of engineering workforce in the U.S. who can address the NAE engineering grand challenges. The specific objectives of the workshop are the following:&lt;br/&gt;1. To identify actions needed to create a culture of collaboration on the educational needs of the next generation of engineers, including a plan of action for revitalizing the current engineering education practices, in particular at universities with an urban mission;&lt;br/&gt;2. To identify best opportunities for synergistic partnerships among MSIs, HSIs, HBCUs, school districts, community colleges, research extensive universities, government, the industry, and the urban communities to address the barriers hindering the expansion of the future engineering talent pool; and 3. To identify the existing Best Practices shown to be effective in (a) attracting minority K-12 students to engineering and increasing their graduation rates with engineering degrees; and (b) strengthening the pipeline of minority students to graduate-level engineering education and faculty positions, as well as successful engineering careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will result in action plans and white papers a road map for funding agencies and a clear pathway for all stakeholders. The results will be circulated widely to raise awareness of the fundamental contributions that a diversified engineering workforce must make to address the Grand Challenges for Engineering as well as the kinds of active partnerships that can realistically address the foundational grand challenge for engineering education. The proposed road map will help guide the stakeholders in engineering education, including the funding agencies, to align their resources and increase the stagnant supply of the next generation of engineering workforce, particularly within underrepresented minorities in urban settings. Such activities will also help increase the number of faculty from HIS/HBCU/MSI?s including severely underrepresented and minority faculty who will serve as role models for the next generation of engineering students in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omnia El-Hakim&lt;br/&gt;Director for Diversity and Outreach</AbstractNarration>
