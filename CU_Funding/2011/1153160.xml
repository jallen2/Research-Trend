    <AbstractNarration>To maintain a robust innovation system, it is important to make full use of qualified personnel, and to create products that are matched to potential users. In the US, women are under-represented in the science and technology labor force, and innovation systems do not always address the ways that gender and technology intersect. As a result, there are bottlenecks in the innovation system. This award addresses those two problems by building on a European Union policy directive that requires attention to gender in innovation. The award funds the development of cases in which attention to gender led to important technological innovations. These cases are refined and tested by an interdisciplinary group of researchers from natural and physical science, engineering, social science, and humanities. This research contributes to theories of how gender shapes scientific knowledge. While previous policy interventions sought to increase women?s human capital, or to redress institutional problems, this research will examine how attention to gendered knowledge can make science and technology work attractive to women, and also contribute to innovation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Case materials are visually and technically documented, and made available to policymakers, practicing scientists and engineers, and teachers through an interactive website, publications, and policy documents. The creation and testing of the materials will geographically and demographically diverse researchers, undergraduate researchers, and students.</AbstractNarration>
