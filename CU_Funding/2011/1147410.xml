    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Special Projects Program of the Chemistry Division to the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST) of the National Research Council funds an examination of the status and goals of graduate education in chemistry in the context of current societal challenges and employment opportunities for Ph.D. chemists. The BCST will convene stakeholders from academe, industry, and government to discuss these issues, and issue a summary report. This effort will provide a baseline of knowledge and opinions that can be used by NSF and other organizations as they try to optimize their support for graduate education in chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The graduate experience is focused on developing a student's ability to formulate research questions and address them with a sound plan of research. It follows an expert/apprentice model to develop the next generation of independent chemistry researchers. As such, judgment as to the adequacy of any individual course of education at the graduate level is largely subjective, and entrusted to the thesis committee, whose members make judgments based on their experience and on their perception of the expectations of the community with respect to the abilities that a new Ph.D. should possess. This activity will examine these expectations in the light of current fiscal conditions and societal needs. It will consider whether the goals and expectations of current Ph.D. programs in chemistry are well-aligned with the current needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The activity will enhance the infrastructure for education by a critical evaluation of current goals of graduate education against goals and needs of employers and broader society. It will contribute to the alignment of graduate education with societal needs in commerce, sustainability, and other critical areas.</AbstractNarration>
