    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing efficient solid-state data storage device and system design solutions. Although solid-state data storage has shown a high potential to significantly advance storage systems to achieve ultra-high performance with low energy consumption, continuous semiconductor technology scaling makes it increasingly challenging to realize efficient and reliable solid-state data storage devices and systems for the storage hierarchy in large-scale systems, such as data centers and cloud systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the theme of developing solid-state data storage design techniques from both software and hardware. Major solid-state data storage device architecture functions, including error correction coding, wear-leveling and garbage collection algorithms, are being developed. Workload and device-aware solid-state data storage system design solutions are also being developed for large data center applications. Design solutions will be evaluated using an experimental hardware platform and the Linux operating system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed research is that it will enable the development of highly reliable and low-cost solid-state data storage devices and systems for large-scale computing and storage systems. The adoption of the design methodology by solid-state data storage architects, system designers, and data-intensive practitioners may provide a direct benefit to this strategically important high technology sector critical to the economic health of the nation. This team will also introduce new research results into courses.</AbstractNarration>
