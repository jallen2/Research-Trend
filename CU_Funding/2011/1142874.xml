    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on development of&lt;br/&gt;an economical process for production of nano-structured non-precious metal electrodes.&lt;br/&gt;Currently, many electrode applications use precious metals that make the technologies&lt;br/&gt;prohibitively expensive for wide-scale adoption. The materials being developed on this&lt;br/&gt;project have unique properties compared to conventional materials used in electrodes,&lt;br/&gt;and can be incorporated into a number of important applications. The materials are&lt;br/&gt;based on carbon nano-fibers, a similar material to carbon nano-tubes. The unique&lt;br/&gt;properties of these materials can be optimized by tuning particular features at the&lt;br/&gt;nanometer scale. In this project, a scalable process (up to tonnage quantities) using low&lt;br/&gt;cost starting materials will be developed for the production of these advanced materials&lt;br/&gt;with high performance for target electrode applications. The production process will be&lt;br/&gt;based on a unique patent-pending manufacturing route that allows the nano-structured&lt;br/&gt;carbon to be produced more economically than conventional routes. The process&lt;br/&gt;conditions will also be optimized to produce materials with the preferred properties for&lt;br/&gt;target electrode applications. The project will result in demonstration of a material with&lt;br/&gt;better performance than conventional electrodes that can be manufactured at a fraction&lt;br/&gt;of the cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be related to more efficient&lt;br/&gt;forms of energy storage and usage. The strongest value proposition is for replacement&lt;br/&gt;of precious metals for use in air electrodes used in applications ranging from fuel cells&lt;br/&gt;and batteries, to industrial electrolysis. These applications are of particular interest since&lt;br/&gt;an inexpensive and stable electrode material could allow significant efficiency&lt;br/&gt;improvements to some of the largest sources of electricity consumption in the U.S.,&lt;br/&gt;including energy storage for transportation, and chemical production. For example,&lt;br/&gt;because of their superior energy density (an order of magnitude higher), metal air&lt;br/&gt;batteries could potentially replace lithium ion batteries for use in electronic devices and&lt;br/&gt;electric vehicles. Additionally, with stable low cost air electrodes, the electrochemical&lt;br/&gt;production of chlorine (which consumes approximately 2% of electricity in the U.S.)&lt;br/&gt;would be 30% more efficient. The materials developed in this project will cost&lt;br/&gt;significantly less and last longer than current state-of-the-art materials, enabling their&lt;br/&gt;wide-scale adoption. The less expensive electrode materials will consequently reduce&lt;br/&gt;the cost of battery, fuel cell, and electrolysis technologies, ultimately enabling the&lt;br/&gt;adoption of more efficient and higher performing means of energy storage and use.</AbstractNarration>
