    <AbstractNarration>Genomic/Proteomic/Metabolomic "Omics" approaches contribute increasingly to the systems-level interrogation of fundamental biological processes. In addition, live-cell imaging, quantitative microscopy, and the computational infrastructure allow for phenotypic analyses at unprecedented scales. The objectives of this conference is to (1) provide an opportunity for show-casing cutting-edge "Omics" scientific advances; (2) motivate the traditional molecular/cell biology, biochemistry and genetics community to embrace the "Omics" resources and to adopt an integrated systems approach to solve complex biological problems; and (3) foster opportunities for networking and establishing key collaborations. Keystone Symposia is a non-profit organization that offers an ideal setting for connecting interdisciplinary and international scientific communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This symposium will bring together the leading experts representing "Omics" technologies, cell biology, structural biology, chemistry, genetics, bioinformatics and computational biology to develop and discuss new strategies to maximize the impact the "Omics" revolution on the understanding of biological systems and processes. The organizers make a significant effort to showcase the work of students, postdoctoral fellows and young investigators and include women and minorities at the organizational level, as speakers and participants.</AbstractNarration>
