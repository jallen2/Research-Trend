    <AbstractNarration>Airborne chemicals (odors) present in the environment provide a valuable source of information for animals about the suitability of food, potential mates and habitats, as well as threats such as the presence of predators. The olfactory system equips animals with the ability to detect and assess the chemical nature of their surroundings and adjust their behavior appropriately. Single odors are often complex chemical mixtures that occur together because they are released from a defined source. However, a single odor does not occur in isolation--it is intermingled with other odors in the background. This project seeks to understand the mechanisms by which the brain picks out and recognizes individual odors against a noisy backdrop. Recordings will be made from single neurons in the olfactory centers of the moth brain while manipulating the presentation of odors to the antenna (nose) of the insect. The results will provide new insights about the mechanisms by which odor information is represented by the brain and how this contributes to the recognition of complex odors as cohesive 'objects'. In addition to contributing to the basic understanding of how the sense of smell works, it is also expected that the use of pest insects, as the study system, may provide novel insights useful to the agricultural community in monitoring or disrupting insect behavior. Insects are excellent tools for introducing and engaging K-12 school children in the scientific process and such appropriate activities will form a part of the current project. High school students and undergraduates will also participate in this project.</AbstractNarration>
