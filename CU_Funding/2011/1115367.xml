    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to create multicore computer processors&lt;br/&gt;with near-mainframe reliability at commodity costs, where the primary&lt;br/&gt;costs are additional hardware and additional power consumption. Should&lt;br/&gt;this project achieve these goals, it would transform computing.&lt;br/&gt;Reliable processors would no longer be a niche product; instead, they&lt;br/&gt;would be the commodity products used in desktops, laptops,&lt;br/&gt;smartphones, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research thrusts in this project include error detection, error&lt;br/&gt;recovery, diagnosis of permanent faults, and self-repair for&lt;br/&gt;tolerating permanent faults. The end result of this project will be a&lt;br/&gt;hardware prototype of a low-cost, reliable multicore processor.&lt;br/&gt;Building an artifact is a vital part of this project for two&lt;br/&gt;reasons. First, a primary project goal is to keep power and area costs&lt;br/&gt;low, and these costs cannot be accurately determined using high-level&lt;br/&gt;simulation. Second, to transfer this technology to industry and&lt;br/&gt;transform the industry, the chip makers must be convinced that the&lt;br/&gt;solutions are viable. Chip makers have historically been&lt;br/&gt;hesitant to accept ideas that have not been built, not least because&lt;br/&gt;important issues can be hidden in a high-level simulator.</AbstractNarration>
