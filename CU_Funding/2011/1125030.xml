    <AbstractNarration>1125030&lt;br/&gt;Mozur &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Mar del Plata, Argentina in July 2012. Organized by Michael Mozur of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) in Pensacola, Florida, the institute will define and address the scope of air quality issues near mega-cities and chemical exchange between them and adjacent agro-ecosystems. Specifically, scientists and trainees from North and South America will evaluate the joint effects of mega-cities? ?metabolisms? and agriculture practices on air quality, with particular attention to be given to potential interactions among the two pollution sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PASI addresses a global concern that presents significant public policy dilemmas for local leaders and environmental managers in affected areas. The international scope of the participants and the plan to encourage collaborative research to address the above issues will represent significant multidisciplinary contributions to tackling this important challenge, even beyond the Americas region. This PASI will integrate research communities that in the past had emphasized agricultural or urban air quality separately, thereby fostering the development of successful hypothesis-driven research.</AbstractNarration>
