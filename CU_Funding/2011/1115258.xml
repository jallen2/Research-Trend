    <AbstractNarration>The 2011 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on High Temperature Corrosion will focus on scientific themes related to discovery and modeling of phenomena associated with the exposure of materials (including coatings) to extremes of temperature and environment. The stability of phases, interfaces, and microstructure will be considered. Reaction pathways in single- and multi-reactant systems, and fundamental coupling of mechanically and chemically driven processes that affect the growth and integrity of protective surface products are also current topics. The fundamental knowledge and associated modeling and engineering developments that come out of the scientific discourse and exchange of ideas at the GRC is essential in making progress towards solving problems associated with high temperature materials for efficient energy generation and conversion, as well as global security and space exploration. Invited presentations by experienced and emerging scientists with expertise in the areas described above, and in the application of advanced experimental and modeling approaches, will cover recent work. These presentations will be supplemented by posters on more specific topics related to similar themes. Ample time will be provided for discussions and informal information exchanges to stimulate ideas and expose promising directions for high temperature corrosion science and associated materials development and protection. For the first time, the 2011 GRC on High Temperature Corrosion will sponsor a GRS for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers on the preceding weekend to foster exchanges of ideas among young and established professionals at a time when advances in experimental and computational techniques provide unprecedented opportunities to make progress in corrosion science and engineering and its integration into materials design. NSF funds will be used in to assist graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, young faculty and invited speakers in the form of registration waivers and travel support. Attendees generally come from industry, academia and government and have a variety of technical interests. The organizers target the participation of women and underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
