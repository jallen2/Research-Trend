    <AbstractNarration>The novel infrared Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM), operated at the South Pole Station over last few years, has opened the door to major advancements in the scientific exploration capabilities by enabling scientists to measure gravity waves in the high-latitude Antarctic Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT, ~80-100 km altitude) region in a new spectral range that is not dominated by aurora, and with a much higher temporal resolution than was previously possible. The proposed research will continue contributing to (1) a far greater understanding of the diversity and variability of gravity waves over the Antarctic continent and their associated momentum transport in the MLT region, and (2) acquired new knowledge of the gravity waves most copious sources at the high-latitudes. Both of these areas are significant unknowns within the aeronomy community, yet they are critical to improving the understanding of gravity wave impacts on larger-scale atmospheric motions, and MLT variability. The proposed new observations will build on the AMTM initial program and will take full advantage of available wind and temperature data from other co-located instruments to quantify the wave-driven dynamics over South Pole in exceptional detail. These data will contribute significantly to the recently funded ANtarctic Gravity Wave Imaging Network (ANGWIN) program that will bring together multi-instrument measurements from eight key sites around the Antarctic continent, including South Pole, to investigate the large-field dynamics inter-annual variability of the Antarctic mesosphere and lower thermosphere at the regional and continental scales. New measurements using the AMTM that has been recently deployed at the ALOMAR Arctic Observatory in Norway will further enable scientists to compare and contrast the wave-driven dynamics of the Arctic and Antarctica MLT regions. This research also contributes to the training and education of both the young scientists and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
