    <AbstractNarration>This award, endorsed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the United States National Commission on Mathematical Instruction, the Mathematical Association of America, the American Mathematical Society and the American Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges, is supporting the participation of 50 U.S. elementary, middle, and high school mathematics teachers or supervisors, graduate students, community college/university mathematics teachers, mathematicians and teacher educators or researchers to attend the Twelfth International Congress for Mathematical Education (ICME-12) to be held in Seoul Korea from June 8 to July 15, 2012. The work and conversations of mathematics educators across the world will contribute to understanding of curricular frameworks, research on teaching and learning, the use of technology, strategies for reaching all students, educating immigrant children, and teacher education and professional development. The award will help inform and enlighten mathematics education in this country through international conversations with others confronting the same issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a special feature of the ICME program, the United States has been invited to host a U.S. National Presentation, which will include two featured sessions and a special exhibit to be open throughout the Congress for sharing artifacts of mathematics education in the United States with the international community. The award includes support for featured speakers and organizing the US National Presentation. It also includes support for the preparation and update of the State of Mathematics Education in the United States, under the leadership of John Dossey, which will be disseminated at the Congress and through NCTM.</AbstractNarration>
