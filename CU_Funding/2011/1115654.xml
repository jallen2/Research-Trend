    <AbstractNarration>The statistics department at Colorado State University has hosted the Graybill conference since 2001. The theme of the conference differs from year to year, but the objective is to bring together researchers, practitioners, and graduate students, in a relaxed and stimulating atmosphere focused on research and applications. For the 2011 conference, the theme is ``Modern Nonparametric Methods.'' The program consists of a workshop, invited plenary talks, and a poster session. The intimate nature of the conference allows for concentrated discussion and interaction among the participants, which can be especially valuable for young researchers and graduate students. The conference will continue the series of topical conferences co-sponsored by the ASA Section on Nonparametric Statistics initiated in 2007, furthering the goal of establishing a biannual conference tradition on a topic of interest to this important segment of the statistical community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continued development of practical nonparametric and semiparametric methods is crucial to the advancement of modern sciences, medicine, economics, agriculture, environment or global change, health and medicine, and many other fields. In many disciplines, the increasing availability of large amounts of high quality data has outpaced the methods available to analyze them. Flexible and robust tools such as modern nonparametric methods are increasingly necessary to address many questions encountered in practice, so that continued research in this area as well as education of future researchers will benefit the statistics discipline as well as the many disciplines that rely on it.</AbstractNarration>
