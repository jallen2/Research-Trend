    <AbstractNarration>1129412&lt;br/&gt;Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) award is made to Professors Jacob Jones and Juan Nino in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The 15 participating U.S. undergraduate students will collaborate for 10 weeks each year over a period of three years with researchers in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia. Their foreign collaborators at the School are Professor Mark Hoffman and his colleagues at the many labs within the School. The proposed program will educate and train the undergraduate students on topics related to materials for energy technologies. Energy production, storage, conversion, and efficiency are key strategic areas for the U.S. and the World. Examples of the areas the students will be involved in include thermoelectric materials for thermal energy conversion, piezoelectrics for energy transduction, metal hydrides and battery materials for energy storage, and lightweight metals for energy efficiency. The student?s individual projects will reinforce personal responsibility while the group experience is fostered by the overall research theme. The proposed work will develop human capital in the sustainable energy sector and will engage international collaboration to promote progress on sustainable energy solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is sufficient overlap of interests between researchers in the U.S and Australia to indicate that they can successfully pursue the activities proposed, and that the interaction will benefit both sides. The University of New South Wales is one of Australia?s leading research and teaching institutions and consistently ranks high in international university rankings. The students will also have use of the neutron diffraction instruments available at the nearby Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). This IRES project will provide the students with additional academic and cultural experiences, and also promote teaching, training, and learning. It is anticipated that the students will maintain contact with the Australian collaborators for additional research projects in the future. Underrepresented groups will be included when the selection of students is made each year.</AbstractNarration>
