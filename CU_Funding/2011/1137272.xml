    <AbstractNarration>1137272 &lt;br/&gt;This project supports a cooperative research project by Dr. Kendra Sharp, Oregon State University, Corvallis and Dr. Ahmed Sohail and others at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) in Islamabad, Pakistan. They plan to study The PI will conduct preliminary research in collaboration with. They plan to work on finding the parameters that influence the success of micro-hydro power systems, especially for Pakistan where water networks depend on snow melting and rapid flow because of topographical features. They plan to develop the results into a full research proposal to be submitted to NSF or to the US-Pakistan S&amp;T program funded by the State Department. The long-term research objective and expected long-term scientific contribution, is to develop scientific tools for the assessment of current and future small-scale hydro power potential in a defined region with an emphasis on the response to changing (decadal scale) climate. While Pakistan is the specific geographic focus of the proposed work, the present proposal could be viewed as a template for the study of other regions as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The PI has correctly identified a need for undertaking long-term assessment of micro-hydroelectric potential, and proposes activities for providing technical support to undertake such an assessment. She has the necessary background to undertake the proposed activities, and she has demonstrated experience working in Pakistan very recently, and has developed contacts that are necessary to completing the project. The expertise of Sharp and Sohail are complementary, to perform preliminary analysis and long-term evaluation of micro-hydroelectric power potential in Pakistan, seeking sufficient and spatially high-resolution regional data regarding spatial and temporal variation in precipitation and temperature. They want to eventually map locations of all potential micro-hydro sites in Pakistan. Micro-hydro is an important technology in the developing world, especially in mountainous regions such as northern Pakistan, Nepal and Afghanistan. The proposal is timely and points out the complexity of pinpointing micro-hydro sites, including the effect of climate change on water resources and their distribution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The project would support of graduate and undergraduate training, help develop a collaborative relationship between OSU and NUST with the potential for ongoing exchange of students and faculty. The project includes outreach in terms of a workshop, and can add to educational material for use in undergraduate or graduate education at OSU. The students could get some interesting experience. It will bring together, in an educational context, aspects of the study of climate change effects and renewable energy. The impact of electricity availability would be significant to the affected populations.</AbstractNarration>
