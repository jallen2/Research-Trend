    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1127689&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kandilkar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to host a conference on Microscale and Nanoscale transport in Edmonton, Canada. The budget is to support the travel of keynote speakers, new faculty, post docs and graduate students. Microscale and Nanoscale transport represent areas that are expected to transform in a fundamental way many applications for which the current solutions are either non-existent or are too expensive. Examples include electronic cooling, micro reactors, heat exchangers etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned conference provides a unique forum for interdisciplinary researchers to exchange ideas and come up with novel techniques. The previous meetings have resulted in a number of NSF supported research themes, and have developed a large number of young researchers to participate in this exciting new technology frontier. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF grant will support bringing a number of prominent as well as emerging researchers to this conference, and will provide exciting new ideas that are expected to culminate into further advancements in this field.</AbstractNarration>
