    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to understand the effect of student motivation and intention on conceptual understanding; conceptual understanding is important for engineering practice and innovation. The study will look broadly at students using a national survey which is followed by real time data collection; the project will develop new ways to collect data using smart-phone "apps". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will occur when the results are translated into classroom practice at multiple institutions through partnerships with engineering faculty members. The project will broadly disseminate the results to multiple audiences using a range of media. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
