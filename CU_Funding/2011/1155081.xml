    <AbstractNarration>Geothermal at the Environmental, Energy and Economy Nexus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Holbrook, University of Texas, Arlington&lt;br/&gt;Walter Snyder, Boise State University&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Moore, EGI, University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1138567&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop to be held November 6-8 in Salt Lake City Utah will address the fundamental aspects of basic research that are needed to facilitate the tapping of the vast geothermal resources ambient to sedimentary basins. The workshop will address the physical science, engineering, computational, and educational challenges inherent to developing this sustainable energy supply. The workshop is intended to identify a way forward that can be used to organize these broad-ranging communities toward effective solutions. The workshop will be truly cross-disciplinary and cross-communities involving the geosciences, engineering, and cyberinfrastructure. It will also include representatives from industry because it is industry that must be able to use the outcomes of NSF research to bring geothermal energy online. Finally, there will be a concerted effort to address the education and outreach opportunities associated with this multi-community effort.The workshop will provide a road map for how NSF's community, through fundamental research, facilities development, and education, can help make the vast geothermal potential of sedimentary basins a significant part of the nation's renewable energy portfolio. The workshop will evaluate methods for practical transfer of findings in science and engineering toward reduction of economic risks and will evaluate means for building the educational infrastructure to support this sustainable energy industry. The findings of the cross disciplinary team of experts will be summarized in a document that will be dispersed to NSF and energy stakeholders as a roadmap toward meeting critical needs for practical use of geothermal energy.</AbstractNarration>
