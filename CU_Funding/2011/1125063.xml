    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The FASEB summer research conference on "Mobile DNA in Mammalian Genomes" will take place in Snowmass, Colorado on August 7-12, 2011. The continued development of high throughput DNA sequencing, as well as other high throughput techniques, is revolutionizing the understanding of genomics and leading to rapid advances in understanding of the interplay of mobile elements and their host genomes. Mobile elements have been shown to have a major role in the genetic instability, evolution and function of genomes. Mobile elements represent almost half of mammalian genomes, and therefore often represent confusing and difficult to analyze portions of these genomes. As in previous years, sessions will focus on all of the major types of mobile elements found in mammals, as well as their evolution, and impact on genomic structure and function. This year will specifically highlight the importance of comparative genomics and epigenetics to the mobile element field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Bringing scientists together in this area is critical to the exchange of new information to the education of young scientists on the unique aspects of this field. Emphasis has been placed on including younger scientists among the speakers and on encouraging female scientists, students and postdoctoral researchers to attend. All attendees will have the opportunity to present their work at either a poster or a talk. This year there will also be a 'meet the speaker' session to provide young scientists with dedicated time to meet and discuss science with successful senior scientists and luminaries in the field. The conference format and location are designed to foster scientific exchange among participants. A special issue in the new journal, Mobile DNA, has been proposed to help disseminate our results more broadly. Analysis of mobile elements using bioinformatics approaches has been a particularly rich area of research and is especially effective as a research and teaching tool within an undergraduate environment. Thus, a number of meeting participants will be from institutions with heavy undergraduate exposure, and many opportunities will continue to develop to engage students in this field.</AbstractNarration>
