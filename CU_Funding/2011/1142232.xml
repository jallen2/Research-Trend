    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a&lt;br/&gt;system that allows for rapid detection and measurement of the concentration of metal ions in water with a&lt;br/&gt;view towards application of this system to monitoring water being released into environmental waters by&lt;br/&gt;industrial companies. Companies discharging water into the environment maintain wastewater treatment&lt;br/&gt;facilities, which frequently use chemicals to remove pollutants from wastewater. Controlling the&lt;br/&gt;efficiency of the treatment process requires real-time monitoring of the treated water. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;system will be capable of providing this capability, which will allow for optimum use of treatment&lt;br/&gt;chemicals ? currently treatment chemicals are used in excess to account for potentially large&lt;br/&gt;concentration changes of the target pollutant to be removed. Thus, a real-time sensor system reduces both&lt;br/&gt;environmental impact and cost of treatment. The technology employs optical fibers, which are&lt;br/&gt;chemically modified with sensor molecules whose luminescence properties change in the presence of the&lt;br/&gt;target pollutant.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are that this technology for real-time monitoring is not&lt;br/&gt;only capable of meeting a critical need for real-time wastewater-treatment process control, but can&lt;br/&gt;potentially address a range of monitoring tasks requiring a robust, portable, and field-deployable&lt;br/&gt;measurement system while offering significant cost advantages compared to existing laboratory-based&lt;br/&gt;systems. Thus, the impact of this project is beyond the initially targeted application to environmental&lt;br/&gt;monitoring in general, exploiting the capability of the technology to accommodate sensors for a variety of&lt;br/&gt;pollutants.</AbstractNarration>
