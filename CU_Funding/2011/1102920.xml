    <AbstractNarration>1102920&lt;br/&gt;Kane Caroline&lt;br/&gt;Cell Biology Education: Increasing Participation &amp; Educating Students &amp; Postdocs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. The ASCB Annual Meeting offers undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows a unique opportunity to see the breadth and depth of modern cell biology. Through presentation opportunities, onsite feedback from more senior scientists, oral and poster scientific presentations by others, workshops and Working Groups (tackling particularly difficult problems in biology), and multiple networking and discussion opportunities (including the new Graduate School Fair and senior scientist-facilitated, topic-based Science Discussion Tables), travel awardees will improve their understanding of cell biology, its processes, and potentials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. Travel awardees who would otherwise not have been able to attend the ASCB Annual Meeting will get both the ?big picture? in core cell biology topics at Symposia, and a more in depth understanding of a variety of topics at Special Interest Subgroups, Minisymposia, Working Groups, and Poster Sessions. In special poster sessions (e.g., undergraduate, minority) and events, Travel awardees will advance their knowledge and understanding of techniques, including approaches for education and career development. These events include the Women in Cell Biology Network Reception, Minority Affairs Committee Mentoring Symposium, Career Discussion Roundtables, and Workshops. By increasing their scientific literacy and expanding their networks, Travel Awardees are pointed to potential mentors, instructed in public outreach, and provided tools to use as educators.</AbstractNarration>
