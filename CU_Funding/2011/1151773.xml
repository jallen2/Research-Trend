    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports the research group of Dr. Richard Hooley of the University of California-Riverside to create new water-soluble functional synthetic receptors via metal-ligand based self-assembly and investigate their application towards molecular recognition and supramolecular catalysis. This research aims to address one of the main deficiencies faced by current synthetic receptors when compared to enzymes; the inability to present a functional group towards a guest bound on the interior of the cavity. The synthetic route to the metal-ligand clusters is modular and easily tunable, allowing access to a wide scope of introverted groups. By orienting functional groups towards the bound guest, selective substrate recognition and supramolecular catalysis will be enhanced. The presence of chiral species, hydrogen bond donors or nucleophiles on the interior of the clusters allows a number of novel receptor properties to be studied. In addition, by positioning catalytically active groups in close proximity with bound substrates, biomimetic reactions and catalysis are possible. NMR spectroscopy will be used to investigate guest binding, ligand exchange and reaction kinetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will extend the capabilities of synthetic host molecules in a number of fields including molecular recognition and catalysis and will introduce new avenues of research in biomimetic organic chemistry. This interdisciplinary project will offer a stimulating research environment for the education and training of students, including members of underrepresented groups. In addition, this research is integrated with an educational component that aims at increasing retention of undergraduate students (and especially underrepresented minorities) in STEM fields by engaging students through the use of collaborative problem-based case studies in the lower division organic chemistry course sequence.</AbstractNarration>
