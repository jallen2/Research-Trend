    <AbstractNarration>This dissertation project aims to understand how different regulatory institutions interact. It&lt;br/&gt;will examine the following research question: "Why has the European Union (EU) responded to&lt;br/&gt;existing private environmental regulation in different issue areas in diverse regulatory ways?"&lt;br/&gt;Private environmental regulation in this project refers to voluntary certification and eco-labeling&lt;br/&gt;programs developed by non-state actors (industry organizations; firms; non-governmental&lt;br/&gt;organizations) to induce corporate environmentally friendly behavior. By examining EU&lt;br/&gt;responses to private regulation in four issue areas (organic agriculture, biofuels, fisheries, and&lt;br/&gt;fair trade) this research will explain why in some cases the EU has responded strongly by&lt;br/&gt;developing its own public certification program, while in other cases it has decided not to&lt;br/&gt;intervene at all, or only in a very limited way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By examining the historical co-evolution of public policy and private regulation in these issue&lt;br/&gt;areas, and by analyzing the decision-making processes of the EU's regulatory responses, this&lt;br/&gt;study will identify the causal mechanisms and processes that can explain the observed&lt;br/&gt;variation. Through in-depth, semi-structured interviews I will gather original data from EU&lt;br/&gt;officials and decision-makers, EU-level and national interest and advocacy groups,&lt;br/&gt;representatives from private environmental regulatory programs, issue experts and academics.&lt;br/&gt;These data will be complemented with data on the decision-making processes, which will be&lt;br/&gt;gathered during desk research and from notes and documents obtained from interviewees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation's main intellectual contribution is its focus on an unexplored dependent&lt;br/&gt;variable, namely the regulatory responses of public authorities to private environmental&lt;br/&gt;regulation. This study will contribute to the nascent research on the interaction between public&lt;br/&gt;and private regulation and on the role of non-state actors in politics more broadly. Even though&lt;br/&gt;this dissertation will be limited to environmental issue areas, it is expected that the conclusions&lt;br/&gt;are generalizable to other issue areas as well. It is not expected, in other words, that the&lt;br/&gt;particular characteristics of the environmental issues determine public responses to private&lt;br/&gt;regulation, but rather that more general factors, such as the specific features of private&lt;br/&gt;regulatory programs and corporate involvement in these programs, explain public authorities'&lt;br/&gt;responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Private actors are currently using certification and labeling programs to address environmental&lt;br/&gt;and social problems in an increasingly diverse range of issue areas. This research will contribute&lt;br/&gt;to generating policy relevant knowledge on how public authorities can attain a better&lt;br/&gt;integration of public and private policy instruments. Furthermore, understanding the way&lt;br/&gt;public policy interacts with private regulatory programs will generate useful information for&lt;br/&gt;initiators of such programs regarding their design and functioning.</AbstractNarration>
