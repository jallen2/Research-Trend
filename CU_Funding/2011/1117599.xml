    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1117599 PI: Cosgriff-Hernandez, Elizabeth ORG: Texas A&amp;M &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Biomaterials Day at Texas A&amp;M University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Biomaterials Day at Texas A&amp;M University is to enhance networking between academic and industrial sectors and increase student exposure to exciting biomaterials research. The meeting program will include a keynote lecture and two invited talks by leading biomaterials scientists. Oral presentations from both academic and industrial researchers will showcase ongoing research and promote collaboration and knowledge exchange between institutions and industry. Finally, abstracts will be solicited for an afternoon poster session that will provide a venue for student research presentations and networking. Judges will select poster award recipients in each student category (Undergraduate, Graduate) which will be presented at the banquet. This one-day symposium will be held at the Annenberg Presidential Conference Center in College Station, Texas, which provides lecture/banquet halls, support staff, and catering. NSF support will go entirely toward rental of facilities for the event. Other sponsors are the Texas A&amp;M Departments of Chemical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering and the Society for Biomaterials. Events of this sort introduce students to the excitement of the biomaterials field and help them in formulating career decisions.</AbstractNarration>
