    <AbstractNarration>This project is implementing an inquiry-based biology laboratory module and determining whether it is effective and transferable across diverse educational environments. The module is composed of a series of experiments and exercises that navigate students through a UV-mutagenesis screen in search of an understanding for how cells monitor their genomic integrity. The module is being implemented within three different educational environments: 1) an introductory-level biology course at a public, primarily undergraduate university (PUI) with less selective admission criteria, 2) the equivalent (i.e. transferable) introductory-level biology course at a community college, and 3) the curriculum of a mathematics and science secondary teacher training program. Assessments that measure learning gains, student perception and course completion rates are being conducted in all three settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is enhancing the research and education infrastructure of a public PUI, a community college, and a mathematics and science secondary teacher training program through the acquisition of equipment and the development of new skills. Scientist-teacher partnerships are developing, and these partnerships allow community college faculty and prospective secondary mathematics and science teachers to engage in scientific inquiry. The PUI faculty are developing a better understanding for the needs of community college transfer students and building relationships with the future local high school mathematics and science teachers. All course materials and findings are accessible and freely available via a website and the BEN portal, while research findings are being presented at national conferences and published in science education and research journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education</AbstractNarration>
