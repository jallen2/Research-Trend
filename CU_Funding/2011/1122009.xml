    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This FASEB conference will be held in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, on July 24-29, 2011. The 2011 Conference on Genetic Recombination and Chromosome Rearrangements will be the fourteenth in a series of highly successful bi-annual conferences devoted to these topics. Genetic recombination plays a key role in molding genome structure in all living organisms and is required to maintain genome integrity. The global objective of the conference is to bring together workers at the forefront of all aspects of genetic recombination to present new results and to promote discussion between researchers using different techniques and experimental systems. In the program for the 2011 conference, every effort is being made to balance organismal systems, homologous/specialized recombination, and mechanistic/biological studies. The organizers have recruited eight leaders in the field to chair the sessions; the session chairs, in consultation with the organizers, have invited outstanding speakers representing diverse approaches and experimental systems. This conference aims to join approximately 200 investigators studying many diverse aspects of genetic recombination, in a range of biological systems and with different experimental approaches. Presentations will introduce new and unpublished work on timely questions in the field and will include discussion from all participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;Every effort has been made to include female and junior investigators as invited speakers; in addition, several slots will be allocated to talks selected from abstracts with the expectation these will be given to junior investigators. Four of eight session chairs are women and about 30% of speakers on the preliminary program are women.</AbstractNarration>
