    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14 July 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1119881&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Miami&lt;br/&gt;PI: R. Kniffin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests two Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V WALTON SMITH which is operated by the University of Miami; namely conversion of one trawl winch and drum to 3/8" wire rope and a new Oily Water Separator. These items will either improve safety, enhance the science support capability, and/or allow the vessel to meet current regulatory requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V WALTON SMITH supports federally funded scientific research in the southern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, and educational cruises. The WALTON SMITH is scheduled to complete approximately 50 NSF sponsored days in 2011.</AbstractNarration>
