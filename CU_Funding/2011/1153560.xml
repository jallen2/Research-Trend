    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical modeling and analysis can give insight and better understanding into the dynamics of biological populations. The theory and application of mathematical models have proved useful for the purpose of providing a logical structure within which to synthesize knowledge, test assumptions, and make predictions about the dynamics of biological populations with regard to epidemiological problems. Models have provided the impetus and means for researchers to study increasingly complex and important questions in these disciplines. The Third International Conference on Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Populations in Biological Systems is being held in San Antonio, Texas, in October 2011. This conference brings together expert researchers for the purpose of enhancing interdisciplinary collaborations that will raise the derivation and analysis of mathematical models in these biological disciplines to a new level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of this conference is on ecology and evolution, including ecological and evolutionary problems in related fields, such as environmental science, epidemiology, etc. Among the participants are researchers working on model derivation and analysis, data testing, and model simulations in these fields. Plenary speakers are encouraged to give surveys of the current state of the research in their field of study and suggest new directions of research and opportunities are provided for other participants to present their latest findings and results of current projects.</AbstractNarration>
