    <AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to investigate a set of fundamental dynamical processes in the Arctic Ocean where the â-effect is small and the western ocean boundary is absent. Results will contribute to understanding a series of important issues concerning the circulation and state of the Arctic Ocean, such as: Does the Sverdrup balance hold in the Arctic? Do Rossby waves still play the central role in the spin up of an oceanic gyre in the Arctic? How does the ocean respond to changes in wind near the North Pole where Rossby waves are supposed to be nonexistent or stagnant? What role do eddies play in the potential vorticity balance? How does the ocean spin up to a quasi-equilibrium state if there is no western ocean boundary? Do winds or thermohaline factors dominate and shape the arctic?s ocean circulation? Why does the Atlantic water penetrate to the Arctic Ocean? Does it go to the Arctic to replace surface water forced by winds to go out of the Arctic (wind-driven theory) or in order to satisfy salt and heat balances (thermohaline theory)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An accepted theory of ocean circulation has been developed over the past century based on studies of the subtropical and tropical gyres, such as the Gulf Stream system. The validity of the assumptions on which this theory is based is questionable in the Arctic Ocean. This study will enhance our understanding of the fundamental physics controlling Arctic Ocean circulation and our ability to predict the changes in circulation patterns that may result from changes in forcing and, hence, our ability to predict the drift of material in the Arctic Ocean.</AbstractNarration>
