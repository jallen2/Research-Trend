    <AbstractNarration>The Chem-STEM Scholars Program is recruiting 41 academically talented and financially needy students into chemistry and biochemistry over the five years of the project. Students share a common curriculum involving degree tracks meeting American Chemical Society (ACS) guidelines for a professional undergraduate education. Based on historical matriculation patterns at the university, both freshmen and sophomore entry points are being used to recruit students. Entering 2012-2016 freshmen cohorts have $5,000 scholarships available; all scholars remaining in good standing are supported for four years. 2012-2015 sophomore cohorts, comprised primarily of students from other majors or transfers, have $5,000 scholarships available; all sophomore scholars maintaining satisfactory progress are supported for three years. At the end of the project, the university is sustaining Chem-STEM scholarships for NSF-funded cohorts who have not yet graduated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is developing the best practices to recruit, engage, and retain students taking rigorous undergraduate programs. Program goals are to: &lt;br/&gt;1) provide increased professional educational opportunities in chemistry for academically talented and financially needy students through sustainable recruitment and scholarship programs; &lt;br/&gt;2) increase student retention to degree completion; &lt;br/&gt;3) improve support services through targeted academic monitoring, community building, seminars, internships, and mentoring; and&lt;br/&gt;4) matriculate 85% of scholarship students into teaching, graduate programs, or industrial scientific positions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts include: 1) student completion of academic programs involving research and internships; 2) participation of students from underrepresented groups; 3) increased involvement of industry in providing science internships; 4) dissemination of research activities to high schools; and 5) availability of Chem-STEM graduates to the state workforce. Findings achieved by students during research projects are being disseminated through presentations and publications.</AbstractNarration>
