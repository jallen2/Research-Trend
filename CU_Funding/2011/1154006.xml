    <AbstractNarration>Kutztown University of Pennsylvania offers scholarships to incoming students majoring in Environmental Science or Marine Science, according to academic talent and financial need. These students are supported to persist in their studies while developing their awareness of opportunities for careers and postgraduate study in scientific fields. Because of the interdisciplinary nature and scientific rigor of these two field-based majors, students are well-prepared to apply their knowledge in a variety of STEM areas, both academic and corporate. A large number of special opportunities target academic success (tutoring, peer- and faculty-mentoring, intensive advising, supplemental instruction), career development (seminars, Learning Community), and leadership skills (leading discussion, presenting research, active involvement in student science clubs, peer mentoring). Many of these programs are also available to students not receiving scholarships, broadening the impact of the project. It is anticipated that by the end of the project, 25 to 30 students, many of whom are from rural and industrial urban areas of eastern Pennsylvania and are from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, will benefit through scholarships and learning opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
