    <AbstractNarration>Verification is a bottleneck of crisis proportions in the design&lt;br/&gt;of the hardware and software systems society depends on. The two&lt;br/&gt;main approaches to verification are formal verification and&lt;br/&gt;testing. Formal verification has the advantage that it rules out&lt;br/&gt;the existence of any logical bugs that violate the properties&lt;br/&gt;under consideration. Unfortunately, current formal methods are&lt;br/&gt;not scalable and cannot be directly applied to entire designs. In&lt;br/&gt;contrast, testing is very scalable and is therefore the method of&lt;br/&gt;choice in practice. The disadvantage of testing is that it does&lt;br/&gt;not rule out the existence of bugs, and bugs that escape the&lt;br/&gt;testing process can lead to recalls, software crashes, and even&lt;br/&gt;the loss of life. The research proposed will make testing more&lt;br/&gt;effective by developing methods of test generation that reduce&lt;br/&gt;the probability of missing bugs while simultaneously keeping the&lt;br/&gt;number of tests generated relatively small.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is based on the new idea that tests can be&lt;br/&gt;thought of as encodings of proofs. This is a fundamentally&lt;br/&gt;different way of viewing testing, which is traditionally thought&lt;br/&gt;of as a method for sampling the space of all possible system&lt;br/&gt;behaviors. The research will explore several potentially&lt;br/&gt;tranformative directions. The first is that one can effectively&lt;br/&gt;generate small and complete test sets, i.e., tests sets that rule&lt;br/&gt;out the existence of bugs. Another direction is that testing&lt;br/&gt;regimes can be compared by checking to see which lead to test&lt;br/&gt;sets that are closest to encoding relevant proofs. A third&lt;br/&gt;direction is to establish strong connections that bridge the gap&lt;br/&gt;between formal verification and testing. Finally, the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will lead to the development of efficient algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;test generation that will be applied to a range of important&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in hardware and software verification.</AbstractNarration>
