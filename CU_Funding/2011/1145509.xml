    <AbstractNarration>Modifications of DNA without any change to the sequence of genes known as epigenetic effects, play important roles in gene expression and allow an organism to adapt to its environment. In the nervous system these non-coding changes to DNA, such as addition of a methyl group, can affect behavior and learning. In the honey bee it was found that aggressive behavior shows a paternal effect, suggesting that some genes inherited from the father are expressed at a different level than genes that are inherited from the mother possibly due to modifications of the DNA. It has been theorized that parent-of-origin effects on gene expression may be more common in social insects because families have one mother and many fathers, and these effects may play a role in many social behaviors in honey bees. This project will use sequencing of gene products in families of bees from specific genetic crosses to determine which honey bee genes have expression that is influenced by whether they are inherited from the mother or the father. The results will aid in the identification of genes that influence specific behaviors such as aggression and provide a better understanding of epigenetic processes in animals. Honey bees are important pollinators for our food crops and a greater understanding of honey bee behavior is important to apiculture. Additionally this project will train a postdoctoral researcher, undergraduate and graduate students in cutting edge genetic techniques thus producing future researchers for this important beneficial insect. Information will also be provided to the public through websites and the popular press.</AbstractNarration>
