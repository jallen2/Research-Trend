    <AbstractNarration>The US-India Workshop on Biocomputing brings together leading researchers working in the areas of Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, and Computer Science from both the US and India---providing a forum for discussion of current research trends in the areas of biotechnology and bioinformatics. A staggering volume of data continues to grow in the fields of genomics, proteomics, and systems biology, as new data collection technologies continue to evolve. Thus, bioinformatics and biotechnology have emerged as complementary tools to biologists---assisting them in their efforts to understand biological processes, improve agricultural products, discover new drugs, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research presentations focusing on regulatory networks, structural informatics, protein interaction networks, microarrays, text mining of biological literature, and synthetic biology by the invited speakers from both the US and India will spark discussions on open problems and research challenges, advancing the field of Biocomputing. This workshop will provide ample time for researchers to interact closely and exchange ideas for future collaborations. Collaborations that may evolve from this workshop will lead to joint research projects and short-term visits by faculty and students?ultimately leading to economic, scientific, and cultural engagements for both countries.</AbstractNarration>
