    <AbstractNarration>Animals constantly face challenges in their environment, which in part lead to dynamic and complex patterns of locomotion as well as innovations that allow animals to move more effectively in their natural habitat. One notable and extremely interesting innovation is the complex adhesive system of many geckos. Geckos are remarkable in their ability to climb vertically and sometimes in an upside-down posture. This biological adhesive system has inspired the development of gecko-like robots, adhesives, and even gloves. Although the microstructure and dynamics of the adhesive system have recently been examined, little is known about how and when this system is used and what impact it has on the mechanics and neuromuscular control of locomotion. In addition, little is known about how geckos move in their natural habitat and how the diversity in toe morphology (bearing the adhesive system) relates to ecology and biomechanics. This project is focused on illuminating the functional consequences of morphological and ecological disparity in geckos, and, more generally, will assess the evolution of function across disparate groups of geckos. The researchers will integrate approaches and knowledge from biomechanics, ecology, comparative methods, and physiology to examine locomotion in geckos. Both fieldwork in Africa and laboratory experiments involving sophisticated techniques and equipment such as force plates, electromyography, high-speed video cameras, and micro imaging will be employed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to propelling the understanding of gecko locomotion, utilizing an integrative approach that incorporates field and lab studies will greatly enhance the training of young scientists, including a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students in the United States and Africa, and undergraduates. Trainees will have opportunities to learn sophisticated laboratory techniques, as well as gain valuable field experience. The students and postdoctoral fellow will present their work at international scientific meetings and publish their work in tier one journals. They will ultimately gain the independence, experience, and skills necessary for a successful academic career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific impacts of this work will be wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. For example, it is likely that species occupying habitats with drastically different surface textures will also exhibit differences in macro and micro-morphology. By knowing what morphology best suits a given surface texture, engineering groups could design surface-specific adhesives that mimic the gecko adhesive system. In addition, understanding the neuromuscular control and mechanics during locomotion in an animal with an adhesive system will also provide insight into the control that is necessary for gecko-inspired robots.</AbstractNarration>
