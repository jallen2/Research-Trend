    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a program on polymer self-assembly of directed hybrid nanostructures the PI will pursue the synthesis, characterization and structure-property correlation studies for novel classes of nanostructured amorphous, polycrystalline and single crystal materials with expitaxial relations to their substrates. Networked morphologies are targeted as obtained from self-assembly of ABC triblock terpolymers used as structure directing agents for inorganic materials including oxides, metals and semiconductors. The aim of the proposed program is to understand the underlying fundamental chemical, thermodynamic, and kinetic formation principles enabling generalization of results over a wider class of materials systems. The research includes synthesis of all necessary organic/polymer and inorganic components, characterization of assembly structures using various scattering and electron microscopy techniques, study of specific properties, and investigation of optoelectronic devices. Interdisciplinarity will be a central feature of the effort. The project will also involve extensive interactions with several researchers at Cornell and abroad (Cambridge and Oxford Universities, UK) who have complementary expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to study the fundamental principles for successfully nanostructuring various materials such as oxides, metals, and semiconductors with the help of specially designed polymers. These polymers should enable assembly of highly complex structures. If successful, this program will have significant impact in a broad range of areas from microelectronics to energy conversion and storage enabled by novel ways to organize matter into nanostructures with functionalities not previously available. The program will promote an interdisciplinary way of teaching, training, and learning for students at all levels. It will further involve the participation of underrepresented groups, enhancement of the infrastructure for research and education, and industrial outreach. The PI will work with high school teachers in a nearby school district to promote learning and understanding related to materials science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
