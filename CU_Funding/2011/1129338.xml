    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to introduce writing exercises into engineering statics courses to improve foundational knowledge in this engineering gateway course. The project team has demonstrated preliminary results that show promise for using explanatory writing as a method to help students learn conceptual and procedural aspects of statics. The project includes both fundamental research on this approach that is well-grounded in existing literature, and a plan to disseminate the results so that other engineering programs can easily adopt the practices developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to help students learn the engineering concepts in statics. Statics is a "gateway" course in engineering; i.e. one that is taken by most engineering students and is often a key factor in determining students' progress in completing an engineering degree. Thus developing more effective methods of teaching statics can result in improved retention in engineering and a reduction in the time it takes students to earn an engineering degree. The approach taken by the project team will require few changes in existing courses, and thus can be broadly adopted at a diverse range of institutions.</AbstractNarration>
