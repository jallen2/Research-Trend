    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Athienou Archaeological Project (AAP) has been investigating long-term culture change in central Cyprus since 1990 (supported by NSF from 1995 to 2008, and again from 2012 - 2014). This multidisciplinary undertaking combines field training in archaeological methods (excavation and survey) with analyses of the natural and cultural contexts of ritual and secular use of the ancient and modern landscape. The specific problem that guides the Project's research agenda is the degree to which rural areas were assimilated into regional and interregional economic, political, social, and religious networks of exchange. A focus on regions is essential to such considerations since it is only by comparison to events in other parts of Cyprus and elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean that past and present human activity in the area of Athienou makes sense. While the Athienou region and in fact, Cyprus as a whole may be viewed as marginal in the evolution of western civilization, the Project area can, nonetheless, be seen as a laboratory for the study of culture change. Ten outstanding undergraduate students are provided with the opportunity to join AAP and (1) receive instruction in survey and excavation techniques (e.g., remote sensing, computer-assisted mapping), record keeping and data management, and artifact analysis, (2) attend lectures taught by specialists on archaeological methods and theory and the cultural history of Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean, (3) visit archaeological sites and museums on the island, (4) plan and complete an independent research project bearing on the work of AAP, and (5) live in Athienou and learn about life in modern Cyprus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of their AAP experience, students find themselves at the intellectual vortex created by the presence of many international scholars in the fields of Social Sciences, Humanities and Natural Sciences, working towards a common goal. The students benefit enormously through their interaction with different disciplines and learn the value of cooperation across disciplines. By the end of the 7-week experience with AAP, students gain a deep understanding of archaeological theory and field research, including most recent approaches to data collection and analysis. Their undertaking of independent research, sometimes on artifacts brought to light by themselves, with the aim of publication, gives them confidence in their abilities to work as scientists, and accomplish set goals. This mentally and physically demanding program prepares students for productive careers in archaeology or related fields, or for that matter, in whatever other career they ultimately pursue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AAP's broader impact to society is manifest in many ways. Through site tours, public lectures and articles in the media, the Project contributes immensely in educating people on the importance of archaeological remains and helps stem illicit looting. AAP's impact is further manifested by the recent conversion of portions of the archaeological site into an archaeological park and the paving of the road signs and all leading to it. Moreover, 2009 saw the inauguration of a state-of-the-art Municipal Museum at Athienou which houses scores of artifacts unearthed by AAP (http://www.athienoumuseum.org.cy/). Like AAP, the Museum has primarily educational objectives, as attested by visits of thousands of school children in the short time since its inauguration, and is a source of great pride among the locals. The cross-cultural interaction between the local population and AAP staff and students helps forge lasting friendships and bridges of understanding between Cyprus and the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International Component: The NSF Office of International Science and Engineering has co-funded this award.</AbstractNarration>
