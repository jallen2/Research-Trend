    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Sarah Pabian is "From soils to songbirds: movement of calcium, aluminum, and mercury in food webs of forest ecosystems impacted by air pollution." The host institutions for this fellowship are Syracuse University, Colorado State University, and State University of New York College of Environmental Science &amp; Forestry, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Charles Driscoll, Colleen Web and Colin Beier. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Air pollution, including acid rain and mercury deposition, has the potential to negatively affect entire forest ecosystems through decreased availability of calcium and increased availability of aluminum and mercury in forest soils. These three changes in soil conditions could act synergistically to negatively affect songbird reproduction. However, little is known about the availability of aluminum and mercury in terrestrial systems, their interactions with calcium supply, or the mechanisms of trophic transfer to songbirds. Also, modeling these complex interactions requires advanced mathematical and analytical techniques. This research evaluates and compares trophic pathways for calcium, aluminum, and mercury acquisition by forest songbirds using a combination of field studies and dynamical network modeling. A better understanding of the availability and interactions among these elements permits an evaluation of the degree to which air pollution is posing threats to the health and structure of forest ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include acquiring new skills in environmental chemistry, community ecology, and mathematical modeling. In addition, the Fellow gains skills in advising graduate students, scientific outreach, and managing multidisciplinary collaborations with scientists working at different institutions. Broader impacts of the research include providing undergraduates with research opportunities and sharing results with scientific, policy, and public audiences. The Fellow uses her knowledge and enthusiasm in science to work with many different organizations, including 4-H, Women in Science and Engineering, and nature centers, to stimulate science interest in a diversity of young people.</AbstractNarration>
