    <AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative NUE in Engineering program entitled, "Collaborative Research: Cross-institutional Nano-technology Education and Workforce Training Project", at the University of Dayton and Sinclair Community College, under the direction of Dr. Andrew W. Sarangan and Dr. Surinder M. Jain. The program will focus on: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Connecting high schools, a community college, a university and selected industries. &lt;br/&gt;2) Developing alternative methods for delivering interactive nanotechnology laboratory experiences. &lt;br/&gt;3) Creating nanotechnology internship opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;4) Developing high school nanotechnology learning and awareness activities. &lt;br/&gt;5) Developing nanotechnology workshops for secondary school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase awareness of nanotechnology concepts and careers in the nanoscience industry. The multi-institutional longitudinal model, connecting high schools, a community college, a university and industry partners, will offer a model for adoption by other institutions seeking to connect secondary school students and undergraduates to an effective and affordable pathway for nanotechnology education and employment.</AbstractNarration>
