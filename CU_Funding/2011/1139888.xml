    <AbstractNarration>The University of Puerto Rico (Rio Piedras),lead institution for the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP), will administer its ninth (9th) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program at the institution during the 2011-2013 academic years. This program will provide multidisciplinary training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines at the Ph.D. Level to enable a seamless transition from the STEM baccalaureate degree to STEM graduate studies ultimately to obtain a terminal degree and enter the STEM workforce. The award supports&lt;br/&gt;twelve STEM graduate students during the 2011-2013 academic years, increasing to 106&lt;br/&gt;the total number of BD fellows supported by this alliance since the start of the NSF&lt;br/&gt;Bridge to the Doctorate Activity in 2003. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program builds on the strengths developed by the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) in several STEM fields, especially multidisciplinary fields. The recruitment plan involves strategies targeted to mainland LSAMP students as well as students from the territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eligible students must be admitted to one of the following UPR PhD programs: Biology,&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, or Chemical Physics. BD fellows will participate in the BD Support Program that was successfully implemented with the eight previous cohorts in order to enhance their academic&lt;br/&gt;preparation. Students are encouraged to complete a summer research internship at national and international strategic partner research centers of PR EPSCoR and the Institute of Tropical Ecology (ITES). The program continues to coordinate its activities with other NSF-funded projects that are managed by the Resource Center for Science and Engineering (RCSE) and by pertinent UPR graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After completing the first two years in the BD program, BD fellows apply for fellowships in the following RCSE/UPR programs: GK-12, NSF-EPSCoR IFN, NASA EPSCoR, NASA Space Grant,&lt;br/&gt;DoE EPSCoR, CREST-CATEC, and RISE. This large array of research and educational&lt;br/&gt;programs also benefit from the recruited BD fellows while they facilitate completion of&lt;br/&gt;their doctoral degree. A tracking system, designed by PR-LSAMP, documents&lt;br/&gt;participant progress, including completion of degree until they enter the workforce, and&lt;br/&gt;beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implementation of the UPR BD Activity develops a highly competitive&lt;br/&gt;STEM education and research enterprise required to advance Puerto Rico?s economic&lt;br/&gt;development and meets the national need for diverse STEM professionals. By&lt;br/&gt;increasing the number of STEM professionals, more college students, in particular&lt;br/&gt;those at 4-year colleges, where the largest population of first-generation college will be taught by PhD level professors/researchers. Moreover, the former BD fellows become role models for other students from historically underrepresented minority groups across the Nation, who become interested in pursuing STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>
