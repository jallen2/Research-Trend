    <AbstractNarration>The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Steve Sullivan to work with Dr. Prof. Stuart G. Cull-Candy at University College London, United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though subjectively unpleasant, the perception of pain to aversive stimuli is important for survival. However, pain can become maladaptive when it long outlasts the potential for harm, a condition known as chronic pain. Typically, noxious stimuli from the environment elicit electrical responses in peripheral neurons which travel to the spinal cord where the information is relayed by the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate across specialized regions called synapses. Glutamate binds and activates receptors on spinal cord neurons, which then send pain information to the brain. One mechanism of chronic pain is thought to occur when certain painful stimuli elicit long-term modifications in the distribution of glutamate receptors present in spinal cord neurons, increasing their sensitivity to minimal input for an extensive period of time. Recently, this model has appreciated an extra degree of complexity in the discovery of auxiliary subunits, a class of proteins which interact with glutamate receptors to change their fundamental electrical properties and distribution in neurons. It has been shown that certain auxiliary subunits are required for the induction of chronic pain, but little is known about the specific role they play in determining the modifications of glutamate receptors associated with this condition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies the role of auxiliary subunits in the alterations of a particular class of glutamate receptors thought to underlie chronic pain, namely, á-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. This work entails rigorous analysis of the biophysical properties of different AMPA receptor-auxiliary complexes to "finger print" and identify those involved in chronic pain. These findings are translated to spinal cord models of chronic pain, where different pharmacological agents are tested to target the suspect AMPA-auxiliary subunit complexes, while retaining basic neural function, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work takes place at University College London, United Kingdom, one of the top institutions in neuroscience research and is part of a collaborative effort with many of the world's experts in electrophysiology, including Prof. Mark Farrant, single channel expert Prof. David Colquhoun, and pain researcher Prof. Anthony Dickenson. The host laboratory of Prof. Stuart G. Cull-Candy is a leader in AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits. The experimental know-how and collaborations acquired during this time course will broaden electrophysiology and neuroscience research in the United States when Dr. Sullivan returns to establish his own laboratory studying glutamate signaling.</AbstractNarration>
