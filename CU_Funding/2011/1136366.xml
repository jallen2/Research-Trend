    <AbstractNarration>The MUST STEM Fellows Program merges the best elements of Cleveland State University's (CSU) existing Master's of Urban Secondary Teaching (MUST) program with the CSUTeach model. It will support 24 Fellows, in 4 cohorts of 6 students each, with full tuition scholarships over the 5-year period of the award, beginning in summer 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Features retained from each program include the following: A compact 14-month program that results in a Master's degree in education and a teaching license (MUST); Understanding urban teaching through a STEM lens (MUST and CSUTeach); Working with highly skilled STEM master and mentor teachers in STEM-focused urban high schools (CSUTeach); Early field experiences (CSUTeach); Action research (MUST) and portfolio requirements (MUST and CSUTeach); Strong collaboration between faculty in the Colleges of Science, Engineering and Education (CSUTeach)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the first graduate teacher preparation program in Ohio to utilize the UTeach model, and is poised to significantly increase the number and quality of STEM teachers entering teaching in Ohio and beyond. In addition, a strong component of this program is the potential of Cleveland State to build on the prior success of the MUST program in attracting diverse candidates to STEM high school teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project completes the transformation of Cleveland State's secondary STEM teacher education program, aligning it to the UTeach model. A unique climate for innovation and collaboration is being created around the transformed programs, which is serving as a model for and catalyst of similar transformations in STEM education across the region and state.</AbstractNarration>
