    <AbstractNarration>Methods known as 'multivariate pattern' (MVP) analysis can be used to decode the information patterns in brain activity obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, a new decoding model has to be built for each brain, because two brains (and the representational spaces they employ) are difficult to align at a fine spatial scale. As a consequence, we do not yet know if different brains use the same codes or idiosyncratic codes to represent the same things. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Drs. James V. Haxby of Dartmouth College, and Peter J. Ramadge of Princeton University, in collaboration with Michael Hanke of the University of Magdeburg (Germany), are developing new methods to discover a coding scheme that works accurately across different brains. The methods being developed align brain activity across brains by projecting individual brain data into a common, high-dimensional space. This approach allows the researchers to build models of brain representational spaces for different cortical areas that are valid both across brains and across a wide range of stimuli and cognitive states. The researchers are developing two algorithms. One is referred to as 'hyperalignment' and the other as 'functional connectivity hyperalignment.' Hyperalignment rotates the voxel spaces (i.e., the smallest units in a brain image) of individual brains into a single high-dimensional space, in which each dimension is a profile of differential responses to stimuli, that is common across brains. Functional connectivity hyperalignment aligns voxel spaces based on the functional connectivity profile (i.e., relationships among activated brain areas) for each cortical location. Functional connectivity profiles allow for models of areas that do not respond to external stimuli in a consistent manner, for example, those areas in the so-called 'default-intrinsic system' that plays a central role in social cognition. The investigators are an interdisciplinary partnership - cognitive neuroscientists and signal-processing engineers - who have been working together successfully for several years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing the computational methods to build common models of representational spaces will augment the power of brain activity decoding techniques, making it possible to investigate how finer, more detailed information is embedded in brain activity patterns, and to read out that information from functional brain imaging data. The proposed methods also will allow extension of brain decoding to the neural codes that underlie social cognition, that is, the representation of knowledge about the personal traits and mental states of others. These models also will allow investigation of how neural coding is altered within brain regions that are affected by experience, by development, and by psychopathology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience and the Office of International Science and Engineering. A companion project is being funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).</AbstractNarration>
