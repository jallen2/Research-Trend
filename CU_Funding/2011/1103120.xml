    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is to demonstrate proof-of-concept of a novel manufacturing process for cutting thin sheet and plates in a tool-less, freeformed fashion. The process, termed Electromagnetic Pulse Induced Cutting, is based on the controlled advance of a fine crack under combined electromagnetic and mechanical loading. The approach will be to utilize electromagnetic forces associated with a series of electric pulses to advance the crack front while using a mechanical load to define the crack direction. In effect, the goal is to move a crack in a highly controlled manner in virtually any direction on a sheet or plate. Conceptually, the process is akin to a microsized, tool-less, electromagnetic jigsaw with a kerf measured in microns. As part of the proposed research, the principles of electromagnetic Lorentz force generation, localized heating at the crack-tip due to current-crowding, and mixed mode fracture mechanics will be combined to derive the conditions required to advance and turn the crack using a simple experimental prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefit to society of the research will include the emergence of a new manufacturing process for precision-cutting of mesoscale thin sheets and foils of brittle, hard-to-process materials. As such, the process has the potential to serve as a new enabling technology for the nation?s manufacturing base. In addition, this project will integrate research and education by advancing discovery and understanding by graduate students at two American universities.</AbstractNarration>
