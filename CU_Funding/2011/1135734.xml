    <AbstractNarration>Abstract Proposal: OISE-1135734 &lt;br/&gt;PI/Institution: Camata, Renato., University of Alabama at Birmingham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Renato Camata from the University of Alabama Birmingham and Dr. Daniel de Florio from the Universidade Federal do ABC in São Paulo, Brazil plan to study oxide film materials with high ionic conductivity for applications in fuel cells. The proposed work will create novel thin film electrolyte materials with high ionic conductivity in the intermediate temperature range of 500 to 750&amp;#730;C. These new electrolyte materials have the potential to create solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) that surmount the reliability and cost impediments in current SOFC systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials will be fabricated as thin films at the University of Alabama and characterized at the Universidade Federal do ABC; making the experimental facilities at both universities highly complementary and ideally suited for the success of this project. Furthermore, the US PI is a known expert in the field of oxide deposition via pulsed laser which is the preferred method for this collaboration while the Brazilian PI is a well-published researcher and leader in SOFC materials. This visit will also make it possible for a US PhD dissertation student, to gain an invaluable international research experience as he works on the characterization of the thin films materials under the mentorship of both US and Brazilian experts.</AbstractNarration>
