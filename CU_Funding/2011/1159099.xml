    <AbstractNarration>The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a 24-month fellowship for Dr. Christopher Pappas from Manhattanville College located in Purchase, New York, to work with Dr. Mathieu Picardeau within the Biology of Spirochetes Unit at the Institut Pasteur located in Paris, France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid in the physiologic study of the genus Leptospira, the investigators are developing an inducible system which will be used to engineer conditional mutants of essential genes in Leptospira spp.. Further, the investigators are exploring in detail the phenotypes of previously identified transposon mutants created using the Himar1 mariner transposon system which has previously been developed within the host laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by the genus Leptospira. It is a zoonotic infection which is maintained within a mammalian reservoir. Transmission to humans can lead to severe disease manifestations, which results in fatality in over 10% of cases worldwide. The proposed projects will aid in the characterization of the physiological aspects of Leptospira spp. and thus allow greater understanding of the biology of leptospires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, this fellowship aids the study of leptospires to transcend national borders. The fellowship creates an international collaboration between Dr. Christopher Pappas of Manhattanville College and Dr. Mathieu Picardeau and other colleagues at the Institut Pasteur; a facility focused on the advancement of biological sciences and public health comprised of researchers who collaborate at the international level.</AbstractNarration>
