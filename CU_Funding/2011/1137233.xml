    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to promote student participation in the long-running ER conference series, to be held in Belgium in Oct-Nov 2011. This will be the thirtieth ER, which is promised to continue the tradition of promoting collaboration among multiple areas. ER is a leading international forum for conceptual modeling, which is an important issue for information management and integration. ER provides a unique forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary research and education in Conceptual Modeling. The proposed activities include recruiting a diverse group of US students to participate in ER, and will use the grant to help cover the cost of travel, subsistence, and registration to the ER 2011 conference for the students. Students participation of international scientific discussion forums is always an important part of their education and a great way to build a mature work force in scientific research. The project will also emphasize on recruiting under-represented groups of students in this effort.</AbstractNarration>
