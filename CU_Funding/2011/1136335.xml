    <AbstractNarration>The San Francisco State University (SFSU) Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program will increase the quality, quantity and diversity of well-prepared science and mathematics teachers in California public schools serving the State's neediest students. The project will support 28 unique scholarship recipients with 10, 3, 5, 5, and 5 new recipients in project years 1 through 5 respectively. The project builds on SFSU's successful track record of supporting future teachers entering middle school and high school and sustaining a vibrant pre-service teacher community. It leverages multiple resources to create an intensive experience based on recommendations from the research literature on the importance of professional community and the development of educational leadership. Noyce Fellows meet in regularly scheduled leadership seminars and play key roles in important national initiatives such as the Algebra Project and the Strategic Education Research Project. SFSU is recognized as one of the nation's most ethnically, culturally, and economically diverse institutions, and graduates the majority of teachers in the San Francisco Unified School District. Pre-service STEM teachers trained through the Noyce Program have a positive impact on many high-needs schools in the immediate area. The commitment of the California State University Chancellor's Office to spread the SFSU teacher development model means that insights and innovations from the Noyce Program will also be rapidly deployed.</AbstractNarration>
