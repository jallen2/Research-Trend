    <AbstractNarration>Ocean acidification and increased temperatures are projected to be the primary impacts of global climate change on polar marine ecosystems over the next century. While recent research has focused on the effects of these drivers on calcifying organisms, less is known about how these changes may affect vertebrates. This research will focus on two Antarctic fishes, Trematomus bernacchii and Pagothenia borchgrevinki. Fish eggs and larvae will be collected in McMurdo Sound and reared under different temperature and pH regimes. Modern techniques will be used to examine subsequent changes in physiology, growth, development and gene expression over both short and long timescales. The results will fill a missing gap in our knowledge about the response of non-calcifying organisms to projected changes in pH and temperature. Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national and international meetings; raw data will also be made available through open-access, web-based databases. This project will support the research and training of three graduate and three undergraduate students. As well, this project will foster the development of two modules on climate change and ocean acidification for an Introduction to Biology course.</AbstractNarration>
