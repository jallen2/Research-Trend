    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The meeting for the Ciliate Molecular Biology Conference will be held as a FASEB Summer Research Conference, July 10-15, 2011 at the Orthodox Academy of Crete, Greece. This is a major meeting of experimental biologists working with ciliated protozoa. The objectives of this meeting are to (i) disseminate new research information and ideas, (ii) share technical innovations, (iii) organize further development of community resources, and (iv) advance graduate and undergraduate research and education initiatives. Approximately 120-150 investigators from the US and other countries will come together to discuss recent scientific discoveries and technological advances, and coordinate community efforts to develop new approaches to address diverse biological questions of broad scientific interest. The primary goal of the conference is to facilitate the open exchange of unpublished research results and technological advances between investigators who are united by their use of ciliates as model organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This biannual meeting represents the most important gathering of cellular, molecular and evolution biologists working with ciliated protozoa, and plays a critical role in sustaining the vitality of this productive research community. The ciliate community promotes the participation of young scientists, women and minorities in conference programs. A longstanding goal of the conference is to promote the participation of young researchers and under-represented minorities in science (including women). A large fraction of plenary talks will be given by women, new investigators, postdocs and students. The meeting provides an excellent opportunity for junior researchers to network, share their findings, and build new collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
