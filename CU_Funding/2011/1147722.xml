    <AbstractNarration>Morphodynamics of the Madeira River: An Amazonian Anabranching Mega-River Facing Imminent Disruption&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Madeira River, the largest tributary in water discharge and sediment transport of the Amazon basin, will be dammed by the end of 2012. This project will collect hydrogeomorphologic and hydraulic information before human intervention. The main objectives are to a) analyze the fluvial morphodynamics to understand the mechanism controlling the development of anabranching patterns in this megariver (this information will serve as baseline for examination of anthropogenic effects); b) identify the geoenvironmental mosaic of the floodplain and the morphosedimentary processes controlling its evolution and architectural style, and c) provide predictive mathematical tools and generate new concepts for management of anabranching rivers. The field work in Brazil, using research vessel-based surveys from Porto Velho to Humaita, will span the Madeira's flow before regulation, with surveys during low and high water stages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a unique and last opportunity to study the dynamics and morphology of the largest tributary of the Amazon River before it is dammed. The researchers will collaborate with Brazilian colleagues on two expeditions in 2012--at low water and high water. In addition to providing rare insights into the workings of so-called "Mega-rivers", the results and data base obtained from these expeditions will be fundamental for assessing and modeling the short and medium-term impacts of the dam on the Amazon and the Amazon plume as a result of the alteration of sediment and water fluxes. The project will support the interdisciplinary education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, and its results are expected to inform Brazilian and international institutions involved in environmental management in the Amazon basin.</AbstractNarration>
