    <AbstractNarration>Characterization of the regulatory events that lead to changes in gene expression and function is key to understanding the molecular mechanisms by which biological processes are governed. To address questions aimed at defining these regulatory interactions, it is necessary to accurately quantify changes in gene expression that result in downstream effects on cell/organism function. To that end, real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis provides a method by which changes in gene expression can be quantified. This approach allows precise assessment of transcriptional targets whose gene products are responsible for modulating adaptive responses. This grant will support the purchase of a Polymerase Chain Reaction machine that will be enable real-time PCR methodology to investigate multiple projects centered on examining diverse biological processes including immunology, cell survival, inflammation, tissue repair, differentiation, and smooth muscle cell biology. Projects of note include characterization of the effects of mechanical forces and extracellular matrix interactions on modulating function of smooth muscle cells and differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells. In the area of inflammation, the processes that regulate inflammatory responses in immune cells and brain as well as the downstream transcriptional targets of immune modulators will be investigated in macrophage and glial cell lines. These studies will be aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms that result in initiation of cell survival and tissue repair in glial and neuronal cells. Finally, this technique will also be applied to study the role of the unfolded protein response during immune response, with a focus on cytokine production by B lymphocytes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment of gene expression patterns will allow the faculty at Mt. St. Mary's University to make more significant contributions to their research fields and will directly impact the training of students by enhancing the undergraduate educational experience. The current proposal describes a total of 11 research and educational projects to be carried out by four faculty members. Importantly, several of the projects address approaches for incorporation of real-time PCR methodology into both the undergraduate curriculum and outreach educational programs aimed at local high schools. This instrumentation provides a means by which to incorporate an inquiry based approach to science instruction. Rapid advances in the understanding of cellular and biochemical processes as a result of genetic and genomic research have generated considerable demand for individuals trained in biotechnology, genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology. Funds from this grant will be used to meet the challenge of improving undergraduate education in STEM areas and enhance student preparation for successful careers in the life sciences.</AbstractNarration>
