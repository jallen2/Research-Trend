    <AbstractNarration>This Noyce Phase II project continues the Noyce Phase I TEMS work currently in progress through collaboration between California State University (CSU), Chico and CSU Sacramento, in partnership with three area school districts. The Northeastern California Curriculum Committee, representing all the rural schools of Northeastern California, is also a collaborator in this project. In conjunction with other existing programs, the Noyce Scholars program has assisted Chico and Sacramento in efforts to increase the number of mathematics and science teachers they produce each year as part of a larger statewide goal of the CSU system. The project is providing scholarships to 37 preservice students at the two campuses, including both undergraduates and post-baccalaureate students. Noyce Scholars participate in enhanced and expanded activities including Hands-On Lab science teaching experiences, Project M.A.T.H. (Mathematics And Teaching on the Horizon), new courses for STEM professionals allowing them to gain teaching credentials, expanded teacher recruitment activities, expanded early field experiences for preservice teachers, and collaborative efforts with existing programs such as the Alliance for Minority Participation, the Mathematics and Science Teaching Initiative, and the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment induction programs. Mentoring and advising are also greatly expanded to insure the success of Noyce scholars from underrepresented groups. TEMS II brings the scholars and faculty from two different environments together to learn from each other, thus increasing their capacity to effectively teach populations of students throughout California. The evaluation plan is designed to be a prototype evaluation model for the California State University System, adding to the body of knowledge about widening the pipeline to the teaching profession in mathematics and science. Evaluation efforts lead to new information regarding the effectiveness of recruitment strategies and the teaching success of the Noyce Scholars once they have been teaching for one year, in comparison to new teachers who have not participated in the Noyce program.</AbstractNarration>
