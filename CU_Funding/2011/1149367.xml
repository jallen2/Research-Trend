    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program of the Division of Chemistry supports work by Professor Hao Chen at Ohio University for the development of microsecond time-resolved mass spectrometry based on ionization of a flying liquid jet generated from ultrafast mixing of reactant solutions by an ambient ionization method. The proposed method is expected to improve sampling resolution from current millisecond sampling to micro-second time resolution. The sucessful development of the described technology will facilitate the investigation of kinetics and mechanisms of fast biochemical reactions, which may lead to a better understanding of protein folding/unfolding, enzymatic catalysis and protein/DNA oxidation processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work provides research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, including members of underrepresented and disadvantaged groups. Dr. Chen is also actively involved in educational outreach activities, including ChemShows/Workshops/Seminars for pre-college students to learn about modern instrumental analysis and to develop enthusiasm for scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
