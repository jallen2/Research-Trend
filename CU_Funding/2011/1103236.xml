    <AbstractNarration>SES-1103236&lt;br/&gt;Michael Bell&lt;br/&gt;Julie C. Keller&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For decades, migration research has focused on remittances sent from immigrants abroad to their families at home. Less discussed and understood is the transnational transfer of health goods in the reverse direction. This will extend transnational migration studies by explicitly considering how the production of health spans national boundaries. This study focuses on a migration stream of workers between the dairies of western Wisconsin and workers' communities of origin in central Veracruz, Mexico to answer the following questions: 1) How does the interaction of various dimensions of social marginalization-gender, language, ethnicity, citizenship, documentation-shape migrant health practices? 2) How, and to what extent, do different levels of incorporation into receiving societies shape the transnational health practices of migrants? 3) To what extent are the transnational health practices of migrants gendered? Data used to answer these questions will be collected through one year of participant-observation methods and in-depth interviews with current dairy workers in Wisconsin and former dairy workers in Veracruz. A key theoretical part of this investigation is identifying the role of immigrant incorporation in the formation of transnational health practices, thus contributing to current sociological debates in the area of migration. Secondly, this research will contribute to the sociology of gender and health by tracing how transnational health practices are shaped by gender relations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is timely given that recent health reform and impending immigration reform will very likely affect the way immigrants experience health care access and incorporation in receiving communities. This study offers a window into the lives of migrants at the margins of society as they negotiate access to health services and rely on transnational ties to manage health problems. The results of this research will provide important information not just for scholars, but for state agencies and immigrant advocates. Reports of findings will be shared with Wisconsin state representatives and various immigrant advocacy organizations at the state and national levels. Additionally, co-investigator will maintain connections with scholars in Xalapa, Veracruz to encourage dialogue between American and Mexican scholars on migration issues. The results of the study can inform future health policy and promote international academic alliances by shedding light on how immigrants get their health needs met in a context of constrained or restricted health access.</AbstractNarration>
