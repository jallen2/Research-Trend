    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources located in Charleston, SC will host five students during a 12-week summer internship program. The Minorities in Marine and Environmental Sciences (MIMES) Program will provide a great breadth of laboratory and field-based research expertise to these undergraduate students who will be recruited from across the nation. This site has a proven track record of incorporating expert mentors, facilities, equipment and experiences from the closely situated Federal and state research institutions that comprise the Marine Resources Center at Fort Johnson, Charleston, South Carolina. Students will be required to design and complete rigorous, independent mentor-guided research projects. Furthermore, students will attend classes on statistics, scientific writing, and presentation skills to train them for successful future careers in the marine and environmental sciences. As final products of the program, students will be required to prepare both a written final report and an oral presentation on the findings from their projects. Oral presentations will be given as part of a day-long research colloquium. Following the program, students are encouraged to attend a professional meeting or conference to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
