    <AbstractNarration>1126217&lt;br/&gt;Evans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports acquisition of an ion chromatograph (IC) to support research and undergraduate education at Wheaton College, a non-Ph.D granting institution. The IC will support PI and student research that will benefit from the ability to measure low concentration (sub ppb) anions and cations in natural water samples. Example research projects that will benefit include studies of CO2 and solute fluxes from hot springs in the Nepal and the Bhutan Himalaya, examination of the impacts of sea-ice cover on biological productivity in the Amundsen Sea, and investigation of the impacts of permafrost degradation on stream and river biogeochemistry across East Siberia. The IC will also support PI high school outreach efforts using the IC through an extant Milton Academy ? Wheaton College high school environmental science summer watershed impact study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
