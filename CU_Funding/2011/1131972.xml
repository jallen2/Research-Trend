    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The meeting of the 2012 Meiosis Gordon Research Conference will be held June 3-8, 2012 at Colby-Sawyer College, New London, NY. Meiosis is specialized cell division that halves the number of chromosomes in cells to create gametes used for sexual reproduction. Meiosis underlies the genetic diversity within and among species, and meiotic mutations have a major impact on organismal fitness. A major strength of the field is that, in addition to the wide variety of approaches that are being taken to understand this critical cell division process, a large number of different model organisms are studied, including yeast, nematodes, plants, fruit flies and mammals. This meeting provides an opportunity for people studying the same process in different organisms to compare notes, and the synergism that has resulted from these interactions has greatly helped speed the advance of our understanding of meiosis. The 2012 Meiosis GRC will bring together over 150 researchers who study the cell and molecular biology, genetics, genomics, biochemistry and evolutionary biology of meiosis. All areas of meiosis will be represented at the meeting. The objectives of the meeting are as follows: 1) To provide a forum for scientific interaction in this interdisciplinary field, 2) To present the newest results in the field, 3) To introduce young researchers to the field, 4) To promote interdisciplinary discussion that will foster new approaches, concepts and ideas. The meeting will consist of nine plenary sessions. There will be a poster session and posters will be presented by graduate students, postdocs, and PIs. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Meiosis GRC is one of two regularly scheduled conferences. The Meiosis GRC has typically had the highest fraction of female participants among the Gordon Conferences. The conference organizers strive to ensure that qualified minorities can attend. This is facilitated through the Carl Storm Fellowships to self-identified members of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
