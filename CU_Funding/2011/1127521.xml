    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to&lt;br/&gt;commercialize a new process to recycle petroleum toxic wastes to clean and inexpensive&lt;br/&gt;energy. This Phase II project will scale the improved process by modifying the company?s pilot&lt;br/&gt;unit to incorporate the enhancements realized with the bench scale unit in Phase I. The basic&lt;br/&gt;SuperATR is a non&amp;#8208;catalytic process that employs a cyclic flow reactor filled with an inert packed&lt;br/&gt;bed. In the cyclic flow reactor, the direction of oxidizer/fuel mixture is periodically reversed&lt;br/&gt;producing a high temperature volume. The modifications in the Phase I project effectively&lt;br/&gt;raised the temperature even higher to make the reactor even more efficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that deteriorating qualities of oils and gases is forcing&lt;br/&gt;the petroleum sector to incur very high cost for energy and waste disposal. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;benign disposal of hydrogen sulfide costs oil refineries and natural gas processing plants $5&lt;br/&gt;billion a year. Present technologies only permit extracting the sulfur content while wasting the&lt;br/&gt;much more valuable hydrogen portion. In commercializing this technology, the value&lt;br/&gt;propositions are but not limited to:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61623; Obtain 9 billion kilowatt hours of carbon&amp;#8208;free electricity and steam inexpensively.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61623; Lowering gasoline and diesel prices, even by 1 cent per gallon, would leave $2 billion in&lt;br/&gt;the hands of Americans.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61623; Eliminate 5 million tons of greenhouse gas along with 1.5 million tons of acid rain&lt;br/&gt;pollutants by helping refineries and natural gas plants exceed environmental standards.</AbstractNarration>
