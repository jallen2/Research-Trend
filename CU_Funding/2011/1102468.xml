    <AbstractNarration>This workshop facilitates the interaction of researchers working with patent data for the purpose of scholarship on innovation policy. The focus is on advancing and sharing knowledge on a series of technical issues including name disambiguation and matching patent data to other economically-relevant data sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The workshop provides a unique forum for the exchange of patent data measurement related topics with the focus of informing innovation policy in a multi-disciplinary environment. It reduces unnecessary duplicative effort on data, measurement, and methodology, and hence increases the capacity to build both theory and for innovation policy. The workshop also advances an important SciSIP goal of creating a bridge between the academic and practitioner communities by directly engaging the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the academic community through the workshop participation of the USPTO's Chief Economist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The workshop advances the establishment of a robust data infrastructure for cumulative, transparent, and high-quality research and the ability to translate that research. It is an important step in continuing the empirical research tradition that has been built around the economic consequences of innovation. It provides an environment for high-quality high-impact research, with an emphasis on measurement. It fosters the development of a research community and research norms, and facilitates cumulative research across this community.</AbstractNarration>
