    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to organize an international workshop on Information Centric Engineering (ICE) and Cybertechnologies to be held on October 19-20, 2011, in Hersonissos, Crete, Greece. Dr. J. Cecil (Oklahoma State University, PI) and Dr. Herve Panetto (University of Nancy) will plan and conduct this workshop with the help of an organizing committee composed of faculty and researchers from universities and industrial organizations worldwide. The impact of cyber technologies and collaborative techniques on innovative engineering approaches and practices have been significant worldwide. Rapid advances in Internet technologies and Virtual Reality based engineering approaches have catalyzed the evolution of this new interdisciplinary field called "Information Centric Engineering" (ICE). This workshop's objectives are to bring together leading researchers to discuss the challenges and opportunities in ICE in the context of emerging and traditional engineering process domains. The objectives of this ICE workshop include: (i) Assess and discuss the state of the art and impact of information centric cyber engineering on nano/micro manufacturing, biomedical engineering and other emerging process domains; (ii) Identify specific "bottleneck" areas which need to be addressed by further research as well as explore ideas for future collaborative research in ICE in the context of identified process domains and subsequently develop white papers related to these findings for submission to NSF; and (iii) Discuss the creation of advanced ICE oriented Test Beds and "collaboratories" which will foster closer collaborative ties among workshop participants. This workshop seeks to stimulate discussion in the related areas that are relevant to ICE. The information related topics will include: (a) IT frameworks and distributed computing architecture and methods: relevant research related to future Internet designs with a specific emphasis on the GENI initiative, Cloud Computing, Semantic Technologies and other topics; (b) Virtual Prototyping approaches and technologies: this will encompass discussions on design of innovative Virtual Prototyping approaches; emergence of new technologies related to Virtual Reality systems (visual, haptic, etc); frameworks for collaborative immersive engineering, among others. These two ICE themes will be explored in the context of various process domains including Nano-/Micro-manufacturing, Bio Medical Engineering and other emerging process domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ICE workshop organizing committee comprising of researchers from universities and industry will be responsible for the overall organization including selection of participants, speakers and providing support to successfully conduct this workshop. The workshop participants (including faculty, researchers and doctoral students) will be selected to ensure diversity and broaden participation. Participation of Women, African American, Hispanic and other underrepresented groups will be encouraged. Paper presentations and panel discussions involving international researchers and participants will be held. The post workshop activities planned include submission of white paper reports and proposals to NSF and developing plans to create an international "collaboratory" to support research and educational activities in Information Centric Engineering. The session papers and other findings will be disseminated through conference and journal papers.</AbstractNarration>
