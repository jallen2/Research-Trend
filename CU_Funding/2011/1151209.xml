    <AbstractNarration>Finding the ketchup in the refrigerator is an everyday activity that requires the use of visual attention. When faced with a cluttered visual environment (the refrigerator), the human visual system can isolate a single, behaviorally relevant item (the ketchup). Visual attention reduces the complexity of the visual world, enabling us to successfully navigate and function without being overwhelmed with the sheer amount of visual information. But how does attention know what to select? Some theoretical accounts propose that attention is directed toward salient (conspicuous) objects, whereas other accounts state that attention is directed toward goal-relevant objects. One limitation of both of these accounts is that they fail to acknowledge that attention is typically used in conjunction with action, which involves coordinating your body with objects in the environment. The goal of this research project is to understand how the body and its position (such as an outstretched arm reaching into the refrigerator) controls visual attention. The research team will investigate this notion of 'embodied attention' using both behavioral and brain imaging (event-related potential) methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on embodied attention is important in providing a fuller account of how the mind and body interact to function successfully in the world. The research also offers the possibility to improve the lives of older adults and those with neuropsychological deficits, because these people often have impairments in both motor function and the use of attention. It may be that understanding the connection between body position and attention will lead to treatments that increase the ability of these target populations to function in the world.</AbstractNarration>
