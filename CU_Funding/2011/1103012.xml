    <AbstractNarration>ICOPS and SOFE are internationally renowned, well-attended conferences involving topics of direct interest to the NSF, Universities, DOE, Air Force, and many others. Both meetings are sponsored by the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society (NPSS). ICOPS has been held annually since 1974. Recent meetings were held in Norfolk VA (2010), San Diego CA (2009), Karlsruhe Germany (2008), Albuquerque NM (2007). SOFE has been held biennially since 1965. Recent meetings were held in San Diego CA (2009), Albuquerque NM (2007), Knoxville TN (2005).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, the conference organizers are projecting a combined attendance of approximately 800 participants. It is anticipated that 25% will be Government/Federal attendees and 75% will be non-federal attendees. The conference will include plenary, oral, and poster sessions on research in plasma science and technology and a Prize Address by the recipient of the Plasma Science and Applications Committee Award. Oral sessions will include both invited and contributed papers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of plasma technologies are expanding in many new areas for materials processing, lighting, environmental protection, and medical research and treatment. All of these technologies depend on a strong underpinning of basic research traditionally supported by the meeting. The program of the 38th ICOPS will emphasize both the traditional areas of plasma science and these new areas of growth through the plenary&lt;br/&gt;talks and the regular technical program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to partially support student travel grants, particularly for underrepresented minorities, activities to promote women in engineering, and help in awards costs. The travel grants will be awarded to those students who will be presenting papers (oral talks and posters) as first authors.</AbstractNarration>
