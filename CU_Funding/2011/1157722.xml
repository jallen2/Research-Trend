    <AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;Mitochondrial ribosomes synthesize a small, but functionally important subset of proteins. Although evolutionarily related to bacterial ribosomes, mitochondrial ribosomes display some mechanistic and compositional differences from their prokaryotic counterparts. Mitochondrial ribosomes are entirely membrane-anchored, whereas in bacteria the ribosomes cycle between soluble and membrane-anchored populations. The mitochondrial ribosomes display a higher protein:rRNA content and this is largely attributed to (i) the presence of "mitospecific" extensions on many ribosomal proteins in addition to their bacterial homology domains, and (ii) the presence of novel mitochondrial-specific ribosomal proteins. The role of the mitochondrial-specific ribosomal proteins/domains in ensuring that the assembly and activity of the ribosomes is tethered to the membrane is largely unexplored and represents a long-term goal of this research. The elucidation of mechanisms of mitochondrial ribosome assembly and regulation have important implications for the fundamental cellular questions concerning protein translation systems and will address how mitochondrial ribosomes have evolved in composition and function from their prokaryotic ancestors. This research project will directly address how the mitochondrion coordinates its translational activity with the biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation system, a process which requires the uniting of proteins encoded by nuclear genes with the mitochondrial gene products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;A major objective of this project is to continue to provide innovative and transformative research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students at Marquette University. The proposed research activities will provide a training platform for student researchers in many aspects of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology. Undergraduate students, by working alongside graduate students, will become active members of a close scientific research and mentoring community. Students will also be encouraged to present their work at national research meetings and to publish their findings, goals which will also hone their scientific writing and communication skills. By exposing students to the excitement of inquiry-based biological research early during their undergraduate tenure, it is hoped to increase the number of students electing scientific research careers following graduation. Finally, exposing students to innovative research in closely mentored research environment will be instrumental for increasing their engagement, awareness, and appreciation for the importance of scientific discovery and rigor in society today.</AbstractNarration>
