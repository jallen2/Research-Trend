    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation (travel, lodging, registration) of doctoral students from U.S. universities in the Doctoral Consortium of the 21st International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS-11) to be held in Freiburg, Germany, June 11-16, 2011. The Doctoral Consortium will be comprised of two parts: (1) a one-day session the day before the conference begins that will include invited talks on research skills and career development, student presentations, and mentor-led focus groups; and (2) a poster session to be held during the conference. This award will support the participation of approximately 9 US-based students. Participants will be selected through an application process that includes review of submitted materials including an extended dissertation abstract and CV, an assessment of the benefit of participation to the applicant, and the stage of the participant's doctoral research.</AbstractNarration>
