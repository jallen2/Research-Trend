    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize the&lt;br/&gt;world?s first cloud-based emotion measurement platform. Today, the majority of market&lt;br/&gt;research is expensive and slow, relying either on subjective self-reports or costly,&lt;br/&gt;obtrusive lab-based technologies. The proposed emotion measurement platform aims to&lt;br/&gt;democratize market research by translating nonverbal facial expressions into intuitive&lt;br/&gt;emotional insights. It also drives down research costs and improves market reach&lt;br/&gt;through the use of widely available webcams as the means to record faces. This&lt;br/&gt;platform enables businesses of any size to capture consumer?s emotional reactions as&lt;br/&gt;they engage with their brands, particularly in the areas of advertising, product design&lt;br/&gt;and packaging. For example, brand managers, marketers and agencies can optimize ad&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness by evaluating viewers' tacit, moment-by-moment emotional response, in&lt;br/&gt;real-time over the web, and through the platform?s emotion norms database. The&lt;br/&gt;technical objectives of this project focus on implementing automated facial analysis as a&lt;br/&gt;scalable cloud-based software-as-a-service platform, building the emotion norms&lt;br/&gt;database, and deploying the platform with leading market research partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to disrupt longstanding&lt;br/&gt;methods in market research by objectively measuring people?s emotional experiences&lt;br/&gt;a) unobtrusively b) in real-time, c) at scale, and d) cost-effectively. While this&lt;br/&gt;differentiated emotion measurement technology can be leveraged in several target&lt;br/&gt;markets, the company?s initial focus is on measuring advertising effectiveness and&lt;br/&gt;media research to deliver actionable insights to leading media and market research&lt;br/&gt;companies. In addition, the proposed cloud-based emotion measurement platform has&lt;br/&gt;the potential to significantly accelerate research in behavioral sciences by enabling the&lt;br/&gt;crowd sourcing of huge corpuses of naturalistic and spontaneous responses to a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of interactions and experiences from online learning to social gaming. It also&lt;br/&gt;allows entirely new research questions to be asked, and tackled with ecologically valid&lt;br/&gt;data, such as whether individuals on the autism spectrum respond differently to content.&lt;br/&gt;Thus, in line with the origins of this technology, our product accelerates psychological&lt;br/&gt;and clinical research on social-emotional intelligence. The long-term vision for this&lt;br/&gt;software as a service platform is to ?emotion-enable? the Internet, giving consumers and&lt;br/&gt;organizations the ability to add emotion context to all online interactions.</AbstractNarration>
