    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to improve the fundamental understanding on the interactions between organic semiconductors and self-assembled monolayers, and to apply it towards the development of a low-cost, high-throughput patterning technique for organic thin-film transistors. The approach is to exploit film-forming properties on selectively chemically modified surfaces and induce patterning by differential microstructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore ordering of organic semiconductor molecules driven by interactions at interfaces. A high degree of order in the transistor channels, where the interactions are present, promotes high-mobility. Film regions surrounding the devices, where the interactions are not present, consist of high-resistivity regions of randomly oriented molecules, electrically insulating devices and yielding self-patterning. A wide variety of semiconductors will be employed as active layers, in combination with various surface treatments. Correlations between the chemical structure of the organic semiconductor and self-assembled monolayer, and their eventual film microstructure and electrical properties, will be established and used to generate design rules governing the limits and applicability of this technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will deliver methods for patterning organic thin-film transistors. Such progress may accelerate commercialization of organic electronic devices. This interdisciplinary program not only will create an environment for cross-training graduate and undergraduate students from Wake Forest University in Physics, Chemistry, Material science and Engineering, but at the same time will cultivate community engagement by offering research opportunities for local high-school students, Forsyth Tech community college students and minority students, who will be trained in semiconductor fabrication and characterization techniques that will make them uniquely employable.</AbstractNarration>
