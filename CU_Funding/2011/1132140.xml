    <AbstractNarration>It is well recognized that university faculty do not reflect the gender or ethnic composition of the&lt;br/&gt;United States population, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;(STEM) fields. This reflects critical shortages of US domestic graduate students, and minority&lt;br/&gt;graduate students in particular. While the number of minority students earning STEM doctoral degrees&lt;br/&gt;has increased over the past 20 years, national data show that there remains a need to enhance diversity among STEM doctoral degrees recipients.&lt;br/&gt;The Virginia Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (VAGEP) will serve as the&lt;br/&gt;facilitating organization for this project in partnership with Virginia Community&lt;br/&gt;Colleges, HBCUs, and the Appalachian Colleges Association. As part of the project, these institutions&lt;br/&gt;will conduct a state-wide survey of students in STEM programs to assess the reasons why they succeed (or not) in STEM disciplines. In addition, they will hold two state-wide conferences/workshops to discuss best practices across the state; the needs of students as assessed from the survey; and, next steps. Their ultimate goal is to create a structured mentoring network to attract talented students through undergraduate studies to graduate education and ultimately to the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;According to numerous reports, the competitive edge of the Nation is at stake unless colleges and universities dramatically increase the number of students studying in STEM areas. It is imperative to&lt;br/&gt;understand the reasons why members of underrepresented groups are not pursuing careers in&lt;br/&gt;these disciplines. This project will focus on underrepresented groups in Virginia and formulate a plan of action based on findings that will address the issue of under-representation in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed work includes the benefits to society of a more diverse faculty serving as role models to attract students to the professoriate; enhanced collaborations between universities in Virginia to develop scientists in the Commonwealth; and, the creation of a model to help other states develop strategic networks to enhance their STEM enterprise.</AbstractNarration>
