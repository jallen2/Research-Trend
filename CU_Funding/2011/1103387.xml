    <AbstractNarration>Funds are requested to provide limted support to US based students to participate in CADathlon contest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CADathlon is an annual graduate student programming contest held in conjunction with the ICCAD (International Conference on Computer-Aided Design) conference held annually in SanJose, California. The contest problems are chosen from the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) field and are posed by EDA experts from academia and industry. The contest is open to all graduate students pursuing their degrees in EDA.&lt;br/&gt;CADathlon was started in 2002 and every year attracts 15-20 teams from universities all over the world. In the eight CADathlon contests held so far, one or more graduate student teams from 26 US and 10 foreign universities have competed. The winning and runner-up teams are awarded cash prizes. In this proposal, we seek NSF support to partially cover the expenses of 2010 CADathlon contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CADathlon is a vehicle to attract students who are good at problem solving to the EDA area. CADathlon directly encourages a deeper study and understanding of critical problems in the EDA/CAD field for the participants. As such, it is an invaluable resource for encouraging young researchers to pursue graduate degrees and for laying the foundations of a career in research in these areas.</AbstractNarration>
