    <AbstractNarration>Fueled by the ubiquity of communications access, networked systems have become pervasive and given rise to behaviors whose evolution depends on both individual decisions and the interactions on the network. Examples of such behaviors include media sharing websites, where user recommendations influence product adoption decisions of other users, or more generally public discussion forums where past voting records of users provide indications on how they may influence each other and, therefore, how initial opinions may determine the outcome of future votes. Understanding the evolution of decisions in such connected settings can, therefore, be of significant social and economic benefit. For example, this can help predict the adoption of new social policies, or more pragmatically the commercial success of a new shared application. The importance of those questions has attracted much recent attention, but due to the complexity of networked interactions, much remains to be done. This project takes a multi-disciplinary approach to tackling these challenging questions, and seeks to build on models from statistical physics developed to capture the interactions of charged particles, which interact with each other in a manner akin to how users influence each other in a social network. If successful, the work can both expand the set of tools available to explore the behavior of networked systems, and offer insight into specific problems of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores two fundamental aspects of networked systems, namely, the formation of opinions in networks, and how adoption decisions are made when they are influenced by network neighbors. Networked systems can be of many different forms, including communication networks, social networks, political networks, geographical networks, etc., and are characterized by the fact that connections between network members influence their interactions. Characterizing these interactions is a complex task. The two main goals of the project are to (i) extend models from statistical physics to apply them to fundamental problems in networked systems; and (ii) empirically validate the predictive abilities of these models. Specifically, the project seeks to leverage and extend the Ising spin glass model, and apply these extensions to problems of opinion formation and adoption decisions in networked systems. Empirical validation of the results will then be sought through comparison to data collected from social media websites.</AbstractNarration>
