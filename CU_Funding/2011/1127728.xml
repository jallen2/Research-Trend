    <AbstractNarration>Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Cornell University, and commercial partners ITT-Geospatial Systems, Lockheed-Martin, and Pictometry International propose to establish the Consortium for 3D Innovation (C3I), an effort dedicated to translating innovative 3D research and development to the commercial sector. The consortium will (i) leverage 3D algorithm research by RIT and Cornell through a non-exclusive, royalty free intellectual property (IP) agreement, (ii) combine technical expertise at RIT and Cornell with business/marketing know-how from commercial partners, facilitated through the Saunders College of Business at RIT, and (iii) educate the next generation 3D innovators in the form of imaging science, computer science, and business students that are affiliated with C3I. The intellectual merits of the effort are underscored by the market need for 3D spatial products, the readiness of existing R&amp;D to transition to market, and lack of a vehicle to accomplish technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society, students and faculty will benefit broadly from the proposed plan of activities. The project flow follows the model of RIT's NSF funded Science Masters Program in Decision Support Technologies for Environmental Forecasting and Disaster Response which requires students to understand fundamentals of business, markets, and entrepreneurism in participation with the Business School. Dissemination of the results of the work will be in keeping with the regular publication of non-proprietary academic achievements and through the commercialization of image analysis and rendering products. The benefits to society will come through the adoption of these products, aided by the creation of a significant number of skilled workers in the field.</AbstractNarration>
