    <AbstractNarration>This project will use data from the THEMIS spacecraft and the GLD360 global lightning detection network to determine the extent to which plasmaspheric hiss is generated by lightning. In addition, observations from the DEMETER satellite will be used to determine to what extent the plasmaspheric hiss resembles magnetospheric chorus emissions. This data will be used to examine the hypothesis that chorus is a major source of plasmaspheric hiss. The project will also use a 10-year data set of gournd-based chorus from Palmer Station, Antarctica to examine the role of magnetospheric chorus waves on the phase-space density of energentic electrons in Earth's radiation belts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is related to the Geospace Environment Modeling program focus group on the radiation belts and magnetospheric waves. It has societal benefits because of the importance of understanding the radiation belts where high energy particles can damage spacecraft. The project also has education and training benefits because it funds a postdoctoral scholar.</AbstractNarration>
