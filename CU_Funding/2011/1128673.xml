    <AbstractNarration>Objectives&lt;br/&gt;As a contending point-of-care (POC) diagnostic platform component technology, semiconductor nanowire field-effect transistor (FET) sensors permit visual-label-free and real-time electronic detections of numerous biomolecules with high sensitivity and great specificity. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), however, needs to be improved before their POC diagnostic platform deployment.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research exploits the fundamental scientific principles and engineering measures to maximize the intrinsic detection sensitivity. The project will hypothesize, develop, and thoroughly characterize a transformative amplifying nanowire FET sensor structure. The research goal is to improve the detection sensitivity, LOD, and LOQ by 1-2 orders over the conventional nanowire FET sensors. Although detection of biomolecules in liquid environment is aimed as the research driver, the same amplifying sensor structure can be readily adopted for numerous other applications. Finally, a dynamically tunable and highly sensitive sensor device technology and architecture can be envisaged for deployments in disease diagnostics and health monitoring, defense and homeland security, and pharmaceutical discovery.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research and education activities will help nurture and educate future engineers and scientists in the areas of nanoelectronics and biosensing. Research experiences for underrepresented, women, and international students with integrated diversity will be created in the project. The research results will be broadly disseminated to enhance scientific and technological understanding. The outreach activities to high school, industry, and general scientific community will stimulate awareness and interests in these sectors. Finally, these sectors will in turn contribute to the advancement of the field of nanoelectronic biosensing.</AbstractNarration>
