    <AbstractNarration>The University of West Florida proposes an ADVANCE PAID project that focuses on diversifying the faculty. Recognizing that for the first time in the institution's history, the proportion of students of color has exceeded the proportion of faculty of color, the institution seeks to build a program for enhancing a supporting and inclusive culture for recruiting, retaining and advancing women faculty in the STEM disciplines. Central to this goal are several specific objectives that include: promoting a more diverse applicant pool, increasing the number of women hired and retained, providing professional development for women faculty and leadership opportunity, and educating current institution administrators on the value of diversity. These objectives are indicated within the proposal and the project to have special attention and relevancy to women of color. Also germane to the goal of this project is a conceptual framework that is rooted in positive psychological capital. As such, the project focuses on both the individual member of faculty and the entire institution the employs these faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This project blends two social science theories, positive psychological capital and social/ecological systems theory, that focus on enhancing understanding of gender equity at the individual and organizational levels. Specific activities are adapted from successful ADVANCE models and applied in a unique way to a comprehensive institution. As a result of this project, important information detailing paths to gender equity at non research intensive institutions will be gained and disseminated across the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;Because of the focus of this project on comprehensive, non research intensive institutions, the University of West Florida ADVANCE PAID project will have a dramatic impact on promoting gender equity at all institutions of similar type in the US. This is particularly significant given the disproportionately high number of women faculty who are employed at these institution types.</AbstractNarration>
