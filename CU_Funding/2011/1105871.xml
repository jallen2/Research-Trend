    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1105871&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Mark Gross&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to study the geometry of mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry for Calabi-Yau manifolds. This will be done from the&lt;br/&gt;perspective of a program developed jointly with B. Siebert, which&lt;br/&gt;"tropicalizes" Calabi-Yau manifolds, using an algebro-geometric&lt;br/&gt;version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator proposes to resolve a number of the&lt;br/&gt;remaining key steps of this program; these steps should be the&lt;br/&gt;component pieces of a complete conceptual proof of mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry at genus zero. These steps include a general gluing&lt;br/&gt;formula for the theory of logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants&lt;br/&gt;and a generalization of the tropical vertex of the PI,&lt;br/&gt;Pandharipande and Siebert to all dimensions. In addition, the&lt;br/&gt;program with Siebert has led to the construction of canonical&lt;br/&gt;theta functions for lines bundles on (degenerating families) of&lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifolds. The existence of such theta functions is&lt;br/&gt;expected to have various applications, such as geometric&lt;br/&gt;compactifications of the moduli space of K3 surfaces (being&lt;br/&gt;pursued with P. Hacking and S. Keel) and a tropical approach to&lt;br/&gt;homological mirror symmetry (being pursued with Siebert and&lt;br/&gt;M. Abouzaid).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work described in this proposal lies at the intersection of&lt;br/&gt;string theory and geometry. String theory replaces the&lt;br/&gt;traditional notion of the point particle with a small loop of&lt;br/&gt;string, moving through space-time. To make string theory&lt;br/&gt;compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be&lt;br/&gt;ten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one&lt;br/&gt;expects six of these dimensions to be a very small "curled up"&lt;br/&gt;geometric object. These geometric objects are called Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. In the early 1990s, string theorists proposed a&lt;br/&gt;remarkable association between completely different Calabi-Yau&lt;br/&gt;manifolds: certain calculations extremely difficult to perform on&lt;br/&gt;one Calabi-Yau manifold could be completed by performing&lt;br/&gt;completely different, and much easier, calculations on a&lt;br/&gt;different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry. Since this time, many geometers have been trying to&lt;br/&gt;understand the mathematics behind this miraculous&lt;br/&gt;observation. New insights and explanations for this phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;are developing rapidly, and these insights are leading to new&lt;br/&gt;approaches to old problems in algebraic geometry. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;work aims to both further understanding of mirror symmetry and&lt;br/&gt;apply this understanding to produce new developments in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry.</AbstractNarration>
