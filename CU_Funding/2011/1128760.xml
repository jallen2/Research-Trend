    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this conference/workshop is to enable graduate students, postdocs, early career scientists, and experts in other branches of astronomy to learn about established and emerging techniques for single-dish radio astronomy and their applications. The workshop program consists of an extensive series of lectures given by experts in the field and hands-on experiences with the Green Bank and Arecibo telescopes. In addition to covering the fundamentals of radio astronomy and radio telescopes the school also encompasses topics of great interest to early career scientists such as proposal writing, data analysis techniques, and discussion of future instrumentation. The majority of the requested funding will go towards Participant Support and will cover travel costs for students to attend the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
