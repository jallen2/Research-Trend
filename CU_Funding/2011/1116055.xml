    <AbstractNarration>With the proliferation of multicore processors has come resurgence&lt;br/&gt;of interest in parallel programming languages and models,&lt;br/&gt;particularly those intended to make it easier for non-expert&lt;br/&gt;programmers to correctly implement important classes of parallel&lt;br/&gt;applications. Unfortunately, most such languages and models are &lt;br/&gt;informally -- and thus imprecisely -- defined. The aim of the &lt;br/&gt;sponsored research is to develop more formal definitions, which will&lt;br/&gt;be needed in order to truly understand and reason about programs,&lt;br/&gt;guide language implementations, and verify implementation&lt;br/&gt;correctness. Within computer science and allied fields, formal&lt;br/&gt;definitions will facilitate the transition to ubiquitous parallel&lt;br/&gt;computing. For society at large, this transition will be essential&lt;br/&gt;to maintain the momentum of the IT revolution, across government,&lt;br/&gt;industry, science, the arts, and entertainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical core of the sponsored research is the use of&lt;br/&gt;history-based executions to capture both the behavior of individual&lt;br/&gt;threads of control and the interactions among those threads. In a&lt;br/&gt;departure from previous work, the interactions are always expressed&lt;br/&gt;in terms of atomic blocks, which can capture arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;language-level synchronization mechanisms. Specific topics being&lt;br/&gt;addressed include transactional memory (including the concepts of&lt;br/&gt;publication and privatization), explicit speculation, and &lt;br/&gt;determinism. The notion of determinism, in particular, is central&lt;br/&gt;to several emerging languages and models specifically intended for &lt;br/&gt;non-expert programmers. A formal framework for the definition of&lt;br/&gt;determinism will allow alternative definitions to be compared,&lt;br/&gt;contrasted, and correctly implemented.</AbstractNarration>
