    <AbstractNarration>Reproduction requires successful interactions among the various participants, including mothers, fathers, and offspring, at many different levels, from whole organisms to molecules. However, the process of reproduction often involves competition among individuals of the same sex as well as conflict between the sexes or between offspring and parents. Competition and conflict are believed to spark an evolutionary arms race between reproductive proteins of males and those of females, but this hypothesis has yet to be definitively tested. The present study will test this hypothesis by using next-generation sequencing to quantify patterns of evolution in the genes that encode reproductive proteins in pipefishes and seahorses. This group is a particularly interesting one in which to examine patterns of reproductive protein evolution, because distinct species differ with respect to levels of sexual competition and conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is scientifically important because it will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary processes that have contributed to the molecular underpinnings of reproduction. Such knowledge is necessary for a general understanding of the various ways in which proteins from males, females, and offspring interact to result in successful reproduction in humans and other animals. This project will also have a number of broader impacts. For example, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in cutting-edge approaches in molecular genetics and integrated into the global research community through international collaboration. This research will also be publicized through local and national outreach, including publication in leading journals, on websites, and in the popular press.</AbstractNarration>
