    <AbstractNarration>The funding from this grant will be used to support students and postdocs so they can attend the twentieth in a series of Atomic Physics Gordon Research Conferences to be held at the Mount Snow Resort in West Dover, VT from June 26-July 1, 2011. This meeting will continue the tradition of focusing on emerging areas of research within the discipline and major advances in existing areas of atomic physics and related fields. The program and speakers are to be chosen based on input from a wide range of practicing atomic physicists. The areas to be addressed at this conference include both theoretical and experimental developments, with emphasis on areas that offer significant challenges and opportunities as we look to the future of the field. In 2011, we include sessions on Precision Measurements, Alkali Earth Atoms, Quantum Simulation and Condensed Matter connections, Quantum Information, Fast Spectroscopy, Mesoscopic Physics, Quantum Optics, Dipolar Gases, and Bose/Fermi Gases. The informal nature of the conference, in which no proceedings or publications result, allows for the kind of free exchange of information and open discussion not always possible in other venues. The Atomic Physics Gordon Conference provides a unique opportunity to assemble a critical number of leading researchers in related but differing specializations, along with significant numbers of students and young researchers, who bring new points of view to the most exciting and demanding problems at the forefront of physics research. Effort will be made to welcome a diverse pool of registrants to the conference.</AbstractNarration>
