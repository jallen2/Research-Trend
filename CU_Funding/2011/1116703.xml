    <AbstractNarration>A central objective for computer science is to develop methods for building&lt;br/&gt;reliable and maintainable software. The most important technique for ensuring&lt;br/&gt;these properties is abstraction, the decomposition of a system into separable&lt;br/&gt;and reusable components. The theory of abstraction in programming is called&lt;br/&gt;type theory. A type is a specification of the behavior of a software component;&lt;br/&gt;type checking ensures that programs obey these specifications. This ensures&lt;br/&gt;that components can be modified or replaced without fear of disrupting the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of other components. By supporting the expression and enforcement of&lt;br/&gt;component behaviors, type theory integrates programming with verification, the&lt;br/&gt;process of ensuring compliance with specifications. All modern programming&lt;br/&gt;languages and development methodologies are based on, or draw inspiration from,&lt;br/&gt;type theory. The broad goal of this project is to extend the capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;type theory to a wider range of properties, and to use type theory to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;the development of reliable software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research will develop the theory of higher-dimensional type&lt;br/&gt;theory, and explore its application to generic programming, a technique&lt;br/&gt;for generating programs from their specifications. Higher-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;type theory draws on recent advances in category theory and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;topology that emphasize the algebraic structure of relations between&lt;br/&gt;programs, and relations between such relations, in direct analogy with&lt;br/&gt;the higher-dimensional structure of topological spaces. In this setting&lt;br/&gt;dependent families of types must respect the algebraic structure of such&lt;br/&gt;relations, and in doing so, they implicitly provide transformations that&lt;br/&gt;correspond to generic programs whose behavior is determined by their&lt;br/&gt;type. More broadly, the project will apply ideas from category theory&lt;br/&gt;and topology to improve software development, and apply ideas from type&lt;br/&gt;theory to facilitate computer-verified proofs of mathematical theorems.</AbstractNarration>
