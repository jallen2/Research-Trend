    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the research is to determine the causes for more than 400 snow related roof failures officially reported in 2010-2011 winter in the Northeast United States such as in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York. The failure data collected by building officials will be analyzed to determine if the failures are either due to excessive snow loads or due to structural capacity being less than that envisioned by building code provisions. These key questions will be answered by analysis of the roof load case histories provided by the structural engineering officials and community in combination with detailed weather information on snowfall and wind for selected sites from the Northeast Regional Climate Center. The research results will provide the basic design information to engineers and code officials to improve snow load demand provisions and material resistance standards prescribed in the current structural design provisions. The project outcomes will lead to determination of appropriate response needed to ensure better building performance in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data and analysis results will be made available to the Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers (SEI/ASCE) for its publication and wider dissemination to the structural engineering community for follow-up studies. A session on Roof Failures in the Northeast will be organized for the April 2012 ASCE/SEI Structures Congress. The report and session will result in practicing structural engineers and building officials gaining a fundamental understanding of how real buildings respond to real snow loads to design safer and more economical buildings in the future. The undergraduate students will be involved in the project to provide unique experience and insight into the behavior of various roofing systems.</AbstractNarration>
