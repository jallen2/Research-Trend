    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this workshop is to identify new research and educational opportunities in the mathematical and computational geosciences with particular focus on the NSF program on Collaboration in the Mathematical Geosciences. The workshop will bring together the leading senior and promising junior researchers to discuss current research trends in the mathematical and computational geosciences. The workshop program will include presentations from the leaders in the field which will inspire break-out sessions devoted to subfields as well as to cross-cutting, interdisciplinary research. The participants will discuss the scientific, educational, and organizational challenges faced by researchers engaged in the field. The results of the discussions and conclusions will be summarized in a white paper that will be presented to NSF for use when planning future initiatives in mathematical geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants at the workshop, through open discussion, will identify the promising research trends and hot topics in the field of mathematical and computational geosciences. This, in turn, will stimulate the development of new mathematical and computational research supporting the understanding of phenomena in the geosciences and the coupled energy-environment system. It will also support understanding of approaches to the management of energy resources. The participants will identify important ways in which research and education in the field can contribute to the new NSF-Wide Initiative on Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) and programs such as Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013.</AbstractNarration>
