    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;This award supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program will provide funds for students, post docs and young faculty to attend the Gordon Research Conference on Thin Film and Crystal Growth Mechanisms to be held July 17-22, 2011 at University of New England, Biddeford, ME. This conference focuses on new developments that impact understanding of crystallization and ordering. Attendees seek to measure, understand, and control three interrelated arenas (a) fundamental interfacial processes; (b) crystalline architectures; and through the first two, (c) materials function. The program addresses each of these topics approximately in this order. The particular strength of this Gordon Conference is its emphasis on interfacial processes the mechanisms of crystal growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conferences provide a unique forum to bring together experts, young scientists, and students around a particular thematic topic to disclose unpublished data, to challenge and discuss novel ideas, and to push the frontiers of science and innovation forward. New collaborations can be formed and new ideas generated that would not otherwise occur if not for these important conferences. The organizers have included 7 female and 1 Hispanic out of the 27 invited speakers and conference chairs. Also, plans to broaden participation to underrepresented groups are discussed. Students, post docs and young scientists will benefit from this conference through intellectual exchange and international participation.</AbstractNarration>
