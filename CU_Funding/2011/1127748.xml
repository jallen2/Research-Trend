    <AbstractNarration>Dissertation Research: "Out of the Shadows":&lt;br/&gt; Democracy and HIV Risk in Morocco&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;Through 12 months of fieldwork, combining network analysis, participant observation, interviews, and document analysis, this project draws on and contributes to science, technology, and society studies through an examination of Morocco's AIDS response at two levels of interaction: between locally-based NGOs and larger structures of AIDS governance; and between NGOs and their clients. A comparative ethnographic approach will yield rich data on how different NGOs solicit the participation of affected persons, formulate and enact public health interventions, produce knowledge about heath and disease, and influence the national AIDS response. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;International health organizations have argued that without greater efforts to manage AIDS in the Middle East and North Africa, the disease will exact a grave toll. Morocco presents a critical case study because its strategies to involve NGOs in AIDS governance are being promoted throughout the region. The objective of the project is to track the practical consequences of efforts to make public health science, policy and practice more responsive to the needs of affected populations. This research will also provide an important comparison for scholars doing work on participatory public health programs in other parts of the world.</AbstractNarration>
