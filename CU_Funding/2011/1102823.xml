    <AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Research: Labor Unions and the Economic Crisis&lt;br/&gt;SES - 1102823&lt;br/&gt;Caleb Southworth (PI)&lt;br/&gt;Ann Leymon (co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;University of Oregon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project examines how different types of labor organizations respond to political opportunities in times of an economic downturn. How do labor unions react to economic crisis? In what ways do unions change their strategy in response to recessions, such as the recession of 2008 or the Great Depression of 1929? What is the relationship between organizational traits, such as the credential of labor leaders or the type of management hierarchy, and changes in unions' response to economic crisis? Political opportunity theory suggests that social movement organizations will increase political action, while business cycle theory predicts that economic crisis will be detrimental to unions, reducing membership and power. As a case in point, this dissertation compares different types of labor unions during the Great Depression and the economic crisis of 2008 and, in the process, creates a dataset on the political, economic, and organizational activity of 30 labor unions both before and after the onset of the crisis of 2008. Researchers will collect and code data on political activity, organizing activity, organizational characteristics, and alliances from constitutions, convention proceedings, and other union records located at the Kheel Center Archives in Ithaca, NY, University of Washington libraries, union websites, and the Office of Labor-Management Standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in four areas. First, it considers the range of possible activities, from conventional lobbying to radical actions, allowing for more nuanced findings. Second, focusing on organizational characteristics enables us to determine which organizational characteristics make unions more likely to take advantage of political opportunities. Third, comparing labor union activities in response to crisis with activities before the crisis began, allows for longitudinal analysis of tactical changes. Finally, the project extends research on business cycles by recording responses of labor unions to declining economic conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;First, the project will produce a dataset on 30 labor unions from 2005-2010 using detailed organizational, financial, and political variables. Second, undergraduate coders will receive a valuable educational opportunity to learn hands-on research skills and experience a research project in progress. Third, the findings may further our understanding how organized labor, and interest groups more generally, affect work place conditions and policies.</AbstractNarration>
