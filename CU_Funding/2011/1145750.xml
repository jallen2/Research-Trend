    <AbstractNarration>77th Annual Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology, May 30 - June 4, 2012&lt;br/&gt;The Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology bring together scientists from all over the world to present and evaluate new data and ideas in rapidly moving areas of biological research. Plants are integral to human wellbeing, and many species have been domesticated for over ten thousand years. During the past several decades plant biology has been revolutionized first by molecular biology and then by the genomic era. With the genomes of more than thirty plant species now available and many more planned in the near future, the impact on our understanding of plant evolution and biology continues to grow. Our increased ability to engineer plant species to a variety of ends may provide novel solutions to ensure adequate food production and renewable energy even as climate change impacts our environment.&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium will span a broad range of areas of investigation including genetics, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, developmental biology, physiology and population/evolution studies at levels ranging from the single cell to the entire organism and from single genes to genomes; plant-specific areas are anticipated to feature broadly. Fundamental biological discoveries will be balanced with applications relevant to societal wellbeing including improved crops, fuel and habitat.&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium seeks to nurture the next generation of plant scientists by providing outstanding younger scientists with an opportunity to interact with and learn from their peers and more senior scientists. Much of the research will be presented in the form of posters, providing younger scientists with the opportunity to develop their ideas, their presentations skills, and their interactions with other members of the scientific community. Representation of women at the Symposium at both junior and senior level is important, since role models play a key role in attracting newcomers to any field. Equally, the Laboratory encourages minority scientists to attend and present their latest research. Through panel discussions, the Symposium also aims to encourage scientists to consider the impact of their own research in the context of how society views the associated risks and benefits. Thus the Symposium aims to empower a broad and diverse community of current and future plant scientists.&lt;br/&gt;The Laboratory also plans to disseminate this synthesis of current thinking to a broader audience. In-depth interviews with leading scientists undertaken during the Symposium provide an alternative snapshot of the state of current research and are made freely available online to a broad audience. Finally, the local community is engaged in the general theme of the Symposium through a public lecture delivered by one of the Symposium participants to a mixed audience of scientists and laymen.</AbstractNarration>
