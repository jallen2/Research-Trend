    <AbstractNarration>The University of Michigan Ann Arbor is awarded a grant to support a two-day workshop focused on planning, deployment and operation of advanced aquatic sensors. The workshop will be conducted by the Global Lakes Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) and the Great Lakes Partner of the Alliance for Coastal Technologies (ACT), and will be hosted by the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS). Aquatic sensor technology is developing rapidly, yet mechanisms and opportunities for limnologists and field biologists to receive exposure to and training in these new technologies are limited. The workshop will address several critical aspects of data collection and management, as well as instrument lifecycle, which are routinely encountered by users of aquatic sensors. These topics include: exchange of knowledge among leading aquatic sensor developers and the end-users of this technology; assembly of project teams for the purpose of deploying, operating and maintaining sensor networks; demonstration of the latest in aquatic sensor and sensor platform technology; development of sensor-oriented curriculum for limnologists and field biologists; fundamental skills needed for sensor deployments such as data logger configuration, data telemetry and data management. Products of the workshop will include a report on the technologies demonstrated and multimedia(recorded audio visuals) from panels and presentations will be made freely available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will, for the first time, bring together members of the Alliance for Coastal Technologies (http://act-us.info) and the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (http://www.gleon.org). The complementary missions of these organizations, sensor evaluation (ACT) and sensor applications (GLEON), affords opportunities for discussions on future collaborations. The workshop will also provide opportunities for graduate students and young researchers from diverse regions and backgrounds, including students and researchers working for upper Midwestern Native American tribal organizations, to gain skills in acquiring and applying data derived from state-of-the-science aquatic sensors. It will also provide students and young investigators with opportunities to collaborate across disciplinary and geographic boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
