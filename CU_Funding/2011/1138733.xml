    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 11-38733&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Lee, Eva K &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Georgia Tech Research Corporation&lt;br/&gt;Title: Population Protection and Monitoring in Response to Radiological Incidents &lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID project, collecting rare and real-life data pertaining to radiological emergency response in Japan, builds on previous work that collects and processes a large amount of time-motion study data in the public health emergency response system planning and usage at Georgia Tech. The team will work with Japanese collaborators in their efforts in performing assessment of the recent series of disasters in Japan, as well as in assisting in the recovery. This team is experienced in using a real-time information-decision support system for emergency preparedness. The collection and the analysis of scarce data in the so-called Knowledge Data Bank for Radiological Responses, speaks to the importance and uniqueness of the proposed system. The Japanese-USA academic research team will be engaged in some of the following activities: &lt;br/&gt;- Establish a knowledge data bank for radiological response: emergency data collection and resource assessment. &lt;br/&gt;- Process mapping and time motion study.&lt;br/&gt;- Interview individuals (emergency workers, affected individuals, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;- Incorporate the radiological knowledge data bank into a real-time simulator and decision support system. &lt;br/&gt;- Analyze and assess the effects of the disaster in collaboration with NanZan University.&lt;br/&gt;The final system will facilitate assessment of current operations performance versus pre-disaster preparedness. It will allow for the study, training, and enhancement of emergency response, as well as future planning for radiological incidents. The work provides a unique opportunity to collect on-the-ground emergency response data. &lt;br/&gt;The researchers collaborate with the Japanese investigators from NanZam University, Dr. Suzuki and Dr. Sasaki, whose work is funded by the Japan Society of Promotion of Science. The Japanese team will arrange trips for the US team to visit the various shelters, distribution, medical, and/or health-registering sites where they will conduct the time-motion studies, interviews, and operations/performance observations, and evaluations. A letter of support and biographical sketches of the Japanese collaborators are included in the supplementary document. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This project promises an immediate benefit to society by supporting economic recovery efforts in Japan through a participatory research paradigm. The data bank is critical to our national medical preparedness, emergency response, and homeland security. Moreover, the work is urgent for population protection from nuclear plant accidents. Long-term benefits for future disasters are in evidence. Obviously, the emergency response and disaster mitigation research will be enabled with the developed simulation and decision support system along with the knowledge data base. In general, the project also contributes to train graduate students exposing them to high-impact application areas.</AbstractNarration>
