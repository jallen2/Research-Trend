    <AbstractNarration>The recent breathtaking advances in modern engineering and bioscience research have enabled the identification of properties and roles of biomolecules that power cellular processes. The hallmark of these nanoscale systems is their multi-scale organization. In neurodegenerative diseases for example, axonal degeneration occurs because the neurotransmitters do not reach the synapse correctly. This is because binding of kinesins on microtubules is hindered. Hence, interrogating the properties of the nanotransport done by kinesins on microtubules is crucial for early/presymptomatic diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Such early diagnosis will be enabled the novel models developed in this work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this work is to create an innovative approach to model and to actively interrogate the complex bio-nanotransport of groups of kinesins interacting with microtubules in controlled fluids. Specific aims are: (a) novel models: develop new models which bridge the gap between nano/pico length/time scales and macroscales through combined atomistic/continuum modeling and experiments, and (b) novel detection: create novel methods to interrogate kinesin-MT systems about their properties by monitoring the nanotransport done by these systems in controlled fluids. Uniquely combined theoretical and experimental methods from atomistic simulations, nonlinear dynamics and bioengineering are used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will answer important scientific questions, and will impact applications spanning from cell science to biomolecular nanotechnology and engineered biodevices. For example, understanding how to model motor proteins in controlled fluids and how to identify properties of nanotransport in vivo is a key element in the next generation of drug technology and delivery, and can profoundly impact medicine. This work contributes to such understanding by using nonlinear dynamic approaches for solving very important questions in medicine and cell biology. If successful, this research can radically transform the way neurodegenerative diseases are diagnosed. Also, this work will provide fundamental understanding of bio-mechanochemical processes which affect the development of lab-on-a-chip bio-applications.</AbstractNarration>
