    <AbstractNarration>EarthScope enables the exploration of the structure and evolution of the North American continent by scientists accessing a range of seismological, geodetic, in situ fault zone sampling, and geochronology and high resolution topography resources. EarthScope science is notable for its interdisciplinarity. Science results from EarthScope go beyond narrow analyses of individual datasets, and combine diverse observational datasets with innovative experimental and theoretical exploration. These results produce transformative knowledge for studying earth's structures and processes and in understanding hazards and guiding exploration of resources. In addition, these data and technologies offer superb opportunities to enhance formal and informal science education in the solid Earth sciences. The EarthScope National Office (ESNO) at Arizona State University serves the broad and diverse community of EarthScope stakeholders, including EarthScope researchers, formal and informal educators in Earth science, and the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ESNO will serve the scientific community through leadership and support of the EarthScope Steering committee, via close communication with the EarthScope program at NSF and the EarthScope Facilities (USArray, PBO, SAFOD), and by frequent solicitation of feedback and new ideas. The ESNO will maintain these activities as well as further promote EarthScope by assuming a meta-leadership role in coordinating current and new earth science initiatives (such as a major focus on Cascadia, the eastward movement of the Transportable Array, developing a plan for Alaskan EarthScope investigation, impending Frontiers in Earth System Dynamics projects, and earthquakes directly affecting the US). The need to integrate EarthScope and related data and other geoscience tools remains a critical need which can be addressed using the tools of cyberinfrastructure. Interesting new and unexpected applications of the EarthScope observational systems will be encouraged (e.g., atmosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ESNO foregrounds education and outreach (E&amp;O): giving it attention, expertise, and resources at the same level as EarthScope science. This is accomplished by maintaining and expanding on effective services such as the EarthScope E&amp;O website, Newsletters, Speaker Series, Interpretive Workshops for informal educators, and the biannual EarthScope National Meeting. Further, ESNO adds value to the programmatic E&amp;O portfolio through new initiatives to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Rapidly channel EarthScope science through new social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and the 'Geoblogosphere'; &lt;br/&gt;- Pilot and disseminate exemplary new solid-Earth science content and inquiry-driven pedagogy for K-12 STEM teacher development (in partnership with organizations such as AGI and PRI);&lt;br/&gt;- Catalyze the use of regional and local results from EarthScope research in promoting place-based Earth science teaching at all levels to better engage and retain diverse students; and&lt;br/&gt;- Deliver a new continuing professional education service for EarthScope researchers and educators at the university and graduate levels: the University of EarthScope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E&amp;O at ESNO, infused with a place-based and educator-centered ethos, coordinates the compilation and presentation of the spectacular findings and scientific legacy of the EarthScope program, and is a reliable and effective partner to stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Exploration of the 4-D structure of the North American continent is spectacularly underway with EarthScope by a vigorous community of scientists. The results are fundamental to increasing our understanding of the Earth, for characterizing how we live with potentially hazardous Earth processes, and for guiding exploration of resources. They are transformative in Earth science and technology education. The ESNO at ASU will be well-situated, planned, and configured to foster continued Earth exploration and discovery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The ESNO at ASU will enhance and continue to expand a high-profile public identity for EarthScope, establish a sense of ownership among scientific, professional, and educational communities, promote science literacy and understanding of EarthScope and Earth science in general, advance formal Earth science education, and foster use of EarthScope data, discoveries, and new technology in resolving challenging problems and improving our quality of life. Scientists, educators, students, decision makers, and our fellow citizens, in the Southwest as well as across the US and abroad, will all benefit from these activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical explanation of broader significance and importance: Exploration of the four dimensional structure of the North American continent and Earth processes operating on and within it is spectacularly underway with EarthScope by a vigorous community of scientists. The results are fundamental to increasing our understanding of Earth, for characterizing how we live with potentially hazardous Earth processes, and for guiding exploration of natural resources. They are transformative in Earth science and technology education. The EarthScope National Office at Arizona State University will be well-situated, planned, and configured to foster continued Earth exploration and discovery. It will enhance and continue to expand a high-profile public identity for EarthScope, establish a sense of ownership among scientific, professional, and educational communities, promote science literacy and understanding of EarthScope and Earth science in general, advance formal Earth science education, and foster use of EarthScope data, discoveries, and new technology in resolving challenging problems and improving our quality of life. Scientists, educators, students, decision makers, and our fellow citizens, in the Southwest as well as across the U.S. and abroad, will all benefit from these activities.</AbstractNarration>
