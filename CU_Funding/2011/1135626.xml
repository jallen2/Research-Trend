    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds to support twelve U.S.-based young researchers to participate as speakers in the special sessions and plenary lectures at the Twelfth Asian Logic Conference, to be held December 15-20, 2011 at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, one the major centers of logic in the world. All but one of those for whom funds are sought have either very limited or no other means of travel support.&lt;br/&gt;The biannual Asian Logic Conference is one of the most important meetings in logic outside of North America, and this the first time it will be held outside of continental Asia. The program includes areas of great current interest (Algorithmic randomness, Logical Aspects of Graphs and Matroids, Modal Logic, Set Theory) and speakers include leading world experts. This event provides an important platform for young researchers to present their work on a world stage and presents excellent opportunities for young U.S. based researchers to make strategic contacts in the Asia-Pacific region.</AbstractNarration>
