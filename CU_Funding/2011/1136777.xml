    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for participants to the international conference on Discrete Simulation of Fluid Dynamics, held August 8-12, 2011 at North Dakota State University. This conference provides a forum to discuss novel numerical methods for fluid flow and their applications that are derived from microscopic models. The thematic focus of the meeting will be ?Computational Soft Condensed Matter?. The aim of the meeting is to bring together experts in simulation methods with experimentalists working on systems that would benefit from computational approaches. The numerical methods represented at the DSFD meetings include lattice gas automata, the lattice Boltzmann equation, discrete velocity methods, dissipative particle dynamics, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, direct simulation Monte Carlo, stochastic rotation dynamics, molecular dynamics, and hybrid methods. This grant provides support primarily for underfunded participants, including minority groups from local Tribal Colleges.</AbstractNarration>
