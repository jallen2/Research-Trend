    <AbstractNarration>The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) is conducting a grant writing workshop for Tribal College and University (TCU) personnel. The workshop focuses on the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship and the Advanced Technological Education programs and is part of a larger effort by AIHEC to expand TCU participation in NSF programs beyond the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP). During the 2-day workshop, participants (TCU faculty, staff, and administrators) hear presentations from NSF program officers about the two programs, and the elements of a successful proposal. In addition, representatives with currently funded Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship and ATE grants discuss their respective projects, including the planning, implementation, and impact on their students and enhancements to the institution's academic program. A key outcome of the workshop is an expected increase in the successful submission of proposals by TCUs. The workshop contributes toward the development of an effective model for providing technical support to TCU personnel leading to a greater number of TCUs participating in NSF programs and contributes to the ongoing effort to promote broader participation of the nation's underserved and underrepresented minorities in STEM education and professions.</AbstractNarration>
