    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMR 1156737&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site Materials Physics at the University of Florida will bring 12 undergraduates per year to the University of Florida for a 10-week summer research experience. Each REU participant will be integrated into an active research group under the guidance of a faculty mentor and in most cases also more junior members of the group. The research projects cover a wide range of topics in condensed matter physics and materials science: multiferroism, carbon nanotubes, organic solar cells, piezoelectricity, quantum dots, low-dimensional magnetism, superconductivity, quantum phase transitions, low temperature physics, and large scale simulations. To provide a complete research experience the program includes seminars on current and emerging research areas, a seminar on applying to graduate school, a forum led by graduate students on life as a graduate student, a written communication workshop, an oral communication workshop, a library workshop, visits to local scientific and technical facilities, a group outreach activity for local K-5 students, and social events. Through exposure to all aspects of research, the project will equip undergraduate students to make informed career decisions, make them more likely to continue in science and engineering, and better prepare them for advanced research if they attend graduate school. Members of underrepresented groups will be actively recruited to enhance diversity in the science and engineering workforce. This project is supported by the Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research, NSF. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;The REU Site Materials Physics at the University of Florida will bring 12 undergraduates per year to the University of Florida for a 10-week summer research experience. Through exposure to research, the students will be more likely to continue in science and engineering and also be better prepared for advanced research in graduate school. The research topics include many deemed essential for technological advancement in the future: advanced electronic and magnetic materials and materials for energy conversion. In addition to completing a research project students will be exposed to research in seminars and field trips, have career development workshops including written and oral communication and applying to graduate school, and participate in a group outreach activity with local K-5 students to excite our future scientists and engineers about teaching. Women, minorities, and students from schools with limited research opportunities will be actively recruited to enhance the diversity of the science and engineering workforce. This project is supported by the Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research, NSF. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
