    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel support for students and early-career scientists to attend a special Symposium focusing on biological aerosols, to be held in conjunction with the 2011 IUGG (International Union of Geodesy &amp; Geophysics), to be held 28 June-7 July 2011 in Melbourne, Australia. Motivation for the symposium comes from a growing recognition of the importance of primary biological particles (bacteria, spores and pollen) in atmospheric processes, including processes involved in the formation of clouds and precipitation. This symposium will explore the current state of knowledge and relevant challenges/perspectives of future research. In particular, interdisciplinary connections will be facilitated and emphasized as part of the broad IUGG forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this activity derives from efforts to increase qualitative and quantitative understanding of processes regulating Earth's weather and climate, and from growing interface between traditionally separate scientific disciplines (viz. biology and geophysics). Broader Impacts of this award will arise through enabling participation of students and early career scientists in the conference, thereby providing for the enhanced education and training of the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
