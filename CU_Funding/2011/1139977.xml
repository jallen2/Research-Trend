    <AbstractNarration>Using an investigative learning model, this project is engaging undergraduate students (and a limited number of high school students) in a series of student-led research activities on biomass renewable energy. Students design and implement their own research plans based upon available biomass resources. The adoption of a student-led investigative approach is a potentially transformative model in biomass renewable energy education. Students identify biomass sources, test heat value and moisture content of the biomass, process the biomass into a useful form, gasify the biomass to produce combustible syngas, use the syngas to drive an internal combustion engine and an electrical generator, charge a bank of batteries, and invert to provide 110 VAC power output. Through the experience of participating in design and implermentation of a complete cycle of renewable energy generation and utilization, undergraduate students develop a real passion, knowledge and skill for using renewable energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Exemplary learning materials are being developed to enable other higher education institutions to transfer the methodology into their respective curricula. With a systematic assessment, the project adds to our knowledge of how students learn biomass renewable energy through a series of student-led research activities. The project contributes to the national effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to maintain a sustainable social, economic and environmental system for many generations to come.</AbstractNarration>
