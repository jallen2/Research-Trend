    <AbstractNarration>Development in humans and other higher organisms creates complex,&lt;br/&gt;precisely defined multicellular structures and patterns. These&lt;br/&gt;structures are the result of molecular programs that are stored in the&lt;br/&gt;sequences and concentrations of biomolecules and are executed when&lt;br/&gt;molecules interact and change state through chemical reactions. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this proposal is to understand how biochemical systems can be&lt;br/&gt;reliably programmed to form asymmetric patterns with multiple layers&lt;br/&gt;of organization. This proposal is part of a general goal to understand&lt;br/&gt;how to program global behavior and structure based on local rules,&lt;br/&gt;which a key intellectual challenge in many areas of computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose that complex, hierarchical chemical patterns can be formed&lt;br/&gt;by systems in which the molecules collectively execute a molecular&lt;br/&gt;program for pattern formation. The PIs will develop a&lt;br/&gt;chemical programming language in which information from simple input&lt;br/&gt;patterns is integrated by logical operations to form new pattern&lt;br/&gt;regions. These logical operations are then systematically integrated&lt;br/&gt;into larger programs, allowing the generation of patterns with&lt;br/&gt;complex, multiscale structure similar to that seen in&lt;br/&gt;biology. Designed synthetic DNA molecules that together act as circuit&lt;br/&gt;elements will be used to implement this language. DNA molecules are&lt;br/&gt;ideal substrates for a molecular programming approach because they&lt;br/&gt;have complex sequences with predictable behaviors and interactions.&lt;br/&gt;This research is tightly integrated with an outreach program that will &lt;br/&gt;develop an educational program dedicated to teaching the&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary skills that are necessary to be successful in&lt;br/&gt;molecular programming.</AbstractNarration>
