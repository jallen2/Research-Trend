    <AbstractNarration>Over the past two decades, a new spectroscopic technique called laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been developed and has gained favor for in situ field measurements in hostile environments. The goal of this proposal is to build a LIBS system suitable for deployment on Alvin with pressure cases and interfaces that are Alvin compatible. Once constructed, the PIs will re-validate the laboratory measurements in a test tank. At the end of this phase, they should have a working LIBS system that is compatible with Alvin, and that has been validated in a real water environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work itself addressing the advancement of the technology and the measurement environment are state-of-the-art research and development. The system configuration and results in this harsh environment will benefit other applications for real-time monitoring, including industrial processes and space exploration. Additionally, the research will lead to several student PhD dissertations, and collaborations among international research teams.</AbstractNarration>
