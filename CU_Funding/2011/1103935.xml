    <AbstractNarration>1103935 &lt;br/&gt;This project supports a cooperative research project by Dr. Stanislav Emelianov, University of Texas at Austin and Dr. Hassan Talaat, Ain Shams University, Cairo. They plan to study nanomaterials for developing devices for Improving Biomedical Imaging and Early Diagnosis of Cancer. Photothermal therapy, a targeted, non-invasive treatment of cancer where heat is used to cause tumor necrosis, is a suitable alternative to traditional surgery when surgery is impossible. The PIs plan a combined ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging system to non-invasively assist, guide and monitor photothermal cancer therapy. Metal nanoparticles will be developed as optically tuned photoabsorbers to efficiently transfer light irradiation into thermal energy to the tumor. Further, bioconjugation protocols will be designed to specifically target the photoabsorbers to cancerous cells. Ultrasound imaging will be utilized to identify the anatomy of the tumor while photoacoustic imaging will be used to ensure the presence of photoabsorbers before beginning therapy. Both ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging will be used to monitor temperature during therapy to ensure tumor necrosis and protect the surrounding healthy tissue. Finally, ultrasound imaging can track thermal damage in real-time during and after therapy to ensure cancer destruction. Ultrasound-guided molecular photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy will have a major impact in breast oncology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits: The main objective of this proposal is to design a prototype device for biomedical imaging based on using the photoacoustic tomography technique and different nanomaterials as contrast agents. The activity does carry a potential to advance our knowledge and understanding within the photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging field as well as nanotechnology and medicine. Nanomaterials and photoacoustic biomedical imaging are both emerging technologies in its own field. Integrating these two technologies in this proposed study will form an important foundation and guidelines to design and develop a hybrid imaging/therapy system for biomedical applications such as cancer treatments. The multi-disciplinary team consists of experts in nanotechnology and photoacoustic biomedical imaging. The roles of each coordinator are well defined and the collaborating mechanisms are adequately planned. This project involves exploring original and potentially transformative concepts of combining novel imaging strategies and advancing potentially new cancer therapies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Highly beneficial education and training of students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculties in the wide spectrum of the research areas of nanotechnology, biomedical imaging and medicine are expected. The already established network between UT and ASU will be strengthened and the successful outcomes of this project may lead a strong industrial partnership between US and Egypt with high potential. If successful, this hybrid technology may eventually bring an important imaging/therapy tool for the cancer treatments in clinic. The activity aims to broaden the participation of under-represented groups specifically women. Successful outcomes could greatly improve the multi-modal imaging techniques and would significantly advance the field. Indeed, the developed technology will be able to identify molecular composition of cancer and functional changes during image-guided photothermal therapy. The research will impact the fields of cancer research and clinical oncology as the developed methods and approaches can be applied in wide range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program where NSF supports the US side and the Government of Egypt funds the Egyptian side.</AbstractNarration>
