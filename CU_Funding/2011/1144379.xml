    <AbstractNarration>Abstract - Ebert (FODAVA II Workshop)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Society, as well as the science and engineering communities, is experiencing unprecedented growth in our capability to generate and access data. Turning this data deluge into usable, actionable information is a challenging, necessary task that is crucial to effective decision making, scientific discovery, and engineering advances. This growing need led to the development of the field of visual analytics. Key findings over the past years have illustrated that collaboration and interaction are key components that complete the integrated computational-human decision making loop. This occurs at many levels from individual manipulation of data representation to interactive cognitive discovery combined with automated analysis, to coordinative and collective interactive analysis among groups of individuals. Therefore, a research agenda for the "science of interaction" is needed that will support ubiquitous and collaborative analysis and discovery utilizing new, transparent interaction tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help define the research topics within this Science of Interaction for data and visual analytics. The workshop will gather leading researchers from the variety of disciplines that underpin this new topic. Focal topics will be (1) ubiquitous, embodied interaction; (2) capturing user intent to guide the analytical process; (3) knowledge-based interfaces based on visual cognition and machine reasoning; (4) effective collaboration and collaboration tools; (5) principals of design, perception, and usability; and (6) composability and integration of tools. The main outcome of the workshop will be the workshop report defining a research roadmap for the Science of Interaction for Visual and Data Analytics, as well as a summary paper to be submitted to IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications? Visualization Viewpoints or IEEE Computer magazine.</AbstractNarration>
