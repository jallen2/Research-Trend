    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Bowser at University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and his group will use micro free flow electrophoresis (uFFE) as the second stage in 2D separations. FFE is a continuous analysis technique capable of further separating analyte peaks as they elute off the first separation column. Continuous analysis removes limitations encountered in previous 2D separations caused by under sampling. Coupling with capillary electrophoresis (CE) or nano liquid chromatography (nLC) is expected to be straightforward with no complicated valving or timing required. It is anticipated that coupling with uFFE will increase the peak capacity of these techniques 20 to 30-fold with no sacrifice of efficiency or separation time in the first dimension separation. Total 2D peak capacities are expected to reach 2,000 in separation times of &lt;15 min. Experiments are planned to fully characterize the peak capacity and compatibility of the many combinations of separation modes possible using this approach. As a demonstration of the potential power of high speed 2D separations CE-uFFE will be incorporated into online microdialysis assays for measuring in vivo neurochemical dynamics. Online microdialysis requires high-speed separations of complex mixtures, making this assay an ideal application to demonstrate the advantages of the 2D separations developed in this proposal. The technical benefit of the proposed approach lies in its increased peak capacity without sacrificing separation time. 2D uFFE therefore has the potential to be adopted widely, improving research capabilities and efficiency in many research areas. Beyond practical advantages, exploration into 2D-uFFE will provide unique insight into the fundamentals of separation science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers at UM-twin cities also intend to design the research project described in this proposal with the goal of maximizing its impact on society through intellectual enrichment, mentoring and training opportunities, inclusion of underrepresented groups and infrastructure enhancement.</AbstractNarration>
