    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1160202&lt;br/&gt;Schwartz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objectives of this project involve the development of methods where liquid crystals&lt;br/&gt;(LC) are used to detect nucleic acid hybridization. Also, to obtain an improved understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the fundamental molecular-level mechanisms by which the interfacial interactions of nucleic&lt;br/&gt;acids affect LC orientation. The ultimate long-term goal of this research is to enable LC-based&lt;br/&gt;detection in medical diagnostic applications, e.g. multiplexed methods (i.e. DNA microarrays)&lt;br/&gt;based on the orientational response of LCs to DNA hybridization, that use the transmission of&lt;br/&gt;polarized light to detect the LC response.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Two distinct approaches will be developed, and so the specific aims and research strategies of&lt;br/&gt;this project fall into two groups. The first approach involves a dynamic change of the LC polar tilt&lt;br/&gt;angle at the LC/aqueous interface in the presence of a monolayer of cationic surfactant, and the&lt;br/&gt;specific aims associated with this approach include the development of a multiplexed platform,&lt;br/&gt;quantitative studies of sensitivity and target generality, the development of fluorescence&lt;br/&gt;microscopy methods that can be used to study the LC/aqueous interface, and the application of&lt;br/&gt;these methods to understand the molecular mechanisms of LC response to DNA hybridization.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this method will be directly validated by experiments that will discriminate between&lt;br/&gt;closely-related bacterial pathogens.&lt;br/&gt;The second approach involves a characteristic chiral rotation of the azimuthal orientation of&lt;br/&gt;planar-anchored LC when the LC is in contact with extended dsDNA. The associated specific&lt;br/&gt;aims include quantitative studies of the macroscopic optical response, extension of the method&lt;br/&gt;to the detection of single hybridized molecules, development of methods that enable multiplexed&lt;br/&gt;detection using covalently immobilized probes, and mechanistic studies aimed at understanding&lt;br/&gt;the distinctive LC response to ssDNA and dsDNA. Similar validation experiments (i.e.&lt;br/&gt;discrimination between related bacteria) will be pursued for this method as for the first method.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The methods developed here have the long-term potential to be used in new medical diagnostic&lt;br/&gt;technologies that are appropriate for point-of-use applications including those in low resource&lt;br/&gt;environments. Furthermore, the fundamental understandings obtained about LC-biomolecule&lt;br/&gt;interactions will be broadly useful for researchers pursuing LC-based biosensing approaches.&lt;br/&gt;More broadly, the optical characterization methods developed will be of use for studies of the&lt;br/&gt;LC-liquid interface and for other liquid-liquid interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;The researchers involved in this project will gain expertise in multidisciplinary areas projected to&lt;br/&gt;be at the forefront of science and technology in the coming decades, including liquid crystal&lt;br/&gt;devices, biodetection, single-molecule microscopy, and self-assembled molecular systems.&lt;br/&gt;Also, through their participation in a variety of educational and outreach programs (e.g. REU,&lt;br/&gt;RET, GAANN, CU-Discovery Learning Center, Materials Science from CU K-12 outreach,&lt;br/&gt;Colorado High School Honors Institute), the researchers will continue to share this project with&lt;br/&gt;students, teachers, and other community members. As summarized in the proposal the PI and&lt;br/&gt;previous students and post-docs involved in this project have demonstrated a sincere and&lt;br/&gt;continuing commitment to the creative use of their research in the pursuit of education and&lt;br/&gt;outreach; the integration of basic discovery and cutting-edge microscopy methods in this project&lt;br/&gt;will provide an ideal platform from which to communicate the excitement of research to the&lt;br/&gt;general public.</AbstractNarration>
