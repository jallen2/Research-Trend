    <AbstractNarration>The project is an effort to investigate the mathematical theory and &lt;br/&gt;algorithms associated with the symbolic evaluation of definite &lt;br/&gt;integrals. The first class of functions that will be considered is &lt;br/&gt;the family of hypergeometric functions. This class is characterized &lt;br/&gt;by satisfying a differential equation of second order with exactly &lt;br/&gt;three singular points. The PI will attempt to develop an automatic &lt;br/&gt;procedure based on the Barnes representation for these functions. &lt;br/&gt;The natural next step is the family of Heun functions that have four &lt;br/&gt;singular points. The project also considers many topics that have risen from previous &lt;br/&gt;investigations by the PI. These include arithmetical properties of &lt;br/&gt;sequences coming from the iteration of integrals, questions of logconcavity &lt;br/&gt;of sequences appearing in the integration of rational functions and &lt;br/&gt;general questions on the p-adic properties of naturally occurring sequences. &lt;br/&gt;A general theory for these valuations will be developed. A third component &lt;br/&gt;of the project is the implementation and justification of a heuristic method &lt;br/&gt;developed by the PI and his coworkers to evaluate integrals coming from &lt;br/&gt;Feynman diagrams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many problems in physics and engineering require the exact &lt;br/&gt;evaluation of definite integrals in terms of the parameters appearing &lt;br/&gt;in them. These integrals come up in the study of particle physics and &lt;br/&gt;classical mechanics. While it is not always possible to find such an &lt;br/&gt;expression, an efficient and robust symbolic software package should &lt;br/&gt;give the result in closed-form, or decide whether such expression is &lt;br/&gt;achievable. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that will &lt;br/&gt;expand the capabilities of existing software packages that are &lt;br/&gt;widely used in industry and universities. A second goal is to develop &lt;br/&gt;mathematical theories for theoretical questions that appear in the &lt;br/&gt;development of the previously mentioned algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
