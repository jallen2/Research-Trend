    <AbstractNarration>SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a 4-5 week education and research program in field-based applied geophysics. The program has existed for 25 years and involves about 25-30 graduate and undergraduate students per year. The program includes instruction in applied geophysics, and seismic, gravity, magnetic, and electromagnetic field data collection. Students at SAGE participate in every phase of a geophysical research program including data collection, data analysis, processing, modeling and interpretation; and they present their results in both oral and written form. This 2-year project supports the 5 additional students per year in the summer field program (4 weeks) and in a one-week follow-up workshop designed to extend and enhance the students' research experiences on geothermal research through additional analyses of the data collected during the summer. REU students at SAGE come from a variety of institutions ranging from small liberal arts colleges to large research universities. Student career goals are solidified from information and experiences included in SAGE through the significant participation of industry, government, national laboratory and academic professionals. The follow-up workshop is also used to provide additional professional development of the REU students through assisting them in preparation of an oral or poster presentation of research results to be given at a future professional meeting. Support for about ten of the REU students to attend a professional meeting is included in the project. This project is supported in collaboration with the Department of Energy, Office of Geothermal Technologies Program.</AbstractNarration>
