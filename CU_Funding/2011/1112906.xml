    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to use seismic data to image Earth &lt;br/&gt;structure and seismic sources based on modern numerical methods and &lt;br/&gt;imaging techniques. We will further develop and enhance software for the &lt;br/&gt;simulation of 3D seismic wave propagation, with a particular emphasis on &lt;br/&gt;computing on Graphics Processing Units, rather than traditional Central &lt;br/&gt;Processing Units, potentially providing an order of magnitude increase &lt;br/&gt;in simulation speed. The broader impacts of the proposal include &lt;br/&gt;open-source software packages for the simulation of seismic wave &lt;br/&gt;propagation. Simulations based on these packages may be used to &lt;br/&gt;investigate seismic hazard and aid in the determination of tomographic &lt;br/&gt;images of Earth's interior and earthquake source parameters. All &lt;br/&gt;software developed during the course of the proposed research period &lt;br/&gt;will be made freely available via the Computational Infrastructure for &lt;br/&gt;Geodynamics (geodynamics.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulations of seismic wave propagation account for heterogeneity in &lt;br/&gt;Earth's crust and mantle, topography&amp; bathymetry, seismic anisotropy, &lt;br/&gt;attenuation, fluid-solid interactions, self-gravitation, rotation, and &lt;br/&gt;the oceans. The main intellectual merit of this project revolves around &lt;br/&gt;harnessing the power of the forward modeling tools to enhance the &lt;br/&gt;quality of images of Earth's interior and the earthquake rupture &lt;br/&gt;process. The approach is to minimize remaining between simulated and &lt;br/&gt;observed seismograms based on so-called adjoint techniques in &lt;br/&gt;combination with conjugate gradient methods, an approach we refer to as &lt;br/&gt;"adjoint tomography". Specifically, following a successful application &lt;br/&gt;in southern California, we will 1) develop open-source GPU-based forward &lt;br/&gt;and adjoint spectral-element solvers, 2) perform adjoint tomography of &lt;br/&gt;Europe, 3) further develop noise cross-correlation tomography based on &lt;br/&gt;adjoint methods, 4) move towards adjoint tomography of the entire &lt;br/&gt;planet, and 5) extend the southern California and global "ShakeMovie" &lt;br/&gt;cyber infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
