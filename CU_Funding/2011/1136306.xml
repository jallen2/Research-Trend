    <AbstractNarration>The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), in partnership with the national nonprofit Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages, Inc. (TESOL, Inc.), is developing the TESOL components of a new teacher preparation program. In response to the New York State Board of Regents' recent decision to authorize non-traditional entities such as informal science education institutions (ISEs) to develop teacher preparation programs, AMNH is developing the capacity to offer a program that would allow teacher candidates to earn a NYS Board of Regents-awarded Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree with a Specialization in Earth Science teaching for grades 7-12. The unique resources AMNH bring to bear on the MAT program include (1) a scientific staff of more than 200, (2) a staff of doctoral-level education and pedagogy professionals, (3) a history of providing content-rich professional development opportunities to teachers, (4) a track record of partnering with host public schools to improve student achievement, (5) experience using mentors to aid students and teachers through prior NSF investments, and (6) its vast collections, research facilities/laboratories, and exhibition halls. The 15-month, 36-credit academic program, offered jointly by faculty in the fully accredited AMNH Richard Gilder Graduate School and the AMNH Education Department, includes coursework in science content and pedagogy, summer teaching and science practicum residencies at AMNH, and mentored school-based residencies in six high-needs host schools in the NYC region. AMNH is working with TESOL, Inc. to infuse the following TESOL components into its MAT program: (1) preparation of Museum and school mentors to support teacher candidates in meeting English Language Learner (ELL) needs, (2) baseline analysis of ELL demographics, resources, and needs in host schools, and (3) support in ELL instruction for AMNH science and education faculty through professional development and the creation of a TESOL resource collection. The MAT program presents a model for how a nonprofit such as TESOL, Inc. can work with a combined ISE and Institute of Higher Education to improve ELL achievement across the nation. Leveraging the unique resources of a science museum for teacher preparation, the project also contributes to education reform more broadly by strengthening the formal role of science-based cultural institutions in improving the teaching and learning of science.</AbstractNarration>
