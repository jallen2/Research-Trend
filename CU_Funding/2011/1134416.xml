    <AbstractNarration>1134416&lt;br/&gt;Lin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being able to both control and monitor neuronal activity is critical for learning how neuronal&lt;br/&gt;circuits process information and make decisions. However, while powerful tools to control neuronal firing&lt;br/&gt;using genetically encoded light-activated channels have recently been developed, limitations of current&lt;br/&gt;genetically encoded sensors of neuronal activity severely restrict their use for monitoring brain function.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, calcium sensors are slow and cannot report on subthreshold depolarizations. While voltage&lt;br/&gt;sensors could in principle be used to follow fast trains of action potentials and monitor subthreshold&lt;br/&gt;depolarizations, the low dynamic range of existing sensors makes them unsuitable for most experiments&lt;br/&gt;in vivo. Moreover, there are presently no calcium or voltage sensors that are efficiently excited by red&lt;br/&gt;(&gt;550nm) wavelengths, a region of the spectrum that would enable their concurrent use with blue/greenabsorbing&lt;br/&gt;light-activated channels.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to address these needs by developing a new generation of genetically&lt;br/&gt;encoded voltage biosensors with significantly improved dynamic range and speed and the ability to be&lt;br/&gt;used concurrently with light-activated channels. This work will enable finer and more powerful functional&lt;br/&gt;dissection of the nervous system, while also establishing new protein engineering methods. The expertise&lt;br/&gt;of the lab in fluorescent proteins engineering will be leveraged to educate future scientists and engineers&lt;br/&gt;about research in protein engineering, and to introduce educators to the utility of genetically encoded&lt;br/&gt;biosensors for teaching scientific concepts in laboratory courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The engineering objective of this proposal is to apply knowledge of fluorescence spectroscopy&lt;br/&gt;and protein structure to quantitatively improve the performance of an existing class of voltage sensors&lt;br/&gt;(Aim 1) and to develop an entirely new class of voltage sensors (Aim 2). In the first aim, we will increase&lt;br/&gt;dynamic range via rational optimization of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent&lt;br/&gt;proteins linked to a voltage sensing domain. In the second aim, we will use a conformationally sensitive&lt;br/&gt;red fluorescent protein to report on movements of a voltage sensing domain with rapid kinetics. For both&lt;br/&gt;aims, we will employ rational design combined with comprehensive saturation mutagenesis and screening&lt;br/&gt;of important sites.&lt;br/&gt;This project will be a pioneering study in molecular engineering in two ways. It will be the first to&lt;br/&gt;rationally apply predictions from modeling of Förster resonance energy transfer to identify the factors&lt;br/&gt;limiting the fluorescence output response, and then to perform protein engineering to comprehensively&lt;br/&gt;address those factors. Second, this project will be the first to combine comprehensive screening with&lt;br/&gt;atomic-level structural knowledge of sensing domains and fluorescent proteins in order to create an&lt;br/&gt;entirely new class of allosteric voltage sensors; this research will thus give insight on the relative&lt;br/&gt;usefulness of prior knowledge and screening to the engineering of genetically encoded biosensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Voltage sensors developed through this project will be promptly disseminated to the larger&lt;br/&gt;scientific community. These sensors will have a broad impact on the field of neuroscience by enabling&lt;br/&gt;robust voltage sensing and concurrent control and readout of neuronal activity. Our work will also impact&lt;br/&gt;the field of bioengineering by validating concepts and establishing strategies for how to optimize the&lt;br/&gt;design of fluorescent protein-based sensors using energy transfer or allostery.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will provide an excellent opportunity to introduce undergraduates and high&lt;br/&gt;school students, including students from disadvantaged backgrounds, to research in molecular&lt;br/&gt;bioengineering. It will also provide the opportunity to introduce educators to the use of genetically&lt;br/&gt;encoded biosensing to create exciting laboratory lessons that teach important basic concepts while&lt;br/&gt;demonstrating the results of recent research in protein engineering.</AbstractNarration>
