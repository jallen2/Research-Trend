    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Advanced Vehicle and Extreme Environment Electronics (CAVE) located at Auburn University. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of proposed research is to develop fundamental understanding of failure mechanics of extreme environment electronics under overlapping stresses of high temperature, cyclic thermal stresses, shock and vibration. The proposed research will target the development of methodologies for prediction of damage initiation and progression for multi-mode competing failure locations in and the vicinity of board-level interconnects. Fundamental understanding of the high-strain rate material and interface behavior will be developed under sequential and simultaneous exposure of stresses. Damage equivalence relationships and survivability envelopes will be developed using pre-cursors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is envisioned that the proposed research will result in development of key enabling methodologies which are scalable to a wide array of extreme environment applications. Examples include automotive and avionic systems which are subjected to simultaneous temperature and transient dynamic loads. &lt;br/&gt;Increased use of sensors and controls in automotive applications has resulted in significant emphasis on the deployment of electronics directly mounted on the engine and transmission. The broader impact and outreach activities will include, (a) Initiation of undergraduate students, women and under-represented minorities in research. (b) Partner with the Womens Leadership Institute at Auburn University (c) Organization of topical-session at the ASME Congress (IMECE) (d) Incorporation of research results in extreme environment applications in cooperation with leading manufacturers which are industrial members of the NSF Center for Advanced Vehicle Electronics (CAVE3). (f) Introduction of K-12 school children to electronics through lab tours and in-class presentations.</AbstractNarration>
