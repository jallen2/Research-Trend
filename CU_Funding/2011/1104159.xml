    <AbstractNarration>MATEC NetWorks is an Advanced Technological Education (ATE) National Resource Center that supports teaching about semiconductors, automated manufacturing, and electronics. In addition to faculty development opportunities, the center provides venues for creating, sharing, and using its collection of digital resources. These include a web site; a digital online library of classroom-ready technology lessons and other pedagogical resources; a web seminar series; a virtual community with forums; and a national conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center continues to provide resources to technical and community college programs across the country and expects to expand services with an additional focus on students and impact measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this effort there are four major goals for the project: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goal 1: Expand the contribution to and usage of the Digital Resource Library by the technician education community. This goal is focused on developing enhanced Digital Library resources and services. &lt;br/&gt;Goal 2: Establish effective approaches and programs for broadly disseminating learning material and faculty professional development. This goal is focused on Dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;Goal 3: Accelerate the ability of the technician education community to adapt as learner needs and technologies change. The focus is on of technician education. &lt;br/&gt;Goal 4: Identify and apply appropriate frameworks for evaluation. This goal is focused on the impact of NetWorks' activities on improving student, faculty and technician learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Focus on Use and Usability &lt;br/&gt;The goals and objectives lead to the generation and acquisition of resources and to an integrated approach to implementation of those resources. The strategies, events, webinars, podcasts, conferences and other activities all focus on helping the community utilize the resources and services to enhance the content of and pedagogical approaches to STEM technician education programs and curricula. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Exemplary Resource Collection Influences Teaching &amp; Learning &lt;br/&gt;NetWorks' collection of classroom-ready technology lessons and pedagogical resources are accessed by an increasing number of users each month.
