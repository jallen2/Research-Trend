    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1159830&lt;br/&gt;Karabacak, Tansel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology stands unprecedented as one of the most promising alternative energy systems for an environmentally friendly, sustainable energy economy. PEM fuel cells can operate with various types of energy carriers including hydrogen, ethanol, and methanol. However, conventional PEM fuel cell electrodes, which are comprised of carbon supported platinum catalyst nanoparticles, suffer from several key limitations that include sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and high Pt loadings at the cathode, agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, oxidation of carbon support, separation of carbon over time from the membrane, and poor catalyst-carbon support stability. To overcome these limitations of the traditional cathode catalyst, Prof. Tansel Karabacak of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock proposes to employ a new nanostructured PEM fuel cell electrode design comprised of single layer carbon-free catalyst nanorod arrays with extremely low Pt loadings, controlled porosity, ideal alloy compositions, and with preferred crystal orientations for enhanced ORR electrochemical activity. Karabacak will use a combination of recently developed small angle deposition (SAD) and glancing angle deposition (GLAD) techniques for the fabrication of the nanorod PEM fuel cell electrodes.The proposal offers a method of material production that is based on very specific catalyst preparation methodology. It combines synthesis and fuel cell performance measurements in a useful manner.The electro-catalysis experimentation will be done in conjunction with an expert at Argonne National Labs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of fuel cell electro-catalysis is one of considerable importance in the overall national energy endeavor. The proposed work can lead to the development of new nanoscale electrode catalyst structures which enhance ORR activity, have improved durability, can be utilized with ultra-low platinum loadings, and can maximize the power/effective surface area of the catalyst, thus reducing PEM fuel cell cost. This approach can avoid the issues associated with conventional carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles, unsupported Pt-black, and polycrystalline continuous Pt thin film approaches. Therefore, this work has the potential to result in a significant advance in fuel cell catalysis and electrode development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal also incorporates the plans for a mentoring and outreach infrastructure for energy related research through UALR. This plan includes an educational collaboration and interaction among the students, faculty, teachers, and parents at UALR and the LISA Academy Charter School. It outlines an organized system of student education and mentoring, equipment and knowledge share, preparation towards science competitions, dissemination of research activities, and channels of increasing the awareness of public in energy research in the area of central Arkansas. In addition, UALR educates more minority students than any other institution in Arkansas. Hence, the proposed effort has a strong potential of benefiting the students coming from underrepresented groups, where the project will employ minority and female undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
