    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the international summer school and conference "Building Bridges: 1st EU/US conference on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics," which will take place July 30 -- August 10, 2012 at RWTH Aachen University (webpage: http://www.af-bridges.matha.rwth-aachen.de/). Grant funds will be used to enable US-based researchers to participate in this international summer school and meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of automorphic forms is a rich research area with deep links to different fields of mathematics and physics. Current research on automorphic forms is particularly impacted by "Borcherds products and applications," "Modular symbols," and "Theta blocks," the topics of the three mini-courses of the summer school. Each mini-course is led by a team of two internationally established researchers and consists of two 90-minute lectures each morning and problem sessions and homework in the afternoons.The conference will provide an important and timely opportunity for participants to start new collaborations and strengthen existing collaborations. International connections between senior researchers indirectly benefit students and post-docs, who may later visit institutions abroad to give talks, study, or hold visiting positions. Junior participants will be able to start new projects with international experts at a critical stage in their careers.</AbstractNarration>
