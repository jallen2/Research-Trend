    <AbstractNarration>In recent years, code-injection attacks have become one of the most&lt;br/&gt;common forms of attack on modern computer systems. At a high level,&lt;br/&gt;code-injection attacks on network services (e.g. file sharing and&lt;br/&gt;webservers) and client-based programs (e.g., browsers and document&lt;br/&gt;viewers) enable redirection of the flow of execution in the vulnerable&lt;br/&gt;program to arbitrary code, called shellcode, which is provided as part&lt;br/&gt;of the attack. The injected code often enables unauthorized control of&lt;br/&gt;system resources, applications, and data. The key to detecting these&lt;br/&gt;attacks lies in accurately discovering the presence of the shellcode&lt;br/&gt;being injected into the vulnerable program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of this research is to design, implement, and deploy a new&lt;br/&gt;framework, called ShellOS, that continuously analyzes network streams&lt;br/&gt;or program buffers to detect the presence of executable code that may&lt;br/&gt;be harmful. The proposed approach addresses the shortcomings of&lt;br/&gt;current dynamic analysis techniques that use software-based CPU&lt;br/&gt;emulation for detecting shellcode. Unlike previous approaches, this approach takes&lt;br/&gt;advantage of hardware virtualization to allow for more efficient and&lt;br/&gt;accurate inspection of buffers by directly executing instruction&lt;br/&gt;sequences on the CPU. In doing so, this project enables more scalable&lt;br/&gt;techniques for protecting cyberinfrastructure against code injection&lt;br/&gt;attacks. Where possible, the project also plans to release anonymized forms of&lt;br/&gt;detected attacks. The availability of such data can play a significant&lt;br/&gt;role in fostering collaboration and ensuring U.S. technical leadership&lt;br/&gt;in network security research. The tools created as part of this&lt;br/&gt;project will be made available to the broader research community under&lt;br/&gt;an open source license.</AbstractNarration>
