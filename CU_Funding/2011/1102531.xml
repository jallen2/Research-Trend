    <AbstractNarration>The University of California-Irvine, lead instituion for the University of California System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP), a senior alliance, will continue to conduct recruitment and retention activities over the next five years to produce highly competitive students from historically underrepresented minority populations, mostly Hispanic-Americans, in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) for the 21st Century workforce. The University of California-Merced joins eight other UC campuses (Berkeley, Davis, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Irvine, Riverside and San Diego)in implementing successful practices such as peer-mentoring, faculty mentored research, collaborative learning, undergraduate national and international research to increase STEM degree production. This alliance of institutions will continue linkages with California community colleges to increase student transfer rates to 4-year baccalaureate-producing institutions. Planned activities to stimulate community college transfer include annual "STEM Transfer Days", partnerships with the Alliance for Regional Collaboration to Heighten Educational Success (ARCHES), MESA, and other federal, state and local educational organizations devoted to supporting pre-college and undergraduate education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAMP provides the tools and support for minority students to overcome traditional barriers. With a common vision and collective effort, CAMP has become the University's premier systemwide program to raise academic performance and full participation in university life. Academic socialization together with professionalization is embedded in all student development activities from entering freshmen to enrollment in graduate education. Faculty mentored laboratory research is a key component, resulting in increased student connectivity to the discipline, subject mastery, and a strong propensity to prepare for graduate school, particularly the Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institutional commitment to increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities completing programs in STEM will continue. The University of California LSAMP has sustained a 2:1 ratio of support to NSF funding, representing an unparalleled effort for institutionalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAMP's effectiveness stems from connectivity among partners and significant, sustained commitment of STEM deans, faculty, and program staff, supported by the University's top-level leadership. From baseline year the minority STEM baccalaureate degree completion rate has increased 168% and minority STEM enrollment increased 182%. CAMP has played a strong role in these outcomes. The Alliance has fostered local, regional, and national synergistic relationships that enable an effective infrastructure within California higher education and among LSAMP-funded institutions nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
