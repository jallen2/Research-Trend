    <AbstractNarration>Two international scientific meetings will be supported at the University of Michigan in July, 2011: the inaugural meeting of the North American Society for Comparative Endocrinology (NASCE 2011), and the 7th International Symposium on Amphibian and Reptilian Endocrinology and Neurobiology (ISAREN 2011). The NASCE is a new scientific society formed in 2010 with the purpose of promoting the comparative study of hormones and hormone action. This includes topics in evolutionary, environmental (including endocrine disrupters), general and biomedical endocrinology/neuroendocrinology. The ISAREN was formed in 1992 to promote the study of the endocrinology and neurobiology of amphibians and reptiles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NASCE 2011 and ISAREN 2011 meetings will revitalize and strengthen the field of comparative endocrinology in North America by bringing together students, young investigators, and trainees from diverse areas and backgrounds to exchange ideas and to establish and strengthen collaborations. We promote diversity in our field of science as well as diversity of scientific topics in the meeting program, and we provide significant opportunities for groups traditionally underrepresented in science to attend the meeting. Meeting abstracts will be published in the open access journal Frontiers in Endocrinology, and the plenary lectures and selected symposium presentations will be published in the journal General and Comparative Endocrinology. This will allow for the presentations to be widely disseminated to the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
