    <AbstractNarration>While many measures could immediately reduce the environmental burden of disease, making such changes requires scientific literacy that informs environmentally-driven decision making. The purpose of the "Breathe, Eat, Touch" project is to use environmental health as a strategy to transform undergraduate education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and create a broadly educated citizenry that understands the intersection of natural sciences and the mathematical science of public health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the interdisciplinary team of investigators is developing, implementing, and evaluating an environmental health learning experience that exemplifies STEM education in the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. One outcome is a collection of new undergraduate environmental health learning resources that are portable and transferable, inquiry-based, and experiential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* engaging students in the design and implementation of new learning materials for classroom and laboratory-based courses;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* deepening students' understanding and enhancing ownership of material by developing a database of service learning opportunities where undergraduates develop resources to enhance STEM education in secondary schools and other community-based programs;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* enhancing the pedagogical skills of faculty through workshops on best practices in teaching;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* developing cross-disciplinary faculty knowledge in chemistry, biology, and epidemiology through an integrated team-teaching experience;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* assessing student learning gains with and without a formal laboratory component, and assessing effective practices in interdisciplinary teaching; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* disseminating the "Breathe, Eat, Touch" approach and resources to two-year and four-year postsecondary institutions through print and online mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>
