    <AbstractNarration>The lowest layers of the atmosphere and their interactions with underlying complex terrain significantly influence forecasts of weather, distributions of aerosols and associated restrictions to visibility, and behavior of the earth's climate system. In recent years field studies have produced a wealth of data on the lower atmosphere over mountainous terrain. The goals of this project are to exploit these untapped data to 1) determine and quantify the spatial and temporal variability of aerosol and convective boundary layer structure in mountainous terrain and to identify the multi-scale processes responsible for this variability, 2) evaluate and improve numerical model representations of transport and mixing processes and associated orographic controls on aerosol distributions and convective boundary layer structure, and 3) create engaging experiences for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students that will allow them acquire and apply scientific inquiry skills. This effort will utilize existing surface and airborne data sets including those from the T-REX (Terrain-induced Rotors Experiment) in which Doppler lidars play a critical role, as well as more comprehensive measurements from orbital platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this effort centers on development of more comprehensive data-driven descriptions of convectively-modified atmospheric behavior over complex terrain as well as new approaches for improved numerical representation of the effects of mountains on the lower atmosphere in regional and global models. Broader impacts of this effort will include significant learning experiences created through 1) the development of online modules enabling and encouraging scientific inquiry, 2) partnerships fostering national and international collaboration, and 3) hands-on activities involving field work and atmospheric modeling. A new meteorological facility in the Shenandoah National Park of Virginia is at the core of the hands-on student educational component of this effort, and will also allow for outreach to park visitors. National and international collaboration will take place with short-term visits from international research fellows and underrepresented undergraduate students during five summers. The development of online modules, hands-on experiences and national and international collaboration will promote lasting knowledge of scientific principles in mountain meteorology. In the longer term, results from this study will be relevant for a wide range of applications including weather prediction, regional and global climate, and air quality management.</AbstractNarration>
