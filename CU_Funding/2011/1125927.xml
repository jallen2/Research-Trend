    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports the acquisition of a variable-pressure scanning electron microscope (SEM), an effective, modern research tool that provides high quality imaging of surface features of specimens that are too small to be observed with the unaided eye or a traditional light microscope. This SEM also contains a microanalysis system which when used in conjunction with the SEM can determine qualitatively the elemental composition of a specimen. The instrumentation will enhance faculty research in the fields of biology, geology and atmospheric sciences. Faculty and undergraduate research students will investigate the elemental composition and surface morphology of cuticular structures of arthropods (i.e. reproductive anatomy of Neotropical spiders and harvestmen), gastropod radulae, vertebrate teeth, clays, sandstones, and particulates from aerosols (soot vs. salt crystals). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Wesleyan College (VWC) is a small, liberal arts college with a diverse student body. The acquisition of the state-of-the-art SEM will increase the quality of undergraduate research training opportunities at the college for minorities, women and physically-challenged students. The SEM will substantially improve the visibility of the natural science programs at VWC, supporting collaborations between the college's faculty, students, and other scientists in southeastern Virginia. The SEM will be used in an upper level research methods course to be offered during the college's three week Winter Session. One of the goals of this course will be to attract and introduce students to SEM early in their educational career. Subsequently, as juniors and seniors, these students can use the instrumentation in their undergraduate research projects. In an effort to bolster recruitment of students into STEM disciplines, the SEM will also be used during the summer months in programs designed specifically to provide exposure for local high school students to the scientific research enterprise.</AbstractNarration>
