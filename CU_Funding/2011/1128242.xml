    <AbstractNarration>The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) Research Conference Center will continue in its mission of promoting focused collaborative research on important topics from all areas of the mathematical sciences. These workshops are distinguished by their emphasis on identifying key problems in a given field and in establishing teams of researchers to work collaboratively toward resolving these problems. The workshop topics encompass outstanding fundamental problems as well as important applied and interdisciplinary problems facing 21st century mathematical scientists. In addition to conducting 20 workshops annually, AIM will run 30 Structured Quartet Research Ensembles per year; these are groups of four to six mathematical scientists who have an ambitious research goal and meet for a week at a time at AIM, multiple times over a multi-year period. AIM has committed to increasing diversity in the mathematical sciences workplace and has put a structure in place to ensure that such diversity occurs in all of AIM's programs. In addition, AIM holds special workshops that directly address workforce issues and strives to ensure that the discipline has a healthy pipeline to the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Institute of Mathematics was founded with the goal of fostering mathematical research through collaboration. AIM's guiding premise is that collaboration is essential to the development of modern mathematics, where the depth and breadth of fields have become so great that understanding the connections between various mathematical areas is increasingly difficult, yet many of the most important and interesting developments occur at the confluence of different research areas. AIM has created a collaborative model for workshops that facilitates collaboration, bridging the gap between the various subject areas and between the different mathematical communities. This model is complemented by the Structured Quartet Research Ensembles (SQuaREs) program, which hosts smaller groups of four to six participants to work on ambitious projects over a three-year period. The American Institute of Mathematics Research Conference Center will host 20 AIM-style workshops (each with up to thirty participants) and 30 SQuaREs per year.</AbstractNarration>
