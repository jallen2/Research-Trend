    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates how interactions on social media such as Facebook (FB) impacted the behavior of people affected by the tornado that hit Tuscaloosa, AL on April, 27, 2011. It will examine how interactions on FB influenced preparations prior to the disaster (e.g., by influencing people to take cover), the mobilization of recovery efforts (e.g., by spreading information on recovery efforts) and the psychological functioning of victims (e.g., by communicating with friends and family and providing social support). FB posts will be qualitatively analyzed to determine (a) the spread of information (contagiousness); (b) normative expectations; and (c) emotional functioning and support provided at each time point. A subsequent survey will examine how FB usage (past and present) impacts on psychological functioning three and six months after the storm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project will provide new scientific knowledge about how social influence processes affect perceived social support and psychological well being after disasters. Specifically, the project will extend the prior literature on social networks by (a) examining the impact of social influence processes as well as the spread of images on coping in online social networks such as FB; (b) focusing on the warning phase of an impending disaster in addition to the aftermath; (c) examine both the victims of the disaster as well as members of their social networks and how appeals for social and monetary support spread; and (d) assessing individual coping at multiple time points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The results will provide new insights into how to optimize communication after disaster, leading to better preparation, better mobilization of recovery efforts, and better psychological coping. Results will be disseminated widely to disaster planners, researchers and practitioners through conference presentations, journal publications, data sharing, and via a dedicated website disseminating the methodology and results of the project. In addition, the project will help train new investigators in the area of crisis communication, will fuel student theses and dissertations, and will provide mentorship opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
