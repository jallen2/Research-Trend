    <AbstractNarration>Computing has enabled immense innovations in many fields and social&lt;br/&gt;life due to continued performance, power, and cost improvements&lt;br/&gt;enabled by technology scaling. Unfortunately, two key trends threaten&lt;br/&gt;performance and cost improvement of computers going into the&lt;br/&gt;future. First, technology scaling is at jeopardy, leading to major&lt;br/&gt;challenges in power consumption, reliability, and performance. Second,&lt;br/&gt;power and energy consumption has become a key constraint, yet existing&lt;br/&gt;systems are mostly designed in a one-size-fits-all way agnostic to the&lt;br/&gt;needs of different applications. To overcome both problems, this&lt;br/&gt;research investigates novel uses of heterogeneous technologies in&lt;br/&gt;three key components of a computing system: cores, interconnect, and&lt;br/&gt;memory. The approach taken is an application-driven approach that aims&lt;br/&gt;to seamlessly integrate heterogeneity in the three components. Major&lt;br/&gt;expected contributions of the research include: (1) an initial study&lt;br/&gt;of first-principles based and application-driven design of cores, (2)&lt;br/&gt;new mechanisms for enabling phase-change memory based heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;main memory, (3) exploration of tradeoffs in the design of&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional optical interconnects, (4) initial exploration of the&lt;br/&gt;interaction of heterogeneous components in cores, interconnect, and&lt;br/&gt;memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has the potential to transform the design and&lt;br/&gt;architecture of future multi-core systems, which are already a part of&lt;br/&gt;the entire IT sector and our daily lives. It can enable overcoming key&lt;br/&gt;challenges that impediment higher-performance and lower-power&lt;br/&gt;lower-cost computing, which has traditionally enabled new applications&lt;br/&gt;and discoveries. Enabling fundamentally efficient heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;multi-core systems can largely reduce energy and technology-scaling&lt;br/&gt;costs of computing, and improve dependability and performance. Direct&lt;br/&gt;transfer of many ideas to industry are expected through extensive&lt;br/&gt;collaborations with platform and chip design industries.</AbstractNarration>
