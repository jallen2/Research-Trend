    <AbstractNarration>Local Artin root numbers whose existence were established by Langlands and Deligne (in some cases earlier by Dwork) are crucial objects in establishing the local Langlands correspondence between n-dimensional continuous representations of the Weil-Deligne group over a local field F and irreducible admissible representations of GL(n,F). In fact, a unique correspondence is obtained only after the root numbers and L-functions attached to tensor products of representations of Weil group are shown to equal to those defined by Rankin product factors for corresponding representations of two GL(.,F). There are some other instances where these objects are defined for representaions of GL(n,F) such as exterior square and symmetric square representations of GL(n,C), as well exterior cube when n is less than or equal to 8 by means of the Langlands-Shahidi method. As the first topic in this proposal, the investigator will study a robust technique which can be used to prove the equality of these factors by those defined for Weil group through the correspondence. Techniques involved are a deformation argument as well as a generalized Shalika germ expansion for Bessel functions by Jacquet and Ye which seems to be amenable to generalization to other groups. He will also use Arthur's results in his upcoming book to resolve certain questions concerning the Langlands packet attached to an Arthur packet, as well as certain arithmetic questions (Weyl laws) for classical groups, and their generalizations to general spin groups. Computing the residues of intertwining operators for classical groups in terms of endoscopy which he has been pursuing in collaboration for many years, should also benefit from Arthur's character indentities which he will explore as part of this project. He will also study certain representation theoretic consequences of functoriality. Next he will continue his joint work on studying p-adic L-functions through the Langlands-Shahidi method, and pursue Langlands new ideas on Beyond Endoscopy and Reciprocity, as well as the possible generalization of the method to loop groups and covering groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal involves training of graduate students and postdocs and includes specific problems for them. The investigator expects several new students to join him and other members of the Number Theory group at Purdue and is involved in teaching high level courses (e.g.,p-adic L-functions, automorphic forms, representation theory of real Lie groups) to train them. Theory of Artin L-functions and its connection with reciprocity law (correspondence) of Langlands is one of the most beautiful parts of number theory which the investigator hopes can be studied by students of different level in different seminars. On another level, he is involved in organizing conferences as well as serving in editorial boards of several prominent journals as well as panels. Moreover, he remains involved in mentoring and minority hiring and currently serves on the Department's Graduate Recruitment Committee with emphasis on recruiting women and minority students.</AbstractNarration>
