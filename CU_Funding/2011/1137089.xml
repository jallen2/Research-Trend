    <AbstractNarration>1137089&lt;br/&gt;Ismagilov&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a rigorous engineering framework to enhance understanding of interspecies&lt;br/&gt;and interkingdom signaling in order to enable building of "microbiome in a pill" particles precisely&lt;br/&gt;engineered, spatially structured microbial communities encapsulated in a biocompatible material to&lt;br/&gt;ultimately prevent and treat human diseases associated with dysbiosis (microbial imbalance). This&lt;br/&gt;engineering framework will enable prediction and control of interspecies signaling and interactions both in&lt;br/&gt;vitro and in vivo by solving four challenges: Goal 1 (MIKS1a): Use computational methods to predict, for&lt;br/&gt;a given desired function, which specific microbes are needed and which spatial structures are required to&lt;br/&gt;achieve that function. Goal 2 (MIKS1b and MIKS2): Develop in vitro microfluidic technologies and&lt;br/&gt;associated design principles to understand signaling by rapidly characterizing and measuring the impact&lt;br/&gt;of spatial structure on the complex molecular interactions that underlie signaling, and host cells? response&lt;br/&gt;to signaling. Goal 3 (MIKS2 and MIKS3): Develop and test design principles for the scale up of spatially&lt;br/&gt;pre-structured microbial communities, discovered and characterized in Goals 1 and 2, to enable&lt;br/&gt;production of engineered functional communities in gram quantities needed for in vivo testing. Goal 4&lt;br/&gt;(MIKS2 and MIKS3): By using communities produced in Goal 3, and by gavaging them into germ-free&lt;br/&gt;and gnotobiotic mice, measure in vivo the function of the community and the host's response, and iterate&lt;br/&gt;with Goals 1-3 to develop a set of design rules that enable rational engineering of spatially pre-structured&lt;br/&gt;"microbiome in a pill" particles that predictably function in vivo in a mammalian gut.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The importance of multi-species and inter-kingdom systems and their signaling is&lt;br/&gt;widely appreciated but general engineering approaches for control of such systems are urgently needed.&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes that signaling and interactions can be precisely engineered via a biomimetic&lt;br/&gt;approach control of spatial structure. This is a potentially transformative shift in understanding how&lt;br/&gt;signaling, metabolic exchange, and function of communities are controlled. The mammalian microbiome&lt;br/&gt;is an excellent test system because it contains a diverse number of species interacting with one another&lt;br/&gt;and the host. This work will lay the foundation for a new engineering paradigm, a "microbiome in a pill",&lt;br/&gt;and establish design principles for controlling signaling and metabolic exchange within the community,&lt;br/&gt;between the community and competitors, and between the community and the host. Engineering&lt;br/&gt;communities with spatial structure may close important gaps in understanding the mechanisms of&lt;br/&gt;dysbiosis and manipulating communities affected by dysbiosis, ultimately leading to more effective&lt;br/&gt;prophylactics and treatments for human disease. The assembled team is well-qualified to carry out the&lt;br/&gt;proposed work: The PI has expertise in microfluidic technology development, and analysis and modeling&lt;br/&gt;of complex networks in biological contexts. Co-PIs Meyer and Henry are experts in automated annotation&lt;br/&gt;of metagenomic datasets and in using these annotations to create and analyze genome-scale metabolic&lt;br/&gt;models. Co-PIs Chervonsky and Mazmanian are experts in the use of germ-free and gnotobiotic animal&lt;br/&gt;models to understand the impact of microbiota in the mammalian gut on the host immune system.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Ultimately, the simple yet precisely engineered "microbiome in a pill" communities&lt;br/&gt;designed in this work could dramatically improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs by modulating&lt;br/&gt;dysbiosis in the context of conditions affecting millions of Americans: IBD, infections, diabetes,&lt;br/&gt;autoimmune conditions, and obesity. This approach may pioneer new solutions for problems where&lt;br/&gt;genetically modified microorganisms are not acceptable or feasible. The design rules for building&lt;br/&gt;functional microbial communities developed here should have broad impact outside of human health, with&lt;br/&gt;the potential to address numerous issues facing society today, including environmental contaminants,&lt;br/&gt;climate, and food and fuel production, which are all strongly impacted by the function of microbial&lt;br/&gt;communities. The project will provide education, training, and mentoring for graduate and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdoctoral scholars, enhanced by the PI's excellent track record in mentoring students.&lt;br/&gt;This project will also provide researchers with numerous tools to study and use microbial communities for&lt;br/&gt;specific functions. Co-PIs Meyer and Henry have extensive track records in disseminating computational&lt;br/&gt;methods and tools, and the PI has an excellent track record of disseminating knowledge via high-impact&lt;br/&gt;publications and partnerships with industry. This project will support public outreach through REEL&lt;br/&gt;Science, hands-on science for K-12 curriculum development through CalTech Classroom Connection,&lt;br/&gt;and research training for teachers and high school students through the Summer Research Connection.</AbstractNarration>
