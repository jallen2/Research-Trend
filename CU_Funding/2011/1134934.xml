    <AbstractNarration>The investigators are organizing the Second Workshop on Computational Issues in Nonlinear Control, which will be held in Monterey, California during the first half of November, 2011. This workshop will bring together top researchers in the areas of numerical methods for nonlinear control as well as related areas of computational methods. This will include researchers from the US, Europe and Australia. Further, a significant portion of the workshop attendees will include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. Researchers from lesser-known institutions within the southwestern US, specifically including members of the CalState system will be invited as well. In addition to the PI, Prof. W. McEneaney (UC San Diego), the organizers include Profs. W. Kang and A.J. Krener of the Naval Postgraduate School. The website of the conference is http://www.nps.edu/Academics/Schools/GSEAS/Departments/Math/pdf_sources/MWCINC2.pdf .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major developments in the theory of nonlinear control began taking place roughly a half-century ago. Of course, further advances in the theory have been made since. However, over the intervening decades, application of this theory has seriously lagged due to the lack of sufficiently fast and robust associated numerical methods. A particularly vexing problem has been the so-called curse-of-dimensionality, which loosely speaking, refers to the fact that standard numerical methods for these problems have been such that the computational requirements grow exponentially with problem complexity. In fact, numerous advances in control were partly motivated as means for avoiding this numerical bottleneck. In recent years, a number of remarkable new approaches have been developed to combat the fundamental computational difficulties. At this workshop, we will share ongoing developments in order to accelerate this progress.</AbstractNarration>
