    <AbstractNarration>This study will examine the distribution of silica production among diatom species, using a novel combination of existing approaches, to evaluate the contributions of specific species or genera to total diatom silica production. Specific hypotheses regarding the distribution of silica production among species of diatoms will be tested by exploiting the strong contrasts in diatom community structure and silica production between a coastal upwelling system and in an oligotrophic subtropical gyre. Several lines of evidence support the idea that the diatoms responsible for the majority of silica production shifts from the most numerically abundant species in coastal systems to relatively rare, but very large, cells in offshore oligotrophic environments. This shift alters the role of diatoms in regional food webs and because many processes determining the role of phytoplankton groups in biogeochemical cycles are a function of cell size, such a shift has strong implications for regional differences in the contribution of diatoms to upper-ocean carbon cycling and the biological pump. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study also seeks to understand of the role of silicon limitation in regulating diatom silica production at the species level. Si limitation of silica production has been detected in every system examined to date, ranging from the high Si waters of the Antarctic, to coastal upwelling systems and the oligotrophic subtropical gyres. Field studies of Si limitation are rarely accompanied by examination of the species present. When studies do have taxonomic data the lack of information on the performance of individual species makes it impossible to allocate the measured rates among cells, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions about the contribution of specific diatom groups to community composite rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will test five hypotheses. Each is related to the general theme of using species-specific data to improve understanding of the factors regulating diatoms' role in marine food webs. By combining bulk measures of silica production using the radioisotope 32Si with quantitative measures of silicon deposition rates by individual cells using the fluorescent probe 2-(4-pyridyl)-5((4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl-aminocarbamoyl)-methoxy)phenyl)oxazole, or PDMPO, the following will be determined: species-specific diatom contributions to total community silica production, regional differences in the distribution of silica production among diatom species as a function of cell size, species-specific kinetic parameters governing the ability of species to compete for dissolved silicon, and whether dominance of a particular diatom group or species can be explained by knowledge of their capacity to utilize Si and their numerical abundance (as opposed to other factors such as grazing or limitation by other nutrients).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Specific-specific knowledge from field assemblages will improve the understanding of the major biological and ecological drivers of organic carbon and silica production by diatoms in the sea. This dataset will also help identify key species for inclusion in food-web and biogeochemical models in coastal and oligotrophic gyre ecosystems, and test whether knowledge of diatom nutrient uptake capacity from laboratory studies are representative of diatoms in mixed communities in the field. This project will also provide research experiences for undergraduates in both the laboratory and field settings, and will include a K-12 outreach program designed in collaboration with scientific-outreach personnel from UCSB's Marine Science Institute's Oceans to Classroom (O2C) program for use in regional elementary schools. O2C currently reaches over 18,000 students in &gt;800 regional K-12 classrooms annually bringing marine science to life for students using real-life examples of marine research by UCSB PIs.</AbstractNarration>
