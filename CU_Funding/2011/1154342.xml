    <AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to academically able and financially needy students who are military veterans and who are majoring in Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Geography and Environmental Science, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. The objectives of this project are to: 1) provide academic scholarships to attain a bachelor's degree within a STEM discipline; 2) expand upon student support structures (e.g. mentoring, counseling services, student organizations, etc.) to better accommodate the needs of this growing population, and 3) assist with employment in the civilian workforce or the pursuit of STEM graduate programs after graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The academic programs into which the students go are strong. The project emphasizes supporting students through faculty mentoring, close interaction among groups of students, and internships. Local industries are supportive and are providing mentoring and internship opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is increasing the number and diversity of students who complete a STEM major and go on to work in the field or to further education. The project addresses a national issue and can serve as a model for other institutions to follow. In addition to assisting an under-served population that makes great personal sacrifices for our country, this program taps into a pool of hard-working and motivated individuals and supports efforts to increase the number of potential employees in STEM industries.</AbstractNarration>
