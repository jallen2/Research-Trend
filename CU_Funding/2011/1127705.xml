    <AbstractNarration>This AIR project will bring to commercial prototype stage a new machining-based process, Modulation-Assisted Machining (MAM), for large-volume production of metal fibers. By super imposing low-frequency modulation onto a sharp tool, individual fibers having highly uniform size and shape are created by cutting in a single-stage deformation process. The key research objectives that will be addressed in the proposed work are: 1) scalability of the production rate for creating fibers, 2) repeatability of fiber size and shape under commercial production rates; and 3) and life-cycle analysis related to the modulation device at rates typical of production. The MAM platform offers a unique ability to produce metal fibers with controlled size at high production rates compared to traditional multi-step drawing processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prototype method for large-scale production of fiber materials will be demonstrated, while transforming machining technology across business sectors and opening a new applications domain for machining production of advanced materials. MAM offers a low cost production route and a process breakthrough for producing fibers that are difficult to create using current technology. The unique particle geometries and structure created by MAM will enable new commercial opportunities for production of fiber-based products, and composite material systems. Complementing the research is an education and training program involving company internships for graduate and undergraduate students. The collaborative research will expose the students to advanced materials processing and related commercialization, and the dynamic environment of a recent manufacturing start-up company</AbstractNarration>
