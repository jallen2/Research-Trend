    <AbstractNarration>Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) is an emerging activity that involves the integration of computational modeling with the manufacturing process. It is expected to improve quality control and economic performance. The First World Congress on ICME will be held at the Seven Springs Mountain Resort. This site and the programming schedule are conducive to stimulating discussions and interactions. There will be seven internationally renowned keynote speakers, and additional oral presentations and presentations for a poster session will be selected based on the submitted abstracts. Active student participation is strongly encouraged, particularly in the poster session. An International Advisory Committee representing 14 countries is promoting the conference worldwide, and various associated international materials societies (including those from Brazil, Canada, Australia, and Japan) are promoting the conference their home countries. Participation by students, postdoctoral fellows and young faculty is being especially encouraged for the purpose of fostering future generations of the ICME workforce. NSF funding will be used to support registration fees for 20 students, 5 postdoctoral researchers, 5 young faculty, 5 keynote speakers and for partial support of the conference proceedings. The organizing committee is expected to invite candidates by contacting university departments and/or laboratories that are known to have strong programs in computational materials science and engineering. Every effort will be made to encourage candidates from underrepresented groups to apply for financial assistance.</AbstractNarration>
