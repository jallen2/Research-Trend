    <AbstractNarration>The 8th Association for Computer Machinery (ACM) Creativity &amp; Cognition Conference (C&amp;C 2011), to be held November 3-6, 2011 at the Georgia Institute of Technology, will convene a diverse group of researchers working in the areas of creativity, cognition, and computational thinking. As information technology is increasingly prevalent in creative thinking and problem solving activities, there is a growing need to study and understand creativity and computing through synergistic cross-disciplinary methods and models to advance computer science and information technology, cognitive science, engineering, design, the arts and education. The ACM C&amp;C 2011 conference theme is Creativity and Technology: to understand human creativity in its many manifestations, to design new interactive techniques and tools to augment and amplify human creativity, and to use computational media technologies to explore new creative processes and artifacts in all human endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentoring and involving young scholars is the key to seed and encourage interests and interactions across diverse disciplinary boundaries in the field of creativity and cognition. The C&amp;C 2011 Graduate Student Symposium is a full-day event for a group of twelve young scholars, in the areas of study that contribute to understanding creativity and cognition. The symposium is a forum to discuss and receive feedback and guidance from a panel of senior researchers and practitioners in a supportive setting. The recruitment of a diverse set of student participants is critical to broadening the participation and research perspectives discussed during the symposium. To attain this goal student eligibility for the symposium includes promising senior-level undergraduates. The symposium leaders have also put into place a proactive plan to recruit participants from minority-serving and undergraduate institutions. Graduate Student Symposium papers are included in the conference proceedings to integrate their research into the larger canon of research presented at the conference.</AbstractNarration>
