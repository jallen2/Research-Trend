    <AbstractNarration>Professor W. Dean Harman of the University of Virginia is supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct research that explores the ability of specially designed tungsten complexes, known as dearomatization agents, to coordinate and activate various types of aromatic molecules toward novel chemical transformations. The cornerstone of this approach is the implementation of highly pi-basic transition metal complexes that forms strong back-bonding interactions with the aromatic molecule. The research focuses on three areas: 1) the activation and manipulation of phenols and anilines 2) the activation and manipulation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and 3) the development of enantio-enriched dearomatization agents that can be used for the synthesis of enantio-enriched organic products derived from aromatic molecules. These new methodologies will be used to generate new organic compounds that will be broad-screened for biological function and medicinal value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New synthetic methods that can convert ubiquitous aromatic molecules into highly functionalized molecules provide facile routes for the preparation of new synthetic substances not readily available from other methods. In most cases, these are entirely new compounds, and are of interest to the biochemical and medicinal communities as potential leads for the development of new biological probes and medicines. The project is highly interdisciplinary, combining elements of coordination chemistry, organometallics, organic, and medicinal chemistries. As a result, Ph. D. and undergraduate students involved with this research will receive the type of broad education required for them to be successful as modern synthetic chemists.</AbstractNarration>
