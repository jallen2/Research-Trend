    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee proposes two studies to examine attrition and persistence in engineering careers. Study 1 extends Fouad and Singh's previous work on women engineering alumnae from 30 universities to male engineering alumni from the same universities, using a web-based survey, allowing comparison of attrition decisions between male and female engineers with the same educational preparation. The survey will use a modified Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) model to assess three domains of self-efficacy, three domains of outcome expectations, interests, workplace supports and barriers, job attitudes (satisfaction and commitment), cognitive and psychological withdrawal, and intentions of leaving the career or profession. Study 2 will focus on only those men and women engineers who are currently working in engineering to identify factors that influence their decisions to stay in engineering, and differences in how men and women become embedded in their careers. Job Embeddedness (JE) theory will be incorporated into the modified SCCT model as a moderator of intentions to leave. Study 2 will also use a web-based survey with members of professional engineering societies to examine self efficacy, workplace supports and barriers, job attitudes (satisfaction and commitment), job embeddedness, work engagement, cognitive and psychological withdrawal, and intentions of leaving the career or profession. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The results will offer important new insights into the distinctive and specific needs of both men and women engineers that can help organizations in designing effective career development and other work-life programs that will aid their retention efforts. Specific recommendations will be developed that will help engineers feel more connected to their profession as engineers and to their organization, thereby aiding their retention in the profession. In addition, such interventions could enhance multiple types of efficacy, job and career satisfaction, and minimize withdrawal cognitions, thereby potentially altering the trajectory of departure choices. The findings may also be used to identify strategic decision points and career stages at which interventions need to be tailored and specifically targeted to increase retention in engineering careers. The findings will also have practical guidance to educational institutions to help them better prepare students for engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
