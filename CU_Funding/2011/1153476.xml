    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1153476&lt;br/&gt;PI: Frankel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will initiate the development of a transformative calibration method for estimating surface heat flux in highly hostile thermal environments without requiring surface instrumentation. This concept has substantive merit for investigating: a) the effectiveness of thermal protection systems associated hypersonic flight vehicles or for understanding thermal efficiencies in hypersonic combustors; b) heat transfer on unreachable surface structures such as found in combustion liners, small chambers, and containment walls as a result of a hostile thermal event; and, c) heat transfer on structures emanating from pool fires or explosions. A comprehensive method is proposed that integrates physical, experimental, mathematical and computational principles. The resulting analytic formulation implicitly possesses full-sensor characterization, probe positioning, host material thermophysical properties, diffusion physics, and mathematical constants required for stable and accurate surface heat flux predictions. The new calibration method leads to a Volterra integral equation of the first kind; and, thus the coupon or specimen can be interpreted as a transducer ready for practical implementation. Further analytical and computational study is required for real-world implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal centers about critical applications for new material development involving high temperature environments. Responsive state-of-the-art accurate methods for estimating surface heat flux and temperature that includes sensor characterization still requires resolution for many applications involving highly hostile environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research effort will impact aerospace, energy, fire, combustion, geophysical, defense and national security research and developments in a timely and responsive manner.</AbstractNarration>
