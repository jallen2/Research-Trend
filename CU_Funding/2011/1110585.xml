    <AbstractNarration>This project is to support the 2011 KUMUNU conference which will be held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, April 2-3. KUMUNU is an annual weekend conference anchored by the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri-Columbia (MU) and Nebraska-Lincoln (NU), promoting interaction among researchers, post docs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines (such as algebraic geometry, K-theory and coding theory) at regional schools (which in 2009 included 23 different institutions). Although the KUMUNU triad has significant strength in these areas, geographic separation raises a hurdle to taking the most advantage of this strength. The aim of the KUMUNU conference series is to provide a cost-effective annual venue for regional researchers at various stages of their careers, including graduate students, recent Ph.D.s and faculty at non-Ph.D. granting institutions, to interact with each other, with experienced researchers based at KU, MU, NU and with a limited number of invited experts from outside the region. Travel and lodging support to facilitate participation, especially for graduate students, is a key element for KUMUNU to achieve its main goals. These include: playing a strong regional mentoring role at all levels by showcasing the research of postdocs and young faculty and by helping recent Ph.D.s and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines enrich their research programs by meeting senior researchers based at KU, MU, NU and elsewhere; and promoting research in commutative algebra by providing a venue for discussion of the latest developments in the field, for exchanging ideas and for setting the basis for future research collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The typical KUMUNU conference comprises 6 to 8 plenary talks accessible to graduate students by speakers representing a geographically diverse mix of senior researchers, young faculty and postdocs, with plenty of time reserved outside of talks for additional interaction. The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus also encourage participants to establish productive collaborative relationships. In addition to enhancing the research careers of the students and early career participants, participants from non-Ph.D. granting institutions will take ideas from the conference back to their colleagues and students to enrich teaching and research at their home institutions. The 2011 meeting is special as it will be held in conjunction with the Howard Rowlee Lecture, an endowed public lecture hosted annually by the Mathematics Department at the University of Nebraska. The 2011 Rowlee Lecture will be given by David Eisenbud, past president of the American Mathematical Society, on April 1.</AbstractNarration>
