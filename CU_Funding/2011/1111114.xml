    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the travel and maintenance costs for a project-planning visit to Vietnam and Laos. The participants are the PI, Dr. Monique Leclerc, a senior US scientist; one junior scientist, her post-doctoral associate, an Hispanic female; and four additional senior US scientists representing a complementary array of expertise as well as a broad institutional and geographical distribution across the US. This group of six US scientists will travel first to Chiang Mai, Thailand, and then on to Vientiane, Laos. In both locations, they would meet extensively with local partners to plan a large proposal to be submitted at a later date. &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this visit is to plan a comprehensive research project that, if funded, will focus on the entire Mekong River environment, including not just the hydrology and biology of the river, but also the effects of new dams upstream on agriculture, on microclimates, on forestry, on land mammals in the Mekong drainage, and on human populations. This broad-based approach to analyzing the effects of damming of the Mekong sets this project apart from so many other Mekong-based projects, and it has the potential to bring in many different partners including US and local government agencies, non-governmental organizations such as WWF and The Nature Conservancy to support planning and environmental protection as well as involvement of young researchers in a comprehensive study.</AbstractNarration>
