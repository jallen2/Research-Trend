    <AbstractNarration>New Frontiers in Nuclear Astrophysics can be opened with neutrinos, which escape from dense and distant regions, revealing the microphysics, power mechanisms, and dynamics of astrophysical sources. In turn, the extreme physical conditions of such sources probe untested ranges of neutrino properties, advancing knowledge of the weak and possible new interactions. The theoretical projects supported by this award use neutrinos and other new messengers to attack long-standing questions in nuclear astrophysics, weak interactions, and especially their connections. The primary focus is on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background, the flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos from all core collapses in the universe, a guaranteed source that is near detection. A secondary focus is on prospecting for new neutrino sources and working to move them to the detected or guaranteed category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary work of these projects connects central topics in nuclear physics to frontier research in astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics. It also connects theoretical efforts to experimental and observational efforts ranging from underground laboratories to satellite surveys. Graduate students and postdocs participating in this research will thus receive training in forefront interdisciplinary topics relevant to present and planned investments in experimental facilities. To maximize broader impacts, the proposed work includes outreach based on integrated efforts in research, mentoring, teaching, and service, including with under-served populations, especially the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.</AbstractNarration>
