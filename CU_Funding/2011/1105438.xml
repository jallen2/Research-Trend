    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, provides a combined tutorial and summer research program focused in solid-state and materials chemistry designed for rising senior or junior undergraduate students and faculty members from primarily undergraduate institutions that want to increase their knowledge of solid state chemistry. An introductory tutorial, held at the University of Oregon, immerses student and faculty participants in the concepts and applications of solid state chemistry through a series of morning lectures and afternoon hands-on laboratories. The tutorial week includes introductions and hands on use of x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis and a variety of surface analysis techniques. At the close of the tutorial, the participants disperse to their assigned host laboratory for an eight-week research session. The host laboratories are located throughout the United States. At each host laboratory, the individual participant will become an active part of the research team, working on a project assigned by the host. Participants return to Oregon at the end of the research phase for a final symposium where they share their successes, frustrations and overall experiences with their peers through presentations, a poster session and group discussions. This cements the network that formed during tutorial week, and allows the participants to see the breadth and depth of opportunities available in the field of solid state chemistry research. The goal of this program is to increase the number, diversity and caliber of young chemists pursuing graduate studies in the field of solid state and materials chemistry. The program recruits students directly from undergraduate institutions with high minority enrollments and helps faculty at these institutions to incorporate solid state chemistry into their curricula.&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, provides a combined tutorial and summer research program focused in solid-state and materials chemistry designed for rising senior or junior undergraduate students and faculty members from primarily undergraduate institutions that want to increase their knowledge of solid state chemistry. An introductory tutorial, held at the University of Oregon, immerses student and faculty participants in the concepts and applications of solid state chemistry through a series of morning lectures and afternoon hands-on laboratories. The participants get hands on experience with state of the art equipment and learn from experts. At the close of the tutorial, the participants disperse to their assigned host laboratory for an eight-week research experience.
