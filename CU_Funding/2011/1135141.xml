    <AbstractNarration>This award will support studies of organic and other aerosols and their regional impact through the integration of modeling studies with the extensive multi-platform ground-, aircraft- and satellite-based measurements obtained during the 2006 MILAGRO (Megacity Initiative: Local And Global Research Observations) Campaign in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. An updated comprehensive measurement-based emissions inventory of gases and particulate matter (PM) will be developed and will be used as input to chemical transport models. In turn, the capability of the chemical transport models to reproduce the rich MILAGRO PM and trace gas data sets will be evaluated. Chemical transport modeling studies will be conducted using a modified version of an on-line coupled Weather Research Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-CHEM). A meteorological ensemble technique will be used to investigate the meteorological impacts on PM simulations. The project will address five specific objectives: i) to improve the estimates of gaseous and PM emissions and the meteorological fields; ii) to characterize formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from different emission sources; iii) to assess the impact of biomass burning and biogenic sources on PM; iv) to quantify the relative contribution of anthropogenic vs. natural sources of PM on the regional scale; and v) to investigate the impact of urban aerosols on regional photochemistry and meteorology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide support for postdoctoral researchers. The results of this study will be of value to the scientific community, but also be used in presentations to Mexican authorities interested in regional air quality.</AbstractNarration>
