    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to design a set of comprehensive, flexible and modularized course materials and pedagogical tools for basic modern cryptography to be used in a dedicated course or courses that include a cryptography component. This work can be used in a breadth-first approach and permits instructors to teach selected topics in-depth. Students get familiar with state-of-the-art cryptography, acquire basic knowledge and skills, and are well-prepared to approach cryptographic applications with confidence. Major activities include (1) developing a web-based tutorial on cryptography, (2) implementing software tools and user guides for the software tools that support the proposed course materials, and (3) designing an environment for students to perform semester-long programming projects and to visualize important elements in cryptography. The course materials and software tools are available on the web. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two major components. The first one is a well-balanced approach with an intuitive and comprehensive web-based tutorial, a programming environment and a visualization system. Instructors may teach cryptography with a breadth-first approach and discuss selected topics in-depth, and students have a programming environment and use the visualization system to learn the inner workings of each algorithm. The second one is an extendable system that uses a layered approach and plug-ins. The system can serve as a programming/demonstration platform and as a debugging tool for instructors and students to implement their own demonstrations and visualizations. The project has a broad impact on teaching, learning and practicing cryptographic topics, and has the potential to transform the traditional dry and formal methodology into an interactive, hands-on, and visualization-based approach.</AbstractNarration>
