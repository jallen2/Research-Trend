    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program (CSDM) in the Division of Chemistry (CHE).&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The research component of this CAREER award investigates the origin of electronic properties of self-assembled monolayers and multilayers of molecules in molecular junctions. This investigation focuses on two electronic properties, multi-state conductance and rectification, and addresses the intimate connection between conductance and the vibration modes of molecular systems. These studies can provide an explanation for the dependence of molecular conductance on bias voltage and the redox states of molecules. The research aims of the project are to: (1) investigate the origin of conductance dependence on bias voltage and redox states of porphyrin monolayers in single molecule junctions, (2) identify the relationships between the vibration modes of porphyrins and its electronic properties in molecular junctions, and (3) investigate the origin of rectification in a porphyrin monolayer versus molecular multilayers. This project introduces studies that are systematically designed to identify experimental parameters that influence molecular transport properties (e.g., the dependence of thickness of molecular films on electronic behavior and the existence of vibration energies in molecular junctions). These parameters are tested using molecular break junctions, conductive atomic force microscopy, and nanogaps fabricated by electromigration.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: This research project in on electronics at the molecular level. The project supports the advancement of molecules for two-state devices and rectifiers. A better understanding of molecular transport can stimulate research in medicine (e.g., drug delivery techniques) and chemical sensors (e.g., detection of toxic gases). To cultivate a broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, the project promotes scientific training of students and broadens the participation of underrepresented groups. This is accomplished through an educational program called NOLA MOVERS, which is a summer program to support students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to participate in cutting edge research at Rensselaer. In addition, a program is introduced to Rensselaer's School of Science to retain and mobilize undeclared students.</AbstractNarration>
