    <AbstractNarration>This grant will fund the Center for Women in Mathematics at Smith. The overall goal of the Center is to increase the number of U.S. citizen women earning doctorates in the mathematical sciences by helping women make the transition from casual mathematics student to committed woman in mathematics. The main activity of the Center is to offer the nation's first post-baccalaureate program in mathematics previously established by NSF award 0602110. The post-baccalaureate program enables women who have graduated college without the necessary course work in mathematics to continue to graduate school. A secondary activity of the Center is to enrich the lives and careers of women in mathematics in the northeast through its annual WIMIN conference and additional outreach and community-building programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The post-baccalaureate program taps into the largest underutilized source of mathematical talent in the country: American women. Women earn 43% of bachelors degrees in mathematics, and yet still make up only 29% of mathematics graduate students and 17% of tenured graduate faculty. This grant funds a program that intervenes at a critical point, the transition to graduate student. The program helps women who graduated from college without the coursework and confidence necessary to succeed in graduate school. The Center maintains a stimulating and supportive environment of students, faculty and alumnae. In addition to comprehensive mentoring and a rich curriculum, the Center gives students the opportunity to do research with faculty throughout the year. The grant will also provide community and support for mathematical women at all levels. Smith College is a regional center for women mathematicians. Each year, the Center for Women in Mathematics hosts Women In Mathematics In the Northeast (WIMIN), showcasing research and offering women in the area a chance to renew ties, to network, and to seek and offer mentoring and advice. The Center also runs a growing number of outreach programs and a weekly seminar featuring northeast women mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>
