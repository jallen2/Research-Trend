    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;AST 1128864&lt;br/&gt;PI: William S. Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists at HAO and NSO, like their counterparts at many FFRDCs, have the dual responsibility to provide scientific leadership and support to the university and scientific community. Community support is provided in a variety of ways; through scientific collaboration, facility operation, instrument development, numerical model development, data analysis tool development, undergraduate and graduate student mentoring, and scientific visitor programs, to name a few. Scientific leadership in the form of cutting edge research and instrument development has been demonstrated by the staff of these organizations throughout their histories. This record of achievement is extensively documented in scientific publications and recognized through invited presentations in national and international venues as well as awards for distinguished scientific achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSO and HAO intend to sponsor a community-based workshop on their multidisciplinary activities in the post-construction ATST era. The agenda will begin with over-arching science questions, followed by a discussion of how NSO and HAO support, and can further contribute to, the community in making progress toward answering these questions. We expect that the workshop discussion will naturally include the role of the NSF in supporting community-based solar research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals of this workshop include providing input for a possible future solar science initiative within the NSF that would benefit NSO, HAO, and the research community. The workshop would involve community members from a wide range of disciplines and stakeholders in ground based solar research. The aim of the workshop is to include representation from all university departments having a significant program of solar research. The product of the workshop would be a report provided to the NSF for planning purposes and to the Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics.</AbstractNarration>
