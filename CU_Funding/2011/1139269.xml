    <AbstractNarration>The MS PHD'S in Earth System Science® Professional Development Program (MS PHD'S PDP) is promoting the advancement of underrepresented minority (URM) students and recent doctoral degree recipients in Earth system science (ESS) careers. It provides URM undergraduate and graduate students with long-term exposure to, interaction with, and increased participation in the Earth system science community. This award is supporting one new cohort of 25 MS PHD'S PDP student participants. MS PHD'S PDP activities address several obstacles to achieving diversity in the geosciences, including: 1) lack of ESS career opportunities awareness within URM communities; 2) small numbers of visible URM role models; and, 3) small numbers of ESS-related programs at minority serving institutions. The project builds on known best practices for successful STEM diversity programs, which involve sustained interactions with students, mentoring by professionals, exposure to educational and research opportunities. It focuses on understanding and participating in the ESS professional community as a means to strengthen eligibility, sense of belonging and achievement. MS PHD'S PDP activities provide student participants with information regarding future ESS funding; education and career opportunities; exposure to cutting-edge ESS research and technology; and, on-going communication and mentoring support via membership within the MS PHD'S PDP virtual community. During a capstone leadership development week in Washington, DC, MS PHD'S PDP participants gain valuable understanding about the operations and priorities of the Federal agencies and related organizations that support ESS research and education.</AbstractNarration>
