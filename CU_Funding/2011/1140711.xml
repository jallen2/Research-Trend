    <AbstractNarration>This project develops and evaluates the effectiveness of two interventions on strengthening student understanding of prerequisite knowledge required for learning biochemistry and integrating this understanding into new knowledge gained. The two interventions are: (1) pre-class activities that review prerequisite material and (2) process-oriented guided inquiry case studies that incorporate both new and review materials to strengthen the understanding of prerequisite knowledge and to integrate new knowledge. Cognitive neuroscience and science education studies demonstrate that students retain less than half of the material presented in class. Developments in learning theory show that regularly recalling previously learned concepts reinforces connections and conceptual understanding. These two interventions to enhance student learning and critical thinking are implemented sequentially so that their separate effects can be determined. Their effects will be evaluated through pre- and post-testing of prerequisite concepts, conceptual questions embedded on unit exams, and surveys of students' self-evaluation of understanding. Long term retention is assessed on comprehensive exams given a year later. This work impacts educational delivery strategies, including textbook organization and classroom delivery methods.</AbstractNarration>
