    <AbstractNarration>This project supports four small teams of experts in key areas of applied computing to synthesize the results from a number of related projects and create curricular exemplars focusing on "computing in context." These can then be used in conjunction with the Computer Science 2013 curriculum guidelines and in other widely disseminated materials to support the breadth of relationships between computing and other disciplines. By exploring these relationships, students understand how the power of computing informs and shapes ideas throughout the academy and society. The project focuses on four areas of collaboration: computational finance, computing and music, computational linguistics, and web science. The modules developed each utilize at least one active-learning technique such as problem-based learning (PBL), process-oriented guided inquiry (POGIL), or a classroom response system (clicker) format that facilitates effective learning for students working on interdisciplinary teams. Full group and small topic area project faculty workshops support consistency and evaluation of the developed materials. Additional faculty are engaged in reviewing and testing the materials, resulting in the participation of approximately 40 faculty over the life of the project. A multi-faceted evaluation of the curricular guidelines, course structures, and pedagogical approaches developed is led by an external evaluator assessing both the process of developing the materials and the resulting products.</AbstractNarration>
