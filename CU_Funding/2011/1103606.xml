    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;The 2011 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Liquid Crystals (LCs), partially supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry and Biomaterials programs in the Division of Materials Research will explore the new advances in liquid crystal science and technology and their role in novel forward thinking applications. The conference will be held at Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA from June 19-24, 2011. Liquid crystal science has played a significant role in many basic and applied fields, including physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. Composed of anisotropic organic and biological molecules, liquid crystals interact with external fields and surfaces to influence strongly their orientational order, structure and properties. From the basic perspective, the orientational order and collective molecular behavior are central contributions to the biological science of self-assembly of membranes, to the dynamics of tissues and muscles activities, and to DNA assemblies. The extraordinary values and contributions of liquid crystals to the modern photonic and information display technologies have revolutionized the way we visualize and present information in so-called information displays, ranging from mobile to projection devices, flat panel TVs to 3D displays, and eco-friendly e-papers. The GRC on LCs will focus on their role in self-assembly, nanoscience and biotechnology. The conference will address the most important current themes in liquid crystals presented by the world?s leading scientists in the fields of biomedical science, engineering, and nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;The 2011 Gordon Conference on Liquid Crystals will provide participants with an unique forum to disclose unpublished data, deliberate and challenge novel ideas outside the realm of accepted thought, and ultimately push outward the frontiers of science and innovation for a particular field. The meeting will provide a forum for career networking and career advancement and will support and encourage young scientists and graduate students as they take their first steps in the vibrant and intrinsically interdisciplinary research field of liquid crystals, helping them establish initial scientific and personal contacts. As a part of the outreach activities of the Conference, the funding will be used to support graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior scientists from underrepresented groups and enable the opportunity of building networks of friends and mentors, and forge long-term professional contacts. Seven women and minority speakers/discussion leaders are included in the preliminary program. To ensure large participation from the underrepresented groups, advertisements will be posted at societies such as National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP), National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) and to increase number of women and minorities participation at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
