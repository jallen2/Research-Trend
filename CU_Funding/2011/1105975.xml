    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project is focussed on improving the understanding of composite materials critical for making multifunctional devices. Specifically, the materials being studied are multiferroics magnetoelectrics (ME) that simultaneously have both magnetic and ferroelectric properties. By intimately connecting the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive phases that exhibit ME-coupling via strain, it is possible to artificially create composite films with better strain-transfer capabilities between the two-phases. At the conclusion of this project, insight will be gained into the scientific parameters affecting leakage current (that adversely reduces the ME coupling). Furthermore, this understanding may be used to combine other ferroics order parameters, such as, ferroelectric-ferroelastic or ferroelastic-magnetic. During the course of this project diverse undergraduate and graduate students are being trained and mentored, results are being incorporated into a new physics and nanomaterials course, and awareness and understanding of multifunctional device materials is being enhanced through presentations at public libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The professor and her team are synthesizing novel magnetoelectric composite films with well-dispersed magnetic phase in the form of nanoparticles, nano-islands, etc. of different sizes, aspect ratio, and distribution, into a matrix of a piezoelectric phase with a reduced substrate-clamping effect. The approach focuses on controlling and characterizing interfacial diffusion and reactions (through careful selection of materials, processing parameters and other phenomena). Insight into how strain states can be modulated is being gained. Team member recruitment includes utilizing connections to a historically black college and university, Alabama A&amp;M University. Professor Jain is incorporating results into the development of new graduate-level course entitled 'Physics of Advanced Functional Nano Materials' and she is presenting scientific principles and directions at the nearby Tolland Public Library. For the latter, assessment is underway to evaluate the effectiveness of the outreach in this environment.</AbstractNarration>
