    <AbstractNarration>Numerical algebraic geometry involves the use of numerical methods to extract &lt;br/&gt;data from ideals about the corresponding varieties or schemes. This area has &lt;br/&gt;grown rapidly over the last 20 years and has found applications in many areas &lt;br/&gt;of science and engineering. This grant is funding four projects in the area &lt;br/&gt;of numerical algebraic geometry. First, the PI and his students will &lt;br/&gt;investigate several forms of preconditioning for homotopy continuation, &lt;br/&gt;including algorithms for finding (near-)optimal multihomogeneous and linear &lt;br/&gt;product start systems, as well as the use of dual bases to reduce the number &lt;br/&gt;of paths tracked to "bad" endpoints. Second, the PI and several collaborators &lt;br/&gt;will work on three application areas: exceptional mechanisms (via fiber &lt;br/&gt;products), software in Macaulay2 for algebraic geometry-related applications, &lt;br/&gt;and software for repeated parameter homotopies. Third, the PI will work on &lt;br/&gt;analyzing the complexity of numerical algebraic geometry algorithms. Finally, &lt;br/&gt;the PI and several collaborators will continue to work on methods to extract &lt;br/&gt;information about real algebraic sets both from standard continuation methods &lt;br/&gt;and from Khovanskii-Rolle continuation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polynomial systems of equations arise in many places throughout mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;science, and engineering. An entire mathematical field - algebraic geometry - &lt;br/&gt;grew out of the need to find solutions to these sorts of equations. Until the &lt;br/&gt;1960s, though, there was no known general technique for solving such systems &lt;br/&gt;of equations. The methods developed in that era require too much memory to be &lt;br/&gt;effective except for relatively small problems. More recently developed &lt;br/&gt;methods - the numerical methods of Sommese, Verschelde, Wampler, Li, and &lt;br/&gt;others, now collectively known as numerical algebraic geometry - allow for the &lt;br/&gt;solution of much larger polynomial systems, opening the application of &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry methods to a wider class of problems. However, there is &lt;br/&gt;still much to understand about these numerical methods. The goals of this &lt;br/&gt;project include addressing four open problems in this direction. This work &lt;br/&gt;includes the development of techniques to streamline some of these &lt;br/&gt;computations, the implementation of valuable algorithms in popular and useful &lt;br/&gt;software packages, a careful analysis of the computational costs associated &lt;br/&gt;with the computational methods in this field, and the continued effort to &lt;br/&gt;extract useful real-world data from the data provided as output from these &lt;br/&gt;methods.</AbstractNarration>
