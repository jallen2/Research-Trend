    <AbstractNarration>Project deals with the development of statistical theory and methodology for dealing with recurrent events occurring in many scientific fields; with complex systems characterized by dynamic changes incurred by the history of the component failures comprising the systems, such as load-sharing systems and networks; with the analysis of high-dimensional (HD) data sets such as microarray data sets in biology and medicine; and classification and prediction problems with HD predictors and many model classes. The development of the theory and methodology will use modern survival analysis techniques; coherent structure theory from reliability and engineering; Markov random fields and Gibbs measure; Neyman-Pearson paradigm, decision theory, and the Bayesian paradigm. Project goals are to obtain asymptotic properties of semiparametric estimators in the general class of dynamic recurrent event models of Pena and Hollander; to develop probabilistic models for complex systems incorporating component dependencies due to the load-sharing structure of the system; to devise and implement optimal decision-theoretic and Bayesian methodologies in multiple decision-making, classification, and prediction with HD data; and to provide training to students and junior faculty in performing statistical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project results will be of high importance and impact since the class of dynamic recurrent events models considered is more realistic for complex systems, while those dealing with HD data will provide more efficient methodology for discovering relevant `genes.' Consequently, researchers and practitioners dealing with highly complex engineering systems will better predict system or component failures, thus leading to improved maintenance policies and decreased risk of catastrophic system failures; while those involved with HD data will improve discovery of important genes, with positive implications in chronic disease management and control. Finally, the training of graduate students and junior faculty in statistical research will benefit science since they are society's future researchers.</AbstractNarration>
