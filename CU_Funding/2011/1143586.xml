    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the Foundations of Molecular Modeling and Simulation (FOMMS) 2012 conference to be held in Welches, Oregon July 22 - 26, 2012. The conference will emphasize the latest developments in computational quantum and classical simulation methods, as well as their application to discovery and data driven applications in science and engineering. The grant will be used to support participant costs for the meeting, facilitating attendance by researchers who might otherwise be unable to attend the conference, including junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and under-represented minorities. The conference features an outstanding and diverse slate of 18 renowned innovators in and practitioners of molecular modeling and simulation from the US, Europe, and Japan who have accepted invitations to present plenary talks over the 4.5 day conference. Additionally, workshops on open source molecular simulation codes and on the use of molecular simulation methods in education will be conducted. Participants will be encouraged to present their latest work in one of two poster sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FOMMS 2012 conference will broadly impact researchers and students who develop or use molecular-based modeling and simulation tools in academia and industry. The conference format and venue provide ample time and opportunity for interaction among participants, cross-fertilization of disciplines, and mentoring of young researchers.</AbstractNarration>
