    <AbstractNarration>This award provides travel and subsistence to graduates students (and some undergraduates) who will attend the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) on "Types, Semantics and Verification." The program is available at http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Activities/summerschool/summer11/. The summer school is a two-week event that brings together top international researchers and students to engage in lectures and discussions on leading-edge foundational topics in programming languages and software verification, much of which is not yet in textbooks. The NSF support ensures participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups. The summer school will help build the next generation of researchers and a global workforce with expertise in these important areas of research and education. 100 students have registered for the 2011 summer school. The organizers will make video of lectures and other educational materials available to the public immediately after the event.</AbstractNarration>
