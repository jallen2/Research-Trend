    <AbstractNarration>This award will continue operation of the Microlensing Follow Up Network in order to search for and analyze new exoplanets using high-magnification microlensing techniques. The consortium makes use of numerous small-to-moderate size aperture wide-field telescopes to conduct the surveys, as well as larger instruments for quick target-of-opportunity follow-up observations. Data analysis will be used to measure relative planet frequency in the Galactic bulge and disk, constrain models of 3-body planetary systems, and determine orbital information of planets using new mathematical techniques and statistical analysis. As part of the survey they will also obtain and analyze high-resolution spectra of highly magnified dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge in order to measure or put limits on lithium abundances in unevolved stars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will exploit the advantages that the microlensing technique has over other methods for detecting new planets, such as being more sensitive to planets with lower masses and higher semi-major axes. This will help produce a better understanding of the planetary system distributions in the Galaxy. The dwarf spectra are critical because lithium is a key element in constraining stellar evolution models. The group includes contributions from both professional and amateur astronomers at international locations. Scientific training of the amateur astronomers, and graduate students is also part of the project.</AbstractNarration>
