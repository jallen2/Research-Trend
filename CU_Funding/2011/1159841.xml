    <AbstractNarration>The overall goal is to investigate both detection and improvement of DNA using a device known as cantilever sensor. We will investigate systematically the role of intense surface vibration on bound double stranded DNA behavior. We hypothesize that the intense vibration will open up the molecule. Currently we do such a reaction by heating. Our preliminary work suggests that vibration directionally applied will cause DNA?s two parts to come apart. We will investigate if a method of increasing the DNA on the sensor can be accomplished. If these two goals are accomplished we may be able to detect DNA that is present in extremely small amounts. The implication of such a capability is we can detect harmful bacteria quickly saving lives; detect human and animal diseases rapidly and inexpensively. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: Three merits are: (1) A new and cheaper approach will be developed for the detection of DNA at a very low level. (2) We will also develop a fundamental understanding of how vibration intensity affects DNA reaction, (3) Training of PhD students in the interdisciplinary area at the intersection of the broad field of nucleic acid chemistry (kinetics and thermodynamics), electromechanical resonators, and measurement science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Students of various backgrounds ? high school, undergraduates in various disciplines ? will be exposed to DNA measurement techniques. An important broad impact will be a new methodology that has sensitivity similar or better than the current expensive methods used in disease diagnosis and presence of harmful bacteria.</AbstractNarration>
