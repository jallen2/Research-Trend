    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to provide a unique opportunity for students to present their research results, learn the cutting edge research, and interact with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry at the ACM SIGMOD 2012 (International Conference on Data Management). As one of the most prestigious conferences in data management research, ACM SIGMOD has contributed significantly to the advance of all aspects of data management technologies and applications since 1975. Today ACM SIGMOD is a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction; and it is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. This project provides partial support for students matriculated at U.S. institutions, especially female and minority students, to attend and present their research work at ACM SIGMOD 2012 in Scottsdale, Arizona. Besides meeting with researchers from academia and industry during regular program sessions, in SIGMOD 2012 students are able to participate in the following interactive activities as partially supported by this project: a new researcher symposium, an undergraduate research poster competition, vis-a-vis meetings with leading researchers, and a female student mentoring workshop. These opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the participants. The broader impact is to train the future generation of leaders and workforce in the critical field of data management.
