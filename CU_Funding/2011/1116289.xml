    <AbstractNarration>Developing and maintaining software is a key challenge in computer science,&lt;br/&gt;with failures costing up to one half of one percent of the US GDP each&lt;br/&gt;year. Most code is retained and evolved, rather than created from scratch,&lt;br/&gt;and professional software developers spend over three-fourths of their time&lt;br/&gt;trying to understand existing code. Understandability and documentation&lt;br/&gt;have become key components of software quality, yet they remain poorly&lt;br/&gt;understood by both researchers and practitioners. In a future where the&lt;br/&gt;software engineering focus shifts from implementation to design and&lt;br/&gt;composition concerns, program understandability will become even more&lt;br/&gt;important. This research develops tools and techniques for mechanically&lt;br/&gt;generating documentation to help make programs easier to understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research follows the insight that modern analysis techniques can form&lt;br/&gt;rich descriptive models of programs that are both precise and succinct.&lt;br/&gt;Human-readable documentation can then be synthesized from such models.&lt;br/&gt;The approach applies to large programs across multiple application domains.&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on documenting how code should be used correctly, a&lt;br/&gt;critical aspect in an era of components-of-the-shelf development, as well&lt;br/&gt;as documenting how code has changed and evolved over time, a key&lt;br/&gt;part of software maintenance. The research leverages program analysis&lt;br/&gt;techniques, machine learning, and textual synthesis, with results&lt;br/&gt;disseminated through academic publication; the education, training and&lt;br/&gt;mentoring of students; as well as freely-available, open-source tools.</AbstractNarration>
