    <AbstractNarration>The transition from a world without states to a world dominated by states is one of the most significant developments in human history since states constitute the dominant unit through with international interactions occur. Although in many parts of the world the study of this transition has been at the forefront of archaeological and anthropological research, in Greece it has been slow to develop despite the fact that early Greek states have significant potential in contributing new knowledge to the world-wide study of state formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although archaeologists agree that Mycenaean states were formed through the unification of previously independent regional polities, the specific mechanisms that affected this process are not clear. For a long time, hierarchy and socio-political stratification were considered the main forces driving state formation, an approach shaped by the fact that the available evidence derived from a few main palatial capitals. Recent models have, however, shifted the focus from the "center" to the "hinterland" and highlighted the need for a systematic and interdisciplinary investigation of non-palatial settlements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project Dr. Cosmopoulos adopts a "bottom-up" approach to the study of state formation and expansion in early Greece. With funding from NSF he will conduct a systematic and interdisciplinary investigation of Iklaina, a secondary center of the Mycenaean state of Pylos. Through a combination of survey, excavation, and scientific analyses he plans to: 1) produce the datasets necessary to test existing models about the emergence of Mycenaean states; 2) investigate the dynamic relationship of centers to hinterlands; and 3) develop cross-cultural models useful in understanding state formation and expansion in other parts of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project concern three main areas:&lt;br/&gt;1) large-scale collaborative research: the project allows scientists to coordinate their skills in a major research program and to interact with colleagues from other fields and other countries. Furthermore, the project builds on work conducted by previous projects in the area and combines archaeological fieldwork (survey, excavation, scientific analyses) with the study of the available textual and literary evidence. Finally, it applies anthropological theories in the study of state formation in Greece.&lt;br/&gt;2) education: the project serves as the training field for a large number of graduate and undergraduate students. Since the inception of the project, 680 undergraduate and 33 graduate students (of whom about 70% women and 5% African Americans) have been trained in archaeological theory and field techniques.&lt;br/&gt;3) preservation of cultural heritage: because the area of Pylos is increasingly being destroyed by developers, tourists, and looters, the excavation, conservation, and proper guarding of the archaeological site at Iklaina will salvage one of the most promising ancient sites of the area.</AbstractNarration>
