    <AbstractNarration>In response to a recent decline in requests for UNOLS facilities, two separate Chief Scientist&lt;br/&gt;Training Cruises are proposed on an Intermediate General Purpose Research Vessel to serve&lt;br/&gt;as forums for teaching early career marine scientists how to effectively plan for, acquire,&lt;br/&gt;utilize and report on time at sea for multi-disciplinary research and educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this program will develop from opportunities given to new investigators&lt;br/&gt;to test compelling research ideas, work collaboratively, use equipment, and acquire samples&lt;br/&gt;critical for developing future oceanographic field programs.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are that as many as 28 new investigators will be trained in the mechanics&lt;br/&gt;of leading expeditionary ocean research while coming to understand how oceanographic research&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure is scheduled, maintained and upgraded. They will also be exposed to standard&lt;br/&gt;sets of observations appropriate to a variety of oceanographic disciplines (e.g., physical,&lt;br/&gt;chemical, biological and geological oceanography) inspiring new ideas for research and the&lt;br/&gt;transfer of science information to the public.</AbstractNarration>
