    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the development of computational methods for&lt;br/&gt;tomosynthesis breast image reconstruction, a technique used to&lt;br/&gt;reconstruct 3-dimensional images using slightly modified versions of&lt;br/&gt;conventional x-ray systems. The mathematical models addressed in this&lt;br/&gt;project are difficult ill-posed inverse problems; computed solutions&lt;br/&gt;are very sensitive to errors in the data, and implementation for large&lt;br/&gt;scale 3-dimensional images is nontrivial. All previous breast&lt;br/&gt;tomosynthesis image reconstruction algorithms use a simplified, but&lt;br/&gt;incorrect assumption that the source x-ray beam is comprised of&lt;br/&gt;photons with a constant energy; that is, the x-ray beam is assumed to&lt;br/&gt;be monoenergetic. The simplified monoenergetic assumption results in&lt;br/&gt;a linear mathematical model. This project uses the physically&lt;br/&gt;correct, and hence more accurate, assumption that the x-ray beam is&lt;br/&gt;polyenergetic. The resulting mathematical model is nonlinear,&lt;br/&gt;providing great challenges to the development and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models, as well as for the development of computational&lt;br/&gt;methods. However, as this project reveals, the nonlinear model allows&lt;br/&gt;for reconstructing images with substantially fewer artifacts than the&lt;br/&gt;linear model. Moreover, the nonlinear model can incorporate&lt;br/&gt;parameterizations to allow for explicit decomposition of the breast&lt;br/&gt;into distinct materials, such as, glandular tissue, adipose tissue,&lt;br/&gt;calcifications, and iodinated contrast agents, thereby providing&lt;br/&gt;improved diagnostic information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the US, over 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every&lt;br/&gt;year, but there is a 97% five-year survival rate if the cancer is&lt;br/&gt;localized, and if it is discovered before it spreads to other parts of&lt;br/&gt;the body. Therefore, improved imaging techniques that help to detect&lt;br/&gt;and diagnose breast cancer early can have a profound impact on the&lt;br/&gt;healthcare of women. The research in this project focuses on&lt;br/&gt;tomosynthesis imaging, which just received FDA approval for clinical&lt;br/&gt;use in 2011, because it has the potential to provide substantially&lt;br/&gt;better screening capabilities than mammography. The new mathematical&lt;br/&gt;and computational approaches developed in this work are designed to&lt;br/&gt;unlock the potentially transformative benefits of tomosynthesis for&lt;br/&gt;breast cancer screening, providing significantly better diagnostic&lt;br/&gt;information to physicians. In addition to its application to breast&lt;br/&gt;cancer screening, tomosynthesis, in its whole-body implementation can&lt;br/&gt;be used for many other applications where standard x-ray and CT are&lt;br/&gt;used, such as chest imaging for detection of lung nodules, as well as&lt;br/&gt;non-medical imaging applications such as nuclear waste inspections and&lt;br/&gt;explosive detection. Thus, advances in computational methods for this&lt;br/&gt;application can have a very broad impact in the imaging field.&lt;br/&gt;Collaborations between researchers in Mathematics and Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;and researchers in the Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences&lt;br/&gt;and Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University facilitates&lt;br/&gt;transitioning new software to clinical use.</AbstractNarration>
