    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a one-and-a-half day early-career symposium focused on helping participants develop personal technology research agendas, to be held at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Education Communications and Technology (AECT). The organizing committee has selected three members of the learning sciences community to mentor advanced graduate students and pre-tenure faculty from this community, to help them focus on taking a theory-based approach to designing potentially-high-impact learning technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this early-career workshop are (i) mentoring of advanced doctoral students into the social/professional network as partners in idea-making, (ii) supporting advanced doctoral students and early career faculty in developing viable technology-oriented research agendas, (iii) providing specific feedback and guidance to advanced doctoral students and early career faculty about their research agendas, and (iv) further developing a community of researchers interested in ways technology can transform teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>
