    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. Signaling networks are the information processing devices of cells and organisms. These drive complex processes such as the development of an entire human being from a single cell and protecting the body in a coordinated response to a pathogen. The immune system presents a unique opportunity for studying development in mammals. White blood cells undergo differentiation and proliferation, a never-ending process throughout the life of the organism. The goal of this research is to present a global, systems view of the immune system, its function and its development. The approach is based on a new revolutionary technology, Mass-Cytometry, which enables us to observe cellular signaling and development at unprecedented resolution and detail. This empowers the exploration of development in a brand new way, unraveling the mystery of how we are made from just a single cell. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Biological research is paved with novel technologies that lead to new opportunities, new challenges, and most importantly new discoveries. Elucidating general principles for molecular signal processing and development have great utility across a host of fundamental challenges in modern biology. This is an exciting era, during which interdisciplinary research can really make an impact on biology. To make such impact requires scientists trained in both quantitative and biological sciences. A key part of this project is to develop ways to distill complex science to a broader community, including science expo for K-8 and specialized systems biology training at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The modeling and visualization tools developed in this project are ideal for presenting the complexity of biological systems in a more tangible and concrete manner for students and are ideal training and outreach resources. The synergistic combination of technology and computation will have a transformative influence on broad topics across all of biology.</AbstractNarration>
