    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences (ISAES) is held every four years and is a premier Antarctic research conference. The 11th ISAES meeting will be held 10-16 July 2011 in Edinburgh, Scotland. ISAES is a key platform for generating or augmenting international collaborations and this travel grant will help make this conference accessible for graduate students and early-career researchers. Symposium presentations and publications will provide a key record of International Polar Year activities in the earth sciences in Antarctica, and an invaluable resource for planning future, international, collaborative research. Funds are requested to support the attendance of 20- 25 U.S. researchers at this conference. In particular, the funds will be used to support graduate students and young investigators who currently do not have sufficient travel support. Requests for support will be evaluated by the PIs and a group of geoscientists from the Byrd Polar Research Center and School of Earth Sciences at The Ohio State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;These funds will allow a more diverse group of researchers to participate in the ISAES conference, which will encourage global collaboration and cooperation. Travel funds will preferentially be provided for students and early career researcher and thus will augment their training and career development.</AbstractNarration>
