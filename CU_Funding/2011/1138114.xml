    <AbstractNarration>The project will use meta-analysis to synthesize the results of research comparing single-sex with coeducational schooling in regard to multiple student outcomes, focusing particularly on mathematics and science performance, interest, motivation, and attitude. The investigators, from the University of Wisconsin and Arizona State University, will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis of research comparing student outcomes in single-sex and coeducation schooling in the US, and will conduct separate analyses of reseatch conducted in other countries. Meta-analyses will focus on potential moderators of the effects such as dosage (e.g., single-sex classrooms vs. entire schools), quality of design (e.g., random vs. non-random assignment), gender, and others. Studies will be coded for multiple variables as determined by the Expectancy Value and Developmental Intergroup Theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single-sex schooling is an important policy issue in mathematics and science education in the US today, but no broad meta-analysis has yet been conducted that examines the scientific evidence for or against this choice. In drawing on a wide range of individua studies conducted both in the US and abroad, the investigators have the potential to provide definitive evidence to school districts as they make policy decisions about instituting single-sex education.</AbstractNarration>
