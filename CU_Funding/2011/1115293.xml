    <AbstractNarration>This study focuses on problems from polynomial&lt;br/&gt;optimization and convex algebraic geometry. The latter is a new&lt;br/&gt;research area that concerns convex sets and convex hulls of sets that&lt;br/&gt;are described algebraically and arise in optimization. The key tool is the use of efficient algorithms in semidefinite programming, a branch of convex optimization that is used in polynomial optimization. The&lt;br/&gt;first set of questions studies the general phenomenon of when a given&lt;br/&gt;convex body is the linear projection of a slice (by an affine plane)&lt;br/&gt;of a closed convex cone. This phenomena is central to all&lt;br/&gt;lift-and-project methods for discrete and polynomial optimization. This study&lt;br/&gt;provides a uniform view of all lift-and-project&lt;br/&gt;methods via new notions of cone factorizations of certain operators&lt;br/&gt;associated to the convex body. The investigator and collaborators have&lt;br/&gt;recently constructed a new hierarchy of convex relaxations for&lt;br/&gt;algebraic sets called theta bodies. Various open questions about these&lt;br/&gt;bodies are posed. The methods&lt;br/&gt;from polynomial optimization and convex algebraic geometry can be applied to problems&lt;br/&gt;from computer vision. Here the application is primarily to object reconstruction from&lt;br/&gt;images taken by multiple cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work of the PI with her collaborators improvies our understanding of the algebraic and geometric&lt;br/&gt;structures that underlie optimization problems that involve&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. Such problems have a wide array of applications and admit&lt;br/&gt;methods from both the algebraic and analytic sides of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. This research considers both improvements in our understanding of the theoretical aspects of polynomial optimization, and the application of these methods to problems in computer vision.</AbstractNarration>
