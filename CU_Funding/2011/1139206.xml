    <AbstractNarration>PIs will conduct a "Future Faculty Workshop: Diverse Leaders of Tomorrow" at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This 3 day workshop aims to encourage and promote careers in academia of underrepresented minorities. The workshop differentiates itself from other such workshops by focusing on materials chemistry and engineering. The target participants are PhD students and Post-doctoral scholars from underrepresented minority (URMs) groups. It is anticipated that there will be at least 38 highly qualified participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the workshop will be introduced to faculty who will serve as mentors during the workshop and throughout their early career. These mentors will lead discussions on the benefits of academia, how to obtain positions in academia, and give intervention strategies on how to overcome barriers to retention and promotion. Workshop participants will receive feedback and coaching on their research proposal ideas which will serve as the basis for discussing how to form interdisciplinary research programs and seek appropriate funding for these programs.</AbstractNarration>
