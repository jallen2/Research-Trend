    <AbstractNarration>NanoLambda, Inc has requested support for a one year membership to the Agile Innovation System that was recently selected as the recipient of the Economic Development Administrations Region 1 i6 award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with the "Agile Innovation Process" project team, this proposal will complete the monolithic fabrication of the nano-optic filter array structure directly onto the CMOS detector array on a wafer scale, to form a spectrometer-on-a-chip. The proposed ultra-compact and low-cost spectrometer-on-a-chip can be used in various applications such as mobile/wearable health monitoring and high-resolution color sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of a winning team for the i6 Challenge Award program, Innovation Works and Carnegie Mellon University will collaborate with NanoLambda to more effectively move federally funded research towards successful technology product commercialization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed ultra-compact and low-cost spectrometer-on-a-chip can be used in various applications such as mobile/wearable health monitoring and high-resolution color sensing. Consumer electronics manufacturers and portable medical device vendors can be potential customers. Considering the manufacturability of the proposed technology and the readiness of the markets, it is feasible to commercialize the technology within 2 years. The proposed activities will contribute to not only ensuring the high quality of color in the consumer electronics industry but also advancing personalized point-of-care, environmental monitoring, and homeland security. The proposed project will also contribute to the maturation of the "Agile Innovation Process" project of the i6 challenge winning team in the region.</AbstractNarration>
