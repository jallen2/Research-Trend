    <AbstractNarration>The Quantitative Literacy Reasoning Assessment (QLRA) project is developing a non-proprietary QLR instrument, piloting it at several participating institutions across the country to begin the creation of a database of QLR abilities, and establishing an online resource portal for QLR assessment. Quantitative Literacy/Reasoning is a relatively new and growing field, with many institutions replacing traditional math requirements with various introductory QLR-requirements such as Liberal Arts Mathematics and Finite Math. The current developmental/introductory math program in this country is undergoing a profound paradigm shift, as focus moves from traditional algebra based curricula to the development of the quantitative skills and habits of mind required for decision making in our personal, civic and workplace lives. Underrepresented groups in STEM (minorities and women) are often disproportionately overrepresented in these traditional developmental courses. The mathematics point-of-entry for these underrepresented groups is a crucial time to nurture interest and engagement with mathematics that could lead to further STEM involvement. The QLRA project provides the needed assessment for curriculum innovation and coherence of these point-of-entry courses. Dissemination via the online portal allows institutions to easily adapt the non-proprietary instrument to their own needs. The QLRA Project provides the necessary assessment infrastructure and a collaborative platform as QLR requirements evolve around the nation.</AbstractNarration>
