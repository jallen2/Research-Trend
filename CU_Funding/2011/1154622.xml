    <AbstractNarration>This project provides 54 two-year scholarships for students enrolled in Civil/Mechanical Engineering Technology, Electronic Engineering Technology, Machine Manufacturing Engineering Technology, and Microelectronics at Portland Community College (PCC). Scholarships are awarded based on academic achievement, financial need, and interest in technology fields. Student support strategies include faculty mentoring, tutoring services, cohort activities, and others. Scholars receive assistance in pursuing technology careers or seeking four-year degrees. New approaches to recruiting students into technology programs are used, specifically targeting Hispanics. A Math Visits Recruitment Program introduces students to technology programs and careers through classroom presentations. High school students interested in robotics receive free tuition to attend introductory machine manufacturing courses, gaining college credit, hands-on experience, and exposure to the S-STEM program. The proposed project strengthens connections among PCC, local high schools, four-year colleges, and technology industries. It has a direct impact on the Portland Metro area by increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in technology industries and creating positive role models for these populations. New partnerships with Upward Bound and Talent Search enhance recruitment strategies. Additionally, effective partnerships with technology industries increase experiential learning opportunities. Outcomes from these strategies inform the broader higher education community on effective means of attracting and engaging students in technology programs and careers.</AbstractNarration>
