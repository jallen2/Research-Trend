    <AbstractNarration>The project aims to create a personalized student learning environment by blending emerging Internet technology, software, computer interfacing, cutting edge graphical user interface, effective pedagogical designs, and assessment and evaluation schemes. The developed environment will have five major features: a) live faculty presentation for a laboratory session; b) provision of integration with a range of STEM courses; c) video, audio, text messaging capability; d) provision of collaboration with frequent student feedback; and e) faculty/facilitator monitoring of student progress and activities. The remote laboratory entails physical (real) laboratory equipment being controlled remotely. The developed environment will be validated by using it in an undergraduate level laboratory course (control systems laboratory).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this project will be instrumental in bringing a transformation from a production-line style laboratory delivery system, where every student goes through the same treatment irrespective of their level of knowledge, learning style, and pace of learning, to a personalized and individualized approach with a level of collaboration. This will help students with diverse background to progress toward their learning goals and thus increase retention and graduation rates. The approach will also be widely applicable to other areas such as distance learning, skill development, and corporate and workforce training.</AbstractNarration>
