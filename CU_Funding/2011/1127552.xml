    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project proposes to&lt;br/&gt;formulate and engineer chemically modified bio-based and biodegradable Poly(Lactide) based&lt;br/&gt;compounds, to generate a new class of materials that are, high strength, lightweight,&lt;br/&gt;multifunctional, environmentally friendly &amp; cost-effective as an alternative to petroleum based&lt;br/&gt;polymers. NTIC has successfully commercialized a portfolio of reactive blended bio-based&lt;br/&gt;and/or biodegradable resins for extrusion, molding, and coating applications. However, it faces a&lt;br/&gt;major hurdle due to poor mechanical properties, high prices, and higher densities of current PLA&lt;br/&gt;materials. NTIC successfully developed novel chemistries of compatibilization to create&lt;br/&gt;advanced PLA bio-resins that offer improved toughness in Phase I of this work. The newly&lt;br/&gt;synthesized materials were applied in four different processing platforms to provide extruded&lt;br/&gt;films, injection molded cutlery, extrusion coated paper, and extrusion blow molded bottles.&lt;br/&gt;Phase II funding will allow NTIC to build on the success of the initial trials and build an&lt;br/&gt;improved, broader portfolio of high strength and economically viable PLA based products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are technical, environmental, and&lt;br/&gt;economical. This work will (1) widen the window of performance of PLA based applications; (2)&lt;br/&gt;further fundamental understanding of PLA and its chemistries (3) greatly increase the use of&lt;br/&gt;biobased products in larger industrial and packaging markets implying environmental&lt;br/&gt;preservation of fossil fuel resources; and (4) create new jobs for sales, manufacturing, technical&lt;br/&gt;support of newly developed Natur-Tec® products.</AbstractNarration>
