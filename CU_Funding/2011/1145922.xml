    <AbstractNarration>Little is known about the amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) and reptiles (turtles, lizards, and snakes) of the Southeast Asian country of Laos. Laos has been plagued by war, instability and isolation from the West, and this has led to a long gap in wildlife research. An improved political situation has made new fieldwork possible, and Laos is now known to contain a high diversity of amphibians and reptile species, many of which occur only there. New country records and entirely new species to science are being rapidly discovered in Laos. Low capacity and poor infrastructure impedes such research by in-country scientists. This three-year project will undertake surveys of amphibians and reptiles, and their parasites, at nine priority field sites across Laos. The work will be undertaken collaboratively between U.S. and Lao biodiversity scientists in partnership with a U.S. non-governmental wildlife conservation organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of which species occur where is fundamental to global biodiversity conservation. Many species of amphibians and reptiles in Laos are at risk of extinction, primarily due to habitat destruction. This project will provide essential information on the biology of amphibians and reptiles in Laos to conservation managers, the international scientific community, and the U.S. public via museum exhibits. A U.S. postdoctoral scholar and Lao graduate students and scientists will receive extensive training in field research and museum science to ensure project impact on the next generation of biodiversity scientists and stewards.</AbstractNarration>
