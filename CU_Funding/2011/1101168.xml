    <AbstractNarration>This award supports two one-day workshops for US and European non-marine ostracode specialists, with a focus on northern hemisphere Quaternary and modern taxa, to develop collaborative research initiatives relevant to urgent societal questions concerning climate change impacts, changes in biodiversity, changes in water quality and supply in aquifers and surface waters. The first workshop, organized by Dr. Alison Smith (Kent State University), Dr. David Horne (University of London) and Dr. Martin Gross (Universal Museum Joanneum in Austria), will be held immediately following the European Ostracodologists Meeting (EOM) in Graz, Austria in July 2011. The second workshop will take place immediately following the Geological Society of America meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina in November 2012. Approximately 45 scientists and students are expected to attend each of these workshops, with approximately 15 U.S. scientists and students funded by this grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-marine ostracodes are microscopic crustaceans commonly found in almost all non-marine aquatic habitats and are important proxies of climatic and environmental change. These organisms produce easily fossilized calcite shells, and are an abundant record used for ecological, geochemical, and molecular phylogenetic research. Previous results suggest that analyses at larger spatial scales should enable researchers to ask fundamental questions, test hypotheses, and gain new insights in the fields of ecology, molecular genetics, paleoclimatology, and hydrology. These workshops will 1) establish an international dialogue for collaborative research; 2) explore the development of linked datasets, cross-training of graduate students, and establishment of taxonomic harmonization procedures; and 3) produce a research agenda and results dissemination plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly supported by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and Division of Earth Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
