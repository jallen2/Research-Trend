    <AbstractNarration>Neighboring plants can sometimes influence the amount of insect damage experienced by plants of interest (crops or weeds). This phenomenon ("associational effects") is the basis for some pest management strategies in agriculture and forestry and might occur through many mechanisms. For instance, neighboring plants may emit smells that repel insects, or attract predators that feed on insects. Although the possibilities are numerous, we understand little about how these specific mechanisms operate and the long-term consequences for plant communities. In a previous study, associational effects were observed between two common weedy plants (Carolina horsenettle and Tall goldenrod). This study will examine how goldenrod neighbors influence insect damage to horsenettle, focusing on four possible mechanisms. Results from this study will contribute to a larger study examining how insect pests influence the persistence of plants (such as the weedy horsenettle) in a community of other plants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the mechanisms by which neighboring plants influence insect damage may lead to more effective management of weeds (where we may want to increase insect damage) and crops (where we may want to reduce insect damage). Results will be presented to agricultural researchers and farmers through seminars, newsletters, and workshops at the local agricultural experiment station and surrounding universities.</AbstractNarration>
