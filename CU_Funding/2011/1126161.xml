    <AbstractNarration>The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory is awarded a grant to support a workshop and planning activities to assess the value of field stations and marine laboratories in science and education, and position them strategically to meet emerging scientific trends. Under the guidance of a steering committee comprised of seven past, current, and future presidents of the Organization of Biological Field Stations and National Association of Marine Laboratories, the project team will prepare a series of reports to assist funders, managers, and users, in making decisions concerning investment in, and management of, field stations and marine laboratories. The goals will be accomplished through a dialogue among the stakeholders of field stations and marine laboratories about the future of these institutions. Specifically, the project will convene a workshop involving a diverse set of participants to explore the relationship between emerging scientific trends and field stations and marine laboratories. Second, a survey will be performed to evaluate the existing status of marine labs and field stations to better understand their capacity to serve evolving science and education needs. The results will be disseminated widely. Finally, a final report drawing from the results of the workshop and the survey will be prepared with the assistance of a professional science writer, to make recommendations concerning strategic investments in field stations and marine laboratories. With over 350 field stations and marine laboratories distributed among all 50 states managing a large amount of scientific equipment, research vessels, laboratories, living accommodations, and land, there is a huge existing investment in the field station and marine laboratory network. Because of the diversity, complexity, and enduring nature of field stations and marine laboratories, strategic planning is critical for ensuring that such institutions are well positioned to meet the dynamic and changing needs of scientists, students, and public they serve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marine laboratories and field stations provide unique opportunities for students to receive scientific training, for the general public to learn more about science, and to foster communications between resource managers and scientists. Strategic planning will help ensure that field stations and marine laboratories are well positioned to integrate modern science into formal and informal educational activities, as well as to facilitate resource management. Resource managers and educators will be included as participants in the workshop in order to strengthen the ties between research, education, and management. Information concerning the project will be available starting June 1, 2011 through http://obfs.org and http://naml.org.</AbstractNarration>
