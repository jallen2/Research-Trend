    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 11-32353&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Bogosyan, Seta O.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Alaska-Fairbanks &lt;br/&gt;Title: SPECIAL PROJECT: IEEE ICM 2011- Workshop on Human-Centered Robotics&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, planning an international workshop for human-centric robotics in Turkey, examines the nature, needs, importance, challenges, and funding mechanisms for ongoing and anticipated research in different CISE areas and even more broad areas. The workshop will brings together recognized CISE research leaders and their peers from Turkey, Japan, and Korea, to conduct such an assessment and produce a material that can be shared with the CISE community, international colleagues, academic administrators, government funding agencies, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;The activity brings together recognized leaders in telerobotics, medical robotics, and collaborative robotics to plan international collaborations in research and education in this rapidly evolving field. The planned interactions in this workshop will also benefit students and early career faculty from US, by providing opportunities to internationally exchange experiences and ideas. Participants from USA, Japan, Turkey, and Korea (KAIST) have actively committed their involvement in the workshop organization. The planned workshop presents a great opportunity for all interested participants to meet in person, and start a new, larger-scale international collaborative effort to serve the challenging field of human-centric robotics. With truly interdisciplinary foundations, the proposed workshop requires, not only a profound creativity and knowledge in robotics, but also deep insights into social sciences. While the expected domain disciplines to be addressed include telerobotics, medical robotics, and collaborative robotics, the associated challenges to be discussed involve adaptation of robots to human nature and behaviors, as well as human?s communication and interaction with robots&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;Robotics is becoming indispensible in assisted living, hospitals, schools, and even homes. The proposed workshop addresses the influence and interaction of technical, physical, psychological, and societal factors as they relate to robotic technologies, and as they are addressed in various parts of the world, by leading researchers. Thus, the findings from this event touch society overall.</AbstractNarration>
