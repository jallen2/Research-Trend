    <AbstractNarration>This proposal deals with three topics in stochastic partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations (SPDE). The first question deals with uniqueness. &lt;br/&gt;Unless SPDE have unique solutions, they are useless for modeling. Recent work &lt;br/&gt;by the proposer, L. Mytnik, and E. Perkins settled a longstanding question &lt;br/&gt;about uniqueness of SPDE related to the heat equation. Using these newly &lt;br/&gt;developed tools, the proposer will attack uniqueness questions for other types &lt;br/&gt;of equations, and study uniqueness among nonnegative solutions. The second &lt;br/&gt;question deals with traveling waves, which occur widely in physical systems. &lt;br/&gt;Recently the proposer, L. Mytnik, and J. Quastel have solved a problem raised &lt;br/&gt;by Brunet and Derrida, involving the asymptotic speed of traveling waves when &lt;br/&gt;the noise term is small. The proposer will would like to extend this analysis &lt;br/&gt;to other equations, and related particle systems. The third topic involves &lt;br/&gt;stochastic wave equations. The most commonly studied SPDE are variants of the &lt;br/&gt;heat equation, but others such as the stochastic wave equation are receiving &lt;br/&gt;increasing attention. With D. Geba, the proposer will like to study &lt;br/&gt;stochastic wave equations involving null forms. Using some function spaces &lt;br/&gt;introduced by Bourgain, the proposer's goal is to study short-time existence. &lt;br/&gt;The ideas developed should be relevant to other classes of equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of SPDE is rapidly expanding. As technology moves towards the micro &lt;br/&gt;level, the effect of random noise becomes more and more important. Since the &lt;br/&gt;most important mathematical modeling tools we have are ordinary and partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations, the study of SPDE is becoming essential in many &lt;br/&gt;applied fields. Even though SPDE is now several decades old, the area has &lt;br/&gt;only recently received widespread attention. There is still a need for &lt;br/&gt;pioneering work to establish a toolbox for the area. This proposal deals with &lt;br/&gt;three types of problems in SPDE. The proposer believes that through the study &lt;br/&gt;of such specific examples is the right way to generate methods and further our &lt;br/&gt;understanding, for both theory and applications. In summary, the proposer &lt;br/&gt;believes that SPDE will play an essential role in future applications of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics. He wishes to develop the theory and help to train graduate &lt;br/&gt;students so that this area can fulfill its potential.</AbstractNarration>
