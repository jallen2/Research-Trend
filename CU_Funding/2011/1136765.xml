    <AbstractNarration>Tougaloo College, a minority-serving institution, is awarding two-year scholarships to 18 talented, upper-level students with a major in biology, chemistry, mathematics or physics who desire certification in secondary education and are committed to completing four years of teaching in grades 7-12 in high-need school districts in Mississippi. The substantial curriculum is being driven by clinical field-based experiences in formal and informal settings, seminars, and workshops in collaboration with established local school districts and community partners. The Noyce Program is being structured around undergraduate and post-graduate mentoring by STEM and Education Division faculty and master 7-12 teachers, professional development activities and networking. Scholars are being prepared to enter the 7-12 STEM classroom as highly qualified, highly effective teachers and are provided resources and support to ensure teacher retention. Pre-Noyce activities such as teaching in the college's Summer Science Program are being made available to freshmen and sophomores who wish to ultimately apply for Noyce scholarships. By establishing a strong STEM Teacher Education Program that will impact Mississippi students for years to come, the Program is increasing the number of qualified beginning STEM teachers in Mississippi and increasing the number of effective beginning teachers in schools serving economic and socially disadvantaged students. The project is establishing a mechanism for ongoing participation between Tougaloo STEM and Education faculty, increasing the number and expertise of STEM beginning teachers, and subsequently improving the aspirations and competence of Mississippi students. By building partnerships with community schools, the Program is creating a pipeline for future qualified STEM teachers to serve in area high-need schools.</AbstractNarration>
