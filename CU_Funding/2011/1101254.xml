    <AbstractNarration>Ultracold atoms are excellent probes with which to make precise measurements. Because ultracold atoms are very slow (with temperature now reaching a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero), they are very sensitive to weak interactions. During the past few years, major progress in the manipulation of atoms and ions (i.e. atoms that lost or gained extra electrons) has led to a revolution in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) Physics, with discoveries of new phases on matter, and application ranging from more precise clocks to quantum computing and cryptography. This research program initiates a new effort in our understanding and, ultimately, control of the interaction between ultracold atoms and ions. For example, one aim of this research is to manipulate individual particles so that an electron jumps (or not) at will between an ion and a neutral atoms. This level of control depends on a precise understanding of the minute interactions between particles, and with their environment (such as magnetic fields), and will impact research for more precise time-standards, and our ability to engineer setups mimicking very complex systems, such as quantum diffusion or superconductivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is always difficult to "predict" the broader impact of any research program, a better understanding of ultracold systems containing a few charged particles will impact not only the development of new frequency standards and quantum information processing, but also many aspects relevant to other fields in science (the application of the results will be relevant to plasma physics, condensed matter physics, chemical physics, information science, etc.). In addition, this activity will promote teaching and training at all levels, from K-12 to the graduate level, and thus help in our goal of maintaining a highly trained workforce for the future.</AbstractNarration>
