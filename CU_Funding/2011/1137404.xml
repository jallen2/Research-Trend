    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Christopher Johnson of Yale University as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Johnson will work on studying the structure and dynamics of the gas-phase clusters that are thought to be important precursors in the formation of atmospheric aerosols. The PI will collaborate with scientists at the Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of the fundamental chemistry and physics of atmospheric aerosol formation and growth. For his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Johnson will develop simple hands-on models for use by students and members of the public, which make clear how modern chemical instrumentation works. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Johnson is aimed at developing an improved understanding of the chemistry and physics behind the formation of atmospheric aerosols. This is an area of research for which there is currently a great deal of uncertainty. This uncertainty hinders the development of e.g. more accurate models of the climate. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Johnson are aimed at educating young people from underrepresented groups about modern chemical instrumentation, in the hopes of encouraging these young people to consider careers in science.</AbstractNarration>
