    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to create a new and transformative class of lateral-flow bioanalytical microsystems based on inkjet fabrication and paper-based surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (P-SERS) for multi-analyte detection. While paper-based sensors have recently emerged for simplistic assays, the proposed approach of fabricating bio-functionalized surfaces and optofluidic SERS detection elements using inkjet printing enables sensitive and sophisticated assays that are extraordinarily low in cost and simple to perform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this effort is the establishment of the fundamental components that enable the emergence of new methodologies in sophisticated paper-based assays. These components include: (i) inkjet-based functionalization of cellulose paper with biomolecules and&lt;br/&gt;plasmonic nanostructures, (ii) Raman reporter molecules that are highly reactive with metal nanostructures, and (iii) a quantitative understanding of the mass transport advantages of paper-based fluidic biosensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are centered around the transformative approach to bioanalytics enabled by the P-SERS paradigm. The incredibly low cost of the proposed P-SERS&lt;br/&gt;microsystems combined with the unprecedented ease of use will lead to a broad range of new applications that require highly sensitive, low-cost disposable analytical devices, including applications in disaster response, at-home health care, and infectious disease screening. In addition, the unique properties of the P-SERS technology enable it to be incorporated as an educational tool at all stages of learning and in any environment. Research opportunities and engineering design projects built around inkjet fabrication and paper-based analytics will be created for underrepresented high school students and for undergraduate engineering students.</AbstractNarration>
