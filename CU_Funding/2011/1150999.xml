    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER project explores the feasibility of a consortium-based program of research and evaluation to support ongoing reforms in the DC public schools and to ensure a high priority for STEM education policy and practice in the emerging design of the consortium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on several recent NRC reports, the project will support (1) the improvement of the infrastructure for collection and analysis of STEM-specific transcript data so that it becomes an integral part of the data and indicator system for DCPS; (2) an exploration of the effectiveness of a consortium in determining priority topics for evaluation and research; and (3) ensuring that the new consortium produces new knowledge useful to other consortium-based efforts underway across the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notion of a university-based consortium as a strategy for improving DC public schools is both bold and innovative and warrants exploration, development and monitoring. There are also significant risk factors reform in the DC public schools takes place in a highly charged political environment where 17 different management structures have been tried since 1804. However, the notion of a consortium that provides accurate evidence and data is a vital one, as the District attempts to sustain the momentum of reform that was initiated by moving to Mayoral control.</AbstractNarration>
