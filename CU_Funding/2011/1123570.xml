    <AbstractNarration>Terrestrial Age Constraints for the Dicynodon Assemblage Zone, South Africa: Implications for the&lt;br/&gt;Timing of the End-Permian Mass Extinction&lt;br/&gt;Robert A. Gastaldo&lt;br/&gt;Colby College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep time records provide evidence for changes in biodiversity and ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;disruption and recovery, and act as models for understanding the potential changes now&lt;br/&gt;recognized affecting Earth. The End Permian Mass Extinction Event is reported to have&lt;br/&gt;impacted more than 90% of life in the oceans and up to 80% of life on land, with the&lt;br/&gt;collapse occurring simultaneously at 252.2±0.2 million years ago. Recent work of the PI&lt;br/&gt;and collaborators demonstrates that the paleontological records from the Karoo Basin,&lt;br/&gt;South Africa, on which the idea of sudden collapse on land is based, can not be used to&lt;br/&gt;identify a distinct event. Rather, criteria used to assign an end-Permian age to the biological&lt;br/&gt;patterns are inaccurate based on field relationships. The most reliable way to identify the&lt;br/&gt;timing of this event is by using chronometric techniques based on radiometric dating of&lt;br/&gt;single crystal zircons from volcanic ash deposits. To date, this has not been possible&lt;br/&gt;because it was believed that such deposits didn?t exist near the boundary.&lt;br/&gt;A fossilized forest litter, located 70 m below the level where the extinction event is&lt;br/&gt;reported, is buried and preserved by volcanic ash deposits in Wapadsberg Pass, Eastern&lt;br/&gt;Cape Province. A pilot study of single crystal zircons analyzed by isotope dilution thermal&lt;br/&gt;ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) using the ET535 tracer (spike) solution, distributed by&lt;br/&gt;the EARTHTIME initiative, resulted in a suite of ages indicating a detrital source for the&lt;br/&gt;zircons. Ages range from the NeoProterozoic (1038.78 ± 1.42 to 606.76 ± 1.0 Ma [3 grains]) to&lt;br/&gt;the early Mesozoic (252.0 ± 0.5 to 251.8 ± .038 Ma [3 grains]). The project goals include the&lt;br/&gt;acquisition of a larger suite of detrital zircon from several stratigraphic horizons in&lt;br/&gt;Wapadsberg Pass and elsewhere that will be age dated. These will be correlated with&lt;br/&gt;changes in sedimentary environments in the collection sites to place an age constraint on&lt;br/&gt;the biodiversity trends identified in the Karoo Basin. The project tests the hypothesis that&lt;br/&gt;the ?Mother? of all Mass Extinctions was a phenomenon restricted to the oceans, and&lt;br/&gt;changes in biodiversity trends on land were decoupled from those documented elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;If turnover in continental biodiversity did not happen simultaneously with the patterns&lt;br/&gt;identified in the oceans, a new model for the greatest mass extinction in Earth history will&lt;br/&gt;have to be developed.</AbstractNarration>
