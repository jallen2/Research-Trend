    <AbstractNarration>The Grambling State University HBCU-UP project, Center for Mathematical Achievement in Science &amp; Technology II (CMAST II), is designed to improve student performance and increase the success rate of STEM undergraduates by infusing problem based and inquiry learning pedagogies in introductory sciences and technology courses, expanding a Scholars' program with academic coaching, restructuring a summer science program for high school students, and implementing a science and mathematics teacher certification program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary focus of this project is student retention in STEM majors with an approach to increase student retention in STEM introductory courses. These courses will be redesigned to include problem based learning which has been found to improve student learning outcomes and success. Problem based pedagogies have been piloted with promising results in selected sections of introductory courses in Engineering Technology, Computer Science, and Chemistry (using POGIL-Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning), and this project will infuse these pedagogies in the first and second sequence of courses in these subject areas and Physics. Faculty development workshops will be provided to faculty to assist them in implementing these teaching strategies in problem based learning and inquiry. The project will use the STEM First Year Learning Community as an intervention also to support academic success and increase student retention in STEM. A Rising Sophomore Summer Academy will be a three week research training experience to prepare and increase skills and participation of students in research experiences for undergraduates.A STEM Teacher Education Certification program will be developed for biology, physics, and mathematics majors to get teacher certified along with attaining their STEM degree and the project expects to increase the institution's production of STEM teachers.</AbstractNarration>
