    <AbstractNarration>The long-term vision for this Research Initiation Grant in Engineering Education is to transform the way computer engineering is taught by establishing the computer engineering curriculum around a carefully designed learning platform. This engineering education project involves research and faculty collaborators from Computer Engineering, the English Department, and the College of Education. It aims to introduce the learning platform system in various computer engineering courses and perform qualitative and quantitative studies to gauge the impact on student learning. The project will generate new knowledge on how students learn, retain, and transfer engineering concepts in a community of practice. It will also test whether students? fixed mindsets can be changed to growth mindsets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research initiation project will provide a vehicle for the PI to explore PLP?s impact on student learning through well-known frameworks and assessment models. The impact on the PI and his graduate students will be significant, as they will learn the intricacies of quantitative and qualitative research in education. Undergraduate students will benefit through a well-designed educational tool. Collaborations will be formed that will lead to future projects where experts from the social and educational sciences will work with engineering faculty to perform rigorous research on student learning.</AbstractNarration>
