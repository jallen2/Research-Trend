    <AbstractNarration>In this project we will focus on four important aspects (requirements)&lt;br/&gt;of an end-to-end software environment for performing multiple parallel&lt;br/&gt;non-rigid registrations over the Grid. Our application is Image Guided&lt;br/&gt;Neurosurgery (IGNS). IGNS is an important tool for neurosurgical&lt;br/&gt;resection which is a common therapeutic intervention in the treatment&lt;br/&gt;of malignant brain tumors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four requirements we will study in this project are: (1) the&lt;br/&gt;high-performance of the parallel and distributed non-rigid&lt;br/&gt;registration code by dynamically balancing the processors work-load,&lt;br/&gt;(2) the ease-of-use from medical doctors (radiologist) of a&lt;br/&gt;web-service by developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for clients&lt;br/&gt;of our web-service (3) the portability of the code to run from a&lt;br/&gt;single high-end workstation to more than one clusters of workstations&lt;br/&gt;within the local and wide area networks available to research&lt;br/&gt;hospitals and medical centers, (4) the reliability by guaranteeing&lt;br/&gt;that part of the system will complete the computations for the image&lt;br/&gt;registration and by making sure we meet the time constrains by&lt;br/&gt;acquiring and re-configuring the system at runtime to compensate for&lt;br/&gt;lost (faulty) computing resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end-product will be a prototype of an IGNS web-service. However,&lt;br/&gt;this project will have broader impact to image guided therapy because&lt;br/&gt;the same framework (but different modalities and finite element&lt;br/&gt;approximation models) can be used in prostate biopsy and treatment,&lt;br/&gt;and liver cryotherapy.</AbstractNarration>
