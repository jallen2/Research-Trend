    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop and commercialize cost-effective high performance macromolecular antioxidants based on Polnox's proprietary "dual type moiety per molecule" (DT-mPM) technology for sustainable-alternate bio-oils. Oxidative stability presents a key issue for industrial bio-oils. These oils, which are derived from bio-resources, have inferior stability compared those derived from fossil fuels. In particular, fuels and lubricants derived from plant-based polyunsaturated fatty acids are especially prone to severe oxidation. It has been demonstrated in Phase I that the DT-mPM antioxidants are significantly more effective in combating degradation of these bio-oils vs. state-of-the-art commercial antioxidants. The current, state-of-the-art, commercial antioxidants do not meet the challenges posed by plant-derived bio-oils. Current antioxidants were developed to protect petroleum lubricants and are simply not capable of meeting the stability issues posed by bio-lubricants. This proposal addresses the key steps involved in the product development of antioxidants for bio-lubricants; namely, (a) molecular design optimization, (b) cost-effective process scale up, (c) preparation of pound scale of lead antioxidants identified in Phase I, and (d) product storage stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to play an important role in reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil and providing a cleaner environment by reducing the pollution of air, soil, water, and the eco-system. Societal benefits from the increased use of bio-lubricants include less potential for environmental pollution (e.g., from loss during use or improper disposal of waste lubricants, accidental oil spillage during industrial use, or off-shore drilling) as well as reduced dependence on imported petroleum as a raw material. However, as oils are developed from renewable alternate energy resources, there are some inherent issues to be addressed: (1) thermo-oxidative stability, and (2) pour-point properties. By addressing the thermo-oxidative stability problem of bio-oils through the development and commercialization of new high performance antioxidants, this will enable the production of higher quality alternate oils that are biodegradable and environmentally safe.</AbstractNarration>
