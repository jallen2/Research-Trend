    <AbstractNarration>This research aims at developing new theories and techniques to&lt;br/&gt;better understand and manage shared memory cache in multi-core architectures. &lt;br/&gt;The core concept is program footprint, which is the amount of memory access in a period of&lt;br/&gt;execution. Complete measurement requires counting data access in all&lt;br/&gt;execution windows, which is too costly. This&lt;br/&gt;research develops computational methods to first make all-window&lt;br/&gt;analysis feasible through a set of new profiling algorithms and then&lt;br/&gt;make this analysis cost-effective by reducing the cost through statistical&lt;br/&gt;inference, sampling, and parallel profiling and effectively obtaining&lt;br/&gt;this information in real time as a program executes. Footprint&lt;br/&gt;information is essential in analyzing cache sharing between programs&lt;br/&gt;and program tasks. It enables the second part of the project, a set&lt;br/&gt;of tools that predict the performance of parallel workloads without&lt;br/&gt;parallel testing. In addition, the footprint information enables a&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally different approach to common techniques. In the third&lt;br/&gt;part, the project develops a new cache-hint insertion tool to&lt;br/&gt;approximate optimal caching and a&lt;br/&gt;memory-performance tuning tool to be used by software developer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As multi-core processors become commonplace and cloud computing is&lt;br/&gt;gaining acceptance, more applications are run in a shared environment.&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this research will fundamentally alter the way&lt;br/&gt;programmers understand and improve memory performance on multi-core&lt;br/&gt;systems. Software developers and hardware engineers will have a new&lt;br/&gt;tool set to tackle the complex problem of managing on-chip memory for&lt;br/&gt;not just sequential but also parallel code and for not just achieving&lt;br/&gt;good performance but also for ensuring stable performance in a dynamic&lt;br/&gt;environment. The broader impacts of this research will include&lt;br/&gt;deeper understanding and more precise characterization of locality&lt;br/&gt;in computational processes, which has implications in other&lt;br/&gt;computing-related disciplines, and memory efficient software and&lt;br/&gt;hardware design, which saves energy and cost and has broad economical&lt;br/&gt;and social benefits.</AbstractNarration>
