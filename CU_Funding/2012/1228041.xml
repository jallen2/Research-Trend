    <AbstractNarration>PI: Amos, Delaina &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Louisville&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The need for innovation in high-efficiency lighting devices has been recognized for some time. Solid-state lighting devices have the potential to increase two- or more fold over the efficiencies of the best conventional lighting technologies available today. Even though there has been significant progress with solid-state device technology based on single crystal semiconductors, there is still a large need for developing such technologies utilizing inexpensive materials and processes. Organic-inorganic composite lighting technology offers such possibilities in terms of both materials and processes; however, the current state-of-the-art technology is limited by low efficiencies. This BRIGE award proposes to develop new materials, processes and fundamental understanding necessary for transformational advances with light emitting diode (LED) devices based on organic-inorganic composite materials. The objective is to develop novel quantum dots (QDs), QD/ligand chemistry and conductive polymers (CP) for use in hybrid organic-inorganic LEDs. Another objective of this project is to investigate the use of inkjet printing and other scalable techniques for the thin film deposition of the multi-layer device. Specifically, the project will focus on the following four directions: (1) synthesis of novel QDs made using earth abundant and less toxic elements; (2) functionalization of QDs and investigation of the QD-CP interface in terms of device performance; (3) use of inkjet deposition to lay down the QD and polymer layers in discrete red, green and blue sections to produce white light; and (4) fabrication and testing of LED devices in terms of energy conversion and light emission efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed broadening participation plan includes the following objectives (1) to create and disseminate a traveling history of lighting display with an accompanying video targeted at regional K-12 students; (2) to create a half-day Engineering school-wide undergraduate and graduate research symposium; and (3) to develop curriculum for a new graduate course entitled "Quantum Dots and Lighting." In addition to research and curricular integration outcomes, the PI plans to focus on various activities for increasing graduation and retention rates for underrepresented minorities in the STEM areas. Long-term societal impacts will be to elevate the awareness of renewable energy challenges, goals and emerging lighting technologies at the K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels as well as to increase graduation and retention rates for this target population. Technological impacts will include new scalable processing techniques leading to lower cost LED lighting and significantly improved environmental impact and lighting energy efficiencies relative to traditional lighting.</AbstractNarration>
