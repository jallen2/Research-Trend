    <AbstractNarration>This award is supporting implementation of a special professional development opportunity for current and future geoscience faculty and teaching assistants that is aimed at increasing capacity for educating students with disabilities in the geosciences and engaging them in geoscience education and career pathways. This program, which will be launched at the 34th International Geological Congress in Brisbane Australia (Symposium 1.2. Geoscience Education Theme 1: Geoscience for Society) and repeated at the 2012 Geological Society of America (GSA) annual meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina. This project is the outgrowth of a new collaboration between the International Advisory for Geoscience Diversity (IAGD) and the International Union of Geological Sciences/Commission on Geoscience Education, Training and Technology Transfer (IUGS/COGE). This instructional workshop is specifically designed for faculty who may need assistance in modifying course materials to include and accommodate students with disabilities. Most faculty members are not adequately prepared to include students with disabilities but are faced with the immediate challenge of retrofitting accommodations when such students arrive at their classes. The highlight of this professional development workshop session will be a first-hand perspective from students with disabilities involved in the presentation and workshop activities. Student presenters will discuss their experiences in the geosciences, and how instructional materials and activities can be accommodated to include them in every aspect of geoscience education. This workshop is being offered at no cost to the participants, in order to self-promote the effort of classroom accessibility and to disseminate the materials and teaching strategies as broadly as possible.</AbstractNarration>
