    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is to fund the Undergraduate Knot Theory Conference 2012 to bring together undergraduates and undergraduate faculty interested in knot theory, to be held at Denison University from July 15-18, 2012. Knot theory is a field very amenable to research by undergraduates. There are a variety of REU programs with a knot theory component. Moreover, there are many faculty members who would like to involve their students in undergraduate research in knot theory. This conference will bring together experts in knot theory with undergraduates who are either currently participating in knot theory REUs, undergraduates who have participated in knot theory research, current graduate students who participated as undergraduates in knot theory research, and perhaps most importantly, faculty who either have involved undergraduates in knot theory research or who would like to involve undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a centerpiece, we will have a collective problem session to give participants numerous ideas for future research directions. This conference will provide an opportunity for students to experience a mathematics research conference that is specifically designed and directed toward them. Moreover, the conference will establish a supportive network of students and faculty with an interest in knot theory research, thus furthering the involvement of students in the field of mathematics.
