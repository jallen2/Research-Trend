    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to learn the sensor fabrication method, the optical cross-connecting architecture, the network framework topology and the system autonomy that is required to create a cognitive and fault-tolerant fiber optic sensor network for structural health monitoring under harsh conditions. The approach is to examine and learn from the unique sensing features of the spider orb-web, formulate the critical sensor and network parameters, and apply this knowledge to the design and demonstration of a robust fiber optic sensor network. Specifically, a new method will be derived for fabrication of robust fiber Bragg grating sensors using high repetition rate femtosecond laser pulse trains. A new lossless cross-connector will be designed to enable the meshed sensor network. The theoretical model of the optical network topology will be established to obtain a fault-tolerant network management methodology for multiplexing and organizing a large number of sensors. The interactions between the pump and probe signals will be studied to find a time-domain technique for fast and fault-tolerant sensor interrogation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will result in an enabling sensing technology for in situ monitoring of the health status of critical civil infrastructure under harsh conditions. The studies will enrich the knowledge base of monitoring technologies for safe operation of the nation?s civil infrastructure, especially for improving mission-critical services and emergency responses during extreme events such as earthquakes. The research will also be integrated into academics through various educational and outreach actives such as undergraduate and graduate course enrichment, support of senior design projects, hands-on workshops for 7th/8th grade students, and outreach to high school students.</AbstractNarration>
