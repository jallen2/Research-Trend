    <AbstractNarration>Many objects in our Galaxy and in the universe are difficult to observe because their light is obscured by dust between earth and the objects. This is a particular problem for observing in the visual part of the spectrum as the dust is very effective at absorbing and effectively blocking visual light. In order to study objects embedded in dust (often true of the environments where stars and planets are initially formed) telescopes must look in the infrared part of the spectrum as infrared light can more readily penetrate through dust. Dr. Dan Jaffe and his collaborators at the University of Texas at Austin have developed a new technology infrared spectrograph. Spectrographs disperse the light into a band of colors (much like a rainbow) and the resulting "spectrum" can be analyzed to reveal the presence of and identify various atoms and molecules and also to measure the velocities that objects have relative to earth. Dr. Jaffe has developed a new type of diffraction grating (the optical element that disperses the light into its spectrum) that is much more compact and efficient than standard gratings. Thus the new spectrograph is smaller and less expensive than spectrographs of similar capabilities. The new spectrograph will be installed on the McDonald Observatory 2.7-meter telescope for commissioning and initial science verification. Discussions are underway with NSF-funded observatories Gemini and NOAO about the possibility of putting the spectrograph on their larger telescopes which are available to all astronomers though a competivie merit-review process. NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences is funding this work through the Major Research Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>
