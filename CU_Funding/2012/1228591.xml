    <AbstractNarration>An award from the Major Research and Instrumentation Program (MRI) will support the acquisition of a Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS) for state-of-the-art isotopic measurements at the newly-formed Scripps Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. This new instrumentation will enhance existing mass spectrometry facilities in the San Diego region. A TIMS instrument will allow precise measurements of a range of extinct (e.g., Mn-Cr), long-lived radiogenic (e.g., Os, Sr, Nd, Pb), and stable isotope systems (e.g., Ca) at a range of sample sizes and employed to a range of geological, cosmochemical, oceanographic and biological processes. The instrument will be used to measure radiogenic isotope compositions of igneous rocks to understand planet formation and differentiation and to trace chemical variations in Earth?s mantle, to establish the formation of precious metal ores and to investigate processes occurring during highly-explosive volcanic eruptions. In the biological and ocean sciences the instrument will be used to precisely measure stable isotope fractionations in the carbonate skeletons of marine organisms to study ocean-acidification, and to isotopically trace hydrothermal alteration and biologically mediated water-rock interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new TIMS facility will help achieve a fundamental obligation to train an increasingly large, diverse and talented pool of post-doctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students who rely on isotopic approaches for their dissertation research in the San Diego area. It will permit enhanced undergraduate participation through independent research dissertations, research experience for undergraduate programs, and through integration of principles, examples and methods of isotope ratio measurements using next-generation mass spectrometry into the classroom. A state-of-the-art TIMS will also enhance on-going community outreach efforts, including demonstrations and examples used in science, technology, engineering and mathematics events for underrepresented minorities and female students.</AbstractNarration>
