    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1236370&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jain, Ankur&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vertical stacking of multiple Silicon substrates containing microelectronic circuits, often referred to as a three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) promises to provide substantial performance improvement while also exacerbating the thermal management challenge. 3D IC technology introduces several new materials and interfaces whose thermal and thermomechanical performance remains poorly known. The objective of this research is to investigate and measure fundamental thermal transport and thermomechanical properties of materials and interfaces in 3D IC technology. Time-domain Joule heating methods will be used to characterize thermal transport through die-to-die interfaces in 3D ICs. Thermomechanical properties of such interfaces will be measured. This research will improve the understanding of thermal transport in 3D ICs. Experimental data obtained in this work will help validate several analytical and simulations-based models that have recently been developed. The long-term goal of this research will be to develop a complete understanding of the interaction between thermal transport and electrical design of 3D ICs and other advanced microelectronic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that by addressing thermal management concerns in 3D ICs, the proposed work will enable 3D ICs with improved electrical performance. This work will contribute to a More-than-Moore approach for design of next-generation microelectronics wherein cost-effective performance improvement is achieved not just by dimensional scaling, but also by vertical integration. The work will be tightly-integrated with industry partners which will facilitate technology transfer of key thermal management principles in 3D ICs to the industry. While the industry will benefit from the fundamental, enabling nature of the work, graduate students will also benefit from mentorship by leading industry technologists and internships. Undergraduate students will be included in this research through senior capstone projects and through REUs during the summer. Research findings from the project will be incorporated into graduate-level and upper-level undergraduate courses being taught at the University of Texas at Arlington.</AbstractNarration>
