    <AbstractNarration>Mutual mate choice in the bushcricket Ephippiger diurnus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few decisions are more important for individual fitness than choosing when and with whom to mate. Although mate choice is a widely studied topic, little is known about cases where mutual mate choice occurs. The bushcricket Ephippiger diurnus provides a unique opportunity to explore mutual mate choice: females choose males based on their acoustic calls, and males provide females with a nuptial gift (nutritious spermatophores). The fellow will test the hypothesis that males display mate choice, and that their degree of choosiness depends on their nutritional status. The fellow will also investigate the relationship between the traits females use to evaluate males and male quality. Finally, the interplay between male and female choice as it relates to body mass will be investigated. Interactions between male and female preferences have received little attention, yet are likely to be an important selective force on mate choice in many species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the Fellow will receive training in working with Orthopterans, in recording and analyzing acoustic signals, and in analyzing spermatophore quality. The Fellow will pursue several outreach activities through the host institution. She will engage students in her research, and she is especially interested in engaging students from groups that are underrepresented in science. This project will foster integration between research and teaching: the Fellow will teach Behavioral Biology at the University of Tours using inquiry-based activities that will involve having students work on independent research projects relating to her research. This international teaching experience will expose the fellow to a rich cultural diversity and broaden her perspectives in the classroom, improving her skills at engaging students from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
