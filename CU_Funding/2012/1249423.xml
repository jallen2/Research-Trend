    <AbstractNarration>The Research on American Indian Science Education (RAISE) project is an empirical research study whose overarching objective is to investigate the efficacy of culturally congruent instruction (CCI) for improving American Indian college students? science achievement. American Indians as a group are currently underachieving on nearly every metric of science achievement, from standardized tests, to high school and college graduation rates, to entry into science related professions. A small but growing number of studies is providing preliminary evidence of the efficacy of CCI in improving Indigenous students' achievement in math and science, but additional and rigorously designed empirical studies like RAISE are necessary in order to further elucidate the nature of the relationship between CCI and student outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;A recent product stemming from research in CCI is the Culturally Congruent Instruction Survey (CCIS). Designed and validated by tribal elders, teachers, and faculty working with pre college students from three American Indian reservations in Montana, the survey operationalizes the nature of CCI for five Montana tribal cultures by outlining the specifics of CCI in three main categories - science content, pedagogy and instructional environment. The study described here tests the efficacy of CCI by systematically infusing specific elements of CCI, as found on the CCIS, into select college science courses, and investigating their effects on student outcomes. The study employs a mixed methods quasi experimental design, comparing pre and post treatment data such as course completion rates, course grades, quality of student work samples, student attitude surveys and focus group responses, graduation rates and entry into science professions. Course content, instruction and environment are thoroughly documented through classroom instruction observations, course syllabi and outlines, and interviews with course instructors. Multiple regression analyses are used to identify correlations between specific CCI course elements and student outcomes data, with additional analyses conducted to further characterize these relationships, such as interactions between variables.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The RAISE project, by providing evidence of the nature of CCI and its efficacy for improving American Indian students' achievement in college science, holds potential for broad impacts. Application of the findings from the study to transform the SKC science curriculum and instruction will translate into higher levels of science achievement and greater numbers of students pursuing science related professions. The active engagement of SKC science faculty in the study will improve their understanding of education research and of effective science instruction, thus contributing to their professional development both as science educators and researchers. The dissemination of the study?s findings through publications and presentations to a broad audience of STEM faculty and education researchers expands its potential nationally and globally for improving college STEM instruction and student achievement. The increased number of STEM graduates will help ameliorate the shortage of STEM professionals in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
