    <AbstractNarration>For this project, the investigator has developed an integrative study including ecological, morphological, biochemical and genetic observations to understand individual responses of corals to temperature stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased coral mortality and subsequent modifications of coral reef ecosystems are responses to the changing environmental conditions that include direct and indirect effects of increased atmospheric CO2, increases in water temperatures, disease outbreaks, bleaching, and opportunistic pathogens. In the Caribbean, combinations of these natural effects have affected several coral species, among them the Montastraea annularis species complex. Considered one of the most important genera of corals in the Caribbean, these species have been affected by diseases and bleaching episodes. Infections and environmental effectors have significantly reduced abundances of M. annularis. Given that these species show local-specific responses to thermal stress and differential survival rates, it is likely that individual genetic composition may offer different levels of resistance/susceptibility to environmental stressors and infectious diseases. Therefore, a combination of observations that includes these different variables is needed to resolve key questions in the response of corals to environmental changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research include mentoring for graduate and undergraduate students in two minority serving programs at the University of Texas Arlington. Mentoring activities involve participation of students in all aspects of the scientific method, including manuscript preparation. Furthermore, the investigator will join outreach efforts of the sponsoring scientist who is engaged in local and statewide activities. The investigator will also work with local junior high schools as well as participate in the Hispanic Engineering Science and Technology conference, where students are taught about coral reefs and exposed to interactive workshops on the role corals play in healthy reef ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (OCE PRF) program, with goals to support novel research by early career scientists and increase the diversity of the U.S. ocean sciences workforce and research community. With OCE-PRF support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to ocean sciences and broaden participation of under-represented groups in the ocean sciences.</AbstractNarration>
