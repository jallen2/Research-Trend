    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participants to EAAI-12, the Third Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence. EAAI-12 will be collocated with the Twenty-sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-12), to be held July 22-26, 2012, in Toronto. EAAI will be held on July 23 and 24. The goals of EAAI-12 are to expand the educational relevance of and benefits to researchers, educators, graduate students, and all others who may be interested within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAAI-12 provides a venue for researchers and educators to discuss pedagogical issues and share resources related to teaching AI and using AI in education across a variety of curricular levels (K-12 through postgraduate training), with a natural emphasis on undergraduate and graduate teaching and learning. Materials to be presented, discussed, and shared by participants include: model AI assignments with innovative ready-to-adopt materials; syllabi, project ideas and pedagogical strategies related to teaching AI; multi-disciplinary curricula highlighting the use of AI in other contexts (e.g., computational biology, cognitive science, computational economics, philosophy); and resources for teaching specific subareas or topics within AI (e.g., machine learning, game playing, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision). There will be a keynote lecture discussing recent experience with on-line AI classes at Stanford University. The EAAI symposium will seek to make available contributions from the symposium. Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts of EAAI-12 include enhancements to the teaching, learning, and understanding of AI, the fostering of stronger research in AI, and increased participation of talented researchers and teachers in AI and more widely those in Computer Science and STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
