    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second the Gordon Research Conference on Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) to be held between July 08 and July 13, 2012. Biological functions are based on molecular recognition and complex networks are organized around a series of inter-related protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interfaces. The traditional view posits that molecular recognition is achieved through a combination of shape complementarity and specific interactions between a protein and its binding partner. Traditional views are, however, being challenged by observations that roughly 30% of eukaryotic proteins fail to fold autonomously and their inability to fold is required for function. Such proteins, referred to as intrinsically disordered proteins or IDPs are implicated in a wide variety of functions that include fundamental processes in biology. IDPs add a new dimension to molecular recognition because they undergo large-scale conformational changes and they raise the question of how specificity in recognition is achieved despite the absence of precise pre-organized shape complementarity. This an opportune time to bring together scientists in the IDP field to identify the important questions, take stock of current progress, and chart the course for rapid and meaningful progress in the study of conformational heterogeneity and its role in protein function. The Gordon Conference on Intrinsically Disordered Proteins features an outstanding and diverse group of scientists at the forefront of research in the IDP field. The conference is organized around thematic sessions focusing on transcriptional regulation, signaling pathways and modules, IDP phase behavior and molecular recognition, emerging technologies for studying IDPs, IDP quality control and homeostasis, regulated self-assembly and mis-assembly of IDPs, and IDP targeting, trafficking and processing. Novel technological advances are needed to study IDPs therefore the conference will showcase the development of state-of-the art biophysical methods, advances in theory and computation, and the synergy with novel tools from molecular biology, for studying IDPs and developing a quantitative understanding regarding their functions in vivo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gordon Research Conference will promote research of IDPs at different levels and in various fields. The meeting has a highly relevant and synergistic focus on understanding the mechanisms by which IDPs function and the development of new integrated methods for studying and characterizing IDP form and function. In the final program, 12 of the 40 invited speakers and discussion leaders are women. The program has a balanced mixture of established and young scientists. Of the two program slots set aside for postdoctoral speakers, the conference chairs will strive to fill at least one with a woman / member of an under-represented minority community. The conference chairs will also ensure that at the stage of selection of participants in the meeting, minority participants will be selected to attend the meeting. When the attendees are selected from the pool of applicants, principles of affirmative action with respect to minority groups, women and junior scientists will be used as criteria, in addition to the date of application and the scientific background of the applicant.</AbstractNarration>
