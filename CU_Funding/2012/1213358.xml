    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Alexander Li at Washington State University and his group will develop new analytical methods for sensitive detection using photoswitchable probes. Specifically, the project will first prepare photoswitchable probes, aiming at optimizing those properties associated with photoswitching, such as the bright-to-dark contrast. Subsequently, samples labeled with such photoswitchable probes will be investigated using fluorescence microscopes. The fundamental principle to be demonstrated is that photoswitchable probes offer much enhanced sensitivity while compared to conventional fluorescent probes. One of the advantages of using photoswitchable probes is that photoswitching can effectively provide means to rid of false positives, a very important attribute in real-world detections. Another anticipated outcome is that photoswitching enables frequency-domain imaging, which amplifies the signal while suppressing other noise. The key to the success resides in the chemistry because preparation of such photoswitchable probes is at the focal point at solving real-world problems like false positives and signal amplification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students who will be involved in this project will be trained in chemical synthesis, biological sample preparation, optical instrumentation, laser spectroscopy, and photonic measurements. Outreach to middle school and high school students through workshop will help to stimulate scientific interest of the younger generation and broaden impacts to general public.</AbstractNarration>
