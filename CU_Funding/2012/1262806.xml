    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program is providing a 10-week summer experience in engineering education research to a group of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) undergraduate students recruited from across the nation. Each summer, eight REU students are working closely with faculty members and their graduate students in the Department of Engineering Education at Utah State University on four research projects that focus on self-regulated learning in engineering education. Self-regulated learning refers to learners' ability and skills to understand and control their learning environment. Example projects on which REU students are working include: 1) development of a self-regulation survey instrument for problem solving in engineering, and 2) effect of computer simulation and animation on students' motivation, self-regulating, and cognitive strategies in a foundational engineering course. REU students are also attending a series of workshops offered by faculty mentors. The workshop topics include self-regulation learning and its role in engineering education, responsible research, development of research questions, mixed methods research methodologies, and educational data analysis. Assessment data is being collected to determine whether REU students and their faculty mentors are better off because of this Site program. The results of this Site program are being disseminated in a variety of ways, such as conference presentations and journal publications. This REU Site program acts as a catalyst for undergraduates to retain in STEM careers, particularly careers in teaching and STEM education research.</AbstractNarration>
