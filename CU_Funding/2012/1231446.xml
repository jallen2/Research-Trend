    <AbstractNarration>The Workshop on Logic and Systems Biology is affiliated with the 2012 Logic in Computer Science (LICS) Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia and is scheduled for June 29. It will consist of one day of invited lectures. The talks will cover a variety of connections between computer science and biology, with emphasis on the uses of formal logic in modeling biomolecular interaction systems.&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;The LICS organizing committee believes that logic will have an important role in systems biology, and invited a proposal for a workshop to explore current and future applications of logic to system biology. Since systems biology is a new field of study which is still unfamiliar to most LICS attendees, the organizers decided to restrict the lectures to invitation only, with an open session for discussion of future research. The lectures are intended to be accessible to computer scientists who have some knowledge about the use of formal methods for analyzing software and hardware, but who may not have much experience with biology. The speakers will also be invited to submit more technical versions of their talks to a refereed proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT&lt;br/&gt;The lectures will explore connections between biology, computer science, and mathematics, with the goal of encouraging collaborations between researchers in the different groups, leading to new applications of logic and raising interesting theoretical questions. It is also expected that graduate students and recent Ph. D.s in computer science will attend the workshop. Since the talks will be partly expository, this will be an opportunity for them to broaden their perspective, with future benefits to their research and teaching.</AbstractNarration>
