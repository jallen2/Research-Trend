    <AbstractNarration>1266294 Princeton University; Claire Gmachi &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center, led by Princeton University, will focus on developing the medical applications of new mid-infrared technologies. The clinical research partner for the proposed center is the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center for MIMES plans to form long-term universityclinicindustry partnerships dedicated to the research and development of engineering systems employing mid-infrared photonic technologies for medical applications. As yet un-exploited opportunities present themselves when using mid-infrared lasers at specific wavelengths for medical applications. First, biological and physiological compounds, such as glucose, dissolved blood gases, or proteins and their malformed cancer-implicated forms have characteristic spectroscopic features in the mid-infrared spectral range. Next, breath constituents are rapidly gaining in importance as bio markers for health, disease-control, or drug-use monitoring; they can be detected rapidly by the only-now becoming available fast time-resolved mid-infrared sensors. Finally, specific tissue can be coagulated, ablated, and otherwise manipulated more safely and less damaging to surrounding tissue with the use of high-power lasers at wavelengths specifically targeting proteins, lipids, or water. Similarly, the needs are great for new Diagnostics techniques and technologies that enable new medical research, and develop new, fast and/or non-invasive diagnostics tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will operate at the intersection of two rapidly advancing, cutting-edge research fields mid-infrared photonics and bio-medical engineering and diagnostics and joins them together under the umbrella of long-term universityclinicindustry partnership. The necessary outcomes are new bio-medical diagnostics tools, developed so close to industrial reality and understanding to enable a most speedy translation of the new discoveries, knowledge, and prototypes into the marketplace and society, providing better healthcare in both the short and long-term for all. MIMES will conduct research primarily with graduate students and senior undergraduate students who have clear interests in industrial R&amp;D and careers in industry. This focus, together with a comprehensive recruiting and mentoring plan with strong industry involvement will foster the development of a diverse, superbly trained, and globally competitive group of graduates for a workforce that is ready to assume leadership in real-world, applied, bio-medical and photonic engineering.</AbstractNarration>
