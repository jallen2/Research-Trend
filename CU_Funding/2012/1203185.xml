    <AbstractNarration>Vlahovska&lt;br/&gt;1203185&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial travel support will be provided for students and young researchers to attend the international Summer School on "Biological Complex Fluids" in Corsica, France. The school in Cargese, Corsica (France) will meet in June, 2012, to discuss challenges in and approaches to the modeling of flows of soft materials. The conference has a strong interdisciplinary character involving researchers from different disciplines (physics, engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, biology and medical science) as well as different generations (expert senior scientists and students). The school integrates research and teaching aimed at training the future generations of engineers, physicists, and biologists to effectively cooperate, which can have significant academic and technological benefits. The intellectual merit is high. The scientific program brings together an impressive group of speakers. 14 internationally renowned speakers (including 3 women) from US have been invited. The proposed support will help to recruit students and young researchers from US to attend the school, which potentially has great impact on their careers. The school will be held in a 13-day period, with long 3 hour-lectures on the fundamentals on weekday mornings and short 45min seminar-style lectures on novel/advanced topics in the afternoons.</AbstractNarration>
