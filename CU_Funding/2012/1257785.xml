    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses how, when, and why organisms diversify and become distinct species. The focal system is an under-studied biodiversity hotspot: Mexican pine-oak woodlands. Sampling of 34 emblematic vertebrates will occur across four major mountain ranges in Mexico and linked regions in the United States. Species include 21 birds, 4 amphibians, and 9 reptiles. DNA data will be collected using novel techniques that capture hundreds of genomic regions, which will be assayed to determine: (1) if there are overlooked cryptic species; (2) whether common barriers (e.g. lowland regions) have influenced diversification across species; and (3) whether the timing of species origins coincides with periods of mountain building or glacial cycling through deep time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will uncover new biodiversity in a part of the world that is known for its species richness and that is under severe threat from habitat loss. Knowing the basic units of biodiversity is the first step toward mitigating such threats. This study will also help understand how biodiversity is generated and over what timescale. All specimens collected will be deposited in natural history collections at two U.S. museums, and will be available for many other studies -- natural history collections are public repositories of biodiversity with virtually limitless future potential on subjects ranging from public health and disease to basic science.</AbstractNarration>
