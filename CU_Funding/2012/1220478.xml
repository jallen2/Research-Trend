    <AbstractNarration>The Gulf of Mexico deep water ecosystems are threatened by the persistent threat of ocean acidification. Deep-water corals will be among the first to feel the effects of this process, in particular the deep-water scleractinians that form their skeleton from aragonite. The continued shoaling of the aragonite saturation horizon (the depth below which aragonite is undersaturated) will place many of the known, and as yet undiscovered, deep-water corals at risk in the very near future. The most common deep-water framework-forming scleractinian in the world's oceans is Lophelia pertusa. This coral is most abundant in the North Atlantic, where aragonite saturation states are relatively high, but it also creates extensive reef structures between 300 and 600 m depth in the Gulf of Mexico where aragonite saturation states were previously unknown. Preliminary data indicate that pH at this depth range is between 7.85 and 8.03, and the aragonite saturation state is typically between 1.28 and 1.69. These are the first measurements of aragonite saturation state for the deep Gulf of Mexico, and are among the lowest Aragonite saturation state yet recorded for framework-forming corals in any body of water, at any depth. This project will examine the effects of ocean acidification on L. pertusa, combining laboratory experiments, rigorous oceanographic measurements, the latest genome and transcriptome sequencing platforms, and quantitative PCR and enzyme assays to examine changes in coral gene expression and enzyme activity related to differences in carbonate chemistry. Short-term and long-term laboratory experiments will be performed at Aragonite saturation state of 1.45 and 0.75 and the organismal (e.g., survivorship and calcification rate) and genetic (e.g., transcript abundance) responses of the coral will be monitored. Genomic DNA and RNA will be extracted, total mRNA purified, and comprehensive and quantitative profiles of the transcriptome generated using a combination of 454 and Illumina sequencing technologies. Key genes in the calcification pathways as well as other differentially expressed genes will be targeted for specific qPCR assays to verify the Illumina sequencing results. On a research cruise, L. pertusa will be sampled (preserved at depth) along a natural gradient in carbonate chemistry, and included in the Illumina sequencing and qPCR assays. Water samples will be obtained by submersible-deployed niskin bottles adjacent to the coral collections as well as CTD casts of the water column overlying the sites. Water samples will be analyzed for pH, alkalinity, nitrates and soluble reactive phosphorus. These will be used in combination with historical data in a model to hindcast Aragonite saturation state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project will provide new physiological and genetic data on an ecologically-significant and anthropogenically-threatened deepwater coral in the Gulf of Mexico. An experimental system, already developed by the PIs, offers controlled conditions to test the effect of Aragonite saturation state on calcification rates in scleractinians and, subsequently, to identify candidate genes and pathways involved in the response to reduced pH and Aragonite saturation state. Both long-term and population sampling experiments will provide additional transcriptomic data and specifically investigate the expression of the candidate genes. These results will contribute to our understanding of the means by which scleractinians may acclimate and acclimatize to low pH, alkalinity, and Aragonite saturation state. Furthermore, the investigators will continue a time series of oceanographic measurements of the carbonate system in the Gulf of Mexico, which will allow the inclusion of this significant body of water in models of past and future ocean acidification scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Results that combine the study of ongoing ocean acidification in the Gulf of Mexico with the physiological and genetic responses of the corals to low saturation state will be presented at conferences, seminars, and published in high-impact and open-access publications. Raw and processed data will be made available in existing databases including NCBI (genetic and genomic data), and through the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO). All project data will also be made available via a local ftp server linked to each of the PIs websites. The PIs are committed to the inclusion of under-represented minorities in their research, and have a proven record of mentoring undergraduates at Temple University, one of the most diverse institutions in the U.S. A two-day workshop for 20 Gulf Coast high school teachers, and also including students from Temple, will be led by the PIs and coordinated by Dr. Shelia Brown at the Gulf Coast Research Lab in Ocean Springs, MS to provide teachers with the background and materials needed to bring curricula based on these results directly into their classrooms. A high school teacher will also participate in the cruise. Through these efforts, the investigators hope to raise public consciousness of the issue of ocean acidification, increase the level of awareness of the presence of deep-water coral communities in U.S. waters, and to inspire the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
