    <AbstractNarration>Ethnographic, historical, and psychological evidence suggests that peaceful interactions among individuals of different ethnicities can play an important role in shaping the cultural characteristics of ethnic groups. However, the general mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Dr. John Bunce, of the University of California, Davis, will conduct a two-year investigation of the effects of inter-ethnic interaction among individuals on cultural norms of behavior in neighboring Mestizo and indigenous Matsigenka communities along the Manu River in Amazonian Peru. This study will advance our understanding of the processes by which ethnic-typical cultural characteristics are maintained, lost, or transformed as different ethnic groups come into contact and expand interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual distributions of behavioral norms and markers of ethnicity (e.g., language, dress, etc.), along with personal inter-ethnic interaction experience, will be identified and recorded in Mestizo and Matsigenka focal communities using structured interviews and extensive participant observation. The isolation of the small communities makes inter-ethnic interaction relatively limited in scope, easy to observe, and easy for people to recall. Experimental "games" will then be used to investigate individuals' perceptions of norms and markers in their own and the other ethnic group. Agent-based evolutionary models will be developed to gain further insight into causal mechanisms underlying the observed patterns of interaction experience and norm and marker distributions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research will contribute to social science theory of culture change that occurs as the result of intergroup contact. In addition to dissemination in scientfic venues, results also will be discussed in culturally-appropriate contexts with the focal communities and regional indigenous organizations. Understanding mechanisms of cultural change will empower them to, if they wish, design effective strategies to limit the loss of cultural characteristics that they collectively want to preserve while simultaneously engaging with outsiders. At the communities' request, the investigator teaches weekly reading and math classes while working there. Additionally, this project will expand dialogue and collaboration with Peruvian researchers through participation in seminars at Peruvian universities.</AbstractNarration>
