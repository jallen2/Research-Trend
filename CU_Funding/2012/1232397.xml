    <AbstractNarration>The 2012 Broadening Participation in Data Mining Workshop (BPDM 2012) will be the first workshop of its kind in data mining designed specifically to foster mentorship, guidance, and connections of underrepresented groups in data mining, while also enriching technical aptitude and exposure. The workshop will be co-hosted with the 2012 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2012), one of the premier conferences in the field of Data Mining. This proposal discusses the attendance and financial support of students from underrepresented groups to the workshop, as well as, to the conference. The conference provides a venue for students and researchers who are addressing data mining problems in areas such as science, engineering, industrial processes, healthcare, business, and medicine, to present their work in a peer-reviewed forum. It also provides an ideal setting for students and others new to the field to learn about cutting-edge research by hearing outstanding invited speakers and attending presentations, tutorials, and focused workshops. The funds will enable the students to attend both the workshop and the remainder of the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
