    <AbstractNarration>A pulsed DNP/NMR/ESR (DyNE) spectrometer for the structural studies of macroscopically aligned membrane proteins under their native-like physiological conditions will be developed. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) allows one to obtain atomic-resolution structures of membrane proteins and membrane-bound receptors in their native lipid environment without the need of crystallization. The current disadvantage of ssNMR is its relatively low sensitivity due to small polarization of the nuclear spins at the available magnetic fields. This main drawback will be addressed by employing and optimizing the Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) method that transfers the larger polarization from the electronic spins to the nuclei, thereby achieving several hundred-fold enhancements of the NMR signals. DNP is rapidly revolutionizing the field of NMR of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic surfaces, but its applications to biological macromolecules remain fairly limited. This project is focused on developing the DNP instrumentation that will be specifically suited for the structure-function studies of membrane proteins under their physiologically relevant conditions (i.e., full hydration at 37 C). To achieve these goals, the expertise of the PI (Nevzorov) in high-resolution structural studies of membrane proteins by ssNMR will be combined with the expertise of the Co-PI (Smirnov), who is a pioneer of using lipid nanotube arrays for stabilizing membrane proteins and an expert in building millimeter-wave instrumentation and probeheads for electron-spin resonance (ESR). &lt;br/&gt;The development of the DyNE instrument will take place at the interface of magnetic resonance, membrane protein biophysics, and nanotechnology. Such an instrument would become an invaluable tool for a diverse group of researchers ranging from biophysicists to structural biologists and medicinal chemists studying the interactions of small-molecule therapeutics with membrane protein receptors. In the course of this development project graduate students will obtain an interdisciplinary training ranging from advanced NMR and ESR methods to biophysical experiments with membrane proteins and preparation of hybrid nanomaterials. The results from this instrumentation development will be disseminated through interdisciplinary educational initiatives including the existing undergraduate and graduate level courses at NCSU as well as by collaborating with biologists, chemists, and physicists on the structural studies of membrane proteins by utilizing this unique instrumentation.</AbstractNarration>
