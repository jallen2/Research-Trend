    <AbstractNarration>The recently-ratified C and C++ standards, "C11" and "C++11"&lt;br/&gt;respectively, add a concurrency model that supports writing&lt;br/&gt;high-performance, portable code for machines with multiple processors.&lt;br/&gt;The concurrency model, however, is large and complicated; it is not&lt;br/&gt;particularly easy for compiler and library developers to get all of&lt;br/&gt;its corner cases right. Errors in implementing the new model can&lt;br/&gt;introduce bugs into important pieces of software, such as operating&lt;br/&gt;systems, web browsers, web sites, database engines, and embedded&lt;br/&gt;systems, all of which are written, at least partially, in concurrent C&lt;br/&gt;and C++.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's previous work on randomized testing for C compilers uncovered&lt;br/&gt;more than 450 bugs in production-quality compilers, most of which were&lt;br/&gt;fixed by compiler developers. The PI's current project extends this&lt;br/&gt;research agenda to support stress testing of implementations of the&lt;br/&gt;C11 and C++11 concurrency model. The intellectual merit of this work&lt;br/&gt;stems from the need to generate random, but standards-conforming,&lt;br/&gt;concurrent code; the need to synthesize "test oracles" that can&lt;br/&gt;automatically ascertain the success or failure of a test case; and,&lt;br/&gt;the need to develop "hostile" simulators for flushing out errors in&lt;br/&gt;compiled concurrent code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected impact of the PI's work is to significantly reduce the&lt;br/&gt;period during which implementations of the C11 / C++11 concurrency&lt;br/&gt;model are flaky and immature, and to reduce the lifetime of compiler&lt;br/&gt;bugs that are introduced during ongoing development.</AbstractNarration>
