    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the principal investigator and his assistants are working on a framework for achieving&lt;br/&gt;scalability and sustainability in three-dimensional wireless sensor network deployments. The objective is&lt;br/&gt;to study the design of energy-efficient three-dimensional k-covered wireless sensor networks, where each&lt;br/&gt;point in a field of interest is covered by at least k heterogeneous sensors, in the presence of obstacles&lt;br/&gt;and mobile events in the field. This study is based on Baxter's factorization of Ornstein-Zernike equation,&lt;br/&gt;the pair-connectedness theory, and potential fields to solve the problem of joint k-coverage, duty-cycling,&lt;br/&gt;and data forwarding in three-dimensional heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with a goal to achieve&lt;br/&gt;sustainable and scalable deployments. The principal investigator plans to evaluate the performance of this&lt;br/&gt;framework through simulation using a network simulator, such as TOSSIM, and implementation using a test-bed of sensors, such as MICAz motes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has significant impact on its field and the society. It has a rich plan for the integration&lt;br/&gt;of research and education through the development of curriculum and resources for teaching to a wide range of undergraduate and graduate students. Based on the results of this project, the principal investigator plans to develop a set of networking courses. Also, the principal investigator has a plan to recruit, train, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students including women and members of underrepresented minority groups. Furthermore, this project allows the principal investigator mentor K-12 teachers and high-school students through research seminars. It helps the principal investigator attract and recruit students to pursue science careers.</AbstractNarration>
