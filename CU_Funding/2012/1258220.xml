    <AbstractNarration>Many species on Earth are unknown to scientists, and in some groups, such as beetles, many known species are poorly documented. This project will build tools and methods to increase the rate of species discovery and documentation, and it will apply these tools to a group of ground beetles (Bembidiina) having over 300 species in the United States. The researchers will discover and delimit species by analyzing DNA sequences using new methods they will develop based on population genetic theory. Photographs of the beetles and their defining physical characteristics will be captured and presented with the DNA results live as they are gathered in an open, online database to which other biologists can freely contribute. The researchers will develop tools to create tablet-apps and print-on-demand, custom-build field guides and scientific monographs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to increasing knowledge about these common beetles, this project will produce many tools that will broadly benefit biodiversity scientists, regardless of their organisms of study. The new DNA analysis methods will allow experts to increase their rate of species discovery, and the improved integration of data collection with dissemination will ensure that effective documentation keeps pace with the rate of discovery.</AbstractNarration>
