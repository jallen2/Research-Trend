    <AbstractNarration>The ability to control spin dynamics is critical for enabling the operation of a host of magnetic devices. Exciting opportunities for manipulate spins are offered by directly using optical fields, as was recently demonstrated in experiments. This program introduces a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework for the characterization, modeling, and design of magnetic devices involving optical control of spin dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has a theoretical physics, computational physics, engineering, technological, and educational component. The research provides fundamental understanding of optics driven spin dynamics, such as near Curie-point switching, all-optical switching, combined optical-spin transfer torque phenomena, and optics-induced spin waves. The program identifies new spin dynamics phenomena and structures that exhibit novel functionalities and the associated fluctuations and noise reduction particularly prevalent on the quantum scale. The research creates new methods and efficient simulators, including high-performance atomistic, mesoscale, and multiscale (hybrid atomistic-mesoscale) solvers. The research spawns new opportunities for modeling magnetic and optical devices and systems. The introduced multi-scale framework is used to address critical technological problems involving magnetic materials and devices employing optical control, such as energy assisted magnetic recording. The program includes an essential component of education of undergraduates and graduates, through courses and mentoring, in application of quantum mechanics to modern technology, particularly, micro- and nano-magnetics and electromagnetics. The work involves graduate and undergraduate students in research, and contributes to diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has a range of broader impacts. The fundamental quantum mechanical models for magnetics contributes to the general field of quantum mechanics and its relation to practical devices. Various components of the high-performance methods can be used in other fields, such as biophysics, chemistry, and astrophysics. The proposed multi-physics solvers can be hybridized with solvers in other physical domains such as electrical/mechanical/fluidic modeling frameworks. The magnetic recording applications contributes to the development of data storage devices which are pervasive in modern society. The effort also develops a set of educational materials covering the proposed theory, simulation framework, and device study.</AbstractNarration>
