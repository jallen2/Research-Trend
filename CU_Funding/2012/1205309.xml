    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on interacting many-particle systems far from equilibrium. The PI will combine advanced analytical and numerical techniques and explore novel aspects of transient and steady state properties far from equilibrium. Two main research thrusts will be pursued. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first thrust focuses on relaxation processes far from equilibrium. Aging phenomena in systems with logarithmic growth remain poorly understood, even though many important disordered systems are expected to display this type of slow growth in the long time limit. The PI seeks to gain new insights into aging through the study of paradigmatic models, amenable both to numerical and analytical methods. Motivated by recent experiments on aging in artificial antiferromagnets, the PI plans to extend the study of relaxation to layered Ising systems with increasing complexity. A better understanding of aging processes in these systems should help establishing artificial antiferromagnets as the new paradigm for the experimental study of non-equilibrium processes in non-disordered systems. The PI aims to build on recent work that showed the existence of a duality between aging phenomena and gravitational physics in order to further open the field of non-equilibrium physics to string theoretical techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second thrust focuses on non-equilibrium phase transitions that take place in inhomogeneous systems where the effects of surfaces and boundaries cannot be neglected. The PI will study phase transitions in two different inhomogeneous systems with energy input at a surface or a boundary: (1) bounded systems with magnetic friction and (2) systems with conserved dynamics where different sectors are in contact with different heat baths. The observed results, ranging from novel surface phase transitions to the emergence of convection cells and temperature driven transitions between striped phases, warrant an in-depth study in order to fully understand phase transitions in systems with local energy input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due in part to the ubiquity of non-equilibrium processes in nature, this research has potential to have impact across disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;boundaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed so that both undergraduate and graduate students can contribute in a substantial and meaningful way, using a large variety of methods. This training through research approach allows students to be involved at every level in cutting-edge research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on phenomena that occur in systems of many interacting particles far from the steady state of equilibrium. Non-equilibrium phenomena are all around us and range from weather patterns to life itself. Two important aspects of systems out of equilibrium are: (1) stationary states, wherein the system will remain if not pushed from the outside, and (2) the relaxation towards these stationary states. Gaining a better understanding of both the stationary properties and the relaxation processes are needed in order to fully understand the world around us, and to develop new ways to manipulate these processes to tailor the properties of materials and other systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of interacting systems of many particles far from equilibrium poses challenges, on both the fundamental and the practical level. While there is a well established theoretical framework for equilibrium systems, a similar comprehensive framework remains elusive for non-equilibrium systems and processes. The PI will exploit a variety of theoretical and computational techniques to advance our understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena. The PI aims to develop new interdisciplinary approaches, that combine statistical physics with advanced theoretical techniques from other areas of physics, and to advance understanding of the influence surfaces and interfaces on non-equilibrium processes. The PI aims to investigate aging phenomena through the study of model systems that are representative of large classes of condensed matter systems. Aging phenomena have been exploited since prehistoric times to optimize some materials so that they achieve desired properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed so that both undergraduate and graduate students can contribute in a substantial and meaningful way, using a variety of methods. This training through research approach allows students to be involved at every level in cutting-edge research projects.</AbstractNarration>
