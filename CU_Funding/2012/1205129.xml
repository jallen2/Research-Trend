    <AbstractNarration>This project is creating a pathway for high school minorities to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs with a primary focus on engineering, technology and mathematics. The program provides Technology Gateway and Project Lead the Way programs to prepare at least 127 minority high school juniors and seniors participants for an associate degree and/or bachelor degree in a STEM discipline, which subsequently increases their opportunity to obtain employment in a STEM or STEM-related field. The program also features mentorships, career readiness training, internships, and enrichment activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The goals of the program are to: &lt;br/&gt;1. Ensure that high school minority juniors and seniors acquire knowledge and skills in engineering, technology and mathematics to prepare them for two-year and four-year post-secondary education through Technology Gateway and Project Lead the Way programs. &lt;br/&gt;2. Provide professional development opportunities for faculty and staff that increase their knowledge and skills in engineering, technology and mathematics and prepare them to teach Technology Gateway and Project Lead the Way courses. &lt;br/&gt;3. Deliver career readiness knowledge and skills to high school students that prepare them for the workforce through field experiences and internships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plan is to increase its current high school enrollments in Technology Gateway and Project Lead the Way courses by 50%, enroll at least 60% of the high school graduates in one of the STEM associate degree programs at the college, graduate at least 80% of the students who enroll in a STEM associate degree program, and ensure that at least 80% who complete an associate degree either transfer to a four year institution or obtain employment in a STEM or STEM related field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The program focuses on underrepresented and minority high school juniors and seniors in rural counties that face many socio-economic challenges such as high school drop outs, unemployment, and low income. The educational infrastructure at the college is impacted by providing STEM pathways that offer training, hands-on experience, and learning opportunities to prepare students in secondary education for post-secondary education. The project improves the overall college infrastructure in STEM fields through sustaining partnerships with businesses and industries that provide workforce readiness (field experiences and internships) for students and increases the economy of the service area of the college.</AbstractNarration>
