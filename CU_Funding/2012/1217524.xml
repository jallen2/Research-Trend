    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to implement a Robust Emergency Data (RED) Link. Recent breakthroughs in wireless communication collectively referred to as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology exploit multiple "dimensions" in space, frequency, time, antenna polarization, and antenna radiation patterns to create parallel or multiplexed channels. This project aims to investigate an aspect of MIMO: exploiting near-field components in the reactive-field region close to transmitting antennas. This project explores novel near-field MIMO to exploit low-frequency RF spectrum as a medium for short-range, robust, bidirectional wireless communication links. Long-wavelength (&gt; 300m) low-frequency (&lt;1 MHz) signals tend to be more penetrating, more multipath resistant, and more robust in cluttered environments than conventional short wavelength high-frequency links. The proposed technique provides a novel bandwidth-enhanced MIMO communication method and a robust diversity communication method which will be virtually free from severe fading. The anticipated result is a RED Link capable of supporting two-way voice and telemetry even in high multipath environments. Operating within FCC Part 15 constraints, the system will function out to ranges of 50m or more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes enhancing understanding of near-field wireless systems, as well as uses spanning multiple emergency communications applications. Approximately 100 firefighters die in the line of duty each year. Improved communications systems could save some of these lives. Every year, workers die in hazardous environments, like mines and chemical plants because rescuers are unable to contact or locate them. Similarly, about 10% of American casualties in combat are caused by "friendly" fire. A system that can provide robust communications for warfighters, particularly in urban combat, could prevent some of these casualties. Finally, near-field communications (NFC) is an emerging RF technology with the potential to revolutionize short-range, high-security data links. The proposed effort could dramatically improve the capacity of these wireless links</AbstractNarration>
