    <AbstractNarration>This award will engage the public on the issues surrounding the interaction and interdependence of human systems and natural systems. Specifically, it will engage them on human impacts and the health of salmon fisheries in the area of Sitka, Alaska. The public in this area includes the citizens of lower portion of Alaska, K-12 students frequenting the Sitka Sound Science Center on field trips, Alaskan Natives, visiting scientists, and tourists who arrive by cruise ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exhibit will be placed at the Sitka Sound Science Center and will include a tank of live salmon fish, a computer game, a 10 minute video, and an artist's rendition of the fishing system and salmon life cycle. The team of scientists from the University of Washington coupled with the exhibit developer, Tenji, Inc., and the outstanding artist, Ray Troll should produce an understandable and marvelously picturesque exhibit for the visitors. This will be augmented by the highly capable staff that has considerable experience in translating science concepts to the public. Media broadcasts will broaden the reach of the exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the impact of this project is not huge in terms of numbers of people, it is an important endeavor as the people in the Sitka area of Alaska will understand their role in the food system for themselves and for the many other parts of the world. Furthermore, the cruise line visitors will derive an understanding of the fragile environment of the salmon ecosystem.</AbstractNarration>
