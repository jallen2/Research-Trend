    <AbstractNarration>This Capacity Building project is designed to make the Cornell Teacher Education Program, which prepares students for New York state certification in K-12 agriculture, secondary biology, chemistry, physics, or earth science, grade 7-8 science, or grade 5-6 science, a viable candidate for a future Noyce Phase I Scholarship award. The Cornell University team, from the Department of Entomology, Department of Horticulture, and the Paleontological Research Institution, are partnering with Moravia Central School District, Tully Central School District, Brooklyn Academy of Science and the Environment, the Cannon River STEM School, Boyce Thompson Institute, Cornell Plantations, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell Outdoor Education, and the Mohonk Preserve. Targeted initiatives are addressing teacher recruitment, teacher preparation, and teacher induction support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's theme is "science for all" which summarizes the goal of nurturing creative and passionate scientists while fostering the development of scientific literacy for everyone to inform their decision making on issues of personal health, safety and public policy. The project is organized around the specific idea that local natural environments are among the best classrooms for learning in the natural and physical science disciplines. Taking science outdoors is leading to better engagement in science, for teachers and students, improvements in health, a better understanding of the "messy" nature of real science, and an appreciation of the power of interdisciplinary approaches to scientific problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The back-to-nature approach for science education is having a broad impact because it is accessible and effective for all students, including those living in more "built-up" areas of the country, and those with disabilities that challenge their access and success. Of special note for aiding in the success of the project is the Professional Development School, in which university faculty and school teachers work together to design and implement learning opportunities for pre-service teachers and for themselves. Also contributing to project success is the Cornell New Teacher Support Corps, a group composed of highly effective retired or part-time science teachers, who are serving as mentors for the project alums.</AbstractNarration>
