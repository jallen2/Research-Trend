    <AbstractNarration>Vascular plants have two fundamentally different axes of growth, roots and shoots, which first become established through precisely orchestrated cell fate decisions in the early embryo. While the mechanisms underlying this patterning process remain poorly understood overall, previous work has clearly identified a key role for the YODA (YDA) cellular signaling pathway. The YDA pathway, which contains a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase module, becomes activated upon fertilization and promotes division of the zygote into a large basal and a small apical daughter. This asymmetric first division defines polarity and sets the stage for subsequent elaboration of the main axis with root and shoot poles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the molecular mechanisms of YDA signaling in the zygote and early embryo will be analyzed using a diverse set of methodologies, including classical genetics, comparative phylogeny, molecular biology, genomics, microscopy, and biochemistry. Particular attention is dedicated to factors regulating the core MAP kinase module in the context of fertilization, as well as the gene expression programs targeted by the pathway and executing the establishment of polarity. The expected results will make pioneering contributions to our understanding of how the basic body plan of plants is laid out and may inform targeted approaches for initiating embryos from somatic cells in culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lead to training of a post doctoral associate and a graduate student in plant genetics, molecular biology, genomics, and advanced microscopy. Participation of a high school teacher, high school students, and undergraduate students is an integral part of the research plan; recruitment will be through the Georgia Intern-Fellowships for Teachers (GIFT) program, the Empowered Youth Program (EPY), the University's Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), and the NSF-sponsored Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PSLSAMP).</AbstractNarration>
