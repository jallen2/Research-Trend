    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to develop high-density, low-power, and low-cost memristive/Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) devices for Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) market. The memristive/ReRAM devices are identified on the semiconductor roadmap as a leading potential replacement for the present flash memories and an enabling technology for Terabytes/cm2 data "storage on chip" almost 3 orders of magnitude denser than the current technology. However, the major challenges to commercialization remain in addressing critical issues including: (i) electroforming, (ii) tight control of compliance current, (iii) reducing switching energy, (iv) device-to-device variability, (v) endurance and cycle-to-cycle variability, and (vi) demonstration of 1Diode 1ReRAM (1D1R) crossbar structures. This gap in knowledge persists due to a lack of fundamental understanding on switching and charge transport mechanism in these devices. The fundamental studies through previous NSF-funded research in this area led the team to a potential solution that addresses these challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current market for NVM is around 26 billion USD and is projected to grow at 14% annually, reaching 51.2 billion USD by 2015. These NVM devices are becoming increasingly important for massive data storage in smart-phone, tablets, notebooks, digital cameras, video recording, and thumb-drives. The current NAND-flash technology will be unable to meet this demand due to fundamental scaling limits. The proposed innovation will provide high-density, low-power memristive/ReRAM devices based memories with additional performance benefits of fast write/erase/read times, endurance of 105 cycles, and 10 years of retention. These devices demonstrate Multi-Level Cell (MLC) storage that will provide an attractive solution for low-cost per bit storage. The demonstration of 1kb memory in 1D1R configuration will significantly enhance the scientific and technological understanding and will have significant impact on developing high-density memory by 3-D stacking. If successful, this will have a direct impact on economic development and job creation in Northwest Ohio and help maintain the US leadership in this emerging technology.</AbstractNarration>
