    <AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a program called the Multicultural Initiative in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) for academic years 2013-2014. The program has operated at Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) since 1991. MIMSUP PI's will recruit eight students annually from around the nation and will seek to identify students who would benefit most from the high level of mentoring provided. The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in the design of an effort that encourages students to pursue higher degrees in ocean sciences. Students will spend two quarters in residence taking a total of 31 quarter-credits that may be transferred back to their home institutions. During the first quarter, students take a laboratory/field course in Oceanography, a Current Trends in Marine Science course that introduces them to modern investigative techniques and the potential professional opportunities that will be available to them, and a research course in which they plan and execute an independent project under the supervision of a faculty member. They all participate in a program that involves training in and application of outreach education in marine science to K-12 school children. During the second quarter, students will take a Scientific Communication course and two additional courses covering various marine science topics. Broader Impacts: Results from prior funding indicate that this program is highly successful in efforts to encourage students to pursue advanced degrees in science. Of the 155 participants who have completed their undergraduate degrees, 15% have pursued the doctorate; 44%, the Master's degree. Overall, 68% have pursued advanced education. Alumni contributions to the sciences include over 381 presentations at science conferences (49 best student paper awards) and co-authorship on over 112 publications in the refereed scientific literature. The impact of these alumni as role models for their peers will multiply the effects of the program. Training and mentoring approaches will continue to be shared nationally, and alumni will continue to participate in other ocean science programs. MIMSUP students are trained in and participate in K-12 marine science lessons in the local school system and in providing ocean science outreach activities at local festivals serving a general audience.</AbstractNarration>
