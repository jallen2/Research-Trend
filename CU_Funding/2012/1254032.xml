    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to unify the capability of full duplex (FD) communications and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications to allow a flexible way of using the available RF chains to increase the capacity and reliability of wireless networks. Recent advancements in multi-antenna wireless systems have allowed wireless nodes to use either all of their antennas for transmission (or reception), or to use half of them for transmission and the other half for reception. The first system is called a MIMO system and the latter is called a full duplex system. Traditionally, MIMO and full duplex have been seen as competing technologies. This research shows that they can be combined in innovative ways to fundamentally increase the capacity of a wireless link compared to the case when they operate separately. This combination allows a node to dynamically allocate radio resources for transmission and reception. It further shows that informing routing and scheduling protocols about this flexible radio resource feature can significantly improve network capacity. The research proposes innovations in the hardware, protocols and software needed in the current wireless network architecture to achieve significant network-wide capacity increases. Thus, this research will produce highly flexible radios that will combine full duplex and MIMO. This flexibility will allow future wireless nodes to dynamically allocate radio resources for simultaneous transmissions and receptions. Second, it will develop MAC and network layer protocols that can fully reap the benefits of this flexible system. Third, it will develop a new network simulator that incorporates the fundamentally new wireless features proposed by this research so that advanced network protocols can be effectively and more realistically studied.</AbstractNarration>
