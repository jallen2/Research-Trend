    <AbstractNarration>Buyers and sellers negotiating in a market face a series of stages from partner choice to information gathering to haggling, etc., with the optimal decisions at each stage depending on both players' bargaining positions. These bargaining positions will depend on the players' assets (income and capital) and outside options for alternative buyers and sellers. Animals face similar decisions regarding courtship, including how much energy to acquire, who to court, how much information to gather, when to give up, etc. In the mating market, males and females haggle during courtship, with their bargaining positions determined by their assets (foraging success and body condition) as well as the number of alternative partners for each. Thus economic models of negotiation in a market provide a framework for viewing courtship as a process where males and females can use tactics to improve their negotiating outcome, using the resources they have available. This project explores this framework using greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) as a model species. New technology will allow experimental study of courtship and detailed observation of foraging behaviors in the wild, with minimal disturbance. Methods include presentations of interactive female robots, next-generation GPS loggers and accelerometers to measure off-lek foraging behaviors, as well as bioanalytical assays of the nutrition and toxicity of sagebrush that grouse prefer to consume. We expect to show that success in courtship, as in business, requires income and capital as well as skilled negotiation. Sage-grouse are a candidate species for listing as endangered. The PIs will conduct multimedia presentations on sage-grouse ecology and conservation for the public, and develop course materials and presentations for primary schools, tribal colleges and universities in sage-grouse habitat. Research by PIs will continue to directly inform sage-grouse conservation efforts. In addition, the PIs will continue to provide research opportunities for students (&gt;175 since 2006), including many from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
