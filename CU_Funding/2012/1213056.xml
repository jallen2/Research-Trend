    <AbstractNarration>Most of the traditional High-End Computing (HEC) applications and&lt;br/&gt;current petascale applications are written using the Message Passing&lt;br/&gt;Interface (MPI) programming model. Some of these applications are run&lt;br/&gt;in MPI+OpenMP mode. However, it can be very difficult to use MPI or&lt;br/&gt;MPI+OpenMP and maintain performance for applications which demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;irregular and dynamic communication patterns. The Partitioned Global&lt;br/&gt;Address Space (PGAS) programming model presents a flexible way for&lt;br/&gt;these applications to express parallelism. Accelerators introduce&lt;br/&gt;additional programming models: CUDA, OpenCL or OpenACC. Thus, the&lt;br/&gt;emerging heterogeneous architectures require support for various&lt;br/&gt;hybrid programming models: MPI+OpenMP, MPI+PGAS, and MPI+PGAS+OpenMP&lt;br/&gt;with extended APIs for multiple levels of parallelism. Unfortunately,&lt;br/&gt;there is no unified runtime which delivers the best performance and&lt;br/&gt;scalability for all of these hybrid programming models for a range of&lt;br/&gt;applications on current and next-generation HEC systems. This leads&lt;br/&gt;to the following broad challenge: "Can a unified runtime for hybrid&lt;br/&gt;programming model be designed which can provide benefits that are&lt;br/&gt;greater than the sum of its parts?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A synergistic and comprehensive research plan, involving computer&lt;br/&gt;scientists from The Ohio State University (OSU) and Ohio Supercomputer&lt;br/&gt;Center (OSC) and computational scientists from the Texas Advanced&lt;br/&gt;Computing Center (TACC) and San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC),&lt;br/&gt;University of California San Diego (UCSD), is proposed to address the&lt;br/&gt;above broad challenge with innovative solutions. The investigators&lt;br/&gt;will specifically address the following challenges: 1) What are the&lt;br/&gt;requirements and limitations of using hybrid programming models for a&lt;br/&gt;set of petascale applications? 2) What features and mechanisms are&lt;br/&gt;needed in a unified runtime? 3) How can the unified runtime and&lt;br/&gt;associated extension to programming model APIs be designed and&lt;br/&gt;implemented? 4) How can candidate petascale applications be&lt;br/&gt;redesigned to take advantage of proposed unified runtime? and 5) What&lt;br/&gt;kind of benefits (in terms of performance, scalability and&lt;br/&gt;productivity) can be achieved by the proposed approach? The research&lt;br/&gt;will be driven by a set of applications from established NSF&lt;br/&gt;computational science researchers running large scale simulations on&lt;br/&gt;Ranger and other systems at OSC, SDSC and OSU. The proposed designs&lt;br/&gt;will be integrated into the open-source MVAPICH2 library. The&lt;br/&gt;established national-scale training and outreach programs at TACC,&lt;br/&gt;SDSC and OSC will be used to disseminate the results of this research.</AbstractNarration>
