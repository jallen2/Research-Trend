    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Jennie E. Burnet of the University of Louisville will undertake research on rescuer behavior, community-level resistance to violence, and rescuer motivation during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The study's central question is: how and why do some people put themselves at great risk of harm in order to rescue others during communal violence? The study will compare rescuer behavior among different ethnic and religious groups in that country to identify the intrinsic factors (such as character, identity, religious belief, and religious practice) and extrinsic factors (such as geography, proximity to victims, opportunity, and community structure) that make rescuer behavior possible. The researchers will investigate the potential impact of social network characteristics on resistance to genocide and will attempt to identify aspects of faith, practice, leadership, or community structure that led to community-level resistance to genocide in certain locales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using social science research methods, the project will gather life history narratives, key informant interviews, testimony about the genocide, and social network data from more than 250 Rwandans in eight communities in Rwanda. A range of actors, including publicly recognized rescuers, bystanders, perpetrators, and victims will be interviewed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to the scientific understanding of rescuer behavior, resistance to communal violence, and the impact of religion on these behaviors. It will also assist policymakers in developing interventions to improve resistance to communal violence. The project will contribute to basic understanding of the Rwandan religious communities and the connections between Rwandan local social movements and global religious communities. Finally, this study can offer a timely contribution to national and international policy debates about religion and violence.</AbstractNarration>
