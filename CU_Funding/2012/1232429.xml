    <AbstractNarration>This project applies Embeddedness Theory to understand the differential experiences of men and women pursuing STEM majors in college as well their experiences in transitioning from college to the workforce. The concept of embeddedness is applied to describe the extent to which one is rooted in her or his STEM major or occupation. Embeddedness is comprised of three factors: Fit (i.e., the extent to which one sees her or his capabilities as matching the demands of the particular STEM major), links (i.e., social ties that a student has within the major), and sacrifice (i.e., the extent to which leaving the STEM major is perceived as coming at a cost). Human capital (i.e., acquiring knowledge and skills) and social capital (i.e., developing interpersonal relationships and networking) investments are examined as key predictors of STEM major embeddedness and occupational embeddedness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research contributes to that literature by extending embeddedness theory's application to the educational experience prior to workforce entry and by demonstrating linkages between college and workforce embeddedness experiences. The project contributes to the literature on gender differences in STEM by taking a broad contextual view of the experiences that may differentially anchor men and women to STEM majors and occupations. In particular, Embeddedness Theory offers explanations beyond abilities and attitudes, which seem inadequate in explaining women's underrepresentation STEM. The combination of multiple methods (qualitative focus groups and individual interviews; quantitative longitudinal surveys) allows for an examination of STEM experiences in the college context as they are occurring, and also incorporates reflection on those experiences in light of the workforce transition. The sample used for this research includes multiple STEM disciplines and closely mirrors national populations of STEM majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research provides national benefit by linking college level experiences in STEM to early career experiences in the STEM workforce. Embeddedness theory provides a meaningful framework for understanding why some stay and others leave the STEM pipeline. Research findings will identify gender differences in building social and human capital and transporting capital to embed individuals in their careers. In particular, this research will address a gap in the "leaky pipeline" between college and work, an under-researched area where many women are likely to leave STEM. This research will help to identify levers for anchoring STEM individuals, especially women, in their careers at both the university and workforce stages. Findings will inform college curriculum development as well as organizational approaches to retaining a gender diverse student body and workforce. Dissemination of research findings will occur via the project website, national conference presentations, and peer-reviewed journal publications.</AbstractNarration>
