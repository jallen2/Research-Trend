    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative project transforms learning in introductory biology courses through a technology-supported, active-learning pedagogy that is informed by theory and evidence about learning systems. Specifically, this project overcomes students' problems in understanding complex biological systems and distributes learning in a way that actively engages students in and out of class. This project evaluates the effectiveness of the pedagogy, provides research on how introductory biology students articulate complex processes within and across biological systems, and investigates development of reflective and deep learning approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project results from a technology-rich approach, allowing instructors to communicate selected content outside of class and replacing traditional lectures with promising active learning strategies in class. An approach adapted from engineering that analyzes systems in terms of their Structure, Behavior, and Function is the theoretical framework employed to facilitate learning and understanding of biological systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates broader impacts by building and strengthening community within and across institutions. At the collaborating institutions alone, several hundred students are expected to benefit from the enhanced instructional framework. Dissemination of practices and curricular materials should impact students at multiple institutions and levels in the biology curriculum. Research findings are expected to be disseminated as oral and poster communication at local and national meetings of professional societies. Further, outcomes of this research are also expected to be disseminated via manuscripts targeted for science education journals. Contributions to the STEM education research literature should yield insights to the broader academic and science education research communities.</AbstractNarration>
