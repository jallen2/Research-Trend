    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: This proposal provides partial support to the US participants of the 8th Conference on Extreme Value Analysis to be held on July 8--12, 2013 at the Fudan University, Shanghai, China, where PIs are members of Scientific committee and organizing committee. EVA conferences started in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1998, then they became regular meetings for researchers in extreme value analysis. The aim of these conferences is to bring together a diverse range of researchers, practitioners, and graduate students whose work is related to the analysis of extreme values in a broad sense. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, extreme events have been becoming more and more frequent and severe, and extreme events result in huge losses to our society. For example, the US now has been suffering from the biggest drought since 1956. How to model and predict such extreme events is of great importance. The major reason for this proposal is to provide partial support, mostly to graduate students and junior faculty from the United States, to boost the participation of US researchers, to improve the visibility and to encourage further research on extreme value analysis in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
