    <AbstractNarration>SES-1258926&lt;br/&gt;Penny Edgell&lt;br/&gt;Douglas Hartmann&lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1258933&lt;br/&gt;Paul Croll&lt;br/&gt;Augustana College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1258893&lt;br/&gt;Eric Tranby&lt;br/&gt;University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What unites us as Americans? What divides us? What are core Americans values and ideals today? Who belongs and who does not? The nature and meaning of unity, social solidarity, and collective identity in the United States have been a source of question and contention since the nation?s founding. And the challenges have become increasing prolific and complicated in an era of ongoing immigration, increasing diversity, persistent inequality, and ubiquitous multiculturalism. The investigators will study the dynamics of social inclusion and exclusion in contemporary American society. More specifically, they will study the contours of the American identity and the ways in which it is constituted in or crosscut by other salient boundaries. The research focuses on race and religion as aspects of social location and identification which may shape how Americans make sense of their own lives, understand who is like them and who is different, and think about the broader society and the public good. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research questions will be answered through a web-based survey of 3,000 Americans. The study extends the work of a previous research project, the American Mosaic Project, by replicating specific items from that study in order to establish trend data for its more innovative and influential findings; this includes items on cultural membership, anti-Semitism, conceptions of diversity, white identity, and views of religious minorities. In addition, the project will include new survey questions to extend research in four interconnected substantive areas: (1) Americans? understandings of social solidarity and collective identity; (2) Americans? explanations for inequality, equal opportunity, and colorblindness; (3) white privilege and white racial identity; and (4) religious exclusion. The project builds on previous work by developing a full set of indicators that allow the investigators to focus on interconnections across our four core areas, providing an opportunity to test and build theory about the relationship between cultural boundaries, inequality, and collective identity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this era of divisive politics, culture wars, pundits, and talking points, this project will provide rigorous empirical data with which to make sense of how people understand American society, its goals and challenges. Results from the project will be disseminated through both academic and media outlets, providing opportunities to discuss the American mosaic in both classrooms and public forums. Additionally, this project will provide research opportunities and training for graduate students and undergraduate students at several colleges and universities across the country and will specifically seek to include students who are members of underrepresented groups. This national survey will provide important data that will be of interest to faculty, students, researchers, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
