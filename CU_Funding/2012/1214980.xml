    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to the development of a new class of liquid crystal (LC)-based direct-read monitors (DRMs) for detection of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) present in air at construction sites. The approach to development of DRMs that is described in this proposal is based on the innovative use of LC materials to detect and report molecular interactions on chemically functionalized surfaces. Results obtained under Phase I research will demonstrate that sensors comprised of a chemically functionalized surface supporting a thin film of nematic LC can detect NO2 in air at levels required to meet worker safety standards established by regulatory agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is the reduction of hazardous chemicals exposure risk to 139 million US citizens at their work place. This Phase I SBIR proposal is focused on protecting the health of 9 million workers in the US construction industry, workers who have been documented to be at increased risk of chronic exposure to NO2 in air due to regular use of various tools, equipments, and vehicles powered by diesel engines. This DRM platform, while initially focused on detection of NO2 within construction zones, has the potential to be broadly useful for detection of a range of hazardous gases encountered in occupational settings in the US.</AbstractNarration>
