    <AbstractNarration>Researchers at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) mentor eight undergraduate Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) students each year in the Fall semester while they conduct independent research projects. Students conduct independent research projects based on a wide variety of marine and open-ocean science topics ranging from the molecular to macro scale processes. Many of the student research projects fall within the framework of the numerous long-term, climate-related programs conducted at BIOS, including Hydrostation "S", the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS), the Marine Microbial Observatory, and the Ocean Carbon and Climate Change Program. Students often have the opportunity to join BIOS scientists aboard the R/V Atlantic Explorer. Other student research opportunities focus on near-shore processes such as water and air pollution, coral reef ecology, marine biodiversity, molecular biology, and climate and catastrophe models, such as those used to predict hurricanes and/or intense rainfall events and flooding. Many projects provide the chance for students to engage in SCUBA and small boat activities as part of their training. BIOS has an active teaching program that insures a diverse student population, and REU students thus have opportunities to interact with marine science students from developing countries as part of the BIOS Centre of Excellence in Observational Oceanography and also with many visiting students from the USA and UK. REU students present a final seminar of their work to BIOS staff and visitors, and write manuscripts in the format of a journal appropriate for publication of the specific research project conducted. Funding provides for student travel to the site, dormatory housing and meals, a student stipend, and some student research support.</AbstractNarration>
