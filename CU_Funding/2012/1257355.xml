    <AbstractNarration>Biologists studying the evolution of life history strategies examine trade-offs between traits to understand how natural selection acts to maximize reproductive success. One fundamental trade-off occurs between the size and number of offspring: an organism can produce many small offspring, or just a few large offspring. There is a large body of theory explaining how these strategies affect reproductive success, but in animals, tests of this theory have been done in only two groups: vertebrates and sea urchins. The proposed research uses experimental embryological techniques to test theory in a much more diverse suite of animals, including members of two of the three major lineages of bilaterally symmetric animals: deuterostomes (hemichordates and echinoderms) and lophotrochozoans (annelids, flatworms, and molluscs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work integrates research and education at two institutions focused on providing meaningful student research experiences. The grant will support the development of a series of web-based lesson plans that will be made available for adoption by any institution of higher learning. These lesson plans will be developed through a series of pilot programs run during introductory and upper level biology classes at both institutions. The grant will provide direct support for 8-10 undergraduates and one graduate student, while lesson plans will provide in-class research opportunities for hundreds of additional students.</AbstractNarration>
