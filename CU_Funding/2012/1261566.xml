    <AbstractNarration>Title: February Fourier Talks 2013:&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for the eighth meeting in the February Fourier Talks (FFT) series and a satellite Workshop on "Phaseless Reconstruction." The 2013 FFT will be held February 21-22, 2013, at the University of Maryland, College Park, and will be followed by the Workshop on Phaseless Reconstruction to be held February 23 - 25, 2013. The FFT is a high-level forum for harmonic analysts to bring their work to scientists from industry and government agencies. In addition, it allows experts in applied and pure harmonic analysis to become familiar with the latest problems in need of mathematical formulation and solution. Finally, it introduces young mathematicians and scientists to applied and pure harmonic analysis. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts, registration information, and an archive of past conferences, can be found at the conference webpage: www.fft2013.org. The Workshop on Phaseless Reconstruction will bring together researchers from harmonic analysis, quantum information theory, and electrical engineering communities to discuss new development on efficient signal reconstruction from phaseless measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The February Fourier Talks directly encourage dialogue and collaboration between mathematicians and scientists working in industry and government. The structure of the conference consists of three main lectures and sixteen 30 minute invited talks. The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The workshop on Phaseless Reconstruction is structured in a similar manner to the FFT, and allows ample discussion time among the participants. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts and registration information is available at the workshop webpage: http://www.norbertwiener.umd.edu/FFT/2013/phaseless.html.</AbstractNarration>
