    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop nanocomposite capacitor films with high energy density and low loss through the use of a unique synthesis process for high aspect ratio nanowires of previously unrealized compositions in this form. High power capacitors are a critical energy technology, yet current state of the art materials only offer an energy density of 1.2 J/cc and have seen only marginal performance gains in the past decade. One method to increase the energy density of the capacitor is through the use of nanocomposite that combines high breakdown strength polymers with high dielectric fillers. Although historically nanocomposites have performed poorly in high energy density capacitors, HARP Engineering?s recent demonstration that nanowire fillers can improve the performance beyond the neat polymer is expected to produce materials that meet commercial demands while significantly reducing the capacitor size. The goal of these efforts will be to produce high energy density materials with low loss such that they meet the current demands for commercialization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lie in the development of high power capacitors which form a critical technology for power inverters, smart grids, electric drive vehicles and pulsed power systems. However the current state of the art suffers from low energy density making them bulky and costly. This Small Business Innovation Research effort will seek to eliminate the low energy density of current materials through the use of nanocomposites that capitalize on high aspect ratio fillers to create superior performance to the neat polymer. The result of this research will also provide improved understanding of the structure property relationships in dielectric nanocomposites and will advance the processing science of nanowires.</AbstractNarration>
