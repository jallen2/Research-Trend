    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-29306&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Mahmood, Akhtar H; &lt;br/&gt; Alam, Mohammad S; Severini, Horst; Zain, Samya; &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Bellarmine University&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI/Acq.: High Resolution Visualization System to Enable Large-Scale Data-Intensive Collaborative Research and Cyber-Learning using Grid Computing&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project from an EPSCoR state and a non-PhD granting institution, acquiring a high resolution visualization instrument, aims to set up an Advanced Visualization and Computational Lab (AVCL) to enable large scale data-intensive collaborative research (data analyses, simulation, and visualization tasks) in high energy physics. In collaboration with University of Oklahoma, State University of New York at Albany, and Susquehanna University, the project spans four geographically dispersed institutions. The acquisition targets a cost-effective high-resolution tiled display system providing a collaborative visualization environment. This visualization system will be constructed as a tiled display wall (16- foot wide by 4.6-foot tall) over an area that fills a user?s field of view to provide a display that looks nearly borderless. It will be connected to several Tier-4 data analyses workstations via a wall processor, so that the scientists can simultaneously display multiple ATLAS data events all at once. 2D and 3D visualization tasks will be carried out using Atlantis, GraXML and VP1 visualization software package. The studies and research projects in high energy physics will be enabled, including, but not limited, to the research for new types of subatomic particles, such as the charged Higgs boson and Supersymmetric (SUSY) particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and ?Search for Charged Higgs Boson from tt Production?. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation increases institutional capacity to conduct cutting-edge research in cost-effective visualization system. Since the large amount of data cannot be otherwise analyzed and studied, visualization is fundamental for high energy physics. The acquisition of this visualization system should significantly increase the research capability within all the participating institutions. Moreover, the acquisition of this visualization system will serve as a campus-wide resource and provide an exceptional opportunity to engage students in research at the forefront of data-intensive computational science, visualization, and high-energy physics. Through this effort, student training (including underrepresented groups) will be emphasized, as well as the knowledge dissemination. Its impact may be significant.</AbstractNarration>
