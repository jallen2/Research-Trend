    <AbstractNarration>Michael L. Klein at Temple University is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in research coupling novel computational algorithms and methods with leadership-class HPC resources to understand membrane fusion, a key process in viral infection and neurotransmitter release at the synapse. In the latter, fusion proteins enhance the intrinsic slow rate of vesicle-membrane fusion when a 30-50 nm vesicle delivers neurotransmitter to the plasma membrane. The long-term aim is to elucidate the mechanistic role played fusion proteins. The size, time-scale, and complexity of the fusion process demands the use of coarse grain simulation methodologies such as those developed by the PI's group for lipid-vesicle self-assembly and related phenomena exhibited by surfactants and macromolecules. Synaptic vesicles are of the size just now accessible with molecular dynamics simulation on state-of-the-art hardware. The immediate challenge is to handle the fusion proteins and then build a complete simulation package - within the massively parallel LAMMPS simulation code - to eventually explore the complete fusion process using models calibrated to realistic simulations of the components. The proposal involves an international collaboration to further elaborate the needed models for charged lipids and their interaction with proteins and counter ions. The closely related process of vesicle-vesicle fusion is broadly relevant to research in surfactant science and nanotechnology. Thus, success will impact fundamental and applied science ranging from chemistry and biology to nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research on using state of the art computer simulation to model key biological processes will be carried out in the Institute for Computational Molecular Science (ICMS). Since its creation in 2009, ICMS has spawned new junior faculty hires with an interest in computation. ICMS already offers informal classes on parallel programming and HPC tools, and classes on molecular modeling, which have impacted education -- faculty, post-docs, grad students and undergraduates in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics take advantage of the expertise residing in ICMS. The long-term goal is to develop these informal offerings into formal undergraduate courses and masters degree programs. ICMS has already embraced significant outreach to the public and society at large (Philadelphia Science Fair and the Franklin Institute). Going forward, it will integrate its HR development efforts with existing programs such as TU-teach, which benefit undergraduates and local high school science teachers. ICMS will continue to host extended visits of scientists from around the World plus graduate students from other labs who can enjoy the intellectual diversity of ICMS research -- chemistry, physics, materials science, pharmacology, and neuroscience. ICMS graduates have been hired by industry and into tenure track positions in academe, which attests to the important of its societal impact.</AbstractNarration>
