    <AbstractNarration>The exchange of individuals among populations, termed connectivity, is a central element of population persistence and maintenance of genetic diversity, and influences most ecological and evolutionary processes. To date, field studies of marine connectivity have necessarily focused on one or a few species at a time, providing little understanding of both the extent of variability in connectivity across a whole community and what factors drive that variability. This project will address these questions with population genetic datasets of a diverse marine fauna sampled across the Hawaiian Archipelago. By combining these genetic data with extensive oceanographic, ecological and historical data, this project can potentially transform our understanding of the basis of the genetic structure of populations and the processes influencing genetic patterns. This project will provide unique, and new, knowledge to basic marine ecology and the science of Ecosystem Based Management while incorporating the latest analytical and simulation approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will be novel on several fronts: 1) advancing our understanding of community genetics and associated statistical techniques; 2) achieving true integration of genetic, ecological and oceanographic data over large spatial scales for many species simultaneously using a World Heritage Site; the Hawaiian Papahânaumokuâkea Marine National Monument; 3) factoring historical effects into connectivity studies; and 4) providing information on the location of barriers to connectivity, the sources and sinks of individuals and the physical processes influencing ecological patterns at a community level. This project will result in a quantum leap for both the conceptual and empirical understanding of marine connectivity and the utility of population genetic data in basic and applied marine science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also provide unique insights for both management and the general public through an established science-management partnership that reaches &gt;14,000 people annually, a radio talk show, and through exhibits at the Waikiki Aquarium and Telus World of Science Center that is expected to reach over 800,000 visitors each year. Additionally, the University of Hawaii has one of the most culturally diverse campuses in the country from which to draw students and assistants. The principal investigators have an established track record of recruiting minority students, and this project will develop a combination of skills in molecular genetics, quantitative analysis, statistics, and landscape genetic techniques to further their career options in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
