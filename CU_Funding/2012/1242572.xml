    <AbstractNarration>A central question in neuroscience is understanding the mechanisms by which genes influence behavior. Using model organisms that have genes that can be easily manipulated is critical to gaining a better understanding of how genetic polymorphisms contribute to complex phenotypes. Past work has shown that the innate food preferences of the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, vary in different strains. The project focuses on understanding how natural genetic polymorphisms influence food preferences as well as the neuronal basis of food preference. The project has three aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which the identified F-box gene modifies bacterial preference behavior; 2) identify additional causative genes underlying other previously determined QTLs; 3) determine the neuronal circuits underlying discrimination among complex odors released by a wide range of bacteria likely to be found in the natural environment of C. elegans. This project will provide insights into the genetic and neuronal mechanisms by which C. elegans generates its responses to different complex stimuli, and into the relationship between the genome and behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study how genes can influence complex behaviors such as food preference using the C. elegans model organism. The research will be conducted primarily by undergraduates at Harvey Mudd College. Students will participate in all aspects of the research, including designing and conducting experiments, analyzing data, presenting their work at on-campus research symposia as well as national scholarly meetings and preparing their work for publication.</AbstractNarration>
