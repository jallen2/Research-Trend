    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the investigator will explore the cycling of phosphorus in the ocean by studying the biological mechanisms that shape the abundance, production, and utilization of marine polyphosphate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although phosphorus (P) is a key nutrient that helps control marine biological productivity and microbial community composition, the origin and fate of up to 75% of marine dissolved P, collectively referred to as dissolved organic P (DOP), remains enigmatic. Research conducted by the investigator revealed that polyphosphate (poly-P) is an abundant component (~10%) of DOP throughout the world's ocean and is involved in critical global processes such as geologic P sequestration and global climate. However, as in the case for bulk DOP pools, very little is known about the biological mechanisms shaping the abundance, production, and utilization of marine poly-P. Given the profound ecosystem and climatic implications of poly-P cycling and its potential role as an abundant biological P source, understanding the microbial sources and sinks of poly-P that regulate its composition and surprisingly consistent global abundance remains a fundamental challenge in oceanography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in the study of marine poly-P have historically been limited by a lack of analytical techniques; however, tools to fill critical knowledge gaps in marine poly-P cycling are now available through an integrated biogeochemical approach that combines the expertise and technical backgrounds of the investigator and sponsoring scientist. New mechanisms of poly-P production and microbial P assimilation discovered through this research have the potential to fundamentally advance biological models of P metabolism and transform current understanding of marine DOP by revealing new mechanisms that shape its composition, influence the linked cycles of other nutrients, oxygen, and carbon, and global climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational broader impacts integrate with existing education and outreach opportunities at the host institution. The investigator will mentor two summer undergraduate students recruited through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Minority Student Fellowship Program. Mentoring approaches are designed to advance discovery and substantially enrich the students' scientific contributions, personal experiences, and overall likelihood of continuing in ocean science. Additional broadening participation activities will contribute to the existing infrastructure of ocean science education and foster participation in the broader community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (OCE PRF) program, with goals to support novel research by early career scientists and increase the diversity of the U.S. ocean sciences workforce and research community. With OCE-PRF support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to ocean sciences and broaden participation of under-represented groups in the ocean sciences.</AbstractNarration>
