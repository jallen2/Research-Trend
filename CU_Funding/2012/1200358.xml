    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to advance our understanding of mechanical failure mechanisms in arterial tissue, focusing on atherosclerotic plaque failure. Arterial tissue failure leads to several life-threatening clinical conditions, including atherosclerotic plaque rupture and aortic dissection. Arterial tissue has structural similarities to fiber-reinforced composite materials used for engineering and manufacturing applications. In this project, theoretical and analytical approaches developed to describe failure of reinforced composites will be extended to interpret the results of experimental studies of plaque failure in atherosclerotic mice, which develop plaques comparable to those seen in humans. The research will combine experimental studies of the structure and biochemistry of the interface between tissue layers in atherosclerotic mouse arteries with development of theoretical and computational models of delamination mechanisms at both macroscopic and microscopic length scales. The models will be used to simulate controlled peeling/delamination experiments on atherosclerotic mouse arteries using both cohesive zone and micromechanical approaches. The validated models will then be used to predict those conditions that result in arterial tissue failure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continuum and micromechanical modeling approaches developed in mouse studies can be readily modified to understand tissue failure processes in human diseases. The proposed effort has potential to positively impact patient management, while guiding the development of successful interventions. The models developed will also be applicable for analyzing failure of non-biological composite materials having similar structure and material properties. The insight gained into mechanisms of arterial tissue adhesion and failure is expected to prove useful to the biomedical device industry, for example in the development of improved biomimetic surgical adhesives. The educational and outreach aspects of the project include undergraduate training in biomechanics, outreach to high school teachers in STEM subjects through Project Lead the Way, and strengthening the new Biomedical Engineering Program at the University of South Carolina.</AbstractNarration>
