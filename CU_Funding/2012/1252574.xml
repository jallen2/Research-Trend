    <AbstractNarration>EarthCube is a joint venture between the Directorate of Geosciences and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure at the National Science Foundation. It is a community-driven effort to design and implement an effective data and knowledge management system for the geosciences that will integrates disparate data sets and web services and serves all members of the geoscience community. This 2-day workshop at the University of Colorado brings together investigators and other interested parties who have been tasked with developing cyberinfrastructure components that are potential candidates for inclusion in the final architecture and design of EarthCube. Participants at the workshop will be tasked to synthesize community input from the June EarthCube meeting and sequence the series of proposed milestones and events included in community-created road maps of key cyberinfrastructure capabilities that were generated over the course of the last six months. The overarching goals of the workshop will be to propose a workable cyberinfrastructure framework for EarthCube and work out a provisional timeline for its implementation. Participants will consist of key individuals already working on potential EarthCube architecture components, as well as those from newly formed special interest groups such as those interesting in having EarthCube link to and incorporate biological datasets; those seeking to serve the needs of geoscientists who work with unique sample-based data, as opposed to large homogeneous datasets coming from sensor arrays; and those trying to develop software to allow direct ingestion of data from laboratory instruments. Broader impacts of the workshop lie in the area of building infrastructure for science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
