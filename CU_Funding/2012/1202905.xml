    <AbstractNarration>The twelfth meeting of the CNTA is scheduled to take place from June 17-22, 2012 at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada. The Canadian Number Theory Association (CNTA) was founded in 1987 at the International Number Theory Conference at Laval University. The purpose of the CNTA is to enhance and promote learning and research in number theory. To advance these goals, the CNTA organizes major international conferences, with the aim of exposing students and researchers to the latest developments in number theory. The direct impact of NSF funding will be the training of a significant number of junior American researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty), who will gain the opportunity to participate in the conference. Further information for this meeting may be found at http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~CNTA2012/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference supported by this NSF grant is in the area of number theory, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. Number theorists study questions concerning the fundamental properties of the integers. Although some of these questions may be easily stated, their solutions often employ advanced methods from diverse fields of mathematics. Moreover, theoretical results in number theory have a wide range of applications and have been useful to researchers in cryptography, coding theory, combinatorics, and theoretical physics.</AbstractNarration>
