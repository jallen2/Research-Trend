    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop novel approaches to water treatment that cost-effectively remove inorganic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in water. These DBPs, known as oxyhalides, are typically associated with standard water disinfection methods but can also be present in water as a result of industrial contamination. Oxyhalides present known public health risks and are targeted for regulation by the US Environmental Protection Agency as well as state environmental agencies. Research in this project will focus on two electrochemical methods that mitigate contamination of water with oxyhalides. The first is a novel electrochemical system capable of directly reducing oxyhalides to their corresponding halide ions while the second investigates unique preventative measures to minimize oxyhalide formation during hypochlorite production using on-site electrochemical generation systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial impacts of this project are that the proposed research will provide novel water treatment technology solutions that increase access to high quality potable water. An electrochemical device capable of complete reduction of oxyhalides will provide an effective, economical new technology that can be used on scales ranging from individual households to major aquifer remediation projects. Similarly, reduced production of oxyhalides during brine electrolysis processes will help municipalities and industrial water producers meet current and planned drinking water standards regulating the amounts of chlorate and perchlorate allowed in potable water. Both of the technologies developed as a result of this research will result in a broad impact on public health by providing technological barriers to the exposure of toxic oxyhalides.</AbstractNarration>
