    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research and education on non-equilibrium dynamics of materials involving classical and quantum models. Two recent algorithmic advances by the PI, one for classical systems and one for quantum systems, will be further developed and applied to specific models. The main thrusts of this project are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The mathematical underpinnings necessary to bridge disparate time scales in simulations, related to Projective Dynamics and Forward Flux Sampling methods, have recently been shown to be applicable to non-equilibrium dynamics of classical off-lattice systems. The Projective Dynamics and Forward Flux Sampling methods will be further developed and applied to two simulations with oscillating electromagnetic fields. One study will be related to fast charging for Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, the other to non-equilibrium processes relevant to the folding of proteins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. A novel quantum algorithm will allow studies of spin systems with a much larger Hilbert space than previously accessible to real-time calculations. This algorithm will be applied to study decoherence and thermalization of spin systems coupled to specific explicit spin baths. Both non-equilibrium dynamics and the approach to equilibrium will be investigated. The methodology will also enable quantification of the relation between physical time and time in dynamic Monte Carlo simulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Two additional studies of a more speculative nature will also be performed. One study will expand a new Renormalization Group method of the PI to investigate time-dependent electron transport through tight-binding models of nanomaterials with disorder. The second study will be to perform real-time quantum simulations in order to understand how the ubiquitous classical phenomenon of synchronization is manifest in large quantum systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports education of graduate and undergraduate students, including minority and female students, in the computational study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium materials processes. In addition, select computer source codes developed in the course of this project and related to non-equilibrium simulations of quantum and classical systems will be made available to the general public through a web site utilizing a GNU General Public License, version 3 or later, in order to encourage code reuse for both research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports computational and theoretical research and education related to the non-equilibrium dynamics of materials. Recharging the battery of an electronic device is a non-equilibrium process. Processes related to the approach toward classical behavior of quantum systems are additional forms of non-equilibrium dynamics, which are called decoherence and thermalization. Performing computer simulations of non-equilibrium processes provides a better understanding of materials properties. The ultimate goals of such studies may be the faster charging of a battery or maintaining the integrity of a quantum mechanical state of electrons for a longer time. Sophisticated algorithms are required to enable computer simulations of long-time studies of large non-equilibrium systems. This award supports developing innovative computer algorithms for non-equilibrium processes in materials, and to apply these algorithms to specific models to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of materials. &lt;br/&gt;This award supports the education of undergraduate and graduate students, including minority and female students, in the computational studies of non-equilibrium materials processes. Computer codes related to non-equilibrium simulations of quantum and classical systems that are developed in the course of this project will be made freely available encouraging code reuse for research and education.</AbstractNarration>
