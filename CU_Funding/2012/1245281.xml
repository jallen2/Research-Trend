    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will support U.S.-based participants attending the second session of the "Young Geometric Group Theory" meeting to be held at the Center for Mathematical Sciences at the Technion in Haifa, Israel on February 3-7, 2013.There will be four senior speakers giving mini-courses on fundamental topics, as well as seven outstanding postdocs giving short talks on their work. The planned mini-courses and talks will cover various aspect of geometric group theory such as CAT(0)-cube complexes, quasi-isometric rigidity, automorphisms of free groups and systolic complexes, and make connections with other fields of mathematics including representation theory, geometric measure theory, ergodic theory, differential geometry and model theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is a fairly young and dynamic field studied by an international community of researchers. Most of the workshop attendees will be early-career mathematicians; the schedule is designed to maximize the interactions among young researchers, as well as to give them extended contact with leading experts in the field. A website for the conference is at http://www.math.technion.ac.il/cms/decade_2011-2020/year_2012-2013/.</AbstractNarration>
