    <AbstractNarration>During the 2013 GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Section cruise, a scientist from the University of Southern Mississippi will determine the distributions of gallium (Ga) and vanadium (V), as well as V redox speciation. The planned cruise track is ideal for this effort because it will traverse various oceanic environments that influence the biogeochemistry of these elements namely, the Peru margin/upwelling zone and the associated oxygen minimum zone, gradients in atmospheric inputs and biological productivity from the Peru margin to Tahiti, and hydrothermal vents along the East Pacific Rise. Specific goals of the project include: (1) examine the discrepancy between surface water Ga and aluminum (Al) distributions and estimate dust inputs; (2) confirm the relationship observed in the North Pacific between the surface ocean Ga/Al ratio and the chlorophyll distribution; (3) compare the surface ocean manganese distribution with that of Ga, Al, and lead to differentiate between shelf and aerosol inputs; (4) determine if there is evidence of shelf V removal which contributes to the surface ocean V depletion; (5) test for hydrothermal influences on the V distribution downstream from the East Pacific Rise; and (6) compare V redox speciation with that of other elements including selenium, arsenic, and iodine as a means of examining the importance of water column reduction versus advective interactions with reducing coastal sediments. As such, the elements selected as the focus of this study, will provide information on dust input and redox cycling, especially when compared with other elements being determined by other cruise participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Results from the study would be included into course materials for Oceanography and Marine Chemistry classes. One graduate student would be supported and trained as part of this project. Mentoring of high school student is also noted.</AbstractNarration>
