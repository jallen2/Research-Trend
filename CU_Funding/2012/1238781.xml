    <AbstractNarration>This Research Initiation Award entitled - Modeling Inquiry Behaviors in Mobile Learning Environments - has the goal to enhance the human computer interaction (HCI) research program at Bowie State University by conducting research to model inquiry behaviors in mobile learning environments, introducing HCI research into the computer science curriculum, and supporting student development. This research will produce a design framework that enables mobile learning researchers to create environments that support sophisticated learner interactions. The research seeks to extend the use of Intelligent Tutoring Systems to include mobile learning environments that integrate new mobile applications and media. The resulting models will advance the understanding of human interaction with emerging technologies to benefit everyone interested in modeling human interactions for learning or training purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to model the behavior of users engaged with mobile learning environments and explore children's ideas for novel mobile learning environments. The two research questions to be answered are: 1) Can inquiry behaviors and complex thinking in personalized mobile learning environments be modeled? As users interact with technologies, they exhibit usage patterns that can be used to create models of their behaviors and understanding such behaviors is critical for making realistic learning environments. This question seeks to understand how to both model and create meaning from these interaction patterns. 2) How can advanced learning technologies extend and support traditional instruction in ways that personalize instruction for various learners? The use of children as design partners, via participatory design sessions, will change their role from that of end user to designer and result in mobile learning applications that extend beyond those commonly available in the popular mobile application marketplaces.</AbstractNarration>
