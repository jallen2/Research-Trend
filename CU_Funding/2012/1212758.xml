    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. The 54th Annual Maize Genetics Conference will be held March 15-18, 2012 at the Doubletree Hotel and Conference Center in Portland, OR. The meeting offers members of the scientific community the opportunity to present and discuss their most recent research relevant to maize genetics and plant biology. A wide range of topics investigating the structure and function of genes, pathways, and traits are included, spanning the spectrum of maize genetics from basic studies of gene action to quantitative trait dissection to more applied topics relevant to crop improvement. The meeting will feature 45-minute talks by four invited plenary speakers: Thomas Dresselhaus, University of Regensburg; Jenny Graves, Australian National University; Bill Tracy, University of Wisconsin - Madison; Venkatesan Sundaresan, University of California - Davis. In addition, the program will include approximately 35 18-minute talks by speakers selected from submitted abstracts, and two poster sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The Maize Genetics Conference provides outstanding opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to meet and interact with an international gathering of scientists in the field, to discuss their research while presenting talks or posters, and to establish scientific networks that will be valuable as they embark on their careers. Efforts to broaden participation at the meeting will occur through outreach and recruiting efforts that seek to support Conference attendance by students, postdocs and young faculty from underrepresented groups with an interest in exploring research possibilities in maize genetics. Partnering these awardees with experienced maize researchers at similar career stages will facilitate their productive participation in the Conference. The Maize Genetics Conference is unique compared to other meetings in its efforts to support attendance by all graduate student attendees.</AbstractNarration>
