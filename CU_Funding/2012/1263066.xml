    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, funded by the Division of Materials Research at the National Science Foundation (NSF), is aimed at advancing the goals established by the previous REU site in Applied Physics at University of South Florida. The primary goal of the proposed NSF REU site is to provide high quality motivational research experiences in Applied Physics aimed at attracting bright undergraduate students to enter this important area of research, and continue their careers in Science and Engineering as graduate students. The secondary goal is to expose some of the students involved in application-oriented projects to innovative research that enables transformation of basic research ideas into applications that are aimed at advancing current technologies. Expectation is to inspire future scientist to become entrepreneurs. The program is specifically designed for students from predominantly undergraduate institutions who have had limited or no research experience. Program offers research and professional development activities that are built upon the urbane university setting, excellent infrastructure and facilities for research, and the enthusiasm, experience, and commitment of our faculty to provide a high-quality research experience for undergraduate students. Students have the choice of acquiring their research experience with 15 faculty mentors in four thrust areas. In addition, their research experiences will be enriched by several special professional development programs such as weekly REU-wide seminar programs, a weekly lecture series in "Advances in Applied Physics", and workshops to develop oral and communication skills. At the end of the program they will present their work in a university wide REU symposium. Students involved in application-oriented projects will learn the steps involved in transforming basic research into commercial products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Applied Physics is a diverse and interdisciplinary area that is critical to technological and societal advances that affect our national competitiveness on the global level and lead to improvements in the quality of human life. This REU site in Applied Physics will strive to nurture the next generation of scientists and engineers who will work in areas of critical importance such as energy, environment, medicine, micro and nanoelectronics, information technologies, and other key enabling technologies. Program aims to kindle the entrepreneurial spirit in some students that may help to propagate American ingenuity. This program will attract undergraduate students from predominantly undergraduate institutions who may not have had a chance to be involved in research before. The adopted recruitment strategy guarantees that this REU opportunity will be available to a large percentage of groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
