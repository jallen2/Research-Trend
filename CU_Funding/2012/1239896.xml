    <AbstractNarration>The Robert Noyce Teacher Academy Scholars Program at The City College of New York (CCNY Noyce TA Scholars Program) in partnership with the New York City Department of Education is preparing forty-two (42) talented individuals pursuing undergraduate degrees in science, mathematics, and/or engineering for careers as certified secondary teachers (7-12) in urban schools. This project builds upon the Teacher Academy at The City College of New York. Program elements include: Pre-Scholars Intern Program for sophomores, Undergraduate Noyce Teacher Academy Scholars for junior and senior STEM majors, Summer Internship Program for Noyce Scholars, Support for Noyce Early Career Teachers Program, and a Noyce Alumni component. Sophomore students are invited to participate as Pre-Scholars in an urban internship as a mechanism for identifying highly talented STEM students and recruiting them to teaching. STEM majors from the City College campus as well as the Community Colleges in the CUNY system are recruited and prepared for teaching through a successful and recognized program that emphasizes teaching in urban high-needs schools via clinical immersion in schools. In addition to field experiences in schools during the academic year, these Noyce scholars participate in a summer internship program where they work in summer STEM camps for secondary school children and participate in existing education research projects at CCNY or within the broader CUNY system. Finally, Scholars are supported in their early career (up to two years of teaching) as practicing professionals in the urban high-needs district through professional development and a support network which establishes professional learning communities among Noyce scholars and their mentors. The program targets multiple populations in recruiting candidates with a focus on a diversity of Noyce Scholars who return to their home communities in the city as excellent teachers and role models.</AbstractNarration>
