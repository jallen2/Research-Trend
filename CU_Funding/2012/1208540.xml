    <AbstractNarration>This project attempts to combine human strengths in reasoning with machine capabilities in information fusion, task planning, and simulation to manage uncertainty and achieve successful human-robot partnerships to perform complex tasks in uncertain environments that were previously considered impractical or infeasible. The approach consists of three objectives: the use of sensing and control to reduce model registration uncertainty; the definition, simulation and implementation of virtual fixtures to allow humans to intuitively constrain the task; and the development of bi-directional task planning and execution with uncertainty to allow humans and robots to request help from one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has a number of broader impacts affecting both the academic community and society at large. The work is expected to have significant appeal to those in the manufacturing and medical robotics sectors, as testbeds will impact these areas. The PIs will mentor hands-on research by undergraduate, graduate, and post-doc students and guide them in the dissemination of their research to the scientific community. The team will also provide engineering experiences for middle school girls in the Baltimore area through weekend programs on the Johns Hopkins University campus, including the "Ready, Set, Design!" program. Finally, the development will be made freely available as all software will be fully integrated with open-source ROS.</AbstractNarration>
