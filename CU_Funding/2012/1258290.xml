    <AbstractNarration>This project will design and trial a new service called WiMed that provides high-quality, robust data communications between moving ambulances and the destination hospital. WiMed maps a small number of large flows to multiple wireless networks. WiMed is application aware and able to cross-layer and cross-application optimization when connectivity characteristics change due to ambulance location. The communications capability will enable high-quality audio-visual links and real-time patient data transfers between the ambulance and the receiving emergency room enabling an early assessment of a patient condition by a doctor and thereby reducing treatment delay. It will also enable trialing of feeding real-time traffic video feeds to the ambulance driver in support of navigation guidance for ambulances. Wireless networks that will be used in the project include the UW-Madison GENI WiMax network, available WiFi networks, and various public 3G/4G networks. The WiMed system will be trialed on ambulances operated by the West Allis Fire Department, part of the Milwaukee County Emergency Medical Services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enable medical ambulances to establish high-quality, robust audio-video and data links between the ambulance and emergency room doctors thus leading to faster treatment for patients needing emergency services. All students involved in the project will acquire significant hand-on implementation, experimentation and deployment experience in wireless systems applied to socially important applications.</AbstractNarration>
