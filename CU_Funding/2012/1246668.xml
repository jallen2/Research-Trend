    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the 2012 meeting of the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), which will be held at the University of Oregon during the period October 20-21, 2012. The 2012 WCOAS will provide attendees the opportunity to hear of progress in most of the following fields: free probability; subfactors; operator spaces; quantum groups; semigroups of endomorphisms; classification of C*-algebras; noncommutative geometry; graph C*-algebras; and noncommutative dynamical systems. The weekend seminar will feature approximately ten talks on current topics, delivered by a mix of junior and senior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WCOAS is the one annual forum addressing the community of operator algebraists in the western United States. It provides an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their own results, furnishes an opportunity for researchers to learn about recent research of others and to stay abreast of current work, and fosters collaborative research by giving researchers the opportunity to meet and discuss their work with one another. WCOAS encourages and nurtures graduate students and postdocs by giving them the opportunity to present their own work, learn about recent work, and meet established researchers in operator algebras. It helps create and maintain a cohesive regional community of operator algebraists, and fosters connections between the faculty and students at research universities and those at primarily undergraduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>
