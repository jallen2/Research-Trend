    <AbstractNarration>The new center site of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Broadband Wireless Technologies and Applications at the University of Notre Dame will complement the existing center?s activities through a focus on emerging wireless technology, economics, and regulatory policy challenges. The site intends to develop a cohesive and integrative approach to broadband research challenges in areas including cellular data collection, analytics, &amp; visualization; heterogeneous network modeling, analysis, and design; electromagnetic radiation exposure; spectrum sharing; vehicular communications; inter-machine wireless; crowd-sourced approaches and advanced circuitry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center site addresses an area of critical economic and has the potential to support development of broadband wireless as a platform for innovation as addressed in the White House PCAST Report. The center site at Notre Dame has the potential to link an even greater diversity of member companies across the broadband industry sector with university a broader base of discovery in this area. The site will provide early exposure to the concerns of and approaches employed in industry in students? education and career development. Underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students will be recruited to the program through existing mechanisms at the site such as the REU program in Experimental Research on Wireless Networking (ERWiN), in which more than 40% of the participants were from underrepresented groups over the last five years.</AbstractNarration>
