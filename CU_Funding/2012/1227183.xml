    <AbstractNarration>The University of Hawaii is awarded a grant to advance marine genomics and light microscopy imaging facilities at the Kewalo Marine Laboratory. Marine labs are ideally suited to study interactions of organisms at the interface of terrestrial and marine environments. This proposal requests funds to update molecular and optical imaging resources leveraging existing strengths to facilitate cutting edge research and training in broad areas of marine biology and biotechnology. These instruments will allow students/trainees to exploit the most modern techniques in DNA sequencing and live cell imaging to address fundamental problems in cellular, developmental, evolutionary, and environmental biology of our local marine biodiversity. KML is uniquely situated for the study of marine life in the sub-tropical northern Pacific environment. Marine habitats on O`ahu, easily accessed from the Laboratory, include coral reefs, sandy beaches, soft sediments, estuaries, and the deep sea and open ocean zones. The marine fauna of Hawai`i reflects a rich tropical diversity: local habitats boast over 2000 species. Due to the relative isolation of the archipelago, the marine fauna and flora provide unique opportunities for the study of speciation, biogeographic distribution and population genetics of coastal marine organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding will not only facilitate research on local fauna of the highly productive NSF-funded marine laboratory (and their diverse undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral fellow trainees), but will also bolster the active Visiting Scientist program. Kewalo Marine Laboratory has a strong record of placing trainees in academic and professional positions. KML hosts several NSF supported programs (Undergraduate Research Mentoring, Advanced Technological Education, and Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence) that train under-represented Pacific Islander students and high school teachers. Faculty and students disseminate research results locally and internationally at scientific meetings, and hold outreach programs for K-12 field trips. The instruments acquired with this award will be used for both research and teaching, allowing a diverse group of students to gain a better understanding of key biological processes that will help preserve and appreciate the unique local environment.
