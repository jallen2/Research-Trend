    <AbstractNarration>The PIs will improve the ability to detect precursory activity leading to active&lt;br/&gt;volcanism at both Okmok caldera and Redoubt volcano, Alaska, as well as increase understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the complexity of magma storage at Redoubt. They will investigate important questions at Redoubt&lt;br/&gt;regarding (1) the spatial extent of the magma chamber, (2) if magma migrates from a primary magma&lt;br/&gt;chamber to a second magma reservoir located somewhere between 2 and 4.5 km depth, (3) if temporary&lt;br/&gt;perturbations to the upper crustal velocity structure of Redoubt, reflecting CO2 degassed at mid-crustal&lt;br/&gt;depths, can be observed, possibly as early as several months prior to the 2009 event, thus serving as an&lt;br/&gt;early indicator of the eruption. At Okmok, they will examine important questions including (1) the&lt;br/&gt;existence of early signs of volcanic unrest preceding the 2008 eruption and/or (2) early indicators that the&lt;br/&gt;eruption would emanate NW of Cone D instead of an expected eruption at Cone A, (3) if there were&lt;br/&gt;indications of shallow magma movement (1-3 km depth) within the caldera in the months leading up to&lt;br/&gt;the 2008 eruption. One promising approach to improve detection of precursory activity leading to active&lt;br/&gt;volcanism at Okmok and Redoubt is to carry out seismic interferometry using ambient noise recorded at&lt;br/&gt;these volcanoes (specifically pre- through post-eruption for the 2008 Okmok and 2009 Redoubt&lt;br/&gt;eruptions).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okmok and Redoubt are two of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc and, as&lt;br/&gt;such, pose major hazards to people living within these regions, air traffic, local fisheries, and local oil&lt;br/&gt;production facilities. This study will improve our ability to detect precursory activity leading to active&lt;br/&gt;volcanism at both Okmok and Redoubt as well as increase our understanding of the complexity of magma&lt;br/&gt;storage at Redoubt. The proposed study will also broaden the experience of an early career female&lt;br/&gt;scientist.</AbstractNarration>
