    <AbstractNarration>This research investigates how prenatal and postnatal nutrition relate to dental eruption and, in turn, the role of the developing dentition in mothers' weaning and feeding decisions. Weaning age is a critical life history characteristic because of the recognized relationship between breastfeeding and inter-birth intervals, and, ultimately, mothers' lifetime reproductive success. Links among weaning age, maternal condition, and infant nutrition and growth have been found in both non-human primates and humans. In addition, human mothers use infants' growth and developmental status as a cue when making weaning and feeding decisions. This research, by doctoral student Jennifer Spence (Ohio State University), under the guidance of Dr. Guatelli-Steinberg, addresses a relatively unexplored yet significant question: how the developing dentition is involved in these relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using anthropometric assessment and ethnographic methods, this research 1) employs a reliable technique of gauging gestation duration to accurately evaluate the association between prenatal maternal nutritional status and postnatal infant nutritional status, and the timing of deciduous (primary) tooth emergence; 2) determines the extent to which the timing of deciduous tooth emergence is related to the age at which the weaning process begins; and 3) investigates how the presence of deciduous teeth affects mothers' weaning and feeding decisions. It is hypothesized that both maternal and infant nutrition are associated with the timing of deciduous tooth emergence, which is in turn predicted to influence weaning and feeding decisions. This project is set among Ribeirinho populations in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, an area characterized by nutritional stress and with variation in weaning and feeding practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is part of a STEM initiative familiarizing underserved public-school students with the social sciences, particularly anthropology. The project promotes collaboration with Brazilian non-academics through inclusion of local women in data collection and academics through a university seminar. A campaign is planned to create and disseminate nontechnical material in local communities to encourage good nutrition and dental health.</AbstractNarration>
