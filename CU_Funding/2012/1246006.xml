    <AbstractNarration>This is a continuation of a study based on the GEM program in 2009 where its research was originally funded for three years. This covers that last two years of that effort. The only change is the location at which the research will be carried out. The effort had two parts. One is to carry out a scientific investigation and the second is to aid in running the scientific parts of the GEM program. Both tasks are discussed below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plasmasphere is a region of relatively dense cold plasma (1000 cm-3) found near the Earth (~ 4 RE). This is proposal to use data analysis and simulation to investigate drainage of this cold plasma from the plasmasphere and its effect on the dynamics of the magnetosphere. Recent findings indicate that leakage of plasma from the plasmasphere may affect magnetospheric dynamics during disturbed times. This research will focus on four of the effects that have been suggested during magnetic storms. In particular the following questions will be examined: 1) Does the cold plasma affect the reconnection rate at the dayside magnetosphere? 2) Does this reduce the overall solar-wind/magnetosphere coupling? 3) Does the cold plasma influence the decay of electron radiation belts? 4) Does it lead to radiation belt dropouts and sudden recoveries? Answers to these questions should lead to a deeper understanding of the effects of cold plasma in the magnetosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will impact future global models to magnetospheric dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEM program's research protocol is to concentrate on specific focus topics. Each of these lasts three years. Part of the funding for this research will be used to help coordinate two of these focus group efforts. These are the focus group on 'Plasmasphere-Magnetosphere Interactions' and the group on 'Diffuse Auroral Precipitation'.</AbstractNarration>
