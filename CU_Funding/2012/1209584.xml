    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Ayla Susan Pamukcu of Vanderbilt University to conduct a research project, entitled "How long did it take to develop the giant magma bodies that resulted in the Oruanui and Whakamaru supereruptions?" during the summer of 2012 at University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The host scientist is Dr. Darren Gravley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop a greater understanding of the timescales over which giant magma bodies persist in the Earth's crust prior to eruption, through the study of textures (sizes, shapes) and compositions of crystals, bubbles, and glass. Such results can aid in the development of volcanic hazards programs. In addition, this work serves to further develop analytical techniques in the fields of igneous petrology and volcanology, such as conventional, differential absorption, and propagation phase-contrast x-ray tomography and cathodoluminescence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
