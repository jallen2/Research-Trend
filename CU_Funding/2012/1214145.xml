    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Eric Ross and his group at Gonzaga University are developing new chromatography methods and materials for the evaluation of binding and partitioning events at lipid bilayers. The materials under study are based on dynamic phospholipid phases supported on aggregates of silica nanoparticles which allow lipid bilayers and incorporated synthetic and natural receptors to be assayed in a nano-volume liquid chromatography format. The high-performance features of the solid support and the dynamic properties of natural membranes that are replicated in the phospholipid coatings promise to extend the capabilities of current biomembrane affinity stationary phases to probe the influence of membrane and solution composition on the function of natural or synthetic pores and channels within lipid bialyers or to screen substances that modulate their function. Project goals include structurally and chemically optimizing the stationary phases for the support of lipid bilayers and functional embedded receptors, optimizing chromatographic procedures for studies of membrane partitioning and binding with key model receptors both natural and synthetic, understanding the separation mechanism associated with ion-channel functionalized membranes, and establishing the compatibility of the system and format with increasingly complex biomembrane systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in research-enabling, cost- and time-effective technology that can be used to investigate factors affecting the strength and selectivity of interactions at biomembranes have the potential to broadly impact scientific fields that study this crucial biological interface which is hampered by the various analytical limitations of existing model systems. Engagement of undergraduate students in all aspects of the research project beginning as early as the sophomore year and continuing through graduation will provide structured and advanced training in applied materials and bioanalytical sciences for students largely from rural areas of the inland Northwest. Multi-year engagement on collaborative projects will allow undergraduate researchers to engage in vertical mentorship roles as they grow in scientific skill and ability.</AbstractNarration>
