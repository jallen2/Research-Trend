    <AbstractNarration>In hydraulic fracturing high pressures are applied to induce fractures within shale&lt;br/&gt;formations. Sand and other solid particles (known as proppants) are then injected to&lt;br/&gt;prevent the collapse of the fractures once the pressure is released.These propped&lt;br/&gt;fractures ease the extraction of natural gas/oil. Sand has the disadvantages of not&lt;br/&gt;distributing evenly within the fractures, and of not reaching fractures far from the&lt;br/&gt;wellbore. This limits the amount of natural gas/oil that can be extracted from a given&lt;br/&gt;shale formation. Research is being conducted in materials sciences to produce&lt;br/&gt;proppantsthat are uniform in size (so that they will not clog the fractures),&lt;br/&gt;small (so that they canpenetrate narrow fractures), mechanically strong (to maintain the fractures open even&lt;br/&gt;when exposed to high subsurface pressures), and light (to diffuse farther from the&lt;br/&gt;wellbore, allowing the extraction of larger amounts of natural gas/oil from one fracture).&lt;br/&gt;This proposal intends to explore whether Pickering emulsions could be used to prevent&lt;br/&gt;the collapse of the hydraulic fractures once the pressure is released. Pickering emulsions&lt;br/&gt;e.g., water in oil) are stabilized by solid particles. They find numerous applications in&lt;br/&gt;areas as diverse as food preparation, cosmetics,drug delivery, and catalytic processes.&lt;br/&gt;The results obtained so far in the PIs laboratory,summarized in the narrative, have been&lt;br/&gt;obtained for bulk Pickering emulsions.Such studies have quantified the effect of solid&lt;br/&gt;particles on the water-decane interfacial tension, and the mechanism of dropletcoalescence.&lt;br/&gt;Current research is being conducted to clarify the interfacial structure anddynamical &lt;br/&gt;properties for systems composed by mixtures of different solid particles.This proposal stems from the hypothesis that emulsions might allow for a bettercontrolled distribution of the proppants within a fracture, possibly far from the wellbore.&lt;br/&gt;In the systems of interest the proppants will have the dual role of fracture stabilizers and&lt;br/&gt;emulsion formers.It is anticipated that once the emulsions are destabilized because of&lt;br/&gt;particle-rock interactions,the proppants will adsorb onto the rock surface.By controlling&lt;br/&gt;the emulsion stability within different sub-surface formations it will be possible to design shale-specific proppants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research consists in the evaluation of a new&lt;br/&gt;method to inject proppants within hydraulic fractures (Pickering emulsions instead of&lt;br/&gt;aqueous dispersions). If successful, this exploratory research could lead to the&lt;br/&gt;exploitation of larger amounts of the natural gas/oil stored in shale formations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. One post-doctoral researcher will conduct this exploratory research&lt;br/&gt;over a period of one year. The results obtained will be used to test our hypothesis. If&lt;br/&gt;successful, the proposed research could bring enormous economical advantages to the&lt;br/&gt;nation because the hydraulic fracturing stage constitutes one of the most expensive stages&lt;br/&gt;in the well drilling, and because more natural gas will be produced from a single well.&lt;br/&gt;Potential impacts are also expected on other technologies (e.g., cosmetics and drugdelivery),&lt;br/&gt;as our research will lead to better fundamental understanding of Pickeringemulsions. &lt;br/&gt;The research results will be integrated in teaching and outreach activities,&lt;br/&gt;following our track record.</AbstractNarration>
