    <AbstractNarration>Objective. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to progress towards a systematic and better understanding of distributed cognitive layering and consequent network architecture decompositions, based on the advanced theory of Variational Inequalities. &lt;br/&gt;The ultimate objective is developing a new methodology to formulate, study, and solve in a distributed way generic cross-layer designs of cognitive ad-hoc networks (including the optimization of the sensing process), building on a novel framework that collectively is termed hierarchical Variational Inequalities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. &lt;br/&gt;The theory of Variational Inequalities provides a broad mathematical framework for a host of formulations of practical interest, such as classical nonlinear optimization, equilibrium, and game-theoretic problems. The proposed hierarchical Variational Inequality problem offers thus a constructive and powerful platform to investigate several novel cross-layer designs, and provides an alternative and promising direction to deal with the fundamental issues of traditional NUM designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. &lt;br/&gt;Success in the proposed research effort has the potential to change how to teach and design cognitive wireless networks. This research will enable efficient, rigorous, and cost-effective new approaches for the design of complex networks, which will represent a shift from current heuristic based approaches. Moreover, bringing for the first time Variational Inequalities in engineering disciplines, the project will promote cross-fertilization among different research fields, such as signal processing, optimization, game and decision theory, and networking, offering to researchers in these communities a constructive and powerful platform for fruitful developments. The research project is well rounded by a complementary educational program that targets both undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
