    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on numerical approximation of wave propagation phenomena in transient cases, with an emphasis on techniques based on the use of boundary integral methods. As a set of physically motivated applications, the investigator will concentrate on different models of scattering of acoustic waves in two and three dimensions and in wave-structure interaction. The proposal includes numerical analysis and implementation of three kinds of schemes: (1) Galerkin and delta-based space semi-discretization with Convolution Quadrature for time domain boundary integral equations; (2) coupling of Finite and Boundary Elements with Convolution Quadrature in time, for models that combine the acoustic wave equation on non-homogeneous media with time domain boundary integral equations; (3) Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin methods for complex wave propagation problems, with an emphasis on wave-structure interaction in the time domain. At the analytical level, the investigator and his collaborators will work on the development of new mathematical tools for time domain boundary integral equations, using time domain techniques instead of the usual Laplace domain tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer simulation is an indispensable part of modern science and technology, often showing the path in design of new devices and predicting the behavior of complicated physical models that are expensive to experiment with. Through deep mathematical understanding, numerical analysis gives not only certainty in the ability of the computational simulations to yield the right answers, but also shows the expected quality of these results, and proposes new techniques to handle problems of increasing difficulty. The investigator and his team will work on the development of algorithmic and mathematical tools to study transient phenomena. The proposed work deals with propagation of sound and the interaction of mechanical vibrations with fluid motion, with potential applications in the simulation of propagation of noise inside vibrating structures (vehicles, for instance). The techniques that the investigator and his team will develop are general in scope and can be potentially applied to other wave propagation problems, including seismic and electromagnetic waves.</AbstractNarration>
