    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Allison McInnes of Texas A&amp;M University to conduct a research project, entitled "Using new techniques to understand the carbon cycle of the Eastern Indian Ocean" during the summer of 2012 at the University of Western Australia in Perth, Australia. The host scientist is Dr. Anya Waite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is a better understanding of the oceanic carbon cycle in a unique and understudied region of the world's ocean. The phytoplankton community is being intensively sampled to provide accurate measurements of phytoplankton community composition and the amount of primary production and nitrogen fixation, for a more thorough understanding of how the base of the food web and primary producers of the ocean drive the carbon cycle. This region is characterized as having very low nutrients which are necessary for phytoplankton while also supporting many important fisheries. A better understanding the carbon cycle in this region reveals how an "oceanic desert" can support so much life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
