    <AbstractNarration>This project examines how animals in groups collectively learn about their environment and how this learning process may result in "collective intelligence", whereby the group can make more accurate decisions than any single individual can. Most social animals, such as fish, have very limited means of communication and coordination, and it is currently unknown whether these animals can learn to exploit the potential collective intelligence under these constraints. This project will develop a theoretical model of collective learning, and preliminary results suggest that the same learning rules known to be ubiquitous in solitary animals can also be highly efficient in a group context and can lead to near-optimal levels of collective intelligence, even with limited coordination between individuals. The specific predictions of the collective learning model will then be experimentally tested using two social animal species: fish and humans. By using two very different species, the generality of the model can be tested, and general mechanisms of collective learning will be uncovered. These experiments will provide important insights into the learning process in animal groups, which has previously been unexplored. They may also give specific insight into how humans learn in a group context and may suggest techniques to increase the efficiency of collective learning in human groups.</AbstractNarration>
