    <AbstractNarration>This project, CC-NIE Network Infrastructure: High Performance Research Networking (HiPerNet), establishes a Science DMZ at the University of Chicago that is distinct from the general-purpose campus network and that is purpose-built for data-intensive science. This Science DMZ includes support for virtual circuits, software defined networking, and 100 gigabit Ethernet. It includes a targeted renovation of the existing campus networking infrastructure, focusing on intra-campus networking from labs and buildings which have high data I/O and networking needs, as well as improving the throughput from these facilities to high-speed national and international research networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This upgrade supports a range of projects in Astronomy, Astrophysics, Computer Science, Social Sciences, Genomics, and Particle Physics. Data-intensive science in these fields requires an upgrade to support high-performance bulk data movement, data-intensive experimental needs, and access to high performance national and international networks in order to foster collaboration and discovery on high-priority projects. The Science DMZ also benefits computer science projects at that are developing innovative data-intensive computing infrastructure, including Globus Online, Open Science Data Cloud, and the UDP-based Data Transfer (UDT) protocol, providing a testbed for new methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This upgrade enables researchers to share data with a larger community of users by facilitating collaboration across universities and labs. In addition, UChicago will take lessons learned from this experience and package them in a form suitable for consumption by other campuses pursuing similar goals. Enhancing campus networking abilities also benefits the surrounding community including schools, community hospitals, and the Adler Planetarium.</AbstractNarration>
