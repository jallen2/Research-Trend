    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to understand and leverage the electroelastic dynamics of flexible piezoelectric composites for next-generation biomimetic locomotion and energy harvesting. Due to their robustness, structural flexibility, high energy density, and well-balanced force-deflection capabilities, fiber-based piezoelectric composites with interdigitated electrodes can be employed in various applications ranging from structural sensors/actuators and energy harvesters to bio-inspired aquatic and aerial vehicles. This research will establish a unified mathematical framework with experimental validations for complex dynamics of fiber-based piezoelectric composites for low-to-high mechanical and electrical excitation levels in the presence of two-way coupling. The technical approach is based on the synthesis of materially and geometrically nonlinear non-conservative electroelastic structural dynamic models with controlled experiments to explore and understand the effects of various parameters on the coupled system dynamics. Specifically, this research will lead to an unprecedented multifunctional nonlinear dynamical system platform that combines biomimetic locomotion and energy harvesting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will result in electroelastic models and structural concepts that can be exploited in various applications, ranging from structural shape control and adaptive stiffness change to bio-inspired aquatic/aerial robotics as well as energy harvesting from deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems. Potential high-impact applications of enhanced aquatic locomotion and vibrational energy harvesting span from sustainability in marine environments and effective drug delivery to battery-less medical implants and energy-autonomous wireless sensor networks in structural health monitoring. This project will also reach and inspire a large number of underrepresented and minority K-12 students and their teachers through a complementary and engaging educational plan, prepared in collaboration with the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC) at Georgia Tech. The educational and outreach activities include the hosting of Georgia Intern-Fellowship Teachers (GIFT) and high school students for research on dynamical systems involving smart structures, aquatic locomotion, and energy harvesting.</AbstractNarration>
