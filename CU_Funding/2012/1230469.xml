    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests travel funds from NSF to assist 20 US students to participate in PerMIS 2012, which will be held at the University of Maryland University College in Hyattsville, Maryland. The purpose of this Group Travel Grant Proposal is to make it possible for US students and postdocs to attend the conference, present their work, and forge connections with colleagues from around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Performance Metrics for Intelligent Systems workshop is the only one of its kind dedicated to defining measures and methodologies of evaluating performance of intelligent systems. This years theme revolves around Cyber Physical Systems, an important area of research highlighted in the recent PCAST report. As part of this award, students will also have the opportunity to participate in special events and learn more about the field of performance metrics and cyber physical systems. Travel funding will be in the form of partial airfare reimbursement and full reimbursement for student registration to approximately 20 U.S. students who plan to present at least one paper at the Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The importance of performance metrics for engineered systems cannot be overstated. The benefit to student learning and mentorship by encouraging attendance of students by direct monetary means brings large dividends in student confidence, knowledge and expertise.</AbstractNarration>
