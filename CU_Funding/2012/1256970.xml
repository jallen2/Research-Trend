    <AbstractNarration>A network of data loggers and sediment traps was deployed by researchers for the University of Arizona in three lakes on three islands to monitor meteorological, limnological, and sedimentation variability as a function of climate changes in the region. The dominant interannual variability is caused by ENSO and during the period of deployment the region exhibited a minor El Nino (2009-2010) followed by modest La Nina conditions (2010-2011). The region is now in a neutral state with predictions of an El Nino beginning again in winter 2012-2013. The data loggers are filled to capacity and need to be retrieved, downloaded and replaced. In addition sediment traps contain the particle rain related to the transition from the week/moderate El Nino to the 2010 La Nina. Replacement with new traps will permit observations of the transition back into El Nino conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the research of two early career scientists: Jessica Conroy, an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow now at Georgia Tech, and Diane Thompson, an advanced graduate student from the University of Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This an excellent proposal for RAPID funding because: 1) the data collection systems are full and should be replaced this fall before the onset of the next El Nino: 2) the sediment traps will have a record of the most recent La Nina and immediate research progress will occur by retrieving and processing these samples; 3) two early career scientists have studies underway (begun during their Ph.D. thesis research) which will benefit greatly from this field program; 4) the redeployment of new monitors will be in place prior to the beginning of the next El Nino.</AbstractNarration>
