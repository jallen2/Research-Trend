    <AbstractNarration>In this project the Principal Investigators will develop methods to rapidly personalize the series of questions that are asked in an experiment or survey, adjusting new questions based on a respondent?s previous answers and the speed of their responses. The methods guarantee, mathematically, that the most informative question is being asked at each step. The software challenge is being able to recompute rapidly on a variety of computer platforms. We will also make software user-friendly and widely available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this research will enable scientists to figure out, faster and better, how people are different from each other in what they like and how they behave. Our method will enable creation of short surveys that yield more insight. The method will specifically be used to find out how much risk people accept, how patient they are toward future costs and benefits, and how much they like to cooperate and compete with other people. These methods can help consumers and companies figure out what kind of investments they should make, and help match workers with jobs that are ideal for them.</AbstractNarration>
