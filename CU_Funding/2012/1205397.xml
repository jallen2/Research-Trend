    <AbstractNarration>This work is focused on developing our understanding of strong field molecular ionization by using pulse shaping, velocity map imaging detection of molecular fragment ions and close collaboration with theory. Our research program draws upon our previous NSF funded work on strong field coherent control, and is composed of three main thrusts. First is the study of electron wave packets generated via strong field ionization. Strong field ionization in an intense ultrafast laser pulse can result in the population of multiple ionic states and the generation of attosecond electron dynamics. We are interested in characterizing which ionic states are populated and how this depends on laser pulse parameters. The study of molecular ionization from electronically excited molecules comprises our second thrust area. By studying ionization from electronically excited states, we can investigate the validity of Dyson overlap projections for strong field ionization and deepen our understanding of electron correlation in molecules. Our third area is following neutral excited state relaxation via strong field ionization and velocity map imaging. Strong field ionization has many advantages as a probe of excited state molecular dynamics, providing insight into dissociation and internal conversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program continually seeks to integrate teaching and research while impacting a large range of participants. People involved in the research include undergraduate students (visiting students through the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program as well as students at Stony Brook University), local high school teachers (through the NSF Research Experience for Teachers program), graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and visiting scholars (through the NSF ROA program). The work is inherently multi-disciplinary, and encourages students to develop knowledge and interests at the boundary between physics and chemistry. It also provides excellent technical and scientific training in the enabling ares of optics, ultrafast laser technology, vacuum hardware, data acquisition hardware and computer programming.</AbstractNarration>
