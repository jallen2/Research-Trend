    <AbstractNarration>This is a RAPID project to complete the high resolution scanning of a juvenile orca skeleton for inclusion in the Virtual Zooarchaeology of the Arctic Project collection (VZAP), a project that is currently supported by the Arctic Social Sciences Program. VZAP is a "virtual, interactive, osteological reference collection for the study of northern vertebrates." As the PI explains, full orca skeletons are very rare and this is a unique opportunity to add a juvenile skeleton to the VZAP collection. The reason for the RAPID is that the Sitka Sound Science Center, the institutions who owns the skeleton, is currently in the process of rearticulating the orca skeleton to put on display in their museum. In order to scan the skeleton it must be disarticulated and because the Center is doing this as a community project they cannot wait before continuing the articulation project, which will take place March 17th-24th,the week of March 11th offers the last opportunity to scan these bones.</AbstractNarration>
