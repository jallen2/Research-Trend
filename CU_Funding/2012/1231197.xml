    <AbstractNarration>Soybean is one of the world's staple foods and it is the second most cultivated crop in the Unites States. The 14th Biennial Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Soybean Conference, to be held August 12-15, 2012 in Des Moines (IA), will present recent advances in the basic understanding of this crop at the sub-organismal level, and will highlight cutting-edge technologies in soybean genomics. The recent release of the soybean genome sequence and related genomics tools will help improve the understanding of complex genetic traits important for soybean improvement. This meeting attracts a wide range of soybean researchers including molecular geneticists, breeders, physiologists, and pathologists. Funding provided by NSF will broaden participation by defraying the costs of participation for students and postdoctoral associates with specific emphasis on women and underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
