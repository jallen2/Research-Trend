    <AbstractNarration>The tenth annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be held March 31-April 1, 2012, at Indiana University, Bloomington. The conference will involves more than 100 graduate students of all levels from all over the country. The conference will consist of 24 graduate student 30 minute talks on expository and original research topics in geometry/topology; two plenary speakers who are both prominent in their respective fields and excellent expositors: Jacob Lurie (Harvard University) in algebraic topology and Andras Stipsicz (Princeton University) in geometric topology; four invited young faculty speakers: Andrew Blumberg (University of Texas, Austin), Julia Elisenda Grigsby (Boston College), Adam Simon Levine (Brandeis University), and Angelica Osorno (University of Chicago). The topic of this conference is broad: topology and geometry. There will be talks in many of the following subfields: hyperbolic geometry, three-manifolds, homotopy theory, symplectic geometry, dynamics, knot theory, cobordism theory, category theory, Teichmuller theory, four-manifolds, differential topology, geometric group theory, algebraic K-theory, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference provides a venue for communication among young mathematicians from different geographic regions. Participants come from dozens of different schools, and include graduate students at all years of study. Although there are many conferences dedicated to topology and geometry, this one is uniquely dedicated to graduate students. The experience of presenting at this conference allows graduate students to refine their speaking skills and grow into more effective communicators. Because of the opportunity to meet other students in related fields, the environment also encourages collaboration now and throughout the participants' careers. Both geometry and topology are growing mathematical fields with deep connections to many other areas of research, such as dynamical systems, physics, computer science, and mathematical biology. This conference serves to further research and communication about research in these areas, and to enable and encourage graduate students in these fields.
