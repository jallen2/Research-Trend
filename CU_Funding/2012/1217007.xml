    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology's outreach initiative named Hands-on Outreach to Promote Engagement in Science (HOPES) will promote and facilitate the establishment of partnerships between biochemistry and molecular biology faculty and science teachers from K-12 schools. The HOPES project will provide support for the creation and implementation of hands-on science learning activities. The workshop participants will be provided with the opportunity to meet potential collaborators and apply for funding that will support the purchase of materials for use in the K-12 classrooms. The workshop will be summarized into three parts, with each one having a specific goal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;HOPES initiative began in 2011 and resulted in 44 proposals of new or developing partnerships between college/university faculty and K-12 teachers. In addition, the workshops have the potential to impact science learning for many students who may not have the opportunity to experience quality instruction and experiences in STEM fields. The workshop's target audience is K-12 science classrooms with a high percentage of underrepresented minority students. The activities that develop from these workshops and seed grants will have a significant impact on science interest of students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
