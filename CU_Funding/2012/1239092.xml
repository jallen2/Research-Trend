    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;#1239092&lt;br/&gt;Maynard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to provide participant travel support for a workshop to initiate the development and implementation of minimum nanomaterial characterization reporting requirements within regulatory and development communities. The workshop is part of a project (NanoCharacter)developed and led by the Center for Risk Science Innovation and Application (RSIA) at the&lt;br/&gt;International Life sciences Institute (ILSI) Research Foundation. Despite increasing research on the environmental and health impacts of engineered nanomaterials, progress in ensuring the safety of emerging materials and products remains limited by poor&lt;br/&gt;material characterization in published studies and minimal adoption of characterization standards and guidelines within the research community. The NanoCharacter project is developing a framework and roadmap detailing what needs to be done to improve the quality and utility of nanomaterial impact research through encouraging the adoption of characterization consistency within particular&lt;br/&gt;study domains; building consensus on the roadmap internationally, across stovepipes, and across stakeholders, and establishing a multi-stakeholder panel to monitor and report out the implementation of the roadmap and to adapt the roadmap as necessary to facilitate adoption of consistent characterization and reporting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned workshop will be held between August and October 2012 at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, NC (the precise dates are dependent on facility and participant availability). It will provide the NanoCharacter project?s Steering Committee and Expert Panel with a forum to engage with leaders from academia, government and regulatory agencies, standard setting bodies and editors of the key publishing houses in order to solicit and consider input from those who are most likely to affect the successful implementation of any such framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outputs of the workshop will include a framework and roadmap for developing and implementing minimum nanomaterial characterization reporting requirements. This will be a standalone document for publication and will be developed by project teams over the subsequent months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed activity: Rigorous, reproducible research into nanomaterial-biological&lt;br/&gt;interactions is critically dependent on relevant and consistent materials physicochemical characterization. Likewise, the value of a growing body of research in this area depends on accepted characterization approaches and procedures. The proposed activity will strengthen significantly the quality and value of research undertaken in this domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity: Sustainable and responsible commercialization of products that utilize engineered nanomaterials depends on sound risk evaluation. This activity will further strengthen the basis for such evaluations, nationally and internationally.</AbstractNarration>
