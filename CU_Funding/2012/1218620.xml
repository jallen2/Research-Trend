    <AbstractNarration>In some combinatorial optimization problems, the resulting solution&lt;br/&gt;may violate some constraints provided the cost of finding the solution&lt;br/&gt;is significantly reduced. Such problems are called soft constraints&lt;br/&gt;problems. In hard constraints problems, an acceptable solution cannot&lt;br/&gt;violate any of the constraints. Hard constraints versions of many&lt;br/&gt;problems have resisted satisfactory solutions as compared to the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding problems with soft constraints. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to study combinatorial optimization problems with hard&lt;br/&gt;capacity constraints. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will be focusing on hard capacity versions of network design&lt;br/&gt;and facility location problems. These problems have applications in&lt;br/&gt;networking and resource allocation and are among the central problems&lt;br/&gt;in combinatorial optimization. As it has happened often in the past,&lt;br/&gt;the PIs believe that techniques developed for solving these problems&lt;br/&gt;will have broader impact in solving other combinatorial problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training and fostering undergraduate as well as high school students&lt;br/&gt;is a major emphasis of the broader impact of the proposed project.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs' prior work with undergraduates have led to very good career&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for many of them. The PIs will continue working with&lt;br/&gt;students at Rutgers-Camden, fostering their raw talent and helping&lt;br/&gt;them discover their own potential. The PIs will also continue working&lt;br/&gt;with high school students, giving them exposure to theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science and working on research with some of them.</AbstractNarration>
