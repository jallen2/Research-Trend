    <AbstractNarration>This research project is to study and improve the sustainability performance of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) through a hierarchical systems approach. ALD is a key enabling nanotechnology that has been adopted in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Currently ALD is under rapid development for a broad array of industrial applications including solar cells, fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, medical devices, sensors, etc. However, ALD has significant sustainability issues due to its heavy use of toxic chemicals, potential generation of nano-particle emissions, and intensive use of energy. The goal of this project is to research mathematical models and analytical tools for reducing the environmental impact and economic costs of ALD nano-manufacturing for industrial-scale applications. This project will be carried out in a systematic manner that integrates both mathematical modeling and experimental investigations. Specific research goals of this project are: (1) mathematical modeling and experimental investigations of ALD process emissions (2) thermodynamic flows and energy modeling of ALD nano-manufacturing system (3) sustainable scale-up of ALD nanotechnology for industrial productions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the models and results developed in this study will allow ALD and associated industries to address the long-term environmental and societal implications of ALD nanotechnology. The models and results can also be used in sustainable management and improvement of similar bottom-up nanotechnologies. The research results of this project will be broadly disseminated through academic journals, professional conferences, and internet media. As a result, this research will improve our understanding of the potential environmental impacts of ALD nano-manufacturing and assist in development of a sustainable infrastructure for ALD productions in various industrial sectors.</AbstractNarration>
