    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Patricia Clayton of University of Washington to conduct a research project, entitled "Steel walls for reducing building damage during earthquakes," during the summer of 2012 at the National Center for Research in Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientist is Dr. K.C. Tsai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is experimental testing of an innovative steel wall structural system that is designed to recenter itself following an earthquake and remain essentially damage-free, thus greatly reducing the repair costs and downtime in buildings. This research is the first full-scale test of this new wall concept and promises to verify its capability of achieving this improved seismic performance. The experiments consist of subjecting the wall to forces and displacements that a building would experience during different levels of earthquake intensity and recording how the wall responds to these demands. r This research may also result in the development of structural design concepts that can greatly reduce the economic and social impact of earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
