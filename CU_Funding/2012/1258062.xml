    <AbstractNarration>Animal migration is perhaps the most spectacular ecological phenomenon on Earth. Be it tiny Arctic terns navigating annually between the poles, or millions of wildebeest doggedly traversing the Serengeti plains of Africa, migration captures the imagination of people like few other biological events. Yet despite its ecological importance and cultural significance, the science of migration remains poorly understood. Even basic questions about why, when, where, who and how animals migrate are largely unanswered. Why, for example, would a 600 pound giant tortoise -- a large reptile that can easily survive for a year or more without food or water -- migrate seasonally up and down the lava strewn volcanic slopes of the Galapagos Islands? Why is it that only adults migrate? And why do tortoises on some islands barely move at all? Giant tortoises represent a tractable "model" for understanding animal migration because many distinct species have evolved under very different environmental conditions within a small geographical area. In this project, a suite of research methods, including GPS telemetry of both young and adults will be used to track Galapagos tortoise movements. Tortoise health, including exposure to infectious diseases, parasite infection and stress levels, will be studied through blood and dung samples, while traditional field work will measure reproductive success of migratory versus non-migratory individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will answer some of the fundamental questions underpinning movement ecology in all animals, not just giant tortoises. In a world that is rapidly changing due to human activities, understanding animal migration is key to predicting which animals will be most affected and devising management plans for them. Because migratory animals can be important vectors of diseases that impact humans and agriculture, the significance of this work extends beyond wildlife. Finally, all results will be packaged into an exciting outreach program with the aim of inspiring and educating children in both Galapagos and the USA toward a stronger appreciation of ecological sciences and strategies of conservation.</AbstractNarration>
