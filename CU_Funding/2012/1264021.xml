    <AbstractNarration>Polyglutamine (or polyQ), a polymer consisting of glutamine repeat units, has been implicated in as many as&lt;br/&gt;nine neurodegenerative illnesses, including Huntington's disease (HD). An intriguing feature of the so-called&lt;br/&gt;expanded-polyQ-track diseases is that they only become manifest when the corresponding polyQ chains&lt;br/&gt;exceed a certain critical length. Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the onset of expandedpolyQ&lt;br/&gt;diseases. One hypothesis posits that, beyond a critical length, a polyQ molecule can adopt a folded&lt;br/&gt;structure that serves as a nucleus for the subsequent polymerization of additional molecules, thereby forming a&lt;br/&gt;fibril. A more recent, alternative view proposes that several polyQ molecules can form a disordered aggregate&lt;br/&gt;that, over time, gradually converts into a protofibril rich in ..-helical content.&lt;br/&gt; In this work, the PIs propose to use atomistic models of polyQ in aqueous solution to determine the &lt;br/&gt;structure of the nucleus and early aggregates, and to identify the molecular pathways through&lt;br/&gt;which they form. More importantly, the PIs also propose to compare the results of simulations to 2-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;infrared (2D IR) spectroscopic measurements. To that end, the PIs will develop advanced simulation methods that&lt;br/&gt;will enable a thorough exploration of phase-space, as well as the pathways connecting different metastable&lt;br/&gt;conformational states, and they will develop tools that will permit prediction of 2D IR spectra directly from the&lt;br/&gt;results of atomistic simulations. By engaging in a synergistic cycle of prediction and experimentation, they will&lt;br/&gt;arrive at a fundamental understanding of early-stage polyQ aggregation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Theoretical and computational studies of the folding and aggregation of large PolyQ&lt;br/&gt;molecules in explicit water have been scarce. Studies of that nature, however, would provide much needed&lt;br/&gt;insights into the genesis of a number of diseases. The research proposed will examine at an unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;level of detail the ensembles of folded states adopted by polyQ, and will help determine how such states are&lt;br/&gt;interconnected in the formation of small aggregates. The existence of such states and their dynamics will be&lt;br/&gt;assessed directly through 2D IR measurements, which will be interpreted in terms of the molecular models&lt;br/&gt;proposed in this work. The knowledge gained through this effort will not only provide insights into the onset of&lt;br/&gt;HD, but will also yield important clues about the process of amyloid fibril formation by oligopeptides in&lt;br/&gt;general. The computational challenges associated with our proposed research are staggering. A promising&lt;br/&gt;array of novel molecular modeling methods will be developed to meet those challenges. Such methods will&lt;br/&gt;advance the state of the art in molecular simulation and will find applications in systems ranging from&lt;br/&gt;biomolecules to complex fluids. The PIs anticipate that the combined 2D IR-computational approach to be&lt;br/&gt;developed in this work will grow into a widely used technique for characterization of biomolecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Huntington's disease currently afflicts 1 in 10,000 individuals. The toxic species are the&lt;br/&gt;small PolyQ aggregates of interest to this work; understanding the molecular origins of PolyQ folding and&lt;br/&gt;aggregation could provide new insights for development of therapeutic strategies. Beyond the beneficial&lt;br/&gt;impact to society that would come with that understanding, the research proposed here offers a particularly&lt;br/&gt;relevant context in which to engage high-school children in science. The PIs propose to capitalize on that&lt;br/&gt;opportunity by developing a workshop on protein aggregation and neurodegenerative disorders aimed at high&lt;br/&gt;school students from under-represented minority backgrounds. By taking advantage of the computer expertise&lt;br/&gt;of students involved in our proposed research, they will also propose to develop a strategy aimed at introducing&lt;br/&gt;middle-school and high-school students to computer programming early in their careers.</AbstractNarration>
