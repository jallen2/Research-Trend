    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12- 29236 Collaborative Proposal #: 12-29250&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Valavanis, Kimon P.; Gao,David Wenzhong; Mahoor,Mohammad;Rutherford,Matthew J;Yi,Yun-Bo and Collab PI(s): Boussalis, Helen R.;Guillaume, Darrell; Wu, Chivey&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Denver and Collab Institution: California State-LA University&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI: Collaborative: Dev. of an Integrated, Intelligent, Autonomous, Unmanned, Mobile Sensor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development of an integrated, intelligent, autonomous unmanned mobile sensor will enable research into the foundations of the next generation of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The objective of this proposal is to develop an unmanned helicopter (about 150 kg weight) along with a mobile landing platform for refueling purposes. The aircraft would be able to operate with both electric and fuel. The instrument will be composed of two tightly coupled components, a&lt;br/&gt;(i) Novel light-weight unmanned helicopter (&lt;150 Kg), and,&lt;br/&gt;(ii) General purpose landing platform that will also serve as a refueling/recharging station and data relay/repository. &lt;br/&gt;This composition of the instrument is expected to pave the way for the next generation of multi-purpose/cost-effective UAS into civilian and public domain applications. The proposed integrated two component instrument development is not considered as an extension of existing technology. It will enable heterogeneous networked unmanned systems operating in unison in traditional/extreme environment. The following specific research projects will be enabled through the instrument: &lt;br/&gt;- Fault-Tolerant and Emergency Landing Navigation and Control Systems&lt;br/&gt;- RADAR-based Sense-and-Avoid System&lt;br/&gt;- Prognosis and Structural Health Monitoring of UAVs&lt;br/&gt;- Networked Unmanned Systems (NUS)&lt;br/&gt;- Integration: Software Reliability and Security&lt;br/&gt;- Unmanned Helicopters for Civilian/Public and Industrial Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Denver (DU) and California State University Los Angeles (CalStU-LA), a predominantly minority-serving institution, collaborate in the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact should be felt both regionally and nationally. At the national level, the instrument should initiate transformative advances in the computational algorithms proposed. The results will be made available to the broader research community in the form of open-source codes. Simulations made possible by these algorithms will have broad national and societal impact ranging from climate change scenarios to wind power generation to plant biotechnology and improved animal breeding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the institutional and regional levels, DU faculty/students will collaborate with CalStU-LA faculty/students to enhance the ethnic and gender diversity of the student population, especially recruiting minority students. Project goal include increasing the educational/training opportunities for underrepresented students, and the number of graduates in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
