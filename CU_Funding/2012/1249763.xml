    <AbstractNarration>This projects supports hosting the three day fifteenth edition of the GENI Engineering conference, including organizing and hosting the demo session to be held on the University of Houston campus. The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual laboratory that is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale' experiments in future internets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GENI Project Office organizes three major GENI Engineering conferences (GEC) per year, in which the entire GENI community meets to review current status, and to decide on subsequent steps in GENI's evolution. These GECs include community-based working groups leading GENI's design and planning, and demonstrating progress with live experiments. About 300 leading researchers and Ph.D. students from diverse US institutions will gather in Houston to showcase their ideas and results. In the demo session each demo will be provided with a wired connection to the GENI infrastructure. Additionally, wireless connectivity will be available for demonstrations and participants. The 3-day conference will be held at a local conference-oriented hotel, with organizational oversight by an experienced UH event coordinator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who amongst their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research. This proposal supports the development and use of the research instrument.</AbstractNarration>
