    <AbstractNarration>"Using the Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Mathematics to Study Crime" is an interdisciplinary REU program that brings together faculty from three programs (Criminal Justice, Forensic Science, and Computer Forensics) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). This eight-week summer program combines the strengths of these distinctive, yet interrelated, programs into a synergistic relationship. Students work with faculty in one of three research tracks: 1) Criminal Justice, 2) Forensic Science, or 3) Digital Forensics. This collaborative venture benefits REU student participants, faculty mentors, two academic departments, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Center for Information Assurance and Joint Forensics Research, the university research infrastructure, and the scientific community via intellectual merit and broader impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This REU program addresses emerging issues of crime and criminal investigation by uniting a traditional Social Science discipline (Criminal Justice) with two STEM disciplines (Forensic Science and Computer and Information Science). Our program provides a much-needed opportunity for undergraduate students to conduct interdisciplinary research on a pressing social problem. The overall objective of this program is to involve a diverse group of undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research that prepare them for a wide range of post-graduate programs in Criminal Justice/Criminology, Sociology, Biology, Chemistry, Forensic Science, Computer Science, and Computer Forensics. This REU program broadens the research participation of underrepresented groups and students from colleges and universities where research opportunities in STEM are limited through targeted recruitment and mentoring. UAB is one of the most ethnically diverse universities in the Southeastern region of the United States and is surrounded by a large number of universities with similar levels of diversity, as well as many Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The research infrastructure and personnel are in place at UAB to deliver a strong interdisciplinary research program targeted to a diverse group of undergraduate students from across the nation. In addition to learning scientific content and participating in real research projects, students also learn about the interdisciplinary nature of scientific inquiry, research ethics, post-graduate options, and professional and career development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Numerous broad impacts are realized for students involved in this interdisciplinary REU Site. REU participants and faculty mentors gain a greater awareness of, and appreciation for, the contributions of many disciplines to research challenges. The cohort-based nature of the program allow students to develop long-term collaborative relationships with faculty and students from multiple disciplines. The outcomes of this interdisciplinary program include: 1) State-of-the-art research experiences that motivate students to pursue graduate degrees in Social Science and STEM disciplines, 2) Broadened participation of underrepresented groups and students from colleges and universities where research opportunities in STEM are limited in research on crime, 3) Increased understanding of how Social Science and STEM disciplines converge to address pressing social problems, 4) A sense of community among REU students and faculty, 5) An understanding of ethical issues faced by researchers in Social Science and STEM disciplines, and 6) Enhanced collaboration between the Department of Justice Sciences (including Criminal Justice, Forensic Science, and Legal Studies programs) and the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at UAB (including Computer Forensics and Digital Security programs).</AbstractNarration>
