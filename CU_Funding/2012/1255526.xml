    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: Ultracold molecular ions prepared via sympathetic cooling : a new frontier for quantum interactions and fundamental physics&lt;br/&gt;Eric R. Hudson, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports the development of techniques to open and explore a new frontier in physics: ultracold polar molecular ions. Recent work has shown that by spatially overlapping a cloud of ultracold calcium atoms with a molecular ion trap, it is now possible to produce samples of cooled polar molecular ions. It is expected that samples such as these will lead to significant technological and fundamental advancements, including the study and possible control of chemistry in the quantum regime, the implementation of a scalable quantum computer, new probes of quantum matter and charge transport, understanding the formation of interstellar clouds, and precision measurement of molecular structure for test of fundamental physics. Thus, the main research objective and intellectual merit of this project is to further optimize the methods of cold polar molecular production and begin developing the techniques necessary to enable the expected technological and fundamental advancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In concert with this research effort, this CAREER award also supports an effort to increase the broader impact of the work by partnering with the UCLA Graduate School of Education's Center X Science Project to develop a series of inquiry-based, hands-on experiments to help local K-12 schools meet the Science Content Standards for California Public Schools. Center X partners with well over 100 local schools, helping them to improve their curriculum and teaching strategies, but currently needs help in developing relevant, inquiry-based physics experiments. Since research shows that when coursework is coupled with hands-on experience, students learn more effectively, retain knowledge longer, and develop higher-order skills with the added benefit of reaching a diversity of students, this lack of curriculum must be addressed. To combat this deficiency, work under this CAREER award will develop a hands-on laboratory curriculum for high schools students closely tied to the research performed in our laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
