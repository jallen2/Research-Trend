    <AbstractNarration>The Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF) 12th Annual Global LambdaGrid Workshop is being held in Chicago, October 11-12, 2012, collocated with the 8th IEEE International e-Science Conference, the Open Grid Forum, and the Microsoft e-Science Workshop. The GLIF organization's annual workshop provides an international forum for Research &amp; Education network managers and engineers, computer scientists and discipline scientists who are involved in the design, development and use of advanced optical networks to meet, discuss, develop and demonstrate innovative solutions to complex societal problems. These optical networks are the underpinnings of an evolving global high-performance computing and communications ecosystem, and provide the "big pipes" that enable scientists to access complex collections of digital "big data" in timely fashion so that they can extract knowledge and insight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global networking is a vital component of global cyberinfrastructure, and it is the GLIF community that focuses on how to optimally design and develop on-demand LambdaGrids of interconnected distributed computing, sensor and instrument resources to best enable data-intensive science, thus representing intellectual merit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLIF 2012 presents an opportunity to better architect how high-performance networks, or "big pipes", can best enable access to "big data" in order to provide scientists with timely information for analysis and ultimately knowledge. Nascent work in these areas is already impacting scientific disciplines, from bioinformatics to metagenomics to geosciences, and it is the general public that will ultimately benefit.</AbstractNarration>
