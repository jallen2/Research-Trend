    <AbstractNarration>Summary: The objective of this research is to demonstrate a new flexible form of silicon photonics integrated on plastic substrates, using a bond-and-transfer method. The new silicon-on-plastic photonics combines the high performance of silicon devices and the flexibility of plastic materials. The thin film format and its mechanical compliance will enable this unconventional form of photonic devices to be mechanically tunable and to be applied as optomechanical sensors. Furthermore, the plastic substrate provides a versatile platform for heterogeneous integration of passive silicon devices with active, non-silicon devices &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Despite extensive research in flexible electronics, flexible form of integrated photonics has not been widely explored. The proposed research will demonstrate highly integrated silicon photonic devices on plastic substrates with unprecedented flexibility, tunability and compatibility. Integration of flexible photonics with microelectronics will yield a multifunctional optoelectronic system in a soft format, leading to transformative advances in areas ranging from optical communication to fundamental metrology and mechanical measurement.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project will impact industry and the scientific community by providing a new class of optical sensors that is flexible and conformal. The education and outreach activities will encourage high-schools students to pursue a career in science and engineering and recruit minority students to participate in research. In collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota, a series of experimental demonstrations of optical science (named ?The Light Fantastic?) will be presented during the Nanodays events to foster public awareness, engagement and understanding of nanoscale science, engineering and technology.</AbstractNarration>
