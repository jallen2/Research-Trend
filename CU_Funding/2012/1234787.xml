    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate the dynamics and control of hummingbird flight. Two species of hummingbirds of different sizes and two species of insect (hawkmoth and wasps) will be used, and an integrative approach based on animal experiments, mathematical modeling, theoretical analysis, and engineering experiments will be performed. The goal of this work is to provide a general theory for animal flight maneuverability, stability and control through a series of targeted experiments. This research will directly contribute to the development of new, improved models of flight mechanics, and it will substantially advance our understanding of one of the major forms of animal locomotion. Ultimately this scientific basis will not only advance the theory of animal flight but also provide design guidelines for bio-inspired engineering systems with superior stability and maneuverability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will enhance the infrastructure for research and education through interdisciplinary research in biology and engineering. The research results will be disseminated broadly to the biology, physics, and engineering research communities. The theories developed in this work can potentially be translated into other forms of locomotion. Advances in high performance flapping wing micro aerial vehicles can be used in civilian and defense applications such as search and rescue in collapsed buildings, or indoor surveillance such as in crowded airports. Building upon their historically-successful outreach activities including various television, film, radio, web-based and newspaper reports, the PIs will continue on their active outreach effort with the goal of engaging general public, pre-college students, K-12 students in scientific research and generating scientific excitement and awareness through various public activities and events.&lt;br/&gt;Abstract</AbstractNarration>
