    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to address the problem of distributed finite-time containment control for Lagrangian networks. Despite the fact that each topic of containment control, finite-time control of networked systems, and control of Lagrangian networks is crucial for networked multi-agent systems, there are few existing results on each topic not to mention a combination of the three due to numerous inherent challenges. This research addresses a combination of the three topics in a unified framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed algorithms will be designed to guarantee finite-time containment control for Lagrangian networks with stationary leaders, dynamic leaders, and swarming behavior and will be experimentally validated on heterogeneous robotic networks. The novelty of the research lies in the paradigm changes i) from leaderless or single leader behaviors dominantly studied in multi-agent systems to more realistic but complicated multi-leader multi-follower behaviors involving multi-layer collaboration between multiple heterogeneous teams of agents, ii) from distributed algorithms that can only guarantee asymptotic or at most exponential convergence in infinite time dominantly explored in multi-agent systems to distributed algorithms that are guaranteed to converge in finite time to meet the needs of many time-critical missions, and iii) from simplified/idealized linear point models dominantly adopted in multi-agent systems to more realistic and prevalent nonlinear Lagrangian models that represent a large class of mechanical systems including autonomous vehicles and robotic manipulators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has impact on numerous civilian, homeland security, and military applications and on other fields related to networked systems including biology, sociology, and physics. A capstone course on autonomous systems will be developed with emphasis on hands-on labs and campus-wide robotics competitions. Outreach activities to high school students will be pursued through involvement in a state-wide engineering program in Utah, Engineering State. Broad dissemination of the research results will be accomplished through publications, tutorial workshops, a summer school, and a dedicated website.</AbstractNarration>
