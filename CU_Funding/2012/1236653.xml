    <AbstractNarration>1236653&lt;br/&gt;Pennell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite rapid advances in nanotechnologies over the past decade, our current understanding of nanomaterial fate and transport in the environment remains limited. Recent studies have demonstrated that new approaches are needed to accurately predict the transport and retention of nanomaterials in soils and aquifers. In addition, nanomaterial mobility is known to depend upon surface coating properties and the presence of stabilizing agents, such as surfactants and organic matter. Although most commercially-available nanomaterials are produced with surface coatings, very little information is available regarding their longevity and impact on nanomaterial fate over time. To address these gaps in our current understanding of nanomaterials, the project combines laboratory experiments with mathematical modeling to quantify and predict the effects of surface coating aging on the fate and transport of several representative engineered nanomaterials (iron and manganese oxides) in sands and natural soils. The research is structured around three tasks; (1) determination of nanoparticle deposition and release rates as a function of surface coating properties using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), (2) measurement of nanoparticle transport and attachment in soil columns and aquifer cells, and (3) development and validation of mathematical models to predict the effects of surface coating properties and aging on nanoparticle mobility and persistence in soils and aquifer materials. Novel aspects of the research include the assessment of nanoparticle deposition rates, utilization of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and light transmission (LT) analysis to visualize nanoparticle mobility, and the integration of experimental and mathematical modeling to assess nanomaterial fate in the environment. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in three areas critical to the pursuit of environmentally sound and sustainable nanotechnologies; (1) development of methods to convert nanoparticle deposition measurements into attachment rate parameters that can be used to predict transport behavior, (b) measurement of the effects of surface coating aging on nanoparticle stability, aggregation, and mobility, and (c) development and validation of numerical simulators capable of predicting the environmental fate of nanomaterials as a function of changes in surface coating integrity. The unique coupling of experimental studies with mathematical modeling allows for careful evaluation of methods that can be used to rapidly estimate nanoparticle attachment parameters for a range of surface and solution conditions, and will culminate in the development of numerical models that are able to predict the effects of surface coating integrity and composition on nanomaterial fate and transport. We anticipate that the experimental parameters and mathematical models developed in this work can be utilized to predict the fate and transport of other nanomaterials in subsurface systems, and will serve as an important component for nanomaterial life cycle analysis. In addition, the knowledge gained in these studies will improve our understanding of filtration technologies used to treat drinking and waste waters containing nanoparticles. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: An important component of the project is the incorporation of education initiatives into the research and instructional activities of the investigators, with the goal of extending the impact of acquired knowledge beyond the traditional framework of journal publications and conference presentations. This goal will be achieved through the following activities: (a) inclusion of undergraduate students in coupled experimental and mathematical modeling research, (b) development of interactive, multi-media instructional tools, and (c) recruitment of female and under-represented minority students. The instructional materials, consisting of model-based tutorials, videos prepared by undergraduate and graduate students, and illustrative case studies and modeling tools, will be incorporated into freshmen and sophomore-level courses and released on a web site so that a broader audience of students can explore processes that govern the fate and transport of pristine and aged nanomaterials in terrestrial environments.</AbstractNarration>
