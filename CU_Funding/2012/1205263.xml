    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this planning grant proposal is to achieve the following objectives (1) complete two archival data manuscript projects- the first on Black women?s lives and roles in the history of science generally and their leadership at HBCUs in particular and the second on gender differences in achievement motivation and identity of Black adolescents in an HBCU middle school of mathematics and science; and (2) solidify formal collaborative partnership memorandum of understanding with universities and colleges, industry, a professional school, industry, and a national laboratory. The proposal adopts a behavioral science theoretical model to engage in activities that will fill significant gaps in the scholarship of the intersections of race, gender, and STEM workforce development and education. In addition, it also proposes to provide a firm foundation for the formulation of future competitive grant proposals and philanthropic giving for this institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the project's short term broad impacts, it proposes to establish formal collaborative partnerships to engage diverse institution types with complementary strengths and proven track records of leading the nation in broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. Moreover, it proposes to produce and broadly disseminate scholarship that can inform future theory, method, and practice in secondaryandhighereducationactionresearch. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this project will be disseminated broadly both nationally and internationally through the professional societies and networks of the research team, as well as through the Howard University Office of Communications. The global competitiveness of the nation and its ability to reestablish itself as a world leader in scientific and technological education and innovation requires significant federal, corporate, private, and institutional investment in the scholarship and professional development of female innovators (Tchen &amp; Jarret, 2011). The sustained engagement of behavioral scientists is an important but typically overlooked national strategy for STEM human talent development.</AbstractNarration>
