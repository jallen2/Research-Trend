    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The "Progress and Challenges in Crystal Growth Design and Characterization Symposium" at the 2012 fall National American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia PA, partly funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program, will bring together scientists from the fields of inorganic chemistry, solid-state chemistry, condensed matter physics and electrical engineering to examine important topics of research. Discovery of new crystalline materials and the growth of high-quality single crystals have potential impact on many sectors, including energy production, energy storage, national security and information technology. However, the National Research Council of the National Academies, Committee for the Assessment of and Outlook for New Materials Synthesis and Crystal Growth, have identified crystal growth and discovery of new materials as areas where the United States is rapidly losing its footing. The committee also pointed out that the United States can only excel in this area if there is a critical mass of young scientists who have the interdisciplinary knowledge and training necessary to succeed in this field of research. Yet they also discovered that there is a marked decline in educational and training opportunities in this country in the areas of crystal growth and preparation of new materials, while these opportunities are increasing in other parts of the world, for example Europe and Asia. This symposium helps to call attention to this problem and also to meet this need by serving to educate young researchers on the research activities of others in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will provide younger scientists, including undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows the opportunity to present their work in crystal growth and new materials synthesis. It will also allow younger scientists a chance to interact with established researchers in the field. Gathering people with different approaches to similar research problems will spark collaboration and the sharing of ideas. Approximately 35% of the invited speakers are from primarily undergraduate institutions and about 40% of the invited speakers are women. Faculty at all levels (assistant, associate and full professor) will participate in the symposium, as well as individuals from industry and national laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
