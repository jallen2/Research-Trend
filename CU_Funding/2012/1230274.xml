    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive radio systems offer the opportunity to use dynamic spectrum management techniques to adapt to immediate local spectrum availability over huge swaths of spectrum when the primary users are not present. The objective of this research is to develop a unique wideband silicon-based spectrum sensing receiver for cognitive radios. With respect to intellectual merit, the proposed receiver enables spectrum sensing over multi-octave radio/microwave frequency range without the need for any complex tunable image-reject filter and a broadband frequency synthesizer to drastically reduce the power consumption and the complexity of the receiver. The realization of this receiver is possible by two-step down conversion and employing a narrowband frequency synthesizer, an integer frequency divider and switchable harmonic mixers in the front-end architecture. Given the wide variations in signal bandwidth and formats that must be reliably sensed, a type of programmable energy detection method is employed to further relax challenging requirements for cognitive radio front-ends.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, simple implementation, miniaturization and low power consumption of wideband spectrum sensing receivers are essential features for cognitive radios operating in a battery-powered environment for applications including man-portable military radios, avionics, electronic warfare, eavesdropping, surveillance and commercial wireless mobile systems. The results of the project will advance microwave integrated circuits and wireless communication fields. The proposed project allows talented students to train in microwave integrated circuits and wireless communications through a variety of research, and educational/outreach activities. Educational opportunities for under-represented groups will be explored by (1) attending annual Electrical and Computer Engineering?Unplugged program and Society of Women Engineers summer camp to inspire high school and women students to join the engineering program, and (2) collaborating with Enrichment Experience Engineering program at Texas A&amp;M University to provide workshops for minority high school teachers in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
