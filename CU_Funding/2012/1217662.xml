    <AbstractNarration>As high-performance processor chips continue to integrate more components such as general-purpose cores or special accelerator units, increasing demand for a communication substrate with higher performance and better energy efficiency is evident. Unfortunately, continued device scaling has exacerbated the fundamental challenges facing on-chip metal wires, such as increased loss, delay, dispersion, and cross-talk. Alternatives to the conventional communication schemes are clearly imperative as technology progresses. Existing solutions for off-chip interconnection such as packet-switching networks and optics are finding their way into the on-chip environment. However, these solutions evolve under a different set of constraints and goals in the off-chip environment and are not automatically suitable in the on-chip environment. For instance, a packet-switched interconnect provides scalable throughput, but at significant communication latency and energy costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes a multidisciplinary approach and explores the design of latency-centric communication substrates based on novel wide-band, pulse-based communication mechanisms and architectural support that dovetails the circuits. Early evidence suggests there are significant potential benefits, including superior latency at sufficiently high throughput and extremely low energy costs. &lt;br/&gt;The success of this project can critically impact future microprocessor and other complex system-on-chip design methodology. This project also contributes to the training of students at the intersection of digital and analog circuit and architecture design ? an important area for the future of the technology industry.</AbstractNarration>
