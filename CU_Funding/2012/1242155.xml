    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate processes associated with the natural emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Of particular interest is the assessment of organic compounds derived from BVOC oxidation that are water-soluble, CCN-active and react readily with the OH radical in controlled laboratory experiments to create low-volatility products that may form secondary aerosol via multiphase organic chemistry. Continuous measurements of SOA chemical and physical properties will be made during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) to be conducted near Centreville Alabama in the summer of 2013. This study will focus on the role of particle phase liquid water and particle pH in determining SOA mass. The data will be analyzed to elucidate the linkages between bio- and anthropogenic emissions on multiphase chemistry, and estimate the magnitude of the contribution of multiphase pathways to SOA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is needed in order to improve understanding of local and global climate and air quality. The results may help explain whether the anomalous temperature trend in the Southeast, which has not warmed like other regions in response to global climate change, is due to interactions among biogenic and anthropogenic emissions that can affect regional climate through formation of secondary organic aerosol. During the field campaign, there will be many activities supporting science communication and education.</AbstractNarration>
