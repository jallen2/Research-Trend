    <AbstractNarration>This study harnesses the predictive power of numerical relativity simulations to investigate extreme astrophysical systems. The work is organized in three activities areas: 1) compact object binaries and a sandbox of simulation data, 2) massive black holes in astrophysical environments, and 3) compact object mergers in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The effort involves postdocs and students working in an interdisciplinary environment fostering interactions and collaborations with researchers in computing science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerical relativity has truly become a tool of discovery, enabling conversations between astrophysics and scientists from many areas focussed on the intricacies of analyzing interferometric detector data. This study is aimed at enhancing the impact numerical relativity is having on gravitational wave physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The work focuses on multi-scale/multi-physics problems where gravity displays its strongest grip, situations such as the collision of black holes in astrophysical environments for which the tools of numerical relativity provide the only avenue to gain new insights and to make observational predictions.</AbstractNarration>
