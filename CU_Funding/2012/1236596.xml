    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1236596 &lt;br/&gt;Zuo, Yi &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Environmental Health and Safety of Nanotechnology program supports work by Professor Yi Zuo to study the interaction mechanism between nanomaterials and pulmonary surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is a detergent-like phospholipid-protein mixture that covers the entire internal surface of the respiratory tract. It plays an important role in surface tension reduction and host defense. Inhaled nanomaterials must first interact with this surfactant film before contacting lung cells and translocating to other organs. Therefore, interactions between nanomaterials and pulmonary surfactant represent the initial bio-nano interaction in the lungs. However, the interaction mechanism is still largely unknown. The research goal of this proposal is to study biophysicochemical interactions between natural pulmonary surfactants and engineered nanomaterials, thus characterizing the potential adverse health effect of inhaled nanomaterials on the respiratory system. This work is important to the general public because it will provide new data that complement the current nanotoxicological knowledge obtained from cell culture and animal-models, thus advancing current understanding of nanosafety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:For the first time, the project team will systematically study biophysical and biochemical interactions between different nanomaterials (including carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoplatelets, and metal oxide nanoparticles) and pulmonary surfactants. This research will provide a novel insight into the interaction potential between surfactant phospholipids/proteins and carbon-based nanomaterials with unique aspect ratios/shapes. In addition, the project team will develop a novel in vitro model that mimics bio-nano interactions in the lungs, for studying the environmental, health and safety (EHS) impacts of airborne nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The interaction mechanism between nanomaterials and pulmonary surfactants has a translational value for nanomedicine-based pulmonary drug delivery and for pathophysiological study of respiratory diseases related to air pollution and particulate matters. Given the unique location of the University of Hawaii, the proposed work will promote participation of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and students from other underrepresented groups. The PI will develop new undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula with interdisciplinary components, and help enhance the infrastructure for research and education. With local and international collaborations, the PI will disseminate the research to increase public awareness of nanotechnology and its potential EHS impacts.</AbstractNarration>
