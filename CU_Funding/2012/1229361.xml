    <AbstractNarration>A high throughput (HTP) sequencing system will be acquired by the University of New Hampshire (UNH) to enable Northern New England research groups using genome-enabled technologies to explore basic questions in ecology, evolution, and biodiversity. This research will catalyze the generation of new interdisciplinary knowledge of fundamental biological processes and advance the role of genomics and bioinformatics across traditional biological disciplines. The instrument, an Illumina HiSeq 2500, is both fast and flexible, suited to a large array of applications. It will support the research and training programs of 16 existing laboratories at UNH, four new UNH Assistant Professors, and 8 research groups at regional undergraduate institutions using genomics to address the basic biological question: ?How do organisms respond to changes in their environment?? Users will benefit from this local, well-managed, shared instrument through (1) dramatic reductions in wait times for sample analyses, (2) intensive sample management to contain costs and maximize data output, and (3) comprehensive onsite technical and bioinformatics support. The Illumina HiSeq 2500 will be housed in the UNH Hubbard Center for Genome Studies (HCGS), an established DNA core facility with a service-driven technical, management, and bioinformatics team. The HCGS also serves as a regional bioinformatics core facility, meeting the bioinformatics and connectivity needs of scientists throughout northern New England. Management, storage, and security of the data generated by the HTP sequencing system will be provided by a dedicated IT team and infrastructure in the UNH Research Computing and Instrumentation Core Facility. To interpret and utilize the data effectively, two full-time Ph.D.-level bioinformatics staff will be dedicated to HTP sequence analysis. In addition, the HCGS works extensively with computer science faculty and students to promote the cross-disciplinary development of bioinformatics expertise. This team approach and infrastructure will ensure the efficient operation of the sequencing platform and will allow its use by the broadest number of research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNH is a national leader in promoting research experiences for undergraduates; the anticipated major users of this HTP sequencing system exemplify this commitment in their own research programs. The new sequencing system will support such research experiences for undergraduate students, and also provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. To complement and support the research activities, a series of workshops will be held to provide training for students (and faculty) in HTP sequencing applications and the associated bioinformatics tools. In addition, data generated by this system will be integrated into courses in the biology curricula of participating institutions, supporting the adoption of these technologies in diverse fields. The research programs that will use this instrument already have a strong record of participation by diverse students and faculty, attracting students through programs such as the McNair Scholars, UNH Project SMART, and UNH REAP, and building faculty partnerships through collaborative research projects with historically black colleges and universities. This participation is expected to continue, and grow, as the new HTP sequencing system facilitates exploration of new areas of genomics and the application of informatics to answering a wider range of research questions.</AbstractNarration>
