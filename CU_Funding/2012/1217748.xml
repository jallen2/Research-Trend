    <AbstractNarration>Production codes on supercomputers are struggling to remain scalable&lt;br/&gt;each time the processor core count increases by a factor of 10, even&lt;br/&gt;though they run efficiently at smaller scale.&lt;br/&gt;But root cause diagnosis fails at petascale since (1) symptoms of&lt;br/&gt;performance problems can be subtle, (2) only few&lt;br/&gt;metrics can be efficiently collected and (3) tools can only feasibly record&lt;br/&gt;a small subset of even these metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses these problems by creating a framework that allows&lt;br/&gt;application developers to focus on data analysis that drives customized&lt;br/&gt;data extraction combined with on-the-fly analysis specifically geared&lt;br/&gt;to their individual problems. This is accomplished by combining trace&lt;br/&gt;analysis and in-situ data analysis techniques at runtime, thereby&lt;br/&gt;lifting data reduction to a new level where it IS analysis. With this&lt;br/&gt;approach, modular measurement and analysis components are combined to&lt;br/&gt;selectively extract representative data from production codes in a&lt;br/&gt;problem-specific manner, which enables root cause analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work demonstrates the feasibility of customized data&lt;br/&gt;extraction and analysis at scale for root cause analysis on current&lt;br/&gt;and forthcoming multi-petascale supercomputers. It thus contributes&lt;br/&gt;to sustain scalable scientific computing into the future up to the largest&lt;br/&gt;scales. Results of this work will be contributed as open-source code&lt;br/&gt;to the research community and beyond as done, allowing other groups to&lt;br/&gt;not only build tools on top of our framework but also contribute their&lt;br/&gt;own components.</AbstractNarration>
