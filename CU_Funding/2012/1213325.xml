    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Ned B. Bowden of the University of Iowa will explore the synthesis of polymers containing the sulfenamide and the diaminodisulfide repeat unit, congeners of polythiazyl. The approach is to prepare cyclic sulfonamides and then investigate the fundamental chemistry of their ring-opening polymerization; to develop methods for the step-growth polymerization of secondary amines and disulfur transfer reagents into polydiaminodisulfides; and finally to synthesize and characterize semiconducting polymers based on polysulfenamides and polydiaminodisulfides. The broader impacts involve visiting local schools to present chemistry demonstrations, hosting a booth at the Iowa State Fair to present chemical research innovations to the general public, a monthly newspaper column to communicate science to the general public, training graduate and undergraduate students, and broadly disseminating research results in a variety of formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices. This research will explore new approaches to include sulfur and nitrogen atoms within the polymer chain, which can impact properties ranging from electrical conductivity to susceptibility to water hydrolysis. The results of the studies could facilitate access to high performing organic electronic or light-emitting devices as well as environmentally responsive materials.</AbstractNarration>
