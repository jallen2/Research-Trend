    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development and commercialization of Lightwave Photonics, Inc.?s novel light emitting diode (LED) technology for use in solid-state lighting. Adoption of LED solid-state lighting is still constrained by the prohibitive upfront cost of commercially available LED solid-state lighting products. Lightwave Photonics has developed a unique material structure that will enable LED manufacturers to improve LED device performance and efficiency as well as reduce the manufacturing costs. During Phase II Lightwave Photonics will work to further improve the performance of their LED technology, develop a commercially viable manufacturing processes, design advanced LED devices that take advantage of the benefits of Lightwave?s technology. Lightwave Photonics will also work with commercial LED manufacturing partners to integrate their advanced LED devices in a commercial LED fabrication facility and qualify Lightwave?s LED technology for production manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of commercially viable technology for improving the performance and efficiency and reducing the cost of solid-state lighting. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), over the 20-year period spanning 2010?2030, the cumulative energy savings from widespread adoption of solid-state lighting in the United States is estimated to total approximately 2,700 terawatt-hours, representing approximately $250 billion at today?s energy prices. These savings could also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1,800 million metric tons of carbon. Lightwave?s advanced technology will allow LED researchers to design new and novel advanced LED device structures that, until the recent development of the Lightwave?s technology, were not possible in a manufacturable way. By improving the performance of solid-state lighting and reducing the upfront cost, Lightwave Photonics will accelerate the widespread installation of solid-state lighting.</AbstractNarration>
