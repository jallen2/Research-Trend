    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Brett Maurer of Virginia Tech to conduct a research project, entitled "Improving predictions of earthquake-induced soil liquefaction damage," during the summer of 2012 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The host scientist is Professor Misko Cubrinovski. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development of a reliable index for evaluating the damage potential of earthquake-induced soil liquefaction. The index is being developed from the truly unique data available from the 2010-2011 Canterbury, New Zealand earthquakes and will facilitate future liquefaction hazard evaluations around the world. Facilitated by excellent ground motion recordings, thorough soil characterization data, and detailed documentation of liquefaction induced damage, the Canterbury earthquakes present a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the risk to the built environment from liquefaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
