    <AbstractNarration>This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of Chicago is to investigate the fundamental limits of signal transduction at the interface between biological cells and inorganic materials. The objectives of this proposal are to investigate the effect of surface morphology and chemistry of nanoscale semiconductors on their structural and electrical interfaces with mammalian cells. The proposed study will potentially yield a new biomaterials platform for conducting electrical recording of single cell activities, which will have much higher spatiotemporal resolutions and better signal to noise ratio than conventional fluorescence or microelectrode based techniques. This work will adopt an integrative approach involving experiments in materials chemistry, biophysics and cell biology. The materials and devices proposed in this work can potentially yield highly sensitive devices for biomedical applications. As part of this Career award, an integrated educational goal is proposed to create a research-intensive learning environment to educate students on subjects of nanostructured semiconductors, biomaterials and biophysics. Based on research results, educational materials, demonstrations, and web tutorials will be developed. Existing model programs at the University of Chicago will be used to increase diversity in science and engineering by offering summer research opportunities to high school and undergraduate students. Finally, two international summer exchange programs are being launched that will allow the undergraduate and graduate students to work with collaborators in China or Israel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrical signals from single cells can regulate their functioning. Earlier studies by this investigator have shown that these signals can be measured using nanoscale materials and devices. The proposed research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which nanoscale materials and devices record these electrical activities. This work plans to adopt an integrative approach involving experiments in materials chemistry, biophysics and cell biology. The materials and devices proposed in this work can potentially yield highly sensitive devices for biomedical applications. The research activities will provide learning opportunities for students in a highly interdisciplinary research environment. The study will also provide a unique knowledge and skill set that can open new areas of endeavor in the semiconductor or detector industry. In addition to existing outreach programs at the University of Chicago, overseas studies in China or Israel will be planned to provide the US students with an awareness and lifelong appreciation of scientists and engineers in other countries.</AbstractNarration>
