    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate a prototype of a&lt;br/&gt;high-throughput, agile, low-cost manufacturing system for tile mosaics. Mosaics have been a source of&lt;br/&gt;visual splendor for millennia, but they have always required arduous and painstaking hand assembly.&lt;br/&gt;Our Phase I proved the feasibility of a programmable, high-throughput robotic tile-assembly system to&lt;br/&gt;enhance the production of mosaic tilings. Phase II R&amp;D will build upon Phase I success to further speed&lt;br/&gt;up, automate and scale the system, develop an effective agile manufacturing management system, and&lt;br/&gt;analyze the economic viability of robotic mosaic assembly for Phase III. We will accomplish this by&lt;br/&gt;enhancing the mechanical processes and reducing operator time - in addition to developing a productionflow&lt;br/&gt;information system. After Phase II system optimization, we will evaluate the commercial potential&lt;br/&gt;of the Artaic technology. The anticipated technical result will be providing a 5x faster manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;process with a 75% reduction in the price per square foot of customizable mosaic tilings produced. The&lt;br/&gt;intellectual merits of this SBIR project involve Artaic?s disruptive robotic technology, which transforms&lt;br/&gt;mosaic installation from its current, time-consuming manual labor processes to a rapid, robotically&lt;br/&gt;directed customizable process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project expands the utilization of artisanal mosaic work&lt;br/&gt;while increasing the competitive advantage of U.S. manufacturing processes through increased&lt;br/&gt;automation and customization. Successful development of this technology will enable a breakthrough&lt;br/&gt;pricing structure that is 75% lower than the competition (based on manual and rudimentary automated&lt;br/&gt;processes), leading to broad market affordability and widespread commercial adoption. Our robotic&lt;br/&gt;system has the potential to revolutionize the $76B global tile industry, while creating numerous&lt;br/&gt;domestic job opportunities. Artaic expects that the 5x increase in manufacturing speed realized during&lt;br/&gt;Phase I will be maintained in Phase II during manufacturing scale-up without loss of placement&lt;br/&gt;accuracy. The increased understanding of robotic agile manufacturing-enabled mass customization&lt;br/&gt;processes will expand the scientific understanding of related robotic processes that utilize highthroughput&lt;br/&gt;flexible assemblies, such as for medical or pharmaceutical technologies, or for consumer&lt;br/&gt;products. In addition, classical mosaic techniques will become more accessible as an art form to all&lt;br/&gt;students, while undergraduate students will increase their understanding of STEM concepts through&lt;br/&gt;engineering courses utilizing this technology. Artists and designers will find the realization of their&lt;br/&gt;design work much more practical and affordable as a business enterprise.</AbstractNarration>
