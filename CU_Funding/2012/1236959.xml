    <AbstractNarration>Zheng&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908207&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies the Euler equations modeling&lt;br/&gt;inviscid fluids, and nonlinear variational wave equations&lt;br/&gt;modeling liquid crystals. His objective is to gain better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of complicated phenomena, such as defects in liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals and shocks in fluid flows, that show themselves as&lt;br/&gt;singularities or shocks in the solutions of the equations. The&lt;br/&gt;methods include hard, soft, and asymptotic analysis, numerical&lt;br/&gt;computation, and techniques of mathematical modeling. In the&lt;br/&gt;fluids topic the investigator explores the role of symmetry in&lt;br/&gt;describing the structure of solutions to shock reflection&lt;br/&gt;problems for the multi-dimensional Euler equations. This bears&lt;br/&gt;on the von Neumann paradox. The issue in the nematic liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals topic is to provide a quantitative as well as&lt;br/&gt;qualitative foundation for manipulating the effect of defects in&lt;br/&gt;electronic devices. The investigation of these mathematical&lt;br/&gt;issues (1) yields new understanding regarding fluids and liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals, which are critical for the advancement of many&lt;br/&gt;engineering sciences such as aerospace engineering, robot&lt;br/&gt;designing, and energy efficient devices; (2) provides advanced&lt;br/&gt;training for graduate students or postdoctoral researchers; (3)&lt;br/&gt;enhances collaboration and cross training of faculties between&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, materials science, and physics, thereby establishing&lt;br/&gt;a foundation for training students in these broad areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies some applied mathematical problems&lt;br/&gt;in fluid dynamics (which includes the motion of air and water)&lt;br/&gt;and in liquid crystal physics in materials science. Scientists&lt;br/&gt;and engineers have used certain mathematical equations, called&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, to model motion or change in a&lt;br/&gt;system. Turbulence in fluids and defects in materials show up in&lt;br/&gt;the form of singularities and instabilities in the solutions of&lt;br/&gt;the equations that model the behavior of the systems. Even in&lt;br/&gt;cases where the equations are quite simple, it is these&lt;br/&gt;singularities and instabilities that often spoil accurate&lt;br/&gt;numerical computations of the solutions. The investigator uses&lt;br/&gt;state of the art analytical tools to study the structures of the&lt;br/&gt;solutions. In the case of a compressible gas such as air, for&lt;br/&gt;example, he isolates typical singularities (hurricanes,&lt;br/&gt;tornadoes, shocks, etc.) and investigates their individual&lt;br/&gt;structures. The result of the investigation is a clearer&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the worst possible solutions, or of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of solutions. Such results quantify our knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;the physics and offer guidance in high-performance numerical&lt;br/&gt;computations of general solutions. Results here influence&lt;br/&gt;scientific areas such as weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, and&lt;br/&gt;materials science, and provide critical knowledge for the&lt;br/&gt;advancement of many application areas such as aerospace&lt;br/&gt;engineering, robot design, and energy efficient devices. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the project provides advanced training for graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdoctoral researchers and enhances collaboration&lt;br/&gt;and cross training of faculties between mathematics, materials&lt;br/&gt;science, and physics.</AbstractNarration>
