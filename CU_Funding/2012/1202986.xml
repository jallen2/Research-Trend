    <AbstractNarration>The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) is developing and implementing a Track 1 pilot project involving innovative professional development and teaching resources based on current geoscience research to improve public Earth Science literacy, particularly through strengthening Earth Science education in grades 7-12 and teacher preparation for secondary school science. These resources include: (1) a short video documentary (in AMNH's Science Bulletins video program) for exhibition and online distribution that features the work of a geoscience researcher and (2) an "Earth Science Teaching Case" (Teaching Case) comprised of a suite of resources to support pre-service and in-service teacher professional development, as well as the implementation of these resources in the classroom to teach students. The Teaching Case includes video segments, text passages, and inquiry-based classroom activities that engage students in the use of geoscience data. These resources are being based on content relating to current research in the area of geological hazards and risks, with a focus on earthquakes and climate change, thereby supporting content in the Next Generation Science Standards. By including the analysis of large geoscience data sets as a catalyst for teaching educators and their students about Earth Science and scientific practices, these resources meet a need currently not met by existing geoscience professional development materials. These resources are being piloted in conjunction with AMNH's new Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program with a specialization in Earth Science for grades 7-12. AMNH's MAT program, supported by New York State and the DR K-12 and Noyce programs in NSF/EHR, is the first of its kind to be offered through an informal science education institution.</AbstractNarration>
