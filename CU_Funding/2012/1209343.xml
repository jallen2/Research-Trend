    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Garrett Hughes of the University of Arizona to conduct a research project, entitled "Constructing the species tree of a pseudoscorpion subfamily" during the summer of 2012 at the Western Australian Museum in Perth, Western Australia. The host scientist is Dr. Mark Harvey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to clarify the relationships between species within the pseudoscorpion subfamily Microcreagrinae, which spans all continents in the northern hemisphere. The research uses physical characteristics to complement molecular data and thereby assist descriptions of new species and improve identification tools for these species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photographs taken of pseudoscorpions and other arachnids in the Western Australian Museum collection taken this summer will be used to create a teaching activity for grade school children involved in the Insect Discovery program that operates through the University of Arizona. This program enables university students to visit classrooms and teach children about biological concepts using insects.</AbstractNarration>
