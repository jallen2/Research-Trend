    <AbstractNarration>The 2013 GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal transect cruise will transit from the highly productive coastal upwelling region off Peru to the stratified oligotrophic waters of the South Pacific subtropical gyre on its way to Tahiti. A range of subsurface oxygen depleted water and sedimentary inputs from the Peru margin will be encountered, as well as hydrothermal vents at 15°S on the East Pacific Rise (EPR). Scientists from the University of Washington and Old Dominion University plan to analyze seawater samples for dissolved and total-dissolvable aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) in water column samples. The dissolved Al, Mn, and Fe in samples from the upper water column (&lt;1000 m depth) will be analyzed onboard to ensure samples being collected are uncontaminated, as well as samples from west of the EPR at hydrothermal plume depths. The shipboard analyses will be augmented by shore-based analyses of water column samples from all depths, as well as analyses of total-dissolvable Al, Mn, and Fe, which will complement the direct analyses of particulate metals undertaken by other GEOTRACES investigators. Results will be used to test the following hypotheses concerning the sources and cycling of Al, Mn and Fe in the ocean: (1) when Aeolian inputs are relatively constant, dissolved Al concentrations in surface waters vary as a function of biological production; (2) concentration maxima of dissolved Al, Mn, and Fe in subsurface waters of the Eastern Pacific oxygen minimum zone are the result of lateral transport from the continental margin by means of resuspension and remobilization; and (3) values about ambient levels with conservative behavior will be encountered in the neutrally buoyant plume about the East Pacific Rise ridge crest for dissolved Fe and Al. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader impacts, results from the study would be disseminated to the public via lectures, the internet, and press releases. One graduate and one undergraduate student from the University of Washington would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>
