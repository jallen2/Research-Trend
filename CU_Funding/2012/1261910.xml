    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;New carbon materials such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have attracted tremendous research interests and led to two Nobel Prizes. The structures of boron nitride (BN) materials are similar to those of carbon solids but have intriguing and different properties. However, the synthesis of BN nanostructures is very challenging. This project supports the efforts to synthesize, characterize, and functionalize single wall boron nitride nanotubes (SW-BNNTs) and boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) by catalytic chemical vapor deposition, which will enable the creation of new electronic and optical materials with tunable properties. This project offers integrated education and outreach activities to future STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforces, includes high school students and teachers, undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, scientists, engineers, and underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the efforts to synthesize, characterize, and functionalize single wall boron nitride nanotubes (SW-BNNTs) and boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) by catalytic chemical vapor deposition. These research themes are challenging, unexplored, and will lead to cutting edge discoveries on new functional BN nanostructures with tunable electronic and optical properties. This project contributes to a series of education and outreach activities, including, i) minor, enterprise, and certificate programs in nanoscale science and technology; ii) research training to postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students; iii) nanotech workshops for high school students (girls, minorities, persons with disabilities) and their teachers; iv) development of a new book and encyclopedia chapters; v) organization of an international conference series; and vi) collaboration with researchers at national laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
