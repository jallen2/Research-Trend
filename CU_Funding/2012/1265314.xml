    <AbstractNarration>The Logical Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS) symposium of 2013 will be held in San Diego, CA on January 6-8 of 2013. The LFCS General Chair is Anil Nerode (Cornell University), the Program Committee Chair is Sergei Artemov (Graduate Center of the City University of New York), and the Organizing Committee Chair is Jeff Remmel (University of California San Diego). The LFCS series represents the body of work in those areas of fundamental logic related to computer science. The conference is intended to encourage the interchange and interuse of ideas emanating from a wide variety of fields and applications. Since its origin in 1989, each LFCS meeting has resulted in a Springer volume of proceedings published prior to the conference and, as has been the norm, a post-conference volume of Annals of Pure and Applied Logic - a flagship journal in mathematical logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LFCS conferences appear to be of significant and growing importance for the logic and foundations community in the United States since computer and information sciences provide a cluster of areas in which the core logical methods are applicable in the most immediate and powerful way. Such a conference is pivotal for building a cadre of future logical foundations of computer science. The US community in logic and foundations will benefit greatly from such a conference. Logic life in the San Diego area is vibrant with many directions of logic and foundations interacting in most fruitful ways. The conference will attract a good number of participants including graduate students for whom this conference will be a milestone event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LFCS 2013 Web site is located at http://www.lfcs.info/lfcs13</AbstractNarration>
