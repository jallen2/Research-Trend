    <AbstractNarration>1254415-Pannier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER proposal is an integrated research and education program that focuses on development of novel nanostructured surfaces that result in high levels of gene delivery to mammalian cells. Gene delivery is the transfer of DNA into a cell, which allows for the introduction of a gene to confer new properties to a cell or to correct mutated genes. Specifically, gene delivery approaches have tremendous potential in therapeutics to correct genetic deficiencies or abnormalities, to guide tissue regeneration, and in the development of new assays for diagnostics. The scientific goal of this proposal is to design nanostructured, slanted columnar thin films (SCTFs) as new surfaces for gene delivery, and to understand how SCTF topography can further improve DNA transfer. These novel nanostructured SCTF surfaces will be designed to load and deliver DNA to cells, as well as prime adhered cells for optimal uptake of DNA as a result of nanotopographical influence. These surfaces will result in increased gene transfer efficiency and cellular function, with applications that would impact the medical and biotechnological communities, ranging from the development of nanostructured substrates for culture studies, bioreactors, and biotechnological assays, to the development of biomaterials for implants or tissue engineering scaffolds that promote gene transfer. The proposed research will contribute to the fundamental understanding of relationships between nanotopography and cellular phenotypes and DNA transfer, allowing for rational design of biomaterial interfaces for gene delivery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will integrate interdisciplinary research, education, and diversity by extending the research objectives into teaching, training, and learning exercises at multiple educational levels. The education goal is to attain excellence in research and educational integration through innovative and interdisciplinary learning experiences that prepare a new, diverse, and outstanding future biomedical engineering workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering Program of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division, by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cell Biology and by the Office of the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).</AbstractNarration>
