    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide new data on the paleoclimates, paleoenviroments and the biodiversity impacts of sea level rise on the southern edge of the Bering Land Bridge (BLB), and is intended to facilitate a better understanding of why woolly mammoths survived late into the mid-Holocene only in the environments of Arctic islands of this area. Furthermore, this research will attempt to establish the actual time of extinction of the Holocene mammoth population on St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands, Alaska, and apply this information to test various proposed causal hypotheses for the extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cores from Cagaloq Lake, St. Paul, will be sampled for chironomids (aquatic invertebrates), pollen, coprophilous fungi spores, plant macrofossils, charcoal, ancient DNA and cryptotephras. Oxygen isotopes from the heads of chironomids will provide an independent climate record that can be supplemented by paleoecological analyses of the chironomid assemblages. Studies will also test chironomid species for isotope fractionation to disentangle climate signals from ground water effects. Terrestrial community changes will be reconstructed from pollen, spores and plant macrofossils; and charcoal frequency will be used to document fire events. Analysis of ancient DNA will provide data on cryptic plant and animal species that have not been detected by traditional methods of analysis, and can also be used to identify taxa to species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spores that grow on animal dung will be used as proxies for the mammoth population size and to document the time of mammoth extinction on the island. Ancient DNA will serve as an important cross-check by helping to resolve specific identifications of these spores as well as providing an independent estimate the time of extinction by the absence of mammoth DNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital elevations, bathymetric data, sea level curves, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology will be used to reconstruct island size from the time of its isolation until today. A highly constrained chronology of the Cagaloq record will be achieved by using 14 C dates and tephras. All data can be compared temporally in order to test hypotheses for mammoth extinction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide opportunities for two PhD students, a postdoctoral fellow, graduate student assistant and undergraduate student. Results of the study will be disseminated widely in peer-reviewed journals. An exhibit on the results of the project will be prepared by the EMS Museum at Penn State University with a web component. In addition, a special on-line, interactive exhibit will allow participants to reconstruct the island at various sizes, populate it with differing mammoth populations and define different climate and environmental factors to observe how each of these components affects mammoth extinction. The interactive exhibit will be available on the Neotoma database. Members of the group will make presentations on the project at the Alaska Quaternary Center in Fairbanks, which serves as a hub for promoting Alaska Quaternary research and outreach to the public.</AbstractNarration>
