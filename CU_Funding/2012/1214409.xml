    <AbstractNarration>This grant funds the research activities of Professor Jeffrey Harvey at the University of Chicago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this project, Professor Harvey plans to pursue several directions at the forefront of string theory. Specifically, he will investigate new connections between the mathematics of automorphic forms, the counting and structure of black hole states in supersymmetric string theories, the properties of supersymmetric states, and the representation theory of sporadic groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Harvey plans to integrate his research into undergraduate and graduate courses. He also intends to mentor graduate students and postdocs. His public outreach activities typically include occasional appearances on local radio and TV programs, public lectures at local theatres and schools, and the opportunity for postdocs to present the Compton Lecture Series, a series of Saturday morning lectures on physics to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
