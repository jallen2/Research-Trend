    <AbstractNarration>A decade ago ecological genomics was a field in its infancy. The field was created to develop a comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms that organisms use to respond to changing ecological and environmental conditions at the genome-wide scale. During the last ten years ecological genomics has grown into a productive discipline that thrives via novel interdisciplinary research that integrates the fields of ecology, evolution, genomics, and physiology to address fundamental questions at the mechanistic level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting award aids the advancement of the field ecological genomics through support of the tenth annual Ecological Genomics Symposium to be hosted by the Kansas State University, Ecological Genomics Institute from the 26th to the 28th of October 2012 at the Marriot Hotel on the Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri. The Tenth Annual Ecological Genomics Symposium will accomplish two primary goals. First, this symposium provides the only annual forum for the dissemination of the rapidly advancing and diverse research in ecological genomics in the world and thus it will continue to accomplish this goal. Second, since this is the tenth annual symposium, this meeting will also allow participants to reflect on the developments of the last decade, as well as chart the path forward for the field. Thus, this symposium provides an essential venue for exchanging scientific information from diverse disciplines and fostering novel research directions for the field. The project will specifically support travel and lodging costs for eleven domestic speakers and ten student/postdoctoral fellowships. The speakers include both established and emerging leaders of the field that is both scientifically and culturally diverse. The travel fellowships will support young scientists working in ecological genomics. These fellowships will be targeted to support individuals from historically underrepresented groups in science. The meeting is designed around a single set of non-overlapping invited talks over a two-day period affording ample opportunity to cultivate interactions among the participants.</AbstractNarration>
