    <AbstractNarration>This project is designed to establish the Establishment of a Scholarship Program in Chemistry and Physics with the overall goal of increasing the number of science degrees awarded and broadening participation in the physical sciences. The specific objectives of the project are to: &lt;br/&gt;(a) Expand access to the high quality and proven academic programs in the physical sciences at the college by reducing the financial burden for qualified and motivated students;&lt;br/&gt;(b) Leverage the fact that many students come from backgrounds and regions where participation in the scientific enterprise is low;&lt;br/&gt;(c) Engage prospective science students in the scientific research process early in their college career through pre-enrollment internships, an innovative research-focused freshman seminar course, and subsequent immersion in the culture of scientific research; &lt;br/&gt;(d) Develop a robust community of science scholars using multiple mentoring models that involve student peers, faculty, staff and alumni; and &lt;br/&gt;(e) Provide learning experiences that represent the best aspects of the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Scholarships are being awarded annually to highly-capable and motivated college students pursuing degrees in chemistry and physics. Strategies being utilized include an early immersion in faculty mentored undergraduate research, formation of a community among the scholars, and frequent, quality interactions with science faculty to provide both one-on-one tutoring and referral to the extensive set of programs that the college has developed to aid students in their transition to college, to retain them as students, and to assure their success in their chosen course of study. Faculty members are working closely with admissions staff to market the program, identify prospective scholars, and bring them to campus for pre-admission events. First-year scholars arrive on campus the week before their classmates to begin a comprehensive first-year program that includes academic support, professional development, and research opportunities. Scholars are sharing academic experiences through common sections of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and English, as well as their own section of the first-year seminar course called the Freshman Tutorial. In this tutorial section scholars are exploring a science-related topic that includes a laboratory/experiential component focused on a shared research problem from the laboratories of the faculty. Support services that are being made available to the students include one-on-one tutoring, participation in mentoring networks developed specifically for these students, and biweekly lunches with science faculty and advanced students to discuss issues related to career development, the practice of science, ethics, and other topics. Faculty members are continuing to mentor these students throughout their four year experience and are coordinating with the career development staff as these students seek internships, apply to graduate programs, and seek employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This program is broadening participation by underrepresented groups and providing a diverse group of students access to and guidance through the high quality physical sciences programs at the college that have historically been among the top producers in the nation of students that go on to earn Ph.D. degrees.</AbstractNarration>
