    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the investigators study a series of challenging problems of extracting information from Chinese text, including: (1) word/phrase discovery, (2) text segmentation, (3) technical term recognition, and (4) association discovery among technical terms. Different from alphabetical languages such as English, Chinese has many special properties: no word boundaries, no clear definition of words, traditionally no punctuation, and a unique grammar. Thus, it is problematic to apply most methods developed for alphabetical languages directly to Chinese. Moreover, the available methods for analyzing Chinese text in the literature have many limitations. Instead the investigators propose an advanced word dictionary model (AWDM) that can simultaneously achieve word discovery, text segmentation and technical term recognition, which are traditionally studied separately. The idea is to build up a word dictionary first by enumerating all word candidates satisfying a certain criterion from the texts and assign to each word candidate a latent word type label representing different types of technical terms (such as names, addresses, office titles, time labels, as well as background texts) and corresponding word usage frequencies. Then, a Markov dependence model among different words and word types is given to model the potential grammatical and semantic structure of the texts. With the help of the training data (i.e., lists of known technical terms), the AWDM can automatically select the most meaningful words from the huge space of word candidates, determine the word type for each word based on not only the content of the word but also the context around the word, and segment the texts based on both grammatical and semantic information. Compared to the existing methods in the literature, the AWDM enjoys a better efficiency due to the joint modeling of the grammatical and semantic information and the integrated analysis of word discovery, text segmentation and technical term recognition. Combined with other text mining tools, such as topic models and theme dictionary models, the proposed method will lead to a powerful multi-level (Chinese character level, word/phrase level, theme level, topic level) analysis platform for Chinese texts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the explosive growth of the internet and digital technologies, large quantities of digitalized Chinese texts can be easily collected. For example, lots of Chinese historical documents written in traditional Chinese are now available in digital form; and, public media such as new papers, forums, blogs and microblogs, are producing huge amounts of Chinese text every day. Thus there is great appeal in developing text mining tools to automatically extract information from these data and create new knowledge. The ideas and approaches in this project may have significant impacts on how Chinese history will be studied. An efficient and reliable method for extracting information from the ever growing databases of digitized historical documents will enable researchers to analyze change over time based on large numbers of disaggregated data points, something impractical in the past. Furthermore, although originally designed for Chinese, these approaches have the potential to be applied to other Asian languages similar to Chinese, such as Japanese and Korean, and thus provide a powerful multi-language platform for the study of Asian history. In addition, the novel way of combatting the challenges in recognizing named entities studied in this project also has the potential to be extended to alphabetical languages such as English. Finally, the ideas and approaches studied in this project have the potential to be generalized into a systematic tool that digests any data flow of Chinese texts, and outputs a structured database that contains key information about the individuals and organizations described by the input data, thus making it easier for researchers to discover social network of all kinds of "units" in our social life. Various item association patterns discovered by our algorithms are also invaluable to the study of public media and sociology, and may help reveal new important epidemiological events and societal trends in a timely fashion. These types of information can have important implications in business decision making and governmental policy making.</AbstractNarration>
