    <AbstractNarration>With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program (CSDM) in the Chemistry Division, Professor Piotr Kaszynski of Vanderbilt University will be developing a new and potentially broad class of organic molecular paramagnetic semiconductors with high molecular and supramolecular structural diversity for electronic applications, such as solar energy harvesting. The centerpiece of the molecular design is a stable heterocyclic radical, which is substituted with groups that promote self-organization of the molecules into layers or columns and formation of liquid crystalline phases. These molecular materials will be investigated for magnetic and photovoltaic properties in which the charge transport is coupled with the magnetic properties of the unpaired electron. The project is interdisciplinary and involves synthesis, extensive characterization, understanding of structure-property relationships (both molecular and supramolecular), and theoretical analysis of new materials. The acquired knowledge will provide tools for fine-tuning of thermal, optical, electronic and possibly magnetic properties of the proposed materials for applications such as energy harvesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will have a broad impact on several fields of modern chemistry, and will open up access to a potentially large and versatile class of unprecedented liquid crystals, that are of increasing interest to the scientific community and industry as materials with potential applications in molecular electronics and energy conversion. Realization of the project will also impact education and scientific training of the workforce through a diverse educational experience. Professor Kaszynski has been successful in attracting women and minority students to his research group by maintaining a creative and supportive environment that has fostered many careers in science and medicine.</AbstractNarration>
