    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing two new major components for Yale's network infrastructure: a dedicated, 100-Gigabits-per-second Science Network, and a Science DMZ. In combination with a high-speed connection to the national Internet2 network, these components are designed to enable collaborations involving Yale scientists and researchers throughout the world on computation- and data-intensive research projects in astronomy, climatology, genomics, and other scientific fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The on-campus Science Network provides a 100-fold increase in speed over the networks currently in use. Using it, Yale scientists, from their desktops, can rapidly access both multi-Petabyte network-attached data storage facilities, and any of the university's high performance computing clusters. Such a dramatic increase in network speed is a game changer for scientists who regularly deal with Terabyte-size and larger datasets, reducing transfer times from many hours to just a few minutes. The addition of the Science DMZ enables researchers to share results outside Yale and to access national data repositories and computational infrastructure such as XSEDE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on Yale's prior investments in both the InCommon authentication framework (which allows external collaborators to use network credentials from their home institutions to access resources at Yale), and IPv6 technology (which allows broader and more efficient access to networked devices). The investigators are using perfSONAR appliances to collect performance data that will allow them to optimize and manage the topology of the network infrastructure and validate the performance gains it delivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In essence, this project is creating a virtual facility for scientific collaboration and data sharing that will allow new research communities and collaborations to form within its walls. By leveraging the Science Network and Science DMZ, Yale will be able to pioneer new modes of research collaboration; host and serve up "big data" scientific data stores; and work with institutions in its region, across the nation, and around the world to broaden the opportunities for scientific research, and support excellent education and training for students at all levels.</AbstractNarration>
