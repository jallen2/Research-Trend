    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this REU site hosted by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Iowa State University is to engage ten undergraduate students annually in summer research experiences in the area of Microscale Sensing, Actuation and Imaging (MoSAIc). The students will pursue fundamental investigations in the area of design and manufacture of sensors, actuators and smart materials as well as "state-of-art" imaging and diagnostic systems. The research activities are inherently interdisciplinary in nature by addressing phenomena at several length scales ranging from the molecular to the mesoscale. Examples include flexible linkages, high temperature MEMS pressure sensors, solar cells, electroactive polymeric actuators, nanomechanical sensors for biological agents, atom probe tomography and high spatiotemporal resolution 4-D imaging. A unique and differentiating component of this REU site from its existing version (2009-2012) will be an increased focus on recruiting community college students and an interaction component with middle school teachers. The potential impact of the REU site is in providing a diverse pool of undergraduate students from 4-year colleges, community colleges and incoming freshman with a) a research experience in topics that are of national interest; b) an appreciation for cross-disciplinary nature of such research; c) an appreciation of the ethical implications of engineering research and; d) a fostering environment for career development. These efforts will encourage participants to pursue graduate school education and careers in R&amp;D and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for advanced sensing and imaging technologies to enhance our nation's health, homeland, food and energy security has never been more urgent as outlined in the Grand Challenges of the National Academy of Engineering. This REU Site will contribute to workforce development by providing students from 4-year colleges, minority-serving institutions, and community colleges as well as freshman students with a 10-week summer research experience annually in projects in the area of sensing and imaging technologies. The site will thus encourage STEM-related educational experiences for a diverse pool of individuals. Example projects include biosensors to detect miniscule traces of chemical and biological toxins, high speed 3-D mapping of human faces to aid medical diagnoses of nerve-based disorders and design of high efficiency solar cells. The existing faculty expertise and research infrastructure in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Iowa State University will provide the necessary guidance, mentoring and cohort-based social and educational activities to enhance students' hands-on experiences, science and engineering knowledge base as well as communication and team-based skills. The student experience in this REU site will thus enable them to walk away with life-long skills that will impact their contributions to science and engineering and to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project acknowledges support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers.</AbstractNarration>
