    <AbstractNarration>NSF funds will be used to support (registration and travel) the attendance of junior and early career scientists at the 2012 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar on Research at High Pressure. The biennial GRC brings together world experts and young scientists in a broad range of fields - condensed matter physics, chemistry, engineering, geoscience and biology - to discuss open questions in behaviour of materials at high density, to disseminate the latest theoretical and experimental research results, and to hear of the latest experimental facilities available around the world. For the first time in its 50-year history, the 2012 meeting will have an associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), beginning immediately prior to the GRC, where graduate students and early career scientists can come together in a highly-stimulating environment to discuss their current research, and build informal networks with their peers. To cement the relationship between the GRS and GRC, the four invited discussion leaders at the GRS will give talks at a special first-day GRC session devoted to "Young Investigators". Further sessions will be devoted to high-density hydrogen, new facilities, and new frontiers. The format of the GRC will include formal presentations by experts, followed by extensive time devoted to questions, free-ranging discussions and "brainstorming". A selection of the most exciting poster submissions is made close to the start date of the conference, and the presenters are allocated "Invited Poster" status, and given 5-minute presentations to "advertise" their work. The 2012 GRC will provide an ideal environment for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to present and exchange their latest ideas and results, and to hear and explore the latest theoretical and experimental methods in high-pressure science. Members of underrepresented groups have been recruited as conference speakers to provide role models and potential mentors for the young scientists who will participate.</AbstractNarration>
