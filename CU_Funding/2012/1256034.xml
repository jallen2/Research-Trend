    <AbstractNarration>The Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE) was established in 1995 to examine the separate and combined effects of livestock and wildlife on each other and on the land they share. This controlled exclusion of cattle, wildlife, and large herbivores provides a unique experimental setting in which to answer basic and applied questions about the ecology, conservation, and management of semi-arid ecosystems. Data collected over the next five years will enhance understanding of soil, plant, and herbivore responses to multi-year weather cycles, with an emphasis on variation in rainfall. Additional experiments will determine the causes and consequences of variation in tree densities and include both eco-hydrological and eco-physiological studies. Continuation of this long-term experiment is necessary to capture the slowly-developing processes and interannual variation that are critical to ecosystem function in savanna landscapes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Globally, the goals of rangeland management and biodiversity conservation collide with increasing frequency, as wildlife become more dependent on rangeland for survival. By examining the conditions under which wildlife and livestock co-exist, results from this project directly inform a reconciliation of these conflicting goals. The study attracts collaborating scientists from multiple institutions and trains both Kenyan and US students in research. The study plots host undergraduate research projects and class visits from Kenya, the United States, and other international collaborating countries.</AbstractNarration>
