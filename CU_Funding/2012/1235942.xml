    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The Workshop on the Frontiers of Stochastic Systems and Control will host participants from academia and industry, working on various aspects of cyber-physical systems. The aim is to increase inter-community collaboration in the applications of emerging analytical tools and techniques from control theory, network science and stochastic processes to networks of interconnected cyber-physical devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The recent past has seen the significant adoption of communication technology in applications well beyond voice telephony. There have been significant advances in the integration of communication technology into a number of systems such as transportation and power networks, leading to the notion of cyber-physical systems that integrate sensing, communication, and distributed control in large scale physical networks. The confluence of communication networks with a number of different areas to which ideas of distributed control apply, implies that academic and industry researchers from diverse backgrounds should interact in order to explore mutual synergies that arise from their different perspectives. The workshop will consist of seminars and discussions to foster long-term collaborations between the student, faculty, government and industry participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This workshop will introduce students to cutting edge ideas as well as recent trends in research and industry. Hence, a major part of the workshop is the education of students and other participants on fundamental problems and solution directions in the space of distribution control of systems.</AbstractNarration>
