    <AbstractNarration>The American Physiological Society (APS) will address critical needs for increased diversity among physiologists conducting integrative organismal systems (IOS) biology research by building an annual cohort of underrepresented (UR) undergraduate students engaged in IOS research working with members of APS' Comparative and Evolutionary Physiology Section (CEPS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;APS will build on the strengths of its existing programs to create long-term solutions to specific needs for increasing diversity in the IOS field. The APS IOSP Fellows will conduct research during the summer, present at APS conferences, gain skills through online professional development activities, and become proponents for IOS research via APS' social media outlets and Physiology Understanding Week. APS expects IOSP Fellows to become active participants in the IOS professional community and will evaluate both short- and long-term impacts of the Fellowship. The project will increase the number of UR students participating in IOS-related research; develop a professional network of support among UR students and researchers; and increase understanding of, and interest in IOS careers among the target group of students.&lt;br/&gt;APS will also create a resource collection on supporting students with disabilities in the research lab. The collection will be freely available via APS' NSDL digital library, the Archive of Teaching Resources (www.apsarchive.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With diversity as a national imperative in STEM fields, this project will create and evaluate resources to improve research hosts' skills in working with UR students from broad backgrounds and with diverse needs and resources for engaging UR undergraduates in research experiences, in professional socialization activities, and as advocates for science to the general public. This will provide a model for other scientific societies in identifying and addressing specific needs in their ongoing diversity efforts, which will be shared with the community at the PI meeting.</AbstractNarration>
