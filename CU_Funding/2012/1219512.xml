    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program at Washington University (WU) in St. Louis entitled "NUE: Nanotechnology Minor at Washington University University in St. Louis", under the direction of Dr. Dong Qin, is to attract and engage undergraduate students to the study of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. A Minor in Nanotechnology for all undergraduate students across the campus will be created and a total of twenty summer research internships will be provided to develop the Process Orientated Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) modules related to Nanotechnology for K-12 education outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new initiative at WU will provide an excellent opportunity to build an interdisciplinary education and research program in nanotechnology for undergraduate students with a focus on the following components: 1) learning that exposes students to a multifaceted, integrated approach to learning about the fundamentals and new developments in nanotechnology, as well as its environmental and societal impacts; 2) training that offers students research experience in the Nano Research Facility (NRF)-a site of the NSF supported National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) and in the laboratories of participating faculty for exploration of research tools and discovery in the frontiers of nanotechnology; and 3) engaging that connects the students with community and society to impart and promote a basic conceptual understanding of nanotechnology in high school students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>
