    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER award focuses on exploring the feasibility of the implementation of a new paradigm in the development of an integrative and interoperable data and knowledge management system for the geosciences for a new NSF initiative called EarthCube. Led by a team of expert Earth system modelers, this project focuses on developing new approaches for integrating and coupling model components so that holistic geoscience scenarios that involve the interaction of large scale climate and atmospheric circulation models and smaller, more heterogeneous component models of surface earth processes can be explored and more effectively used by a broader range of users. The project engages participants from a number of major NSF-funded geoscience modeling investments (CSDMS, NCAR, CUHAUSI). A main goal of the of the work is to bridge the gaps between present modeling frameworks, data standards, and computational architectures. The approach includes collection of all relevant approaches and then comparing their pros and cons and linking existing different "plug and play" modeling components together and assessing the accuracy and robustness of model results. Major project goals are to see if more standard modeling protocols can be developed and to develop a general roadmap for improving the interoperability and meshing of model components that address phenomena at wildly different spatial and temporal scales. Broader impacts of the work include building new modeling infrastructure for science and leveraging prior NSF investments in cyberinfrastructure. It also improves the utility of, ease of use, and broader access of scientists and other potential users to more fully integrated and powerful earth systems models.</AbstractNarration>
