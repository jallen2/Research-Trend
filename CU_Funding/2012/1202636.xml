    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for STEM Students (RE STEM) pilot program is providing research- and inquiry-based ocean science experiences for high school Advanced Placement Biology and Environmental Science (AP STEM) students and their teachers in two rural Eastern Shore, Maryland school districts, as a strategy for engaging students in geoscience education and career pathways. The RE STEM program leverages expertise at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Horn Point Laboratory (UMCES HPL)) to introduce students to the practice of authentic ocean science research and incorporate skills used by ocean research scientists, including problem formulation and solving, mathematics and use of high technology instrumentation. The RE STEM Team, which consists of scientists from UMCES HPL and the AP STEM teachers from the school districts, will hold a summer institute based on resources developed through the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE) program to develop the implementation plan for the student research projects and the integration into the AP Biology and Environmental Science classes. During the school year, the RE STEM Team will implement the student research project in the AP STEM courses offered by the two partnering school districts. The program culminates with a student visit to the UMCES HPL research institution so that students can explore the research world first hand. Student responses to the research experiences are being evaluated through pre- and post- surveys and by tracking choices of STEM majors in college. The RE STEM program targets approximately 150 AP STEM students on Maryland's rural Eastern Shore. Additionally, eight AP STEM teachers are gaining experience in research science that is expected to be transferable to their classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
