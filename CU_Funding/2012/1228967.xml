    <AbstractNarration>The web browser is ubiquitous and indispensable. It runs applications&lt;br/&gt;like social networking, business productivity, and online banking, and&lt;br/&gt;promises isolation policies that keep these applications secure when&lt;br/&gt;run side-by-side. Because of its crucial role, we would like the&lt;br/&gt;browser to be robust and secure against attack; but in fact browsers&lt;br/&gt;are fragile. They are complex pieces of software with rich features&lt;br/&gt;that allow for flexibility and programmability, and even small bugs&lt;br/&gt;can make the browser vulnerable to attack. Indeed, browser&lt;br/&gt;vulnerabilities have been used to infiltrate the internal networks of&lt;br/&gt;American defense contractors and leading tech firms. Attempts to&lt;br/&gt;improve browser security are often ad-hoc engineering efforts; and&lt;br/&gt;even when formal guarantees are provided, they come in the form of&lt;br/&gt;proofs over a model or idealization of the browser, not the browser&lt;br/&gt;itself. A buggy implementation can invalidate intended guarantees and&lt;br/&gt;leave users open to attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to build a browser inside the Coq proof&lt;br/&gt;assistant, along with a proof of its correctness. Unlike previous&lt;br/&gt;research efforts, the proof covers the actual browser implementation&lt;br/&gt;rather than a model or abstraction. This provides extremely strong,&lt;br/&gt;precise guarantees about the security properties of the browser. The&lt;br/&gt;proof is made tractable by focusing the verification effort to a small&lt;br/&gt;browser kernel, and running legacy code in a sandbox to render&lt;br/&gt;web pages. In this way, the browser can provide meaningful isolation&lt;br/&gt;guarantees even when the legacy code that renders web pages is&lt;br/&gt;untrusted and potentially buggy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide:&lt;br/&gt;* For users of the web, browsers that are more reliable and secure;&lt;br/&gt;* For software developers, a new approach for developing high-assurance systems;&lt;br/&gt;* For researchers, a framework for formally reasoning about security policies;&lt;br/&gt;* For students, security and formal methods education.</AbstractNarration>
