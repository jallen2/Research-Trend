    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to conduct the NSF Workshop on Nanotechnology Infrastructure to identify nanotechnology infrastructure needs in universities related to the NNIN (National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Initiative). Columbia University and the SRC will co-organize the workshop which will be held in Arlington, Virginia on April 3-4, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NNIN has been very successful in establishing facilities and infrastructure for universities to perform basic research in all areas of nanotechnology. This Workshop attempts to identify the needs for the next phase of NNIN which will continue and expand the research capabilities in US Universities and educate the next generations of scientists and educators in an area of National importance. The proposal?s goals are clearly articulated and the participants who are prominent in their scientific fields are appropriate for achieving the stated workshop goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NNIN has had a fundamental impact on US nanotechnology R&amp;D and education over the past 10 years and is expected to continue to do so. Additionally, more emphasis will be placed on the societal and ethical implications of nanotechnology which will broaden the benefits to society.</AbstractNarration>
