    <AbstractNarration>Carbon-based nano-materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and, more recently, graphene layers and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), have attracted strong interest as alternative device technologies for future nanoelectronics applications. This collaborative research project will potentially result in transformative advances required to harness the early science of these nano-materials into practical design technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, PIs will develop a multi-scale simulation framework that integrates quantum simulations with compact model development for CNT and GNR field-effect transistors (CNTFETs and GNRFETs). They will develop ambipolar logic circuits and ultra-steep sub-threshold logic circuits as two promising candidate solutions with applications to both CNTFETs and GNRFETs. PIs will identify, model, and explore the effect of different variability and defect mechanisms in these devices to provide expedient means to systematically understand and predict their effects on the performance and reliability of practical carbon-based circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will be disseminated through an integrated testbed for research and education in beyond-silicon computing, with an emphasis on carbon-based electronics. Through collaborations with a broad range of academic investigators as well as government and industry affiliates, this collaborative effort will strengthen ties between the device and CAD communities, help create links among them, and accelerate convergence to key design parameters essential for large scale integration of carbon-based electronics. Additionally, the development of learning modules, inter-disciplinary courses, and outreach efforts such as the Design Automation Summer School will bring the architectures, design tools and methodologies -- alongside fabrication and basic physics -- that will most likely define the first generation of nano-computing systems into the mainstream academic curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
