    <AbstractNarration>1239820 &lt;br/&gt;Gough&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports an Advance Study Institute by Dr. Heidi Gough, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle and Dr. Muna Abu-Dalo, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan. They plan to organize a three-week workshop and course on Water in Arid Land, The Engineered Cycle in Jordan. It is scheduled for August-September 2012 and will include US and Jordanian students. The ASI will provide opportunity for study of sustainability and water in an arid country within the context of civil and environmental engineering disciplines; link the specialties of water resource, drinking water, desalination, and wastewater treatment within a single program, and focus on students early in their education path with the expectation that the program experience will influence their future career development.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Water is a scarce commodity, and many parts of the world receive very little annual rainfall, including much of the developing world. Water is predicted to become increasingly more difficult to obtain, and providing access to clean water is listed among the engineering grand challenges. Water collection, drinking water treatment, and wastewater treatment are inherently different in arid regions than in water-rich regions. This project will help future engineers be equipped with knowledge related to these differences. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan will serve as the backdrop for an Advanced Studies Institute exploring the engineered water cycle in an arid region. The institute will examine the engineered water cycle in Jordan by studying (1) the current and historic water resources in Jordan, (2) drinking water treatment and distribution in Jordan including the use of cisterns and desalination, (3) treatment of concentrated wastewater including efforts for safe reuse, and (4) plans in Jordan for meeting future challenges. The program will partner this Advanced Studies Institute with a University of Washington Study Abroad Exploration Seminar Program. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The targeted participants for the program are engineering and hydrology undergraduate and early graduate students from US (predominately University of Washington) and Jordanian universities. Because this young generation of scientists and engineers are expected to be at the fore-front of technological solutions and decisions that are anticipated to impact society in the next 30 to 50 years,&lt;br/&gt;targeting this population now will provide cross-disciplinary training to provide a greater breadth to their&lt;br/&gt;educational and future professional experiences. Two members of the organizing committee are from an underrepresented group (women in science), and underrepresented groups will be encouraged to apply. A webpage developed as part of the institute will serve to increase recognition of the institute, and it is planned that this first year will serve as a pilot project for a self-sustaining program that will continue in future years. It is further anticipated that the program will increase teaching and research collaboration between the two sponsoring universities.</AbstractNarration>
