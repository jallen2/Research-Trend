    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jingsong Zhang of the University of California at Riverside investigates the light-driven dissociation of polyatomic free radicals (photodissociation dynamics). Free radicals are important in many reactive environments such as combustion and atmospheric chemistry, and it is still challenging to understand their photochemistry, excited state dynamics, and nonadiabatic interactions. The goal of this project is to provide detailed information on the spectroscopy, structures, energetics, photochemical reactivity, and nonadiabatic dynamics (especially via conical intersections) of the benchmark polyatomic radicals with quantum accuracy. High resolution high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight spectrometry will be utilized as the main tool to study the spectroscopy and state-resolved photodissociation dynamics of reactive intermediates important in combustion and atmospheric chemistry. The systems to be examined include formyl radical, small diradicals, and alkyl radicals. These experimental studies can also provide stringent tests for high-level quantum mechanical theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Zhang will work closely with Professor C. Brazier and his students at California State University at Long Beach to enhance the research and educational activities at this Hispanic Serving Institute. Through this project, Professors Zhang and Brazier mentor graduate students to become community college teachers, collaborate with the current and future instructors, and share their knowledge with a highly diversified student population at Riverside and local community colleges that serve a large population of minority students will participate in the research during summer.</AbstractNarration>
