    <AbstractNarration>Objective: This proposal offers an algebraic approach -- network modulation (NeMo) -- to improve reliability, rate, security and robustness of multi-hop networks. The objective of this proposal is to (i) design NeMo protocols to enhance packet delivery rate and robustness to node failures; (ii) optimize NeMo to incorporate network constraints on energy, delay, and data characteristics; (iii) investigate NeMo techniques to cope with impairments of wireless links such as fading; and (iv) develop random NeMo methods to improve network security against sniffing and malicious attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal tackles the challenging issues in multi-hop networks from the novel perspective of symbol-level modulation. Relying on signal space techniques and algebraic number theory, NeMo enables more efficient networking in terms of data persistence, reliability, and security, and at the same time remains flexible and scalable. Aside from applications such as information exchange/collection in sensor networks that could directly benefit from the NeMo technique, our novel insights also shed light on other networking applications (e.g., media streaming and P2P content distribution).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed work is of both theoretical and practical significance to the networking community. At a broader scale, it will impact the design of future networks through technological advances. This project will engage both graduate and undergraduate students by offering them research and learning experiences. This project will also strengthen the ongoing collaboration between the PI and the researchers at industry, thus facilitating transition of scientific discoveries to the application domains.</AbstractNarration>
