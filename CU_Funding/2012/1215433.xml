    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 23rd International Conference on Arabidopsis Research (ICAR) will be held at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Austria, July 3-7, 2012. Worldwide intensive research efforts on Arabidopsis thaliana continue to produce useful information that impacts our understanding of other plants as well as non-plant species. Arabidopsis studies are increasingly facilitating knowledge transfer to other plants and efforts are accelerating due to the efforts of a vibrant research community and the leveraging of advances and resources that inform studies in plants of economic importance including food, feed and fuel crops. The focus of this conference is integrated across many aspects of Arabidopsis biology relevant to topics supported by MCB. Arabidopsis research continues to impact our understanding of other plants and of general biology. A particular highlight of the meeting will be the session sponsored by the Multinational Arabidopsis Steering Committee, which will feature talks on the MASC Roadmap (from Bench to Bountiful Harvests). In addition, the meeting will feature special sessions on other plants, agricultural topics, bioenergy, systems biology and bioinformatics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The funding of this conference will be used to support the cost of registration, housing and travel for underrepresented minorities and/or faculty from MSI, HBCUs and 1890 institutions. The organizers have a well-established program for encouraging participation and providing financial support for minorities and early-career scientists. Previous NSF funding for the 22nd ICAR was used to support 10 underrepresented minority students and faculty, 22 domestic young researchers and 11 invited speakers who were also early career scientists. The North American Arabidopsis Steering Committee began their assessment efforts last fall. The surveys were sent to previous minority awardees and early career awardees who were supported by NSF funding in the periods since 2004. The results of the surveys were quite favorable and document positive impacts of attendance at the ICARs, including facilitating publication and new collaborations, submitting funding proposals and facilitating new curriculum development.</AbstractNarration>
