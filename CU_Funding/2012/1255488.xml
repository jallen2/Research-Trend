    <AbstractNarration>Stearns/1255488&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to understand the flow dynamics of Antarctic glaciers by means of a physically-based numerical model. The model will be used to systematically investigate the dynamics of Antarctic glaciers, and to test their response to a variety of perturbations. The intellectual merit of the project relates to the fact that outlet glacier speeds exert a major control on ice sheet mass balance and contribution to sea level rise; it is essential that their sensitivity to a range of dynamic processes is properly understood and incorporated into prognostic ice sheet models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives include estimating the sensitivity of individual glaciers to both climate and non-climate forcings, calculating changes in mass flux based on a number of different perturbations, and characterizing how glacier response varies across the ice sheet. The broader impacts of the project include education and outreach as well as contributions to the field of ice sheet modeling. The numerical model used in this project will be incorporated into an online interactive website, called the DYNamic Antarctic MODel (DYNAMOD) that will allow students and researchers to investigate Antarctic glacier dynamics, hypothesize about response behaviors, and test their results. Detailed model results will be widely distributed to the community through publications, while the model framework will be available online for student and researcher exploration. The proposed work will provide significant research opportunities for several early-career scientists, including the PI, a Post-Doctoral Researcher, and a glaciology PhD student. The scope of the project provides unique training in glaciology, modeling, computer programming and science education for the PI and her entire research team. The award is a CAREER award and as such the research and education will be integrated through the development and distribution of a numerical glacier flow model and online glacier database. Studies show that data-driven explorations, and the use of dynamic visualizations, increase student understanding of both complex processes and fundamental (math and physics) skills. This project aims to use a numerical flowline model to improve understanding of Antarctic glacier dynamics while also familiarizing students with applied math, science and modeling techniques.</AbstractNarration>
