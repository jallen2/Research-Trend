    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;This Materials World Network collaboration will develop a research program to perform time-resolved and element-specific measurement on spin dynamics in magnetic nanostructures at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Ferromagnetic/Antiferromagnetic (FM/AFM) Py/CoO and Py/NiO bilayers will be grown on MgO(001) substrate by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and 2 or 4GHz microwaves will be delivered to the sample through coplanar waveguide sample design to generate ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the Py layer. By synchronizing the microwave source with the ALS accelerator frequency, the research team will perform time-resolved and element-specific X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) on the Py spin dynamics and X-ray Magnetic Linear Dichroism (XMLD) on the CoO or NiO spin dynamics. The research will involve a close collaboration by exchanging students between UC-Berkeley at US and Exeter Univ. at UK, as well as critical technical information between ALS in US and Diamond Source in UK. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;As magnetic devices perform faster and faster, spin dynamics becomes more and more important in nanostructures. In particular, nanosecond or GHz range sets a critical time scale beyond which spin procession starts domination domain wall motion in spin switching. This Materials World Network collaborative research program will develop a basic understanding of the spin dynamics right in the GHz range in FM/AFM nanostructures. In order to achieve this goal, collaborative effort is needed among US, UK, and Synchrotron expertise. Results of the research will lead to an understanding of the spin dynamics in the important ns time range to provide guidance for future spintronics devices. Graduate students will receive training at the cutting edge of modern experimental techniques through exchange program, which is crucial for their future careers in academic, industrial, and government jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Condensed Matter Physics Program and the Office of Special Programs in the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
