    <AbstractNarration>String theory, as a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, encompasses both quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of general relativity. A remaining challenge is the identification of the appropriate set of background conditions relevant to the formation of our universe. Compactifying the eleven-dimensional M-theory/supergravity can lead to a very large number of four dimensional vacua. It is therefore necessary to understand the extra, compact dimensions and discover the links between the properties of these spaces and the physics we observe in our universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses two important aspects of string compactifications. A primary focus is the determination of how, in the context of global flux compactifications, string vacua exhibiting Standard Model like spectra exist. This study will also apply constraints from cosmology, such as the cosmic microwave background, to put restrictions on the inflationary type potentials obtained from string theory. In addition, questions regarding the details of the geometry, such as mirror symmetry, will be addressed. A second approach will be made in studying various features of AdS4/CFT3 aimed at improving our understanding of the four dimensional string landscape, as well as three dimensional condensed matter systems. The projects , taken together, are very timely since, during the course of the next few years, data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will be improving our understanding of physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, more accurate observations of the cosmic microwave background using the European Space Agency PLANCK satellite will provide even tighter constraints on the possible inflationary scenarios arising in string theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Results from the proposed work will be of interest to several sectors of the mathematics and physics communities. Furthermore the proposed activities will foster collaborations and intellectual exchange within the UNH physics and mathematics community and amongst regional, national and international collaborating scientists. In addition the research program will be coupled with a strong outreach program taking the frontiers of particle physics into local high schools. This will capitalize on the existing infrastructure within the Theorynet, an NSF sponsored program in the greater Boston area, as well as at UNH, for interactions with high school teachers and students. Such interactions will include seminars and informal question-answer sessions with both teachers and students during presentations by the PI at local high schools, as well as visits by high schools to UNH to learn about research in theoretical particle physics.</AbstractNarration>
