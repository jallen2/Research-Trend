    <AbstractNarration>The University of Cincinnati Center for Field Studies (UCCFS) has been awarded a grant to support vital infrastructural and research needs. The major improvements include: internet connectivity with appreciable bandwidth, two weather stations, power and water service for the east side of the campus, solar panels and two essential research instruments that will be housed in a recently constructed laboratory facility. UCCFS was established in 2008 through an agreement with the Hamilton County Park District (HCPD). This 17-acre tract, formerly a Shaker farm, is in the middle of Miami Whitewater Forest (MWF), a 4,000-acre preserve located 12 miles to the west of the university. This property, which lies between the Great Miami and Whitewater Rivers, includes wetland habitats, restored prairie and mixed mesophytic eastern deciduous forest with a mosaic of climax beech-maple and oak-hickory forests. The setting of UCCFS is unique because it is one of the relatively few field stations located near a major urban center. The station has a considerable history of environmental data recorded for this area including intensive studies of the parks in the Cincinnati area by UC botanist E. Lucy Braun in the 1920s. Many others have followed in her footsteps, so there is a long record of ecological observations and species inventories from these sites that can be paired with more modern data collections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the principal objectives of the UC Center for Field Studies is to promote rigorous and sophisticated research programs designed to meet six of the major challenges of our national research agenda. Accordingly, investigations focus on: 1) biological diversity, species composition and ecosystem function; 2) ecological aspects of biogeochemical cycles; 3) ecological implications of climate change; 4) land use dynamics and habitat alteration; 5) the impact and control of invasive species; and 6) hydrologic forecasting. Research activities are integrated with educational programs to achieve multiple goals: 1) advance discovery in the environmental sciences while promoting hands-on training, teaching and learning; 2) broaden participation from underrepresented groups in science by offering opportunities for field research to urban scholars; 3) accrue benefits to society through the generation of advanced understanding of environmental issues through the training of a diverse cadre of new scientists who will become the leaders and teachers of tomorrow; and 4) engage the public in discussions and hands-on scientific study through involvement in research projects and the participation of research scientists in community activities.
