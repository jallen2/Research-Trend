    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to research novel electromagnetic cutting techniques for freeformed fabrication of shaped parts from thin metallic sheet and plates with and without mechanical assistance. The processes, termed Electromagnetic Pulse Induced Cutting and Non-Contact Magnetic Cutting, are based on the controlled advance of a fine crack under an electromagnetic and in one case combined mechanical loading. Conceptually, the processes are akin to a microsized, electromagnetic jigsaw with a kerf measured in microns. The approach is (a) to develop a theoretical basis for fracture mechanics under combined mechanical and electromagnetic forces through a combination of modeling and experiment, (b) to experimentally optimize the conditions for controlled electromagnetically driven crack extension, with and without simultaneous mechanical loading and active sample cooling, and (c) to develop experimental testbeds for demonstrating electromechanical driven freeform metal cutting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include increased understanding of the nature of the electromechanical cutting processes culminating in creation of laboratory demonstration testbeds and leading eventually to technology transfer and commercialization; education of undergraduate and graduate students; and dissemination of results. The results of the proposed research will impact domestic competition by providing novel manufacturing processes for commercialization. Several undergraduate students will assist in the research funded by associated Research Experience for Undergraduates grants at both universities. Under-represented minority undergraduates will be hired who show strong potential for graduate pursuits. Results of the project will be broadly disseminated to enhance specific and technological understanding. This will be done both through faculty and student participation at meetings of learned societies and the National Science Foundation Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation Grantees Conferences.</AbstractNarration>
