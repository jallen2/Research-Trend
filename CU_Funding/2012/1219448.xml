    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for early career scientists and graduate students to participate in the CCAPP Workshop "Radio Simulations for Neutrino and Cosmic Ray Detectors" to be held February 22nd - 24th, 2012 at the Center for Cosmology and Astro-Particle Physics (CCAPP) at The Ohio State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has two major aims: 1) educating young researchers on developing simulations for neutrino and cosmic ray experiments that use the radio Cerenkov or geosynchotron detection techniques and 2) coming to a consensus on simulation strategies for radio experiments. This will reduce systematic uncertainties and improve the sensitivity of these experiments to the highest energy cosmic messengers. The success of the workshop will rely on the active participation of both young scientists and the world's top experts in these areas of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. A major goal of this workshop is to educate young researchers and further their impact on the science of the projects. Simulation work is an excellent way for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs to learn about both the physics and instrumentation aspects of the experiments and make important contributions to the projects.</AbstractNarration>
