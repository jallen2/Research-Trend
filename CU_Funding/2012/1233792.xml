    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to investigate the mechanical response of a new class of nanolayered ceramics (MAX phases) and their solid solutions in extreme dynamic loading conditions through a combination of experimental approaches. MAX phases have attracted considerable attention as potential multifunctional materials for extreme environments since they combine some of the best attributes of ceramics and metals. Preliminary work on MAX phases suggests that new underlying physical mechanisms that can make ceramic materials resistant to dynamic loadings are yet to be discovered and fully explored. Studies conducted under this award will elucidate the physical mechanisms of deformation and damage in the MAX phases, and address fundamental questions regarding the constitutive behavior of the MAX phases under dynamic loading conditions as a function of temperature and to what extent our understanding of deformation and failure mechanisms of the MAX phases in quasi-static conditions can be extended to the extremely high deformation rates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the technological point of view, successful completion of this project will result in a deeper understanding of the connections between composition, structure and mechanical properties in this novel class of materials for extreme service conditions, enabling further developments in power generation, hypersonic and orbital re-entry flights, ballistic protection, etc. The educational and outreach plan focus on a series of activities, including: building a strong integrated research, educational and outreach collaboration between Texas A&amp;M and University of Rhode Island focused on mechanical behavior of novel ceramics under extreme loading conditions; mentoring and training the next generation of experts in the areas of experimental mechanics and materials science of ceramics materials; and linking undergraduate and graduate students? research experiences to their education through their close involvement in research during coursework, research projects, and thesis research.</AbstractNarration>
