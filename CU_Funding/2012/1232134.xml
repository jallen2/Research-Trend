    <AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Manipulating terahertz waves using three-dimensional metamaterials&lt;br/&gt;PI: Cheng Sun, Weili Zhang, John F. O'Hara, Proposal No. 1232134&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Terahertz (THz) waves remain one of the most underdeveloped regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, despite the great promise for potential applications in remote sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, and communications. THz waves carry unique molecular signatures that are not available in the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum. In particular, THz waves offer the opportunity for transformational advances in homeland security, such as applications in standoff detection and identification of concealed explosive targets. However, THz waves have proven very challenging to control due to a paucity of electromagnetic materials with an effective response at THz frequencies. This ?THz gap? results in a great impediment for the development of functional THz optical components and systems. In view of these challenges, the objective of this research proposal is to develop a synergetic approach that incorporates Transformation Optics (TO) theory, metamaterial design using the effective media approximation, scalable three-dimensional (3D) fabrication technologies, and a method of experimental validation to explore a range of novel THz optical components: 1) TO-enabled aberration free THz imaging lens, and 2) an integrated THz spectroscopy platform. The collaborative research proposed here will undoubtedly initiate new possibilities for a variety of much needed THz applications with unprecedented functionalities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research addresses the grand challenges surrounding the spectroscopically important THz frequency range by offering a fundamentally new solution to control the flow of these waves. The fruition of this research is expected to be the forging of bridges between the multiple disciplines for creating a new field of THz Metamaterials, while training the next generation of scientific and engineering leadership in an interdisciplinary learning environment. The innovations obtained from this research represent a technological breakthrough, which will usher in a new generation of THz optical systems with greatly improved resolution, efficiency, and miniaturization to meet the needs of commercial and military applications. The proposed THz 3D metamaterials concept and integrated research protocol can be further extended to the broad electromagnetic wave spectrum for stealth technology, advanced communication systems, medical imaging, and remote sensing.</AbstractNarration>
