    <AbstractNarration>University of Miami proposes to support technical services on one research vessel R/V Walton Smith, operated by the University?s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS). R/V Walton Smith is operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet and as part of their basic operations they will provide one technician on each seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
