    <AbstractNarration>The Oregon group will continue its vigorous efforts aimed at discovery of gravitational waves (GW) within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC). The program will be pursued in the two areas where Oregon has developed significant expertise and compiled a successful record of accomplishment. The first is detector characterization and detection optimization: As the initial LIGO (iLIGO) era winds down and the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) era ramps up, the lessons learned will be applied to the aLIGO instrument and the aLIGO science program. Specifically, we will understand the coupling mechanisms for environmental noise to the LIGO interferometer by way of measurement (analyzing data from monitoring instrumentation) and the development of software to better identify subtle mechanisms which gave rise to troublesome noise transients in iLIGO. The second is data analysis, especially in developing searches for GW transients associated with astrophysical triggers, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or supernovae. An important motivation for developing and refining these searches will be to learn how best to combine other astronomical observations with those from LIGO, something we helped pioneer with triggered GRB searches in iLIGO. Furthering this development is widely seen to be crucial for the full realization of the scientific potential of Advanced LIGO. We intend to pursue this by refining searches involving gamma-ray observations (associated with GRBs) and developing searches involving neutrino observations (associated with core-collapse supernovae).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the commissioning of Advanced LIGO, we are preparing for an era of discovery with the new astronomical medium of gravitational waves. Historically, each fundamental new means for observing the universe has resulted in the emergence not only of new science, but new ways the public perceives the world. We expect this to also be the case with gravitational waves. Our work will help ensure that our observational instrument, Advanced LIGO, works to its full potential, and that the new window on nature is exploited scientifically to the greatest extent possible. So beyond the scientific advancement resulting from publication of new methods and observations, we anticipate the possibility of significant human enlightenment regarding the nature of the universe to result. A new scientific discipline of gravitational- wave astronomy has emerged, and the education and advancement of the technical workforce must keep pace. The participation of graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and undergraduate students is a crucial element of the project. As an additional, direct benefit to society, we will also continue to work with high school teachers to bring this research to their students, and to engage the public via speaking engagements.</AbstractNarration>
