    <AbstractNarration>This project will implement fast particle size distributions measurements during the 4th Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME IV) Study. The measurements will be made with a Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS) that is (1) capable of measuring the size range of interest for fresh smoke aerosols, (2) has fast time response that will be useful for all burns, and (3) is capable of measuring high concentrations. These are all characteristics of the aerosol produced by biomass burns in the FLAME experiments, particularly stack burn experiments of relatively short duration (minutes to tens of minutes from ignition to flame out and smoldering). The measurements will be complementary to those of several other investigators that include ice nuclei and evolution of secondary organic aerosols from the burn emissions. The research will help to elucidate fundamental physicochemical properties of biomass smoke, important to health and climate impacts of smoke aerosols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a unique collaboration between private sector and academic partners that has potential to lead to further developments in this arena. Broader impacts center on the continuation of FLAME collaborations begun a decade ago between the principal investigator and the other investigators on the project. Although students are not directly supported, it is anticipated that informal learning opportunities and collaborations with students working as part of the FLAME study will develop. Moreover, results to date from the principal investigator's research and work activities have been successfully integrated into the classroom in his adjunct faculty position at Front Range Community College and into seminars presented at regional air quality meetings and at nearby institutions of higher learning. The project will enhance collaborations within the regional air quality research and education community.</AbstractNarration>
