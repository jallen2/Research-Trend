    <AbstractNarration>Soil microorganisms carry out many processes that are vital for maintaining productive soils and sustainable agricultural lands. For example, they recycle nutrients and regulate greenhouse gas emissions. However, little is known about the distribution of microorganisms across the landscape. To address this knowledge gap, this research project will study how different factors, such as agricultural management practices and soil properties, influence the distribution and function of microorganisms at local and broader spatial scales. The experiments will be conducted as part of the Landscape Biomass Project, a large-scale research and demonstration farm in central Iowa. Results from this project will generate data for modeling soil microbes and the processes that they perform. These models, in turn, will inform management decisions that promote soil carbon and nitrogen retention and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collected as part of this project will strengthen cross-disciplinary research that involves the fields of ecology and biogeochemistry, agronomy, hydrology, forestry, and economics. The project will support international collaborations with soil modelers in the United Kingdom. It will foster training of undergraduate students in the biogeochemical sciences through hands-on field and laboratory experience. Finally, results will be presented to a diverse group of public and private stakeholders at on-site field presentations, meetings with a farmer advisory board, and at workshops with policy makers.</AbstractNarration>
