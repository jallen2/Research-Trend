    <AbstractNarration>As the international construction sector continues to expand, US competitiveness will depend on the flexibility to both design with and utilization of construction materials, including steel, in innovative ways. Whether the future includes automated construction, prefabricated or modular building components, or entirely new section configurations is unclear at this point. Regardless, innovation will require both fundamental and applied research in order to understand and develop new approaches. The American Society of Civil Engineers /Structural Engineering Institute (ASCE/SEI) Technical Activities Committee (TAC) on Metals has planned one-day long workshop to develop a research and innovations agenda for the design of steel structures with support from the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC). The primary objective of the workshop is to develop a research agenda that will provide a direction for steel design and construction research in areas of promise for both technical advancement and global competitiveness with the input of a diverse group of academics, industry leaders and engaged graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop, through moderated discussions, will bring together leaders and emerging talent in the academic and design communities to specifically address the following: &lt;br/&gt;? What are the most promising areas of steel design innovation to increase US global competitiveness; and &lt;br/&gt;? What fundamental questions about steel structural behavior, including response to extreme loads and resiliency, need answers?&lt;br/&gt;In addition to speakers from AISC and ASCE, academic and industry leaders will facilitate discussions in breakout sessions in three designated areas: Design for Rapid Construction, Sustainability and Resiliency, and Response to Extreme Loads. A ?Wildcard? session will also convene to allow for open discussion in any area related to steel design. The results of the deliberations at the workshop will be disseminated to the stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>
