    <AbstractNarration>Planning Grant: I/UCRC for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1238341 Texas A&amp;M; Brett Peters &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M University is proposing to join the existing I/UCRC for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) as a new university research site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M University is a unique fit for helping CELDi achieve its strategic goals in both logistics and distribution. Based upon its research strengths and its geographic position, Texas A&amp;M is well suited to lead efforts related to energy and to international logistics. In energy, excellent possibilities exist in both traditional oil-and-gas, where nearby Houston is the energy capital of the world, and in alternative energy, where Texas presents significant opportunities in bio-fuels, wind, and solar. In international logistics, the proposed site's research background and geographic position allow it to exploit the trend of companies reevaluating their global operations, particularly considering moves to North, Central, and South America based on compelling economic advantages including in terms of transportation savings. The faculty researchers at Texas A&amp;M have a long history of generating quality scholarship, and they are committed to continue to make fundamental advances in knowledge as well as solve important problems faced by industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By establishing focused efforts related to energy and international logistics, the proposed site will establish unique niches for CELDi in areas of significant future importance. The Center will also involve a large number of students, both graduate and undergraduate, exposing them to both the critical challenges faced by industry and the latest research methods and results. Texas A&amp;M has a diverse student body and a successful track record of involving a diverse set of students in research. The PI intends to have its member companies implement research results from Center activities to create new strategies and operational procedures.</AbstractNarration>
