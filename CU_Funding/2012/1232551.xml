    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested to provide travel support for U.S. graduates students to attend&lt;br/&gt;the 2012 IEEE Magnetics Society Summer School in Chennai, India. The Magnetism&lt;br/&gt;Summer School is the IEEE Magnetics Society?s main outreach effort to promote&lt;br/&gt;education in the field of magnetism and attract more young scientists to choose a research&lt;br/&gt;career in magnetism and related areas. The one-week Magnetism Summer School is&lt;br/&gt;designed for graduate students studying magnetism, will consist of lectures by&lt;br/&gt;international experts and will include poster presentations by participating graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. The program will cover fundamentals and advanced topics in magnetism. The&lt;br/&gt;summer school is a unique opportunity for young scientists to meet leaders in their field&lt;br/&gt;in a relaxed and collegial atmosphere and to begin establishing a network of colleagues in&lt;br/&gt;the international research community. The funds requested from NSF will provide&lt;br/&gt;additional opportunities for U.S. graduate students to attend the Summer School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The Summer School provides a forum for exchange of information in the field of&lt;br/&gt;magnetics research. In addition to formal lectures, each participating student is required&lt;br/&gt;to present a poster about their current research. These topics are discussed amongst the&lt;br/&gt;students and lecturers during poster sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the Summer School lies in the education of young&lt;br/&gt;scientists and researchers in a fast-moving and economically important field. Participants&lt;br/&gt;will learn both fundamental as well as advanced topics through lectures delivered by&lt;br/&gt;internationally-renowned experts. In addition, there is a degree of cultural education,&lt;br/&gt;teaching young scientists to interact with and respect their colleagues from other&lt;br/&gt;countries. The organizers of the Summer School particularly encourage women and&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities to apply. The program committee also strives for diversity in &lt;br/&gt;the lecturers selected for the summer school to provide role models for female and minority students.</AbstractNarration>
