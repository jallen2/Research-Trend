    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to significantly advance the field of MEMS filters by putting forward innovative solutions that tackle the issues hindering widespread deployment of MEMS filters such as high insertion loss, low power handling, and limited bandwidth. Our approach is to exploit high-coupling-factor thin-film piezoelectric materials in combination with novel impedance matching techniques to improve the performance of acoustically-coupled monolithic filters, which are fabricated on ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD) substrates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to overcome current limitations of MEMS filters and establish lateral-mode MEMS filters as a viable candidate for emerging multi-band transceivers. Specifically, the significance of the proposed activities is as follows: &lt;br/&gt; Finite element models are developed that can fully capture the frequency response of a piezoelectric MEMS filter. &lt;br/&gt; UNCD is utilized to scale up the frequency and improve the power handling of MEMS filters. &lt;br/&gt; Impedance matching networks are integrated with thin-film piezoelectric-on-UNCD filters.&lt;br/&gt; Novel processes for direct deposition of high-coupling-factor piezoelectric films on UNCD are developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The successful demonstration of low-loss thin-film piezoelectric-on-UNCD filters proposed in this work will have a significant impact on how future RF transceiver architectures will be designed. This proposal will provide opportunities for OSU graduate and undergraduate students (with priority given to students from under-represented groups) to work with industrial scientists and gain experience in an industrial setting at Advanced Diamond Technologies Inc. Results from the project will be disseminated through presentation in prestigious conferences and publication in high-impact journals.</AbstractNarration>
