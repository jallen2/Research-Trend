    <AbstractNarration>This projects describes a new kind of thermostat, where the setpoint is not necessarily an array of times and temperatures. Rather, the setpoint is a cost, and the output of the thermostat program is the expected setpoints to achieve this cost over the next month, based on typical weather patterns. The approach is possible given the innovative system model effort, which models the home in such a way as to account for Gaussian disturbances in weather and model error, resulting in cumulative costs that are within a certain bound of the system?s prediction. For more than a decade, the promise of smart-thermostats has been to lower energy costs?but to date, the exact amount that energy costs can be lowered is non-trivial to calculate, or even predict. This work allows homeowners to equate a setpoint schedule with cost of anticipated energy usage, and is shown (in previous publications) to predict that anticipated energy usage within 10% error. Further, if a homeowner sets a desired spending setpoint (e.g., $100 for this month), the setpoint schedule can be generated and (using data gathered previously from that home) can be bounded by certain error amounts that are derived from predicted weather deviations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Home energy made up nearly 25% of all energy consumed in the US in 2010, and 31% of this energy is estimated to come from home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Yet, the inputs available to a homeowner for those systems are not easily correlated to the energy consequences, making it difficult (if not impossible) for a homeowner to choose setpoints in order to meet a budget each month. The proposed work will produce technology that can impact this very large percentage of the energy market in the US (and abroad), with little or no necessary construction changes required to the home. Using this technology, current manufacturers can use data they are already collecting to put the consumer in control or a large portion of their home energy use.</AbstractNarration>
