    <AbstractNarration>One little-publicized aspect of human-caused, global change has been a doubling of the availability of nitrogen to plants via the manufacture of fertilizer and the burning of fossil fuels. Nitrogen is the element that most strongly limits plant growth on land, so one ecological consequence is likely to be a rise in the total productivity of plants. A more surprising and opposite consequence could be a fall in a major, natural source of nitrogen for plants, the association between species of plants in the Pea Family, known as legumes; and root-dwelling bacteria, known as rhizobia, which convert nitrogen gas in the air into ammonium, a form of nitrogen that plants use to make proteins and other molecules essential for life. Legumes that can get more nitrogen directly from the soil tend less to associate with rhizobia, which demand carbohydrates from the plants. Over time, global change in nitrogen is thus predicted to reduce the abundance of rhizobia and drive the evolution of less cooperative rhizobia that make less nitrogen available to the plants. This could in turn increase reliance on synthetic fertilizers, and feedback upon the global nitrogen cycle. This project will use an existing, 22-year-old experiment in nitrogen addition experiment at the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site at the Kellogg Biological Station as a window onto what may happen to the natural nitrogen supply over the decades to come. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include applications to agriculture, research training for students, and promotion of diversity in the scientific workforce. A number of cropping systems, including the rotation of soybeans and corn, use the association between legumes and rhizobia as a source of nitrogen. Inquiry-based labs for two large undergraduate courses will be based on the project and submitted for publication by Teaching Issues and Experiments in Ecology, a widely used resource for science educators. To promote equitability and diversity in the academic community, the project will create web-based materials and organize panel discussions that will guide undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds through the process of applying to and succeeding in graduate school.</AbstractNarration>
