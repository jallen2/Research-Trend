    <AbstractNarration>Determining the effect of climate change on the carbon dynamics of the high elevation tropical humid puna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent scientific evidence shows that global temperatures are increasing. The effects of increased temperatures are expected to be more dramatic in polar regions, however, the tropics may also be especially susceptible to warming as a result of the specialization of tropical species to a narrow range of climatic conditions coupled with rapid rates of warming. Nevertheless, investigation of the potential effects of warming in tropical ecosystems has been extremely limited. Humid puna lands - grasslands located at high elevations in the Andes Mountains of South America - harbor fragile ecosystems with a high level of endemism; puna areas also are under high pressure as a result of fire, grazing, and climate change. Human populations, such as native Quechua, depend on puna ecosystems for subsistence. To better understand potential responses of high elevation tropical ecosystems to climate change, a thermal and hydrological manipulation experiment will be conducted to determine the potential effects of climate change on the high elevation humid puna ecosystem of the tropical Andes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the tenure of the fellowship, the Fellow will focus effort on the development and strengthening of quantitative skills, statistical analysis and model development. The Fellow will work on establishing experiments, and training and mentoring local Peruvian technicians and undergraduate and graduate students from the USA. Additionally, the proposed sponsoring institution, The Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (FTBG), represents a unique outreach opportunity by translating research into activities and programs that can be used for environmental education of K-12 students and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
