    <AbstractNarration>Genome duplication, which creates individuals with twice the genetic content, is a common phenomenon in the plant kingdom and an important contributor to the diversity of life. Though it has been increasingly recognized as important, little is known about the evolutionary processes that generate duplicated genomes and result in new species. To enhance our understanding of this process, the PIs study the plant Arabidopsis arenosa, a species that has two types of populations. One type has duplicated genomes (tetraploids) and the other type has the typical ancestral genome size (diploids). The PIs are currently collecting DNA sequence data from many tetraploid populations to learn about their evolutionary history, but having these same data from the diploid progenitor is crucial for understanding the context in which the tetraploids arose. DDIG funds will be used to collect more individuals that have duplicated genomes so that comparisons between the type types of populations can provide insight into speciation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will not only elucidate the biological processes that give rise to evolutionary novelty but will also train aspiring scientists who will travel to eastern Europe to collect plants and extract their DNA back in the US. The results will be presented to the scientific community and general public to increase awareness of this important evolutionary process. High school students will also benefit through an online organization called Planting Science that allows researchers to mentor young, aspiring students.</AbstractNarration>
