    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Shay Mailloux of Clarkson University to conduct a research project, entitled "Self-Assembled Nanowire Arrays for Electrocatalytic and Biocatalytic Applications" during the summer of 2012 at The University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The host scientist is Professor Justin Gooding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project involves taking the first step in fundamental studies focusing on understanding how magneto-assisted self-assembling of nano-structured interfaces can be used for tunable interfacial properties. The proposed research addresses the key issues of novel biocatalytic applications for biosensing and biofuel cells. The experimental design of a general interfacial platform is being advanced for various biocatalytic and bioelectrocatalytic systems. Among the potential uses of the improved systems include new biosensors and biofuel cells, as well as biomedical and environmental applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
