    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The 2012 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in Marine Microbes will be held in conjunction with each other from June 23-24 and June 24-29, respectively, in Barga (Lucca), Italy. The GRC is an international forum for cutting edge research in the ecology, evolution and function of the microbial community in the ocean, while the GRS is a young researcher-centric meeting bringing together students and postdocs to discuss cutting edge research, create informal networks among peers, and gain experience/confidence for participation in the following GRC. Funds are requested to help support participation in the GRC and GRS by students and postdocs and to partially cover the registration for invited speakers. Marine microbes occupy an important role in the biosphere by making up the bottom of the marine food web, performing energy and nutrient transformations, and performing a wide range of still unknown metabolic and physiological processes with implications for our own survival on the planet. They comprise 98 per cent of the biomass of the world's oceans, supply more than half the world's oxygen, are the major processors of the world's greenhouse gases and have the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change. They are also the cause of diseases that are suspected to be spreading due to global warming, yet produce compounds which are potential cures and solutions for combating human diseases. This meeting represents one of the only opportunities for researchers to come together and discuss marine microbes specifically and in depth, and will be important in defining the future of the field. The special format of the Conference, with a maximum of 180 participants allowed, morning sessions, followed by free afternoons and afterwards evening sessions, is specially designed to foster interaction and promote the free exchange of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The GRC program will cover several aspects of marine microbial research, from "omics" and other emerging technologies to physiology, chemical ecology and ecosystem scale science. The best science in the field will be presented by both younger and more established top scientists during invited and contributed oral and poster presentations. Specific sessions will be dedicated to current controversies in the field, where different points of view will be presented and discussed, hopefully provoking critical thinking and a consensus. The location of this meeting in Italy will provide a pleasant and informal setting with many opportunities for casual interactions and ensure that the meeting is truly international, with the hope of sparking new international collaborations. The addition of the GRS for the first time this year will increase participation by young researchers, giving them a chance to meet the leaders in our field while also forming linkages within their own peer group that may lead to future collaborations. The GRS has only a limited educational component from senior researchers, because it is committed to bringing young scientists together to discuss their current research and build informal networks with the support of leading scientists from the associated GRC. The GRS program will consist of talks and poster sessions from the participants, along with time for formal and informal discussions of the research presented. The mentoring component will be provided by a plenary talk from Prof. E.V. Armbrust from the University of Washington, Seattle, and a mentoring panel entitled "How do I fund my research"? led by Prof. Lisa Campbell from Texas A&amp;M University, College Station and Johanna Wesnigk from the German Northwest Marine Research Association. The GRS is expected to have ~50 participants, and all attendees are encouraged to attend the associated GRC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The GRC and GRS will have an impact on the community of marine microbial researchers for years to come. By promoting debates and free thinking, these meetings will foster national and international collaboration between participants, both among established researchers, and those just getting started. With the inclusion of the GRS, these meetings will also promote the careers of young researchers by giving them exposure and time to interact with established researchers in the field. In addition, the mentoring at the GRS will help prepare young researchers for careers in academia, and the discussions at the GRC will help them form personal perspectives on key issues of relevance to the study of marine microbes</AbstractNarration>
