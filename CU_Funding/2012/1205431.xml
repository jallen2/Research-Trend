    <AbstractNarration>The award is to design a compact electron storage ring with circumference about 3 m capable of producing X-rays at energy 5 to 80 KeV, by employing inverse Compton scattering of laser at 800 nm wave length with electron beams at 20-60 MeV. The photon flux is estimated to be about 100 billion photons/second. The award will evaluate effects of the collective instability, intrabeam scattering and Touschek lifetime. We will carry out experiments at the ALPHA stroage ring to characterize beam properties. In addition to the compact light source, the award will carry out design of a compact proton storage ring at energy of about 300 MeV. Such proton storage rings can provide industial and medical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is to investigate beam dynamics problems associated with high brightness low energy storage rings and its applications in the generation of inverse Compton X-ray source, and possibly coherent light sources. This award is also intended to investigate physics associated with high power accelerators. Topics associated with high power accelerators are space charge physics, synchrobetatron coupling, nonlinear beam dynamics and collective beam instabilities. The award activities also include training of future accelearator scientists.</AbstractNarration>
