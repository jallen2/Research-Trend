    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the PIs will investigate the consequences of recent observations that the dynamics of the cell scaffolding is wavelike in many biological processes - from amoeboid chemotaxis to development. The PI's goal is to elucidate how this wave-like characteristic of the motility machinery affects navigation of cells in complex environments, and collective behavior of cell groups. The PIs will use D. discoideum as a model organism that exhibits both individual and collective cell migration behavior, and that exhibits wave-like protrusive activity even when cells are suspended without any surface contact. The specific goals are: 1. Wave-surface coupling: The PIs will analyze how waves interact with surfaces to generate forces and motion using micro-fabricated local adhesion patches and lines. The aim is to understand how patterns of adhesivity may direct migration and to integrate this insight into stochastic simulations of collective cell migration. 2. Cell-cell coupling: The PIs will measure how waves propagate through groups of cells that are in contact and integrate this finding in simulations. The aim is to elucidate mechanical aspects of cell-cell signaling and group migration. 3. Triggering waves and resonances: the PIs will use the strengths of their team in nonlinear dynamics, microfabrication, and quantitative studies of amoeboid cell migration, to achieve these goals. The PIs will carry out the proposed work through the combination of expertise in controlled 3D microfabrication and surface functionalization of local adhesion patches, systematic shape dynamics quantification, and stochastic modeling of collective dynamics. To make their findings broadly accessible, the PIs will also develop a series of videos for YouTube that will highlight wavelike cell migration and cell-cell communication as a jumping point to introduce different scientific topics at a level that is suitable for the general public. The PI will train women and underrepresented minorities in this research program. All students will receive highly interdisciplinary training involving elements of biophysics and materials science.</AbstractNarration>
