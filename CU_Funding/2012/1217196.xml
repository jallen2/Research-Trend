    <AbstractNarration>The last decade has seen a rapid expansion of new minimally-invasive treatments, for instance in structural heart repair, where certain market needs are not well addressed. For example, controlled delivery of bulky devices from small bore endovascular catheter-based delivery systems can be a challenge. Teflon surface modification exists in the marketplace today, but shortcomings of this approach related to performance and price present significant market needs. This project is investigating the ability of bionanocomposite coatings developed to produce comparable transformative lubricity and biocompatibility performance in bio-medical conditions as already seen in fundamental lab experiments. This class of high performing nanocomposites has not previously been successfully implemented in such applications, mainly due to insufficient mechanical durability. This long-standing hurdle has recently been overcome by the team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This innovation effort will enhance scientific and technological understanding by paving the way for transferring superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials out of the lab and into the bio-medical field. Stemming from discussions with potential partners, the transformative improvements in lubricity and hemocompatibility are believed to be ideally suited to endovascular delivery catheters (for improved lubricity) and stents (for improved hemocompatibility). The 50-90% reductions in liquid friction gleaned from the fundamental research, combined with the recent mechanical durability achievements should allow for disruptive enhancements in lubricious coatings to improve access, deliverability, and predictable deployment of such medical devices. These coatings could vastly reduce side effects, accelerate natural healing processes, and may even improve hemocompatibility. With the proposed I-Corps project, it is also planned to grow the small entrepreneurship program at UVA by involving undergraduate students and expanding the facilities in creating a high-profile effort to transition a potentially disruptive technology out of a university lab and into the market and grow the local innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem.</AbstractNarration>
