    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to conduct an international series of four face-to-face workshops&lt;br/&gt;to assess quantitatively the potential and status of four topics related to research on nanoelectronics&lt;br/&gt;devices and materials. The topics are: Emerging Research Memory Devices, Emerging Research&lt;br/&gt;Logic Devices, Emerging Research Architectures, and Emerging Research Materials critical for&lt;br/&gt;the realization of specific nanoelectronics devices. Participants and contributors to these&lt;br/&gt;workshops will include academic and industrial domain experts. The outputs of these workshops&lt;br/&gt;will guide and input preparation of the 2013 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors&lt;br/&gt;chapters on Emerging Research Devices and Emerging Research Materials. This grant will&lt;br/&gt;be used to pay partial travel expenses for some presenters, particularly academics, requesting&lt;br/&gt;travel assistance.&lt;br/&gt;The workshops series will focus on the relationship between the Semiconductor Industry as&lt;br/&gt;it endeavors to continue to advance semiconductor technology and the work of the National&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) research community. One purpose of these meetings is to evaluate&lt;br/&gt;the potential and status of each specific nanotechnology entry identified by the ITRS ERD/ERM&lt;br/&gt;Working Groups as having potential to enable a new paradigm for information processing. Another&lt;br/&gt;purpose is to identify research opportunities that, if addressed, will benefit the Semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;Industry and fall within the scope of the NNI research agenda. Presenters will be provided&lt;br/&gt;with a list of questions that are intended to stimulate discussions during the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;Each workshop will be documented by a report described below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;In bringing together leading academic and industrial scientists to discuss, debate and reach&lt;br/&gt;consensus on the potential performance and key scientific challenges related to several emerging&lt;br/&gt;research memory and logic device technologies, these workshops will provide an excellent forum&lt;br/&gt;for intellectual pursuit and discernment of important/limiting scientific issues related to&lt;br/&gt;approaches to information processing. The intellectual merit of these workshops is illustrated&lt;br/&gt;by way of example.&lt;br/&gt;In the first example, the physics of operation and extreme scaling projections are not well&lt;br/&gt;understood for ?select devices? required for use in nanoscale memory arrays. These select&lt;br/&gt;devices are needed to employ a new class of non-volatile memory cells, called resistive random&lt;br/&gt;access memory (ReRAM),that may replace NAND flash for technology generations beyond the 16nm&lt;br/&gt;technology node. Generally speaking, a memory cell in an array can be viewed as being composed&lt;br/&gt;of two fundamental components: a ?storage node?, which is usually characterized by the physics&lt;br/&gt;of operation of the particular memory device used, and a ?selector?. The selector is a device&lt;br/&gt;which allows a given memory cell in an array to be singularly addressed for read or write&lt;br/&gt;operation without addressing its nearest neighbor cells. It is a non-linear element, which&lt;br/&gt;can operate as a switch, such as a diode-type, or as a resistive-switch-type structure. The&lt;br/&gt;latter category includes novel concepts such as Mott switches, threshold switches, and mixed&lt;br/&gt;ionic electronic conduction switches. Understanding the dominant physics related to their&lt;br/&gt;non-linear I-V characteristics is essential to employing these select devices in a highly&lt;br/&gt;dense non-volatile ReRAM crossbar architecture. It should be noted that for several advanced&lt;br/&gt;concepts of ReRAM, the storage node in principle can be scaled down below 10 nm, and the memory&lt;br/&gt;density will be limited by a somewhat larger conventional three-terminal select device. Thus&lt;br/&gt;the select device represents a serious bottleneck for scaling a ReRAM memory cell to 16 nm&lt;br/&gt;and beyond. Application of these new non-volatile memory devices to a crossbar memory structure&lt;br/&gt;will enable a paradigm shift to a new storage class memory (SCM) off-chip memory architecture&lt;br/&gt;discussed below.&lt;br/&gt;Another example, related to logic, is a family of new nanoelectronic low subthreshold-swing&lt;br/&gt;devices: e.g., negative Cg devices. These devices offer the attractive possibility of performing&lt;br/&gt;high speed logic while dissipating much lower power compared to a conventional MOSFET. The&lt;br/&gt;circuit design and the academic research communities have a expressed a strong interest for&lt;br/&gt;the ERD Technical Working Group to explore the physics of operation of these devices and the&lt;br/&gt;circuit design space in which they can operate in order to better understand their potential&lt;br/&gt;performance. This information will provide important input to these communities regarding&lt;br/&gt;their accelerating development of low-power electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;By carefully assessing the potential performance and scientific/technological challenges for&lt;br/&gt;each new memory select device and of new low-power logic devices, as well as emerging architectures,&lt;br/&gt;these workshops will provide important documented inputs to the research community as they&lt;br/&gt;pursue their exploration of many emerging research devices.&lt;br/&gt;One venue being initiated to obtain broad dissemination of this information is the editing&lt;br/&gt;and publication of a comprehensive book on nanoelectronics entitled ?Emerging Nanoelectronic&lt;br/&gt;Devices?. A proposal is under review by a major publisher who has expressed considerable interest.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the educational value and planning impact of these workshops on the international&lt;br/&gt;research community are quite substantial. Several universities (e.g., Stanford, U. Minnesota,&lt;br/&gt;U. Tokyo,?) use the ITRS chapters on Emerging Research Devices and Emerging Research Materials&lt;br/&gt;resulting from these workshops as texts in their Nanoelectronics courses. Also several international&lt;br/&gt;research funding agencies (e.g., SRC, NSF, and NIST Nanoelectronics Research Initiative, the&lt;br/&gt;EU Framework Program 8, ?) use the material in these chapters as inputs to their decisions&lt;br/&gt;on research directions in their Nanoelectronics research programs.</AbstractNarration>
