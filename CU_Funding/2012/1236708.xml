    <AbstractNarration>PI: Varanasi, Sasidhar&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1236708&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Toledo&lt;br/&gt;Title: Simultaneous Isomerization and Reactive Extraction of Biomass Sugars for Efficient Furan Production via High Yield Ketose Intermediate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cost of biofuels can be lowered by reducing the process steps needed for production. FConversion of biomass sugars with high yields to their ketose forms can immensely facilitate one-pot synthesis of fuels/chemicals. Aldose to ketose isomerization, however, has a very unfavorable equilibrium, and high yield conversion to ketoses in a manner that allows for further conversion economically has yet to be demonstrated. The goal of this project is to develop a novel simultaneous isomerization and reactive-extraction ? followed by back-extraction ? strategy that produces high yield, high concentration ketose sugars (in pure form) from biomass hydrolysate without significant energy inputs. Another feature of the technology with significant economic implications is the ability to produce separate, high-purity xylulose and fructose sugars from hydrolysate containing glucose and xylose, affording flexibility with downstream processing options. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology will allow for the direct back-extraction of ketoses into acid-containing, benign reaction media (such as room temperature ionic liquids); such media are ideal for high yield conversion of ketoses to furans under facile conditions. Hydrogenation products of these furans, such as dimethylfuran and dimethyltetrahydrofuran, are suggested as ?drop-in? liquid transportation fuels.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed project - The potential impact of the proposed technology is immense due to its green and sustainable features. This technology (i) allows for recovery of the sugars in a form (ketose) that is readily amenable to conversion to value-added products with fewer processing steps, leading to reduced processing costs; (ii) eliminates the need for hydrolysate conditioning and the accompanying solid-waste disposal issues; (iii) eliminates energy-intensive evaporation-based sugar-concentration methods; (iv) is based the recycle and reuse of the isomerization catalyst, the sugar complexing agents, and the organic extraction media; (v) requires facile temperature and pH conditions that prevent sugar degradation and minimize cost associated with pH and temperature adjustment; and (vi) allows for in situ room temperature production of furans in high yields with no disposable waste streams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An essential part of this project is the training and education of graduate and undergraduate students. The wide scope of this project, from renewable biomass feedstock to the end product of liquid transportation fuels, will allow student researchers to acquire broad-based training in green engineering methods, analytical techniques, biomass pretreatment, enzyme catalysis, and reactions and separations. Additional outreach activities will allow for a wide dissemination of biofuels knowledge and training of students at large.</AbstractNarration>
