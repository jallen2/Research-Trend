    <AbstractNarration>This Innovation Corps project proposes technology that will develop a functional handheld prototype to be used in animal studies and in clinical trials for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of pre-cancers of the skin. The bench prototype will address a large area (2 cm x 2 cm) prototype that responds to clinical needs. The PI and her team anticipate that the breakthrough in the illumination delivery offered by the prototype device will enable a targeted treatment of pre-cancerous conditions of the skin with PDT in a dermatology office. The treatment to be offered will be complementary to the current FDA approved treatment for AK that consists of illuminating the whole anatomic area. In addition, the dosimetry calculations of PDT will critically benefit from the known illumination provided. PDT, a minimally invasive procedure, will be a key to lowering the cost of healthcare; by promoting a more effective treatment, increasing patient compliance (which is key to lowering healthcare cost) for early screening and early treatment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed technology will improve the current skin PDT treatment by making it more effective, ultimately reducing the number of patient visits needed. For oral cancer, the proposed optical devices will make the treatment cheaper, faster, minimally invasive and more comfortable for the patient, by targeting light to the lesion and not requiring any shielding procedure.</AbstractNarration>
