    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Kyana Young of University of Wisconsin - Madison to conduct a research project, entitled "Detection of Harmful Disinfectants Caused by Water Treatment" during the summer of 2012 at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. The host scientist is Dr. Yang Xin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in understanding and mitigating risks as a result of inadequate treatment of water where and when an established water infrastructure is unavailable, for example, post war and post natural disaster situations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A point-of-use treatment device that uses a photoelectrocatalytic oxidation (PECO) method can generate chlorine to purify water. However, when treating natural water which contains naturally-occurring organic matter (NOM) and heavily contaminated water to provide drinking water, disinfection by-products (DBP) must be monitored to ensure that potentially harmful chemicals are not produced or do not remain in the drinking water. In this research, raw water samples from five regions in China are being treated with the treatment device and tested for the presence of DBPs formed during treatment. Analytical techniques include gas chromatography and membrane introduction mass spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
