    <AbstractNarration>The International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project is a core project under the auspices of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and is co-sponsored by the international Commission on Atmospheric Composition and Global Pollution (iCACGP). IGAC's mission is to coordinate and foster atmospheric chemistry research towards a sustainable world. IGAC's priorities and activities are guided by an international volunteer Scientific Steering Committee (SSC). The IGAC International Project Office (IPO) is responsible for fostering implementation of the SSC priorities by facilitating international collaboration in field campaigns, organizing international efforts to address specific scientific issues, and coordinating the preparation of synthesis and assessment documents. This award through the Atmospheric Chemistry Program is NSF's component of larger funding package provided in collaboration with NASA's Tropospheric Chemistry Program and NOAA's Atmospheric Composition and Climate Program to support the IGAC IPO for the next three years. These funds will cover operating costs for the IPO including salaries, supplies, computer/web page maintenance costs, and travel expenses. Funds will also support travel for early career scientist and scientists in developing countries to participate in workshops and conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGAC contributes to the international atmospheric chemistry community, the wider earth system research community, and stakeholders both by advancing atmospheric chemistry research and contributing to understanding earth system sustainability science. It also builds scientific capacity globally by engaging early-career scientists and scientists from developing countries through travel grants to IGAC sponsored workshops, meetings, and conferences and by featuring their work in the IGAC newsletter. IGAC broadly communicates results of atmospheric chemistry research to the scientific community, policy makers, and the broader public through its newsletter, web site, email announcements, and conference presentations.</AbstractNarration>
