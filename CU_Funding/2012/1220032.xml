    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research aims to identify mechanisms of ocean acidification and carbonate undersaturation in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean. The investigators will use a 3-year dataset to address the role of two specific mechanisms involving sea-ice processes: (1) surface water freshening and undersaturation resulting from recent enhanced melting of multi-year sea-ice, and (2) surface water undersaturation resulting from a "carbon-pumping" mechanism driven by brine rejection and carbonate mineral precipitation during increasingly cyclical seasonal sea ice growth and decay. The proposed work would expand understanding of the inorganic carbon cycle, air-sea CO2 exchange rates and acidification in the Arctic Ocean. Understanding baselines and how they are changing is important for setting realistic parameters for process studies on the effects of ocean acidification on flora and fauna. The investigators would participate in one upcoming (2012) research cruise and analyze these data along with that from two previous (2010 and 2011) expeditions. The investigators propose to continue an outreach website initiated on the 2011 expedition, including background about the cruise and ocean acidification, a journal depicting different days? activities, a mechanism for the public to ask questions regarding the cruise and our research and answers to those questions, and an education and outreach page with material on ocean acidification. The proposed research will also contribute to graduate student education, and facilitate collaboration between university (USF) and government (USGS) scientists.</AbstractNarration>
