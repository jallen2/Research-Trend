    <AbstractNarration>The proposed Urban Massachusetts LSAMP (UMLSAMP), consisting of eight institutions located in the Eastern Region of the Commonwealth, will expand and scale up its existing programs that help URM students start on-track and stay on-track, thus significantly improving the probability of their successful and timely graduation. The Mid-Level Alliance will assist the participating institutions with implementing a proactive student-centered approach, which employs student learning communities as fundamental elements. The specific project goals are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-A 50% increase in the number of Black, Hispanic, and Native American students with majors in STEM fields &lt;br/&gt;-A 150% increase in the number of BS STEM degrees awarded to Black, Hispanic, and Native American students &lt;br/&gt;-A 150% increase in the number of students who successfully transfer from Alliance community colleges into BS STEM majors &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the Mid-Level Alliance will be generated through several foundational project objectives: 1. Increase recruitment, retention and graduation rates, particularly for underrepresented students; 2. Provide LS-AMP Scholars with research and internship opportunities; 3. Promote institutionalized adoption of successful models; 4. Create synergies for STEM student success through interactions across the Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lessons learned, success stories and other programmatic outputs will be documented and disseminated through online communication channels, participation in national and international student success and STEM related conferences and workshops, and peer-reviewed publications.</AbstractNarration>
