    <AbstractNarration>The NSF Sustainable Energy pathways (SEP) Program, under the umbrella of the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative, will support the research program of Prof. Shulin Chen and co-workers at Washington State University, University of Georgia and University of Minnesota. The vision for this SEP project is to develop sustainable energy systems through a biomimicry pathway inspired by natural biological systems. The central hypothesis of this project is that wood feeding termites harbor biocatalysts that modify lignin structure in order to improve the accessibility to and functionality of saccharifying enzymes. New knowledge about the reaction mechanisms and enzyme systems in termites will provide the required critical insights for designing new methods to break lignocellulosic biomass. A nature-inspired lignocellulose processing system can be developed by building upon a stepwise lignin degrading catalytic process, and by mimicking the termite system. The objective of the project will be accomplished by achieving four specific aims: (1) elucidating the mechanism of selective lignin modifications in wood feeding termite and evaluating the alleviated inhibition effect of lignin on cellulase, (2) identifying, locating, expressing, and characterizing new lignin modifying enzymes of the termite, (3) integrating biomimetic approaches with interdisciplinary sciences to develop a nature-inspired lignocellulose processing system, and (4) conducting sustainability and social acceptance analysis of the biologically inspired energy system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the SEP program goal in terms of societal, economic, environmental, and education /workforce development imperatives. The project will benefit the society by producing new knowledge and highly competent professionals for building an innovative sustainable pathway to secure energy future, to strengthen sustainable economic development, and to combat climate changes. It is anticipated that the project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. The complexity and scientific challenges will enhance interdisciplinary learning and training. Minority students will participate in this project thus broadening the participation of under-represented groups. The research opportunity for K-12 students will promote science and engineering interests to the next generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the project will produce multiple impacts: The research activities will yield new transformative knowledge and enabling tools that may lead breakthroughs in the fundamental science needed for the development of a biofuel industry to achieve the mandated national biofuel goals. It will demonstrate the possibilities and scientific challenges in employing nature-inspired systems for the development of robust, effective, and environmentally-friendly biorefineries. The project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education through fostering collaborations among the members of the consortium. The results will enhance scientific and technological understanding through broad dissemination to the public, the scientific community and industry.</AbstractNarration>
