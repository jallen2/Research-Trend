    <AbstractNarration>One of the cornerstones of modern cryptography is that new constructions of cryptographic protocols should be accompanied by a proof of security. Such proofs show that a construction satisfies a given definition of security, under certain assumptions and in a specific model. Widely used models include various forms of setup (such as the existence of a public-key infrastructure or common reference string); idealized models such as the random oracle model where a hash function is treated as a truly random function; or hardware models where physical devices with some additional functionality are assumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the models used widely in cryptography are still poorly understood, especially insofar as their relation to practice. The goal of this work is to develop a better understanding of these models, investigating in particular their relations and implications; the possibility of constructing cryptographic protocols in weaker (or at least incomparable) models; and the feasibility of designing schemes with "fallback" security that provide more basic security guarantees in case the assumed model fails.</AbstractNarration>
