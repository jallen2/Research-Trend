    <AbstractNarration>Numerical models are a critical tool in many disciplines for generating and testing hypotheses, examining sensitivity to perturbation, hindcasting or filling in data gaps, and making predictions about future behavior. Numerical experiments offer advantages over field or laboratory experiments in that they provide complete control over critical variables and can expand the spatial and temporal scales over which experiments are run. Although improvements in computing technology have allowed for highly detailed simulations, does the ability to see everything (i.e., the perfect experiment) improve our overall understanding of phenomena? An alternative to highly detailed simulations, reduced complexity models (RCMs) have persisted and are even becoming more pervasive in the environmental sciences. RCMs offer advantages in their ability to couple physical, biological, and chemical dynamics and provide highly intuitive yet quantitative understanding of system behavior and sensitivities. However, these advantages depend on the rigor of the processes simulated and the assumptions involved in model simplification. A diverse array of assumptions and strategies used in formulating RCMs is present in ecology, hydrology, climate science, and other environmental science fields, highlighting a need for the community to come together for synthesis. In this workshop, participants from diverse fields will come together to discuss common strategies for reducing complexity in models, probe assumptions, and evaluate issues of scale and parameterization of RCMs. Strategies for testing the rigor of RCM processes and assumptions using direct numerical simulations, physical models, and/or databases will also be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RCMs are common elements of larger climate change simulations and are also used to predict how large ecosystems such as deltas, wetlands, and desert landscapes will likely change as a result of restoration, urbanization, and/or changes in climate. The workshop will result in tools for the scientific community that will make the use of RCMs more efficient, reliable, and effective for use in management of thee complex environmental systems. The tools include online resources (code, model test cases, data, descriptions of common steps in formulating RCMs) that will help streamline and validate RCM development. Two synthesis papers, targeted for general publications of geophysical and ecological societies will also result. Because of their simplicity and their ability to produce intuitive understanding of how complex environmental systems function, RCMs, or ?toy models,? are an ideal teaching tool. Part of the workshop will focus on developing online teaching resources using RCMs. An additional workshop session focused on graduate student research will reinforce an emphasis on training a diverse assemblage of early-career scientists.</AbstractNarration>
