    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor T. Don Tilley and his research group in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, will conduct fundamental studies of structure, bonding, and reactivity in new transition metal-main group complexes, with a particular focus on complexes with silylene ligands, LnM=SiRR'. This research is designed to provide an understanding of the mechanism and scope of a new type of hydrosilation reaction discovered in this program. This work will guide the way to more challenging catalytic hydrosilation substrates, and to other catalytic systems that utilize cost-effective, earth-abundant metals such as iron, cobalt and nickel. Efficient catalysis with first row metals is a pervasive theme attracting strong interest in the research and industrial catalysis communities, and it is therefore important to learn how such catalysts may operate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this research relate to its development of new strategies for chemical conversions having potential applications in drug development, polymer and materials synthesis, and the large-scale production of value-added chemicals. The proposed basic research will contribute to the knowledge base chemists use to design new catalytic reactions that will contribute to sustainability. Furthermore, the proposed research is well suited for the training of young scientists. In addition, the PI and students involved in this project regularly participate in and lead outreach activities, such as the training of local high school students and presenting science demonstrations at a local middle school. Notably, a collaborative effort within the research group involves planning and presenting science lessons to grade school students. Group members travel to nearby elementary schools (at least two each month) and teach basic scientific principles, hoping to improve early STEM education and encourage budding scientists.</AbstractNarration>
