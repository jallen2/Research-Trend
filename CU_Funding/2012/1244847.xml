    <AbstractNarration>This project is comparing the effectiveness of different active learning modules (ALM) designed to increase student understanding of cell biology in a large lecture environment. The activities are focused on three central processes in cell biology: protein translation, eukaryotic gene regulation, and the cell cycle. These processes are fundamental to an understanding of how cells function; and, due to their complexity, present significant teaching challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of integrating active learning into the college science classroom. However, two questions then arise: Are all active learning strategies equally effective? Are some strategies better for specific topics than are others? In this study the ALMs are being tested in a large-enrollment course at the University of Washington that has already implemented teaching innovations such as peer TAs, automated response systems (clickers) and some guided group activities. ALM effectiveness is being measured in terms of how much students learn and how engaged they are in the different activities. Learning gains are being measured by comparing student performance on validated tests. Data on student perception and engagement are being gathered from student focus groups convened after each activity and videotape analysis of student participation during each activity. The ALMs are also being measured in terms of their relative 'cost' to design and execute in a large classroom. This study will result in the production of research-validated in-class activities that promote student learning in cell biology. Direct comparison of different active learning strategies will provide insight into what elements make one strategy more effective than another for teaching a particular concept. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;Improvement of STEM education requires an appreciation for the relative benefits of different teaching strategies for diverse populations of students. This study investigates the interplay between topic, active learning strategy and demographics with the goal of identifying active learning strategies that are effective for a broad population of students. There is evidence that collaborative learning exercises have a particularly beneficial impact on underrepresented groups, suggesting that advances in designing collaborative active learning strategies may play a significant role in decreasing the 'learning gap' in STEM classrooms. The activities developed and tested in this study will be made available for distribution to other institutions and thus have potential to impact the approximately 300,000 students who take introductory biology in the U.S. each year. Further, an improved understanding of the relative benefits and challenges of different active learning strategies may help guide future resource allocation decisions by STEM educators in terms of faculty development and design of instructional materials. Training of a postdoctoral scholar and involvement of undergraduates as research assistants will help broaden the base of young professionals with experience in STEM education research and contribute to the development of a growing national STEM education network in the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
