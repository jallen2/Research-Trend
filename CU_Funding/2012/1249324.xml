    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Massachusetts Boston to manage, in collaboration with the BIO REU Leadership Committee, the BIO REU Travel Scholarship and Just-in-Time review programs. Biology REU programs are dynamic and multi-disciplinary. To ensure that students appreciate the full scope of "doing science" it is crucial that students are able to present their work to their scientific peers. To enable students to present their work in poster, oral, or written form this program will offer electronic submission and rapid review of research products. BIO REU student research materials will be reviewed by graduate research students from across the US providing not only content review but also an expanded network of near-peer mentors, further strengthening the impact of the BIO REU experience. In addition the program provides travel scholarships for students to attend and present their research at scientific meetings. These meetings are the ideal venue to ensure that students fulfill the research experience which culminates in peer-review of their work. The goal of both programs is to support undergraduate researchers to publish and/or present their research to the scientific community ensuring that research results are disseminated broadly. Students will apply for funds and/or submit their research materials for review on-line at http://www.bioreu.org. Just-in-Time review will utilize cutting-edge real-time editing and response tools ensuring that students receive feedback quickly. Applications for travel will be reviewed by a selection sub-committee of the BIO REU Leadership Council and will include the abstract submitted for presentation, letters of recommendation from REU mentors and site directors as well as an essay from the student regarding the anticipated professional development outcomes of attendance and presentation. Travel awards will be based on student application materials with priority given for one student award per REU site. Students will, in addition to presenting their research, have the opportunity to share their presentation/poster with the broader REU community through the BIO REU website. For additional information visit http://www.bioreu.org or contact Dr. Robyn Hannigan (Robyn.Hannigan@umb.edu).</AbstractNarration>
