    <AbstractNarration>A Hydrogeophysics workshop will be held 8-11 July 2012 at the Boise State University. The conference will address current hydrogeophysical approaches to predicting and/or monitoring hydrologic properties and processes in both the saturated and unsaturated zones, at scales ranging from centimeters to watersheds. The conference will also include ?homework sessions? that will enable attendees to independently analyze a shared dataset, which will provide insight into uncertainty in solutions, differences in processing algorithms, as well as variations in rock physics assumptions. The workshop will enable the hydrogeophysics community to come together to think creatively about new ways to share resources (people, equipment, access to field sites) to advance the science. Discussion will be organized into a white paper designed to provide a statement of the current state of the art. The meeting is open and students are encouraged to attend.</AbstractNarration>
