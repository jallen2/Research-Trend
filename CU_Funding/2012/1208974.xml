    <AbstractNarration>Climatic warming is shifting where species occur, disrupting interactions among them, and altering how ecosystems work. In collaboration with scientists from Vermont, Massachusetts, and North Carolina, the proposed research uses an experimental temperature manipulation at field sites in North Carolina and Massachusetts to examine the impact of temperature on ant communities and their influence on the rest of the ecosystem. Many plants in eastern forests rely on ants to disperse their seeds, but it is unknown how changes in climate might affect how, or whether, ants disperse seeds. In some cases, warmer temperatures might increase seed dispersal by ants, but in others, it might totally shut down seed dispersal because some important ant species go locally extinct and are replaced by species that do not disperse seeds. This study will examine the potential for warming to indirectly affect plant community composition through changes in seed dispersal mutualisms. Additionally, this research will seek to determine traits indicative of species that respond strongly to climate change. Results of this research will provide a better understanding of the often complex and idiosyncratic responses of biodiversity to warming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is little doubt that changes in temperature are causing species to move outside of their historic ranges and are affecting interactions among species. Understanding the mechanisms driving these shifts, and predicting the consequences, will enhance our ability to plan for and mitigate the effects of warming on ecosystems. This project will educate and prepare students for future careers in science by involving undergraduate researchers from diverse backgrounds and geographic regions on all aspects of conducting environmental research. The warming project also has a strong public outreach component, which is key to informing the general public on this important issue.</AbstractNarration>
