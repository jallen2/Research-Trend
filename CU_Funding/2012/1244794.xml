    <AbstractNarration>The ACM Special Interest Group on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Biomedical Informatics (SIGBioinformatics; http://www.sigbioinformatics.org/) has been instituted in 2010 with the aim of focusing on theory and practice of processing, storing, analyzing, mining and knowledge management of biological and biomedical data. The mission of ACM SIGBioinformatics is to support advanced research, training, and outreach in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Biomedical Informatics by stimulating interactions among researchers, educators and practitioners from related multi-disciplinary fields. The third ACM Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology will be held in Orlando, Florida in October 2012. As a flagship conference of ACM SIG Bioinformatics, it provides a premier forum for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research encompassing disciplines of computer science, mathematics, statistics, biology, bioinformatics, and biomedicine. This award provides travel support for 20 graduate students to attend the conference. This will allow the students to participate in the conference, workshop and tutorials. Additionally special activities such as a doctoral consortium and student poster session will be specifically targeted for them. Participation in premier research conferences in bioinformatics and computational biology is an integral component of doctoral research-based training. It will allow them to interact and network with and potentially collaborate with leading researchers in the discipline. In addition, it will provide them access to potential career opportunities for full time employment after graduation in industry, academia and government.</AbstractNarration>
