    <AbstractNarration>Software development is facing a paradigm shift towards ubiquitous&lt;br/&gt;concurrent programming, giving rise to software that is among the most&lt;br/&gt;complex technical artifacts ever created by humans. Concurrent programming&lt;br/&gt;presents several risks and dangers for programmers who are overwhelmed by puzzling &lt;br/&gt;and irreproducible concurrent program behavior, and by new types of bugs that elude &lt;br/&gt;traditional quality assurance techniques. If this situation is not addressed, we are &lt;br/&gt;drifting into an era of widespread unreliable software, with consequences ranging &lt;br/&gt;from collapsed programmer productivity, to catastrophic failures in mission-critical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will take steps against a concurrent software crisis, by&lt;br/&gt;producing verification technology that assists non-specialist programmers&lt;br/&gt;in detecting concurrency errors, or demonstrating their absence. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed technology will confront the concurrency explosion problem that&lt;br/&gt;verification methods often suffer from. The project's goal is a framework&lt;br/&gt;under which the analysis of programs with unbounded concurrency resources&lt;br/&gt;(such as threads of execution) can be soundly reduced to an analysis under&lt;br/&gt;a small constant resource bound, making the use of state space explorers&lt;br/&gt;practical. As a result, the project will largely eliminate the impact of&lt;br/&gt;unspecified computational resources as the major cause of complexity in&lt;br/&gt;analyzing concurrent programs. By developing tools for detecting otherwise &lt;br/&gt;undetectable misbehavior and vulnerabilities in concurrent programs, the &lt;br/&gt;project will contribute its part to averting a looming software quality crisis.</AbstractNarration>
