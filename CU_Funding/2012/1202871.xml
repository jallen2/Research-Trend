    <AbstractNarration>Bats are one of the best examples of vertebrate evolutionary diversification and ecological specialization. Furthermore, bat reproductive physiology is extremely diverse and includes reproductive delays, interruptions in the sequence of events leading from insemination to birth. Due to their diverse reproductive physiologies, bats are an excellent system for asking questions about genital evolution. The hypothesis that bat genital morphology is influenced by sexual selection will be evaluated by performing an interspecific anatomical comparative study. The Fellow will determine if reproductive delays facilitate sexual selection, and examine the nearly undescribed female reproductive morphology in the context of male morphology. This study will make substantial contributions to our understanding of genital evolution and the role of delays in facilitating post-copulatory sexual selection, advancing knowledge of how sexual selection interacts with physiology and ecology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bat reproduction and ecology are linked. If, as predicted, climate change results in non-linear changes in cues previously used for timing reproduction, bats may mistime reproduction. This is particularly true for long-lived species with disjointed reproductive periods such as those with reproductive delays. Understanding the role of delays in reproduction will help us to predict high risk species. This project will include several undergraduates from diversity programs who will be trained in all of the project's methods and mentored for professional development. The Fellow will maintain her blog aimed at educating the public about science and bats and will encourage undergraduate researchers to maintain pages documenting their experiences.</AbstractNarration>
