    <AbstractNarration>PI: Padir&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1264588&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motivation The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate, design, implement and validate novel robotic technologies for assisting persons with general and age-related disabilities through undergraduate capstone design projects. The proposed work is also aimed at educating a new cadre of engineers who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the needs of individuals with disabilities and who are equipped with multidisciplinary design and analysis skills to significantly advance the field of robotics and contribute to the fast deployment of robots in direct collaboration with humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is significant and novel in many aspects. Utilizing recent research advances in autonomous robots as well as the rapid development in enabling technologies, we propose to design, develop and validate modular and hardware-software reconfigurable assistive robots in service of persons with disabilities. In particular, the proposed work will (i) develop user-centered designs for the next generation of personal assistive robots, (ii) develop (semi-)autonomy software modules for robot navigation and manipulation, (iii) design and implement intuitive control techniques that will rely upon the robot, human and interaction models, (iv) contribute to the design of replicable experiments in robotics research to test and validate systems, (v) train the next generation of robotics engineers and innovators by involving K-12 and undergraduate students in all aspects of the project. In view of these objectives, the proposed work will significantly advance the design of assistive robot technologies and systems that operate in close vicinity of individuals with general and age-related disabilities. The systems developed within the scope of the proposed capstone design projects will potentially lead to new scientific research directions in understanding the team dynamics in human-robot teams to advance the field of assistive robotics. Moreover, the proposed work will establish and enhance research and education collaborations between the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and UMass Medical School co-located in Worcester, Massachusetts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project will train a new generation of engineering students that can broadly address challenges of our society through directly involving undergraduate students in well-defined yet cutting-edge project-based implementation tasks. The highly multidisciplinary nature of the research and educational experience will impact undergraduate engineering and non-engineering students, as well as K-12 students. Moreover, undergraduate engineering students will receive multidisciplinary training on disabilities engineering. Hosting summer robotics programs in collaboration with WPI's Summer Programs Office, we offer research and learning engagement for middle and high-school students and impact curriculum development through participation. Because of the power of robotics-oriented activities to break down traditional cultural barriers that prevent students from realizing their potentials as engineers and/or as business leaders due to gender and racial bias in upbringing, we expect our work to positively impact the diversity of STEM disciplines. We will also continue to develop our educational collaborations with various Worcester middle and high-schools, Worcester Public Library as well as in the EcoTarium, Worcester's museum of science and nature to offer learning opportunities about the science and engineering of robots using. By introducing these educational activities revolving around robots, this project is aimed at increasing the awareness of STEM college and career choices along the lines advocated in the Rising Above the Gathering Storm report, and Changing the Conversation: Messages for Improving Public Understanding of Engineering (The National Academies Press).</AbstractNarration>
