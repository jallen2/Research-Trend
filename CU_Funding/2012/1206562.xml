    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into fuels has an enormous potential to address both greenhouse emission issues and sustainable energy challenges. Significant challenges exist in producing materials, which can facilitate this conversion by utilizing solar energy, especially the visible part of the solar spectrum. A limited number of known materials exhibit very low quantum efficiency for carbon dioxide conversions, while being activated only by ultraviolet (UV) light. If successful, this project can significantly impact energy and environmental areas by using green routes for producing valuable chemicals. It will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by utilizing sustainable sources of energy, such as sunlight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The major obstacle to progress in this scientific area is a lack of understanding of the relationship between synthetic method, micro- and nano-architecture and nanostructure, and the resulting physico-chemical and reactivity properties. Achieving this understanding and developing entirely new fabrication methods, applicable on an industrial scale, are major challenges that must be met before these new functional properties can find actual practical application. Accomplishing these two objectives, one scientific and the other technical, would correspond to a major breakthrough that would make possible a whole range of new applications. This project focuses on synthesis of perovskite-based nanostructured films and powders modified at the nanoscopic level by a variety of techniques that allow chemical doping, control of crystal structure, defect concentration and imposition of unusual new morphologies. This research undertakes an entirely new direction for achieving photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide into valuable chemical products. This project aims at exploring several strategies to establish a link between reactivity and physicochemical properties of these materials through both bulk and surface sensitive characterization techniques. This project also seeks a better understanding of the role of dopants in carbon dioxide interfacial reactions when the dopants are introduced in the correct oxidation state, concentrations and location where they can lead to significant increase in catalytic activity. An unusual part of this research is the utilization of doped nanostructured films, where both particle size and composition can be precisely controlled by a new nanofabrication method. Additionally, this project aims at exploring morphological control of perovskite oxides to increase their surface area and light trapping capabilities. Finally this project expands the teaching curriculum and research opportunities at both the graduate and undergraduate levels with significant inclusion of underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>
