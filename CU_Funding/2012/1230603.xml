    <AbstractNarration>Steering Committee: James Elser, Rimjhim Aggarwal, and Helen Rowe at Arizona State University;&lt;br/&gt;Tauhidur Rahman, University of Arizona; David Vaccari, Stephens Institute of Technology; Anita&lt;br/&gt;Street, US Department of Energy; Robert Mikkelsen, International Plant Nutrition Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Phosphorus (P) is an essential element to life and, with few exceptions, a necessary&lt;br/&gt;fertilizer for high agricultural yield. Because P cannot be manufactured and global supply is limited,&lt;br/&gt;this chemical element poses a unique, double-sided threat to sustainability. P scarcity leads to&lt;br/&gt;high prices and poverty for poor farmers in developing countries, but in industrialized nations, excess&lt;br/&gt;P from farms and in urban waste streams degrades downstream water quality. The issues surrounding&lt;br/&gt;P sustainability are deeply complex and involve diverse geological, biogeochemical, economic, and&lt;br/&gt;geopolitical dimensions that are currently unconsolidated. Environmental degradation due to nutrient&lt;br/&gt;runoff and potential threats to global food security urgently call for an end to this disjointed approach&lt;br/&gt;to phosphorus. The goal of the P Sustainability Research Coordination Network (RCN) is to spark an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary synthesis of data, perspectives, and understanding about phosphorus to identify and&lt;br/&gt;implement solutions for P sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RCN theme, objectives, and initial topics build upon broad agreement on key P sustainability&lt;br/&gt;challenges reached at a recent Sustainable P Summit (SPS) led by James Elser and colleague Dan Childers.&lt;br/&gt;The RCN will involve two phases centered on three Challenge Areas. Phase I groups will work&lt;br/&gt;on two Challenges: (1) Improving P efficiency in food production; (2) Developing robust pathways&lt;br/&gt;of P recycling. At the Kick-off Workshop, identified Core Members will develop Working Groups&lt;br/&gt;centered around these challenge areas. These Groups will be further populated with At-Large Members&lt;br/&gt;recruited through a widely advertised application process that will allow us to target qualified&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, postdocs, and members of under-represented groups. In Year 3, a Synthesis Workshop&lt;br/&gt;will report on the science and solution outcomes from Phase I and develop new Phase II Working&lt;br/&gt;Groups focused on Challenge 3: Integrating efficiency and recycling to create a sustainable food system.&lt;br/&gt;A Wrap-up Workshop, held early in Year 5, will be held to report on science and solution outcomes&lt;br/&gt;from Phase II and provide the push to finalize outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Central to the P Sustainability RCN will be recruitment of a diverse network of&lt;br/&gt;participants of different professions, ranks, genders, races, ethnicities, and nationalities. The Steering&lt;br/&gt;Committee will reflect this diversity, including three students in ex officio capacity, giving them invaluable&lt;br/&gt;experience in leadership, networking, collaborative science, and policy. To communicate key&lt;br/&gt;aspects of RCN work, we will produce two dynamic, high-quality videos to reach targeted audiences of&lt;br/&gt;farmers, educators, fertilizer industry, and policy makers. The three RCN Workshops will be held in&lt;br/&gt;Washington DC in order to facilitate participation by policy makers, government officials, representatives&lt;br/&gt;of agriculture and the fertilizer industry, and urban planners with the aim of developing research priorities&lt;br/&gt;for the RCN, presenting outcomes and planning implementation of sustainability solutions.</AbstractNarration>
