    <AbstractNarration>TECHICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This Materials World Network project focuses on the understanding of principles found in natural vibrational receptors and on the mechanism of mechanical signal detection with the spider slit biosensory system at the material level. The investigation of the direct spatial correlation among cuticule morphology, hierarchical structural organization and spatial distribution of micromechanical properties in spider stress-sensing slit-sensilla as studied with a combination of microbeam small angle X-ray synchrotron scattering, dynamic nanoindentation, and surface force spectroscopy will be a crucial point of this highly cross-disciplinary biomaterial project. The PIs will explore the time-dependent micromechanical properties of these mechano-receptors embedded in the spider exoskeleton with high spatial resolution and relate the findings to the function of these organs as sensitive and selective vibration filters. The PIs consider the micromechanical properties of the cuticle, which are dependent on the protein fiber arrangement and orientation as key parameters for the mechanical response during slit compression and the efficient transmittance of external mechanical stimuli. Ultimately, this knowledge can be utilized in the future design and development of bio-inspired mechanoresponsive and adaptive nanostructured materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;The Materials World Network project focuses on deeper understanding of biological vibrational receptors found in large spiders from prospective of their morphology and physical mechanical properties. Ultimately, this knowledge can be utilized in the future biomimetic development of responsive and adaptive synthetic materials with tailored vibrational and elastic properties as smart mechanical filters, anti-vibrational pads, soft robotic arms, and pressure-sensitive glues. The broader impact of this project is anticipated through the enhanced training of graduate and undergraduate students with an emphasis on their early involvement in interdisciplinary research and invaluable international research experience which is facilitated by an intensive collaboration with researchers from Germany and Austria. To further enhance this education, the lead researcher will further develop an undergraduate course on advanced soft nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Biomaterials program and the Office of Special Programs in the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
