    <AbstractNarration>Vast quantities of character-encoded text form the foundation for the Information Retrieval revolution of recent decades. In contrast, very little symbolically-represented music exists, preventing music from fully participating in the Information Age. The International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) is a large and rapidly growing open library of public domain machine-printed classical music scores, actively used by many musicians, music scholars, and researchers around the world. The PI's objective in this exploratory project is to begin creating the algorithms needed for automatic optical music recognition (OMR) to convert scanned musical scores into symbolic representations. This is the first step in the PI's long-term goal of building a system to transform the library's score images into symbolic representations, bringing the IMSLP community together in a Wikipedia-like collaboration to mine this invaluable resource. The result will be a comprehensive and open music library of symbolic scores allowing unprecedented access while forming the basis of many new music applications as well as commercial potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there have been many efforts at OMR over the last fifty years, the current state of the art is far below what the IMSLP challenge requires. Existing systems require such laborious error correction that it is not clear if they actually improve on manual data entry. OMR is much harder than its optical character recognition (OCR) counterpart due to the fundamentally two-dimensional layout of music, which makes it difficult to cast the problem in terms of familiar recognition paradigms. Thus the primary focus of the current work lies in creating and implementing an appropriate recognition paradigm suitable for the two-dimensional structure of music notation, building in knowledge of notation conventions and allowing for automatic adaptation. To this end, the PI will explore strategies that merge recognition with segmentation, express the desire for non-overlapping musical symbols in a principled way, and model the interpretation problem which understands the often ambiguous meaning of the recognized symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A large open music library of symbolic scores, as well as offering widespread and easy access to one of our culture's richest traditions, will be transformative for musicians, music researchers, and music lovers. Libraries will be able to distribute music scores electronically and globally, allowing for adaptive display, ongoing scholarly annotation, and registration of scores with video and audio. The prevalence of symbolic music scores will open up a world of possibilities to music-science researchers, including systems for music information retrieval, expressive performance, automatic musical accompaniment, transcription and arranging, performance assistance, and many others. Finally, the library will enable important commercial applications. For example, many expect that devices such as the iPad will form the sheet music "delivery systems" of the future; the benefits of basing such digital music readers on symbolically represented music are compelling, including automatic page turning and content-based annotation.</AbstractNarration>
