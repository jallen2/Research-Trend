    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing curriculum materials for two chemical engineering core courses: thermodynamics and material and energy balances. These materials are promoting active learning, which has been shown to increase student learning, by reducing the barriers encountered by faculty who want to use more effective teaching approaches. An essential element is a set of explanations of the underlying theories for these teaching approaches and links to additional references. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing resources for flipped classrooms, in which students are watching screencasts (short videos with narration) on their own before class. Class time is being used for more active engagement with the material, which is resulting in better learning of conceptually difficult material. Resources for faculty also include a complete set of class notes that utilize active learning (ConcepTests with peer instruction, in-class group exercises, etc.), measureable learning objectives for each class period, a database of solved example problems, homework assignments, and exams. They are organized in OneNote software so they can be easily modified and customized to individual faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program evaluation is measuring the utilization of the materials and how faculty change their educational approach. These materials are being made available online, accompanied by screencasts that describe how to use them. Dissemination of these materials is enhancing the STEM education community and providing faculty professional development.</AbstractNarration>
