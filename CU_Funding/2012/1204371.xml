    <AbstractNarration>The research program at Carleton has a history of applying novel statistical strategies for parameter estimation and the analysis of data from LIGO. The Carleton team and its collaborators have made significant progress in developing methods for binary inspiral gravitational wave event detection. The group's on-going research is in the development of programs for even more complex binary inspiral signals, including the plunge, and the ringing of the newly formed black hole as well as supernova produced signals. When detection occurs, parameter estimation will provide the path toward astrophysics, and the Carleton-developed routines will be critical in that task. Additionally, the Carleton group searches for sources of noise that produce deleterious effects. Carleton develops vetoes for binary inspiral-like events produced by local environmental or detector disturbances; the group also assists the European Virgo detector in their burst and binary inspiral veto development, and will continue to do so with Advanced Virgo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carleton is a leader in producing future scientists. This project will provide research opportunities to students with interests in physics and statistics, and help to train them to become the next generation of scientists. Carleton students are eager to participate in exciting research, and their interest in gravitational wave astronomy is large. The computational methods developed by the PI and collaborators have had significant influence in other fields, with applications in cosmic microwave background analyses, noisy chaotic systems, and proposed space-based gravitational wave detectors. Carleton faculty, including the PI, are also active in scientific outreach. High school students and teachers are regularly exposed to the wonder and significance of LIGO's research, and this outreach creates much excitement for science.</AbstractNarration>
