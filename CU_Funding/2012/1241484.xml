    <AbstractNarration>This project is engaging partners from universities, industry and government agencies to develop and deploy applications and services for ultra-fast broadband and software defined networks. This nationwide collaboration will nurture U.S. leadership in next-generation networking. To this end, the project is creating a neutral forum for partners to discuss guidelines for implementing next-generation capabilities and interoperability, cataloguing next-generation applications, disseminating news and best practices, and selecting and publicizing compelling applications from competitions for an annual 'Best of the Best' showcase. This project expects to transform people's lives in five national sectors. First, by accelerating breakthroughs in advanced manufacturing technologies, this project provides a foundation for private sector investment and growth. Secondly, this project fosters the next-generation of safer, smarter, more efficient clean transportation technologies. Thirdly, by revolutionizing education and workforce learning tools, this project is helping to create a world-class workforce. By fostering applications that use information and communication technologies to predict disasters, this project can also keep Americans safe and cities better prepared. Finally, this project seeks technologies to shift healthcare paradigms to empower patients through information and medical knowledge to become an active part of their own care and to allow medical experts to use data and technology to prevent medical errors, improve the quality of care, and reduce costs.</AbstractNarration>
