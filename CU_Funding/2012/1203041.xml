    <AbstractNarration>Geosciences Careers for Kids and Parents is a Track 1 program by Jim Metzner Productions (JMP) that uses its current communication platforms - the Pulse of the Planet (PoP) radio programs and website and the Kids Science Challenge website - to involve upper elementary children and their parents/caregivers and other adults in learning about geosciences research and careers. JMP's award-winning PoP radio program, which reaches 1,000,000+ listeners weekly, profiles geoscientists and encourages parents to involve their children in the geosciences. The PoP companion pulseplanet.com website provides podcasts of past radio programs and additional resources for engaging learners in the geosciences. On JMP's Kidsciencechallenge.com website, children(8-13 years of age) will find "kid friendly" profiles and videos of geoscientists and their careers, rich resources and interactivity on the sciences and further career activities, presented as part of a project that has already actively engaged thousands of children in learning about and "doing" science. The Pulse of the Planet and Kids' Science Challenge websites receive an average of 9,600 page views daily. PBS television's The News Hour and the PBS education site will feature our video segments on geoscientists featured in PoP programs.</AbstractNarration>
