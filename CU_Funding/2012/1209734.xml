    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Zachary B. Haber of the University of Nevada, Reno to conduct a research project, entitled "Development of prefabricated bridge columns with innovative structural design and connections," during the summer of 2012 at The National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientists are Prof. Kuo-Chun Chang of National Taiwan University and Prof. Yu-Chen Ou of National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop novel prefabricated concrete bridge columns that can be rapidly assembled and utilize innovative structural details. These new elements are being developed by integrating technologies developed and tested independently and brought together in this project. There are a number of advantages to the new design, including rapid replacement of of bridges during construction, repair, and replacement after severe natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, flooding, and hurricanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
