    <AbstractNarration>This project is partially supporting the HI-TEC national conference and special forums on technology education within the conference (http://www.highimpact-tec.org/). The forums focus on the identification of critical issues and the challenges of technology education. Importantly these forums are designed to provide necessary feedback to the NSF and other stakeholders to help shape initiatives in response to identified national and global challenges. The forums are expected to engage participants from the ranks of community college educators, technicians, and industry personnel in frank discussions designed to highlight challenges and priorities faced by modern technology education and provide stakeholders information on funding opportunities to support these challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event significantly broadens the impact of the ATE program by engaging new constituencies in STEM and workforce education. One specific objective of this project is bringing students and technicians to the conference to broaden their experience and solicit their feedback concerning skills and competencies needed within the workplace. This conference, more than any other single event, is a highlight and showcase for the Foundation's long-standing efforts and initiatives to support technician education at community colleges.</AbstractNarration>
