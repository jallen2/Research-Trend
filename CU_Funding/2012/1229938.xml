    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a prototype of a software tool for automatic detection of macro defects on semiconductor wafers based on optical scanning or imaging of the wafer surface, for use in fabs that manufacture integrated circuit chips. A typical semiconductor chip fabrication process involves hundreds of complex and expensive processing steps. With an increase in the number and complexity of process steps involved, it is of critical importance to detect defects early in the manufacturing process. Yield would be maximized if such detection is performed for each and every wafer without affecting throughput. Under this program an innovative in-line tool will be developed to rapidly detect macro defects on whole wafers by integrating inexpensive commercially-available hardware with sophisticated defect detection and classification algorithms. The tool will inspect every wafer and will have zero false positives. In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed approach was conclusively demonstrated. In Phase II, a prototype of the defect detection and classification software and scanning hardware will be integrated into commercial wafer processing equipment, and its effectiveness will be demonstrated. The tool will have a major impact by reducing inspection cost and increasing yield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is substantial. There is great potential in the semiconductor industry for an inexpensive tool for real-time detection and classification of macro defects right at the equipment where the defect is generated. The successful commercialization of the proposed defect detection tool will assist in significantly increasing manufacturing yields and thus lowering costs. The product will find use in several secondary markets such as solar energy devices, light emitting diodes, photonics, etc. Additionally, with strong relationships with several universities, summer internships will be provided to students from local universities, and the research findings will be presented at international conferences. Thus the proposed work will certainly impact academic research and training and there is a strong commitment to creating opportunities for women and minorities. Finally, microelectronics affects almost every aspect of our lives including wireless and mobile internet technology. Hence, a product that makes a significant contribution to lowering the cost of manufacturing integrated circuits will positively affect the society at large.</AbstractNarration>
