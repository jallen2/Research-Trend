    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) and supported graduate students will conduct a study to characterize binary and triple systems in the near-Earth object, main-belt asteroid, and trans-Neptunian object populations, with the goal of constraining the nature, origin, and evolution of minor planets. The proposing team will conduct ground-based observations using a variety of observational techniques, including direct optical imaging, adaptive optics imaging, radar imaging, and light curve observations. The specific objectives are (1) to measure the physical properties of minor planets, including masses, sizes, and densities, which will constrain thermal and mechanical properties as well as interior structure; (2) to test theories for the formation of binaries and subsequent evolutionary processes, including tidal evolution, radiative evolution, collisional evolution, and collisionless interactions mediated by gravity; and (3) to infer constraints on the compositional and thermal characteristics of the early Solar System, and on the current distribution of volatiles. The team anticipates a detailed characterization of several near-Earth multiples, several main belt multiples, and at least one trans-Neptunian multiple during the project. The supported graduate students will gain expertise in observation planning, observing techniques, calibration, analysis, astrometric measurements, statistical and numerical methods, and scientific communication. A collaborative research environment (wiki) serving the community of radar observers will be developed. The team will actively engage in public outreach with presentations at various events and teacher workshops, and plans to disseminate exciting results to the public through social media.</AbstractNarration>
