    <AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support to nine U.S.-based researchers and eleven Ph.D. students at U.S. universities to participate in the Fifteenth Latin American Symposium on Mathematical Logic, to be held June 4?8, 2012 at Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia, a major center of logic in Latin America. Most of those for whom funds ares ought have either very limited or no other means of travel support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biannual Latin American Symposium on Mathematical Logic, first held in Santiago, Chile in 1970, has played a central role in the growth and vitality of mathematical logic in Latin America. While the level of research activity and the number of specialized conferences of international prestige that are held in the region continues to increase, the Latin American Symposium on Mathematical Logic remains the largest Pan-American logic meeting. The program includes areas of great current interest, and speakers include leading world experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event provides an important platform for extensive interaction between U.S. and Latin American researchers and students beyond already well-established research contacts. Increasing the visibility and presence of logic outside North America and Europe, particularly in Latin America and Asia, is one of the Association for Symbolic Logic?s highest long-term strategic priorities.</AbstractNarration>
