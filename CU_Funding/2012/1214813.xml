    <AbstractNarration>This project provides support for the U. S. National Commission on Mathematics Instruction (USNC/MI), a primary means for ensuring U.S. participation in mathematics education at the international level. The project will facilitate periodic contact and interaction with mathematicians and mathematics educators from around the world as issues about instructional practices are addressed. The participation of representatives of USNC/MI on the international stage opens venues for collaborative research and opportunities to learn about successful practices from other countries. The USNC/MI regularly communicates with many professional organizations in mathematics education throughout the United States with reports and updates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major function of ICMI is to authorize studies on issues of current international concern in mathematics education, and the next topic to be addressed will be instruction related to number in the primary grades. Another thrust of the USNC/MI is to be represented at the International Congress in Mathematics Education that is scheduled every four years. The ICME-12 meeting will be held in July 2012 in Seoul, Korea and USNC/MI will be organizing several events and hosting a major exhibit throughout the week long meeting.</AbstractNarration>
