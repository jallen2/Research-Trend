    <AbstractNarration>1232965&lt;br/&gt;Bonazza&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will provide partial travel support to American graduate students and young scientists who will participate in the 29th International Symposium on Shock Waves. The meeting will be held at the Memorial Union of the University of Wisconsin-Madison from Sunday, July to 14 to Friday, July 19, 2013. There will be ten plenary lectures by national and international invited speakers. A total of 313 contributed papers have been submitted and they will be distributed among six parallel oral sessions in each of four daily periods, and a poster session. Oral sessions will include: Medical/Biological Applications; Industrial Applications; Blast Waves; Chemically Reacting Flows; Detonation and Combustion; Facilities; Flow Visualization; Hypersonic Flow; Impact and Compaction/Condensed Matter Physics; Ignition; Magnetohydrodynamics/Plasmas; Multiphase Flow; Nozzle Flow; Numerical Methods; Propulsion; Shock Waves and Rarefied Flows; Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability; Shock/Boundary Layer Interaction; Shock Propagation, Reflection; Shock Vortex Interaction. Some of the oral sessions will be reserved for a "student competition" whose winner will receive an award for best paper. The funds for the awards will be provided by the International Shock Wave Institute.</AbstractNarration>
