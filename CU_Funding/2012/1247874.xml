    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to create nano-devices using single- and few-layer forms of selected crystalline layered semiconductors as building blocks for the next-generation nano-electronic components that work at high frequencies above 10 GHz. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit is this program will conduct exploratory studies on the design and construction of novel two-dimensional nanostructures for high-frequency nano-electronic applications. If successful, the proposed work will develop suitable layered materials, elucidate electron transport mechanisms in these two-dimensional materials, develop device schemes for high-speed electronics, and establish the foundation for their future integration in industry. The outcome of the research will shed light on both the fundamental research and technological applications at the nanoscale. The transformative nature of this project includes the potential to provide new materials platforms and novel device schemes which may change the landscape of future high-speed integrated nano-electronic industry. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are: (1) the program will open new avenues for interdisciplinary research with significant technological and fundamental impact, thus benefiting the society at large through research breakthroughs and knowledge dissemination; and (2) the program will boost the participation of many underrepresented groups in science and technology, through integrated education and dissemination efforts at the University of Houston (the second most ethnically diverse research university in the nation): student training, outreach to local K-12 students and teachers, and knowledge dissemination to the scientific communities and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
