    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit VERITAS is currently the most sensitive VHE gamma-ray observatory in the world. Operating at the basecamp of the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona, the VERITAS project expands the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope technique pioneered by its precursor, the Whipple 10m Telescope, to include an array of four 12m telescopes with a multitelescope trigger for an order-of-magnitude improved sensitivity over the previous generation. VERITAS probes the extreme physics of sources such as the jets of Active Galactic Nuclei, Supernovae Remnants, and microquasars and provides an important complement to the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. This award will provide support for the VERITAS science and collaboration service efforts of the Adler Planetarium &amp; Astronomy Museum researchers. The Adler group will lead the development and optimization of advanced gamma-ray analysis methods to increase the performance of VERITAS and play a leading role in calibration efforts. The Adler's science efforts will utilize the improved array performance in the study of extended supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae focusing on the case of the Crab Nebula, particularly in light of the recent discovery of the rapid bright synchrotron flares detected by Fermi. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact The Adler serves as the lead institution for VERITAS Education and Outreach efforts. Beyond the management aspects of the VERITAS EPO effort, the Adler VERITAS scientists will engage in a variety of efforts including hosting undergraduate interns from collaborating VERITAS institutions, participating in the daily 'Astronomy Conversations' held at the Adler Planetarium's Space Visualization Laboratory, investigating the feasibility of a Citizen Science project to distinguish gamma rays from cosmic rays, and providing planetarium expertise to the VERITAS project office to develop a VERITAS-themed show.</AbstractNarration>
