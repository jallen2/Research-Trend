    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Kevin Hung Pham of the University of Texas at Arlington to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating the role of a fluctuating solar wind and the effects of the polarity of the solar wind's magnetic field on geomagnetic storms," during the summer of 2012 at the National Central University in Jhongli City, Taiwan. The host scientist is Lin-Ni Hau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in a better understanding of the space weather around Earth. Space weather can have a great impact on the people and technology, in space and on Earth. The research seeks to determine which polarity of the solar wind's magnetic field causes a more severe geomagnetic storm and whether a fluctuating solar wind has a significant contribution to geomagnetic storms. It is crucial to understand what conditions lead to severe space weather such as geomagnetic storms which can cause power grid failures, navigational difficulties, and other serious disruptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
