    <AbstractNarration>The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is collaborating with Salish Kootenai College to convene a second conference of the Geoscience Alliance, which fosters engagement of Native American students in the geosciences and related STEM fields by bringing together geoscientists, Native leaders, educators and students for the purpose of advancing research, identifying best practices, improving evaluation, promoting educational opportunities, and fostering new collaborations. The conference is being held at Salish Kootenai College in March 2012, with an anticipated attendance of ~125 participants. The Geoscience Alliance effort builds on best practices for improving participation by Native Americans in STEM fields, and particularly in the geosciences, including: 1) cultural context; 2) community relevance; 3) a holistic approach that considers the entire student; 4) involvement of the community, family, and elders; 5) a communal learning environment; and, 6) problem-based or real-world-based activities. The conference will address the following research strands: Topics in Education and Evaluation Related to Native American Geoscience and STEM Learning, and Topics in Geosciences Research Affecting Indigenous Communities. Attendees at the conference will include: Native American K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty from Tribal colleges and other universities, teachers, elders, and other interested researchers. Scientists from major Federal agency-supported research and education centers and facilities, including CUAHSI, EarthScope, UCAR/NCAR, GLOBE, LacCore, will share information about opportunities and programs for Native students and educators working in Native communities. Continuation of the Geoscience Alliance after the conference will be fostered by organizing sessions and receptions at professional conferences (e.g., SACNAS), through communication by technological and traditional means, and via new ongoing research and education collaborations. Co-funding for this conference is being provided through a separate contribution from NASA (via the Virginia Space Grant Consortium).</AbstractNarration>
