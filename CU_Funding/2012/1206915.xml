    <AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid systems combine the desirable features of two or more technologies in a way that improves the performance of each component. This project seeks to develop hybrid "molecules" formed of phosphorus dopants embedded inside silicon double quantum dots. The project will study methods for transferring information between the spins in two distinct subsystems: the electron spin in a quantum dot and the electron spin (or nuclear spin) of a phosphorous donor. The high degree of tunability of gated quantum dots offers the possibility of new ways to interact with nuclear spins (which are highly coherent) via electronic degrees of freedom (which can be manipulated and measured very rapidly). This project seeks to probe new types of hybrid states between a donor and a quantum dot, and to use those states to bridge the length scale mismatch between atomic donors and other semiconductor nanostructures. Computer modeling will provide a link between the experimental results and the underlying theory. Through this research, graduate students will be trained in areas including nanofabrication, electronic measurement, and theory. The project will also create a new outreach module, focused on nanoscience, and merge it with a program that currently reaches thousands of students each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid systems combine the desirable features of two or more technologies in a way that improves the performance of each component. This project seeks to develop hybrid "molecules" formed of individual real atoms embedded inside artificial atoms. The project will use artificial atoms formed in single-electron transistors that are constructed from two common semiconductor materials: silicon and silicon-germanium. This project will study methods for transferring information from the artificial atoms to the real atoms (and to the real atomic nucleus, where it is especially long-lived), and back again. From a practical perspective, the project seeks ways to manipulate atomic systems using tools that work well for silicon transistors. Fundamentally, the project will probe the interactions between real and artificial atoms-systems that have very different characteristic length scales. Computer simulations will be used to relate experimental results to the underlying theory. Through this research, graduate students will be trained in areas including nanofabrication, electronic measurement, and theoretical simulation. The project will also create a new outreach module, focused on nanoscience, and merge it with a program that currently reaches thousands of students each year.</AbstractNarration>
