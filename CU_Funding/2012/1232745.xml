    <AbstractNarration>1232745&lt;br/&gt;Genin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support is requested to support hosting a cross-disciplinary discussion on the broad topic of interfaces and attachment in materials, biology, and physiology to be held over the duration of the 2012 Materials Re-search Society Spring Meeting in San Francisco. The specific expenses requested to be covered by the National Science Foundation through this grant proposal, as detailed in the accompanying budget statement, involve registration fees for invited speakers and travel expenses for junior participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective interfaces between materials present a grand challenge across a broad range of physical phenomena within both conventional and biomedical engineering. Many high performance alloys exhibit property amplifications similar to those observed in nature and physiology, and the science of relating this property amplification to a material's hierarchical structure is gaining in maturity. However, careful control of the interfaces and interphases between constituents continues to pose theoretical and applied challenges across disciplines, ranging from challenges attaching composite wings to civil aircraft to challenges in understanding and regenerating attachments between tendon and bone in rotator cuff reattachment surgery. It will bring together experts across the life sciences, the physical sciences, and materials engineering to discuss the state of the art in our understanding of this grand challenge across disciplines, to identify additional major challenges and solutions that exist across disciplines, with the goal of providing future direction to this field. The intellectual merit of this symposium lies in addressing the critical need to bring together this cross-disciplinary expertise to unify and identify future directions for this field at an important stage of the field's development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this symposium lie in the development of young and future scientists, and the symposium's aim of inspiring and motivating further inquiry into the study of interfaces. From the human resources perspective, the program draws organizers and will draw participants from diverse backgrounds from four continents, and will specifically target individuals at the beginnings of their careers. Finally, we would like to facilitate opportunities for junior and early career faculty, post doctoral fellows and graduate students to present research in an interdisciplinary, international workshop. Our objective is to have over half of the speakers in this symposium be scientists who have not previously presented their work at an MRS Meeting. From the perspective of inspiring and motivating further inquiry into the study of interfaces, the symposium will serve as a platform for the broad dissemination of research across disciplines. It is expected to have more than 200 attendees over the course of the symposium. The symposium will have 48 presentations (27 invited, with five of these being junior investigators) and 15 poster presenters (8 of which are students).</AbstractNarration>
