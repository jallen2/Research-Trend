    <AbstractNarration>The 27th Annual Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications will be hosted by the Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics of Minnesota State University, Mankato, on July 25-28, 2012. Special sessions are to be offered in Asymmetric Topology, Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, and Set-Theoretic Topology. Each session has one to two associated plenary speakers. The conference will also feature workshops in Dynamical Systems and Geometric Topology. More details and information can be found at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://cset.mnsu.edu/mathstat/sumtopo/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of Topology, developed as a distinct discipline beginning in the late 19th century in an attempt to provide a flexible framework to answer questions of a geometric and analytic nature, has broadened in the last one hundred years to become ubiquitous throughout mathematics and related disciplines. The field has had great success in connecting with the areas of Algebra, Dynamical Systems, and Computer Logic, as well as Physics, Economics and Biology. Recent advances in Asymmetric Topology have found uses in screen pixelization applications. This series of conferences, which draws a large national and international audience, has likewise broadened over its history and has established itself as a successful venue for the dissemination of results and sharing of ideas among these related disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
