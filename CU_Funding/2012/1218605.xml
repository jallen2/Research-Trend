    <AbstractNarration>Computers, and implicitly programming languages, are used in many&lt;br/&gt;critical applications these days, where correct behavior is necessary.&lt;br/&gt;Rigorous, formal semantic definitions of the employed programming&lt;br/&gt;languages are therefore necessary in order to verify computing systems.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, in spite of more than forty years of research in&lt;br/&gt;programming language semantics, most program verifiers are not directly&lt;br/&gt;based on a formal semantics, but rather on complex and ad-hoc hardwired&lt;br/&gt;models of their target programming languages. This has at least two&lt;br/&gt;negative consequences: first, it makes the development and maintenance&lt;br/&gt;of program verifiers hard and uneconomical, particularly for new&lt;br/&gt;programming languages or languages which evolve fast; second, it allows&lt;br/&gt;room for subtle bugs in program verifiers themselves. This research&lt;br/&gt;project aims at developing a generic program verification framework&lt;br/&gt;that takes a programming language given through its formal semantics as&lt;br/&gt;input, and yields a program verifier for that language as output.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the language semantics will be executable, so testable,&lt;br/&gt;and public, so will serve as a reference implementation for the language&lt;br/&gt;and as a formal basis for language understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this projects builds upon recent advances in matching logic&lt;br/&gt;and its use for verifying reachability properties. A language-independent&lt;br/&gt;sound and relatively complete proof system takes a programming language&lt;br/&gt;operational semantics as a set of axioms, and can be used to derive&lt;br/&gt;any reachability property about any program in the given language. This&lt;br/&gt;is in sharp contrast to the existing verification approaches based on&lt;br/&gt;Hoare logic and on dynamic logic, since these approaches are&lt;br/&gt;language-specific. This research will therefore lead to the development&lt;br/&gt;of semantic and verification techniques and algorithms that will work for&lt;br/&gt;any language, provided a formal semantics of the language is given.&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, the broader impact of this research is that it will increase&lt;br/&gt;the quality and robustness of software systems, and will narrow the gap&lt;br/&gt;between the specification and the implementation of computer systems.</AbstractNarration>
