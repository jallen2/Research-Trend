    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Alan Michael Twomey of the University of Minnesota to conduct a research project, entitled "Quantifying small-scale distribution of proteins in frozen solutions using chemical imaging techniques," during the summer of 2012 at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The host scientists are Dr. Hiroshi Takamastu and Dr. Kosaku Kurata&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to quantify the effect of cooling rate and thermal history on the distribution of proteins in the ice interface in solutions composed of cryoprotective agents and buffers. Using confocal Raman spectroscopy scans of solutions frozen along a temperature gradient, the distribution of the proteins are being measured, as well as changes in their conformation. The specific goal of the research project is to develop a methodology to control the interactions of a protein in a solution with a propagating ice interface in a manner that minimizes damage to the protein structure. Minimizing structural damage to proteins has significant implications for many applications, including the pharmaceutical industry where therapeutic proteins are frequently stabilized and stored at length in the frozen state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
