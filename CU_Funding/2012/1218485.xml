    <AbstractNarration>Solid-state storage technologies, such as flash, phase-change memory&lt;br/&gt;and memristors promise large-capacity storage at speeds much faster&lt;br/&gt;than disk. To date, mainstream use of these technologies has been as a&lt;br/&gt;replacement for disks, storing a disk-oriented file system. However,&lt;br/&gt;solid-state storage is and will remain far more expensive than&lt;br/&gt;disks. Thus, it will often be used as a cache or special-purpose&lt;br/&gt;store, and not as the main repository of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops new interfaces to solid-state storage that&lt;br/&gt;leverage its new features, such as access via ordinary memory&lt;br/&gt;instructions, and its role in large software systems as a middle layer&lt;br/&gt;between memory and disk. It focuses on two forms of solid-state&lt;br/&gt;storage: flash memory, common in solid-state drives and mobile&lt;br/&gt;devices, and forthcoming storage-class memory, which compared to flash&lt;br/&gt;promises lower latency, better endurance, and access as memory rather&lt;br/&gt;than as a device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses important concerns about using solid-state&lt;br/&gt;storage: how best to use the capabilities of these devices to improve&lt;br/&gt;specific applications or use cases, such as caching; how to provide&lt;br/&gt;access to internal management capabilities of solid-state storage&lt;br/&gt;devices, such as address translation and garbage collection, to&lt;br/&gt;applications; how to remove software layers between an application and&lt;br/&gt;storage to reduce latency; and how to provide reliable storage while&lt;br/&gt;removing many of the layers that currently provide reliability.</AbstractNarration>
