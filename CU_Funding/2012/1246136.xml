    <AbstractNarration>The availability and growing use of high-performance heterogeneous computing and storage components by scientists across university campuses has led to realization that the general-purpose campus network offers neither the capacity nor the capabilities necessary for data-intensive research project. This project designs, builds and maintains a new network at the University of Oregon (UO) campus called Bridging Open Networks for Scientific Applications and Innovation (BONSAI). BONSAI is designed as a high-performance science network providing high end-to-end throughput and unique capabilities between five interconnected UO facilities, as well as computing resources located at other institutions throughout Internet2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project primarily focuses on the following five major tasks:(1) Creating a Science DMZ platform among major computing facilities &lt;br/&gt;across UO; (2) Adding a new 10Gbps network circuit between the UO and Internet2; (3) Implementing and operating Software-Defined Networking(SDN) technologies throughout the network; (4) Promoting the development of IPv6- and service-aware scientific applications, and (5) Socializing the use of the UO's membership to the InCommon federation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BONSAI also serves as a testbed for experimental research on new networking technologies (e.g.,SDN) and facilitates to support data-intensive applications (e.g., visualization), including their translation for educational purposes. This project will directly impact teaching and training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers by providing access to advanced computing infrastructure and networking capabilities. Finally, the project will significantly advance the broader access and dissemination of UO research results for advancing scientific and technological understanding.</AbstractNarration>
