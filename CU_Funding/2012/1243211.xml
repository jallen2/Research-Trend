    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the travel expenses of graduate students, postdocs, and individuals without other sources of support to attend the conference ?Dynamics Days US 2013? on nonlinear dynamics and chaos which will be held in the Marriott City Center in downtown Denver, Colorado, in January 3-6 of 2013. The conference webpage is http://amath.colorado.edu/conferences/DDays2013. &lt;br/&gt;Dynamics Days is an annual international conference that has been running in the US for more than 30 years. During this time, Dynamics Days has served as one of the main venues where recent developments in and applications of nonlinear dynamics are disseminated. This year, the conference is aimed at promoting cross-fertilization across different fields of nonlinear dynamics, and will address topics such as geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics, neuroscience, synchronization and self-organization, nonlinear dynamics of biological systems, dynamics on and of complex networks, dynamic fracture, granular media, and pattern formation. The conference will have 21 invited speakers, a similar number of contributed talks, and poster sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the last decades, Dynamics Days has become established as an excellent venue for interactions between specialists in different fields and between young and established researchers. The topics of the talks cover a variety of areas with overlapping interests in nonlinear dynamics. This variety attracts participants from various fields in mathematics and physics, and also a significant number of participants with backgrounds in other fields such as engineering, biology, and geology. Experienced researchers will benefit from the exposure to new techniques and potential collaborators in diverse fields. Financial support will be available to students and young researchers, who will be able to give contributed talks or present in a poster session. These young researchers will especially benefit from the format of the conference, gaining a broad perspective of current research in interdisciplinary areas. The participation of students and young researchers from underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged.</AbstractNarration>
