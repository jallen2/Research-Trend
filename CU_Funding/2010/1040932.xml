    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing, disseminating, and maintaining an interactive website and annual print materials to enhance awareness and catalyze partnerships for the National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education (ATE) centers and program. This effort is helping to build partnerships, and bringing synergy to centers' efforts. In addition, the information compiled through this project helps make the case for the critical U.S. economic need for technician education and the important role of the community colleges in the context of the ATE program. Industry specific collaterals are being developed to demonstrate center collaboration by industry sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATE Impact 2011 is designed to address the needs and interests of three major audiences: decision makers and influencers at the federal level, to inform them of the breadth and impact of the ATE program; users of ATE resources and services such as community college and secondary school educators who seek curriculum development assistance, faculty development opportunities, model educational practices, and innovative teaching methodologies; and potential partners in the public and private sector who seek collaboration and collaborators to advance initiatives important to the nation's technological workforce and STEM education. The website and print materials reach significantly beyond the existing community of knowledge about the ATE program. The ATE Impact project is synergistic with www.ATEcentral.net and points users to the resources referenced there.</AbstractNarration>
