    <AbstractNarration>This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE) grant provides support to combine physical and chemical numerical tools to predict the performance of concrete made with glass filler. Waste glass that cannot easily be recycled into new glass has the potential to be used in concrete in place of part of the Portland cement, if the glass is finely ground. Both experimental and modeling approaches will be used to (1) measure the chemical reaction properties and rates for individual glass types of different fineness in concrete, (2) measure the water absorption and strength development of mortar containing ground glass, and (3) integrate the thermodynamics into an existing numerical tool that simulates the structural arrangement of the cement chemical reaction products. The model will then be used to simulate the mortar strength and water absorption when glasses of different type and fineness are used. Finally, a sensitivity analysis will be performed to determine the optimum grinding needed for mixtures of different glass types and fineness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will potentially allow for increased commercial use of waste glass in concrete, benefiting both the environment and infrastructure. This project will reveal fundamental information about glass reaction in concrete that is currently lacking, but vital for modeling performance. The results of this study will provide insight into the mechanisms of other materials used to replace portions of the Portland cement in concrete, such as volcanic ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, and coal combustion fly ash. The modeling component developed will also be applicable to the reaction of any particle system at variable temperature. The education plan, to be integrated with the research program, will result in a day-long program on recycling engineering for middle school-age girls and boys with representation from underrepresented groups. Evaluations from the participants will provide valuable insights into the role of gender in designing outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
