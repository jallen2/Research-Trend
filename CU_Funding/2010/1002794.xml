    <AbstractNarration>SES#: 1002794&lt;br/&gt;PI: John R. Warren&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Elaine M. Hernandez&lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study combines an emerging approach in medical sociology that focuses on the importance of new health information and disease preventability with the literature that describes the influence of social relationships on medical decision-making. To examine the influence of new health information and social relationships, the research will focus on women who are pregnant for the first time and must navigate a plethora of new health information. A mixed-method design is employed comprised of survey interviews and in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Over the course of a year, women will be sequentially enrolled from local health clinics during their first prenatal visit to participate in an in-person survey interview and conduct in-depth interviews with a subset of the women during their third trimester. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This study will not only advance knowledge about the processes that contribute to inequalities in health, but it will also provide insight into decisions about behaviors that lead to unequal health among women and infants.</AbstractNarration>
