    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will create a Global Scale Ionospheric Plasma laboratory by acquiring an Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) to be deployed at the Institute of Radio Astronomy in La Plata, Argentina. The field of view of the radar at the selected site in Argentina includes the magnetically conjugate point to the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The research instrument will be called the Argentine Ionospheric Radar Experiment Station (AIRES) which, together with the Arecibo Observatory, will be able to perform inter-hemispheric measurements of the Earth's ionosphere. The Arecibo ISR is part of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC), a national research center operated by Cornell University. An ionospheric heating facility will shortly become operational at Arecibo to enable active ionospheric experiments using the incoherent scatter radars at Arecibo and Argentina to make diagnostic measurements. The objectives of this program are: 1) support the acquisition of a state-of-the-art instrumentation that improves access to, and increased use of, modern research and research training instrumentation by scientists, engineers, and undergraduate and graduate students; 2) To implement a research training program in Argentina in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields mainly in Astronomy and Atmospheric Science for graduate and undergraduate pre-college students as well as science teachers; and 3) to enhance and support research in Atmospheric Science and Planetary Science using both the proposed AIRES and the Arecibo Observatory facilities. This Global Scale Ionospheric Plasma laboratory will provide unique measurements of ionospheric properties in the heater interaction volume, as well as never-before-attempted conjugate observations of the undisturbed ionosphere. These will support a wide range of studies, including the physics of atmospheric waves and layers, and low-latitude plasma instabilities and irregularities. The installed system will bring state-of-the-art radar technology to Puerto Rico, U.S. and Argentinean Universities, with accessibility tools that make it readily available to students from many research communities. The results of the project will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conferences, meetings, and publications, as well as through the organization of international schools both in Puerto Rico and Argentina.</AbstractNarration>
