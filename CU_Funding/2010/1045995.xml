    <AbstractNarration>EAGER: Piezoelectric Energy Scavenging Schemes for Hybrid Integrated Systems&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The objective of this proposal is to design and fabricate an integrated encapsulated device for sensing in gaseous and/or liquid environments applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The exploratory approach is to focus on bimorphic beams with different thermal expansion coefficients, experiment with lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and demonstration on a micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) type device. PZT used as a single layer piezoelectric material can be optimized in energy harvesting applications when the output voltage drives low power electronics. Primarily it can be implemented for generating renewable energy by stress relief. In addition by changing the Zr/Ti composition in PZT it can be temperature sensitive and in turn be used in pyroelectric sensors.&lt;br/&gt;Thereby these devices can develop a small voltage with temperature change and able to drive post processing electronics. The challenges consist on the limitations of this voltage swing, identification of the materials for the optimum combination, and to minimize the driving electronics. The fabricated device structure will be used for energy harvesting and into important properties of materials suitable for MEMS devices.&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion will permit the overall sensitivity of the MEMS-based subsystem to improve. By coordinating both piezo and pyroelectric effects, the approach described here could offer many applications including bio-sensing. Eventually it is expected that the electrical measurements with the&lt;br/&gt;mechanical properties of the samples from this investigation will provide a platform for modeling the integrated device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The principal investigator will incorporate this research topic within the ?Each One Mentor one education program involving graduate students as Expert Classroom Visitors during the academic year and mentors during the summer for young scholars and high school teachers that she has&lt;br/&gt;developed in collaboration with the NC Science House at NC State University. The investigator special efforts are targeted to increase the participation of women and underrepresented students in the science and engineering fields.</AbstractNarration>
