    <AbstractNarration>A Measurement based Framework for Dynamic Equivalencing of Large-Scale Power Systems using Synchrophasors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aranya Chakrabortty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a unified framework of analytical procedures by which simplified reduced-order electro-mechanical models of large power system networks can be identified, not by the traditional approach of modeling each individual component in the network, but by using dynamic data available from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) installed at only specific points in the network. The approach will be to use concepts of nonlinear circuit theory, fundamental physics and graph theory for such measurement-based model reduction, and for employing these models in wide-area monitoring and control. The results will be validated with PMU data from recent disturbance events in the US West coast power system and the East Texas grid in collaboration with American Electric Power and Southern California Edison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is in establishing a significantly novel application area of the PMU technology through its integration with dynamic system theory and network science. This will benefit power system protection engineers tremendously in interpreting meaningful information about the interconnected grid dynamics from overwhelming amounts of raw PMU data during critical emergencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project will be in providing a much-needed, timely infusion of control theoretic ideas to advance emerging research on synchrophasor-integrated next generation power grids, and in creating a national influence through a variety of outreach activities including journal publications, industrial collaborations with the Texas utilities, undergraduate research on smart grids, and power system education for underrepresented student groups from several minority institutions in West Texas.</AbstractNarration>
