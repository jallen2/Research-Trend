    <AbstractNarration>This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) is for recent disasters around the world that have resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths (e.g., 9/11, Indian Ocean Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina). However, very little is known about what happens to unidentified and unclaimed bodies after disasters. This research will examine mass fatality management in Haiti and include a comparison of similar activities in Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh. The study will be based on media and internet research, field observations, interviews, and document collection. Government officials, international humanitarian agency representatives, medical doctors, forensic experts and local citizens will be interviewed. The research team (which is comprised of experts in disasters in developing nations, comparative analysis and mass fatality management) will increase understanding of post-disaster operations and provide recommendations to improve responses to mass mortality incidents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will produce valuable information for both scholars and practitioners. Professors will gain new insights into what happens to unidentified bodies after disasters. This knowledge will be shared to undergraduate and graduate students who study emergency management. Findings will also be published in academic journals and presented at educational conferences. This study will identify lessons learned for emergency management officials in the United States and in other nations. Findings will be useful for disaster researchers, emergency management personnel, and others involved in humanitarian activities.</AbstractNarration>
