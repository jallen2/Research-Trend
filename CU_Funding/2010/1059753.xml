    <AbstractNarration>This is a RAPID proposal to assess the immediate impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on near-by resident populations of endangered whale species (sperm whales and beaked whales) and prediction of the long-term effects of the disaster on their population dynamics using statistical and mathematical modeling. The project includes three components: 1) an acoustic experiment in the vicinity of the incident to collect population estimates data and comparison to similar collected data from previous years; 2) the development of statistical models to quantitatively estimate the population of marine mammals before and after the incident in the vicinity of the disaster; 3) the development of a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of the whale population that will be used to evaluate the long term impact of the spill on whale populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is one of a kind to assess the adverse impact of the BP oil-spill on the marine ecosystem in general, and marine mammal populations of specific species in particular, in and around the oil-impacted area of the Gulf of Mexico. Acoustic data will be collected near the sites where marine mammal phonations were collected by the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center in 2001, 2002, 2007 and are as close as 9 miles from the BP oilspill incident site. Therefore, the newly collected data will be unique as we will be able to compare them to the previous data, which will provide base-line estimates of the marine mammal population density. Successful project implementation will provide not only environmental impact assessment of a large-scale oil spill on several species of marine mammals (including endangered sperm whales), but also the foundation for development of a new systematic methodology of population estimation and dynamics based on acoustic cues; this is in contrast with the traditional methodology which is based on visual observations. The&lt;br/&gt;collected data, which will be useful for ecologists in the future, and the theoretical research associated with the project will shed light on the debate concerning how the Gulf of Mexico has been affected by the oil-spill. This can help the policy makers in the future. This project will not only assess the impact of the BP oil-spill on marine species in the impacted area, but also can work as a paradigm in the future for similar manmade or natural disasters. The proposed research, with a strong theoretical component, will complement other existing and ongoing research on the BP oil-spill. Furthermore, articipating graduate students will receive valuable interdisciplinary training ranging from data analysis to statistical and mathematical modeling of marine mammal population dynamics.</AbstractNarration>
