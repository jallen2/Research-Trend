    <AbstractNarration>The environmental fate and interaction of nanoparticles with water, air, soils, and organisms in the natural environment are growing areas of global interest and concern as the production and use of human-engineered nanoparticles increases. As such, dialog between researchers in this critical area across the spectrum of disciplines is important and necessary to move the science forward and to improve our understanding of the effects of nanoparticles on environmental health and safety. This award provides funds to support student travel to the 5th International Conference on the Environmental Effects of Nanoparticles and Nanomaterials. This conference brings together researchers from different fields and countries who would not normally interact with one another; thus, acting as a crucible for ideas and information exchange. The goal of the conference is to facilitate discussions that lead to innovative, collaborative efforts that address the research and education needs in this important area of science and engineering. Participants from academia, industry, and government from seven counties in Europe, Asia, and North America are slated to attend. Broader impacts of the work and key conference outcomes will be (1) a paper for the publication that summarizes research presented at the conference and that identifies critical research needs and (2) the publication of a special journal issue. Significant efforts, through outreach to professional societies and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, will be made to encourage the attendance of under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
