    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel bionematicide to control soybean cyst nematode (SCN) in soybeans. In wide-ranging preliminary research, this bionematicide controlled several nematode stages, including up to 90% of cysts (the primary inoculum source for SCN infestations). The isolate also controls SCN over a broad range of soil temperatures and SCN races (biotypes), indicating that resistance to the isolate by SCN will be of minimal consequence. The overall objectives of this project are to 1) demonstrate and determine field parameters for application of the technology and 2) evaluate scale-up production protocol(s) for eventual commercial production. The advantage of the project is supported through the collaborative efforts of a strong public and private alliance utilizing very diverse professional expertise. This alliance provides an excellent framework to design and implement field and laboratory testing as well as marketing (and related) strategies to make the project successful. Results will provide data and structure for an expeditious commercialization track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that SCN is one of the most economically important disease pest of soybeans in the world. Most chemical nematicides have been removed or are little used, resistant cultivars continue to break down to SCN biotypes, and crop rotation is not feasible in most areas due to economic and environmental constraints of applicable crops. Based on these factors the technology, once commercialized, will have a significant impact in the market. In the U.S. alone, there are 50,000,000 soybean acres (and growing) infested with SCN, costing farmers an estimated $1.5 billion annually. And, because of the environmentally (or "green") sound and sustainable nature of the product, the technology will create much broader impacts for the consuming public through the overall reduction of chemical pesticide applications and by providing for a much needed option in soybean cyst management. Effective, sustainable control methods such as outlined in this proposal are badly needed for this major pest creating a significant market opportunity as well as societal benefits.</AbstractNarration>
