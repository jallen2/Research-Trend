    <AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Anthropogenic elevation of atmospheric pCO2 is increasing the acidity of the oceans, thereby reducing the saturation state of seawater with respect to calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Of mounting concern is the potential impact of these changes on the ability of calcifying organisms to form their shells and skeletons. Recent studies, including pilot work conducted by PI Ries and his colleagues on a suite of benthic marine calcifiers spanning broad taxonomic, mineralogical, and ecological ranges, have revealed that marine organisms exhibit a wide range of calcification responses to CO2-induced ocean acidification, including positive, negative, parabolic, threshold, and neutral responses. Marine calcifiers build their shells and skeletons from various forms (polymorphs) of CaCO3, most commonly aragonite, high-Mg calcite, and low-Mg calcite. These polymorphs differ greatly in their solubility in seawater and, therefore, in their potential response to CO2-induced ocean acidification. X-ray diffraction analysis of shells secreted by the organisms investigated in the pilot study reveals that the proportion of calcite (the less soluble form of CaCO3) to aragonite (the more soluble form) within their shells increases under elevated pCO2, while the Mg:Ca ratio of their calcite declines. These observations suggested that some marine calcifiers may partially adapt to a declining CaCO3 saturation state by accreting a greater proportion of the less-soluble form of CaCO3 (low-Mg calcite) at the expense of the more soluble forms (aragonite, high-Mg calcite). However, it is likely that such mineralogical and compositional changes in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms would alter their structural and biomechanical properties. The project seeks to build upon the results of the pilot study by rearing a suite of benthic marine calcifiers under past (280 ppm), present (385 ppm), and predicted future (540, 840 ppm) pCO2 and under three distinct temperatures to investigate changes in: (1) their rates of calcification and linear extension; (2) the relative abundance and micron-scale distribution of the various CaCO3 polymorphs within their shells/skeletons; (3) the ultrastructure and crystal morphology of their shells/skeletons; and (4) their biomechanical properties. The research would also build upon the pilot experiments by utilizing a more thoroughly replicated study design, by more precisely constraining the chemical parameters of the experimental seawater treatments, by investigating calcification responses under 3 different temperature regimes, and by employing a "pre-industrial" pCO2 level (280 ppm). The results of the proposed research should advance our understanding of how benthic marine calcifiers shall respond to future CO2-induced changes in seawater temperature and CaCO3 saturation state. And by investigating the response of organisms over the range of atmospheric pCO2 that has occurred since late Paleozoic time, this research should inform our understanding of the putative links atmospheric pCO2, mass extinction events, and secular variation in the polymorph mineralogy of marine calcifiers throughout geologic time. Finally, comparison of the observed biological responses to variable pCO2-T scenarios with that already established for abiogenic carbonates will advance our understanding of the very mechanisms by which marine calcifiers build their shells and skeletons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The results of the proposed research will inform the decisions of policy makers and legislators working to mitigate the impacts of CO2-induced warming and ocean acidification by establishing pCO2-T tolerances for a range of marine calcifiers. Results of the proposed research would be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations, public outreach, the PI's website, and mainstream media outlets. PI Ries is an early career scientist whose developing research program would be materially enhanced by the resources and activities afforded via the research. This research would also promote the education, training, and professional development of graduate students Ann Mooney (a native Pacific Islander) and Isaac Westfield, and postdoctoral fellow Karl Castillo (a native Belizean of African descent), two of whom belong to minority groups that are underrepresented in the marine sciences. Finally, the proposed research would create valuable training and educational experiences for several undergraduates conducting research under the PI.</AbstractNarration>
