    <AbstractNarration>The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. The Center for Research Computing (CRC) at the University of Notre Dame is providing a setting for the REU student to become familiar with interdisciplinary computational research. CRC provides access to research groups working across a diverse range of computational problems including (a)Modeling highly complex blood clotting processes to advance the understanding and treatment of heart disease, strokes and hemophilia, (b) Using molecular simulation to develop a fundamental understanding of the link between the physical properties of materials and their chemical constitution, (c) Discovering planets outside the solar system to help further astrophysicists? study of star and planet formation, (d) Creating computational models of coastal ocean hydrodynamics that can be applied to real-world problems, from dealing with coastal flooding due to hurricanes to helping map currents for shipping operations, dredging and harbor design. The students are learning how to use the most current cyberinfrastructure tools and receiving training on fundamental scientific computing skills and techniques. In addition, REU students are exposed to international scientific collaborations active at the CRC. The program will involve 10 students every summer, and each will spend 10 weeks at the University of Notre Dame. In addition the CRC funds 3 international students from its collaborating institutions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit is grounded in four core areas of expertise: multiscale computations in engineering and science, interdisciplinary molecular modeling and simulation, validation and verification, and cyberinfrastructure development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the critical advancement of education in computational science as identified in the Presidential Information Technology Advisory Committee report and development of the nation?s future scientists with immediate impact both at their home institutions and nationally.</AbstractNarration>
