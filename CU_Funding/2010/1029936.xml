    <AbstractNarration>The PIs' preliminary data from sediment cores from deep equatorial Pacific show evidence of old radiocarbon ages and thus the presence of old, poorly ventilated bottom water brought to the surface as deglaciation began at the end of the last glacial, thereby potentially explaining the prolonged decrease in radiocarbon content and a concurrent increase pCO2 levels of the atmosphere. The PIs propose to evaluate this ventilation signal further and test its significance through a combination of 14C and 230Th measurements on selected additional cores in order to better understand the effects of benthic processes. In addition, Thorium profiling will be used to test the significance of maxima in foraminiferal abundance that are dated with 14-C. This method will be used to evaluate the accumulation rates of benthic foraminifera and the possible role of winnowing and sediment focusing in creating benthic abundance peaks. Thorium data will also help refine chronology of millennial-scale events in the eastern Equatorial Pacific over the last 25 K.Y.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The scientific impact of the findings could be strong for other paleoclimate research. Outreach and educational efforts include training of teachers, students and a post-doctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>
