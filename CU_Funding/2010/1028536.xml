    <AbstractNarration>A conference on Compact Moduli and Vector Bundles, which will be held at the University of Georgia during October 20-24, 2010, will allow an exchange of ideas in these interrelated subjects. The topics will include the moduli space of stable varieties and pairs, including stable curves but also with a special emphasis on the higher-dimensional case, and the vector bundles on compact moduli spaces, with a special emphasis on conformal block bundles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the conference is to bring together and strengthen an international community of algebraic geometers including many young people -- graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty -- as well as established researchers for discussing the progress achieved during last few years and&lt;br/&gt;to produce cross-fertilization between several major fields of study and spark new ideas and cooperation.</AbstractNarration>
