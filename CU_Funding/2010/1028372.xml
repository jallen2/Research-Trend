    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to demonstrate a working prototype of a nano-optical conveyor belt for transport of ~100 nm nanoparticles over millimeter distances. Engineered metallic nanostructures support intense near fields that can trap truly nanoscopic objects such as viruses and single molecules. Numerical calculations indicate that a chain of alternating size C-shaped apertures, irradiated in turn by three wavelengths, can peristaltically transport nanoparticles along its length using substantially less power than is required for conventional optical trapping. Work will be guided by electromagnetic, diffusion and fluidic simulations. Relative merits of candidate nanostructures will be determined through numerical and laboratory experiments with nanospheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The competing effects of Brownian motion, refractive momentum transfer and radiation pressure, convection currents and thermophoresis have not been studied in conjunction with asymmetrical plasmonic structures as will be required for this work. This work opens new theoretical and experimental territory in optics and supports a new generation of massively parallel biomolecule research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nano optical conveyor belt is an enabling technology for macromolecular manipulation and lab-on-a-chip devices. A device which can identify single molecules must have a mechanism for drawing in and holding the molecule, and as such this work is a "glue technology" for fundamental biomolecular research. Compact pathogen detection systems enabled by such nano-manipulation tools are increasingly important for homeland security. This project will incorporate high school and undergraduate research assistants, and be integrated into our remote laboratory framework to reach students worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
