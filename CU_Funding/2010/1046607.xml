    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to significantly advance&lt;br/&gt;H2 gas sensing technologies by exploring a novel nanohybrid sensing platform of SnO2&lt;br/&gt;nanocrystals supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The high demand of H2 as a clean energy&lt;br/&gt;source drives the fast growth of the H2 sensor market. Early detection of H2 is essential to the&lt;br/&gt;safe handling of H2, and ultimately supports the market feasibility of a hydrogen economy.&lt;br/&gt;Currently, no single H2 sensor technology exists that can meet the leak detection and safety&lt;br/&gt;features required for the widespread use of H2. Miniaturized resistive sensors based on the&lt;br/&gt;proposed SnO2-CNT platform are promising for H2 detection with low cost, low energy&lt;br/&gt;consumption, superior sensitivity at room temperature, and flexibility to realize selectivity.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are that miniaturized H2 sensors to be&lt;br/&gt;developed will directly benefit society by enabling secure deployment of hydrogen fuel.&lt;br/&gt;Combining the unique properties of novel nanomaterials with rapid progress in microelectronic&lt;br/&gt;device fabrication promises low-cost, novel electronic device structures that can be readily&lt;br/&gt;fabricated using existing microfabrication infrastructures. The major sensing materials used in&lt;br/&gt;this platform, CNTs and SnO2, are affordable, particularly given the small amount of materials&lt;br/&gt;needed for each sensor. With a pre-fabricated sensor substrate, the sensor fabrication time is on&lt;br/&gt;the order of minutes. The project will also train UWM graduate and undergraduate students in&lt;br/&gt;the areas of nanomaterials, nanodevices, and green energy.</AbstractNarration>
