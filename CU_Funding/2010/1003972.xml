    <AbstractNarration>The REU Site, Mathematical Sciences at Ursinus College: A Broad Spectrum of Opportunities, will be a vibrant community of scholars with students as integral members, and will focus on exposing students to opportunities in numerous subfields of the mathematical sciences. Exposure to questions, concepts, and viewpoints from multiple fields has inspired new, deep and interesting theorems, theories and algorithms. The PIs and senior personnel are active researchers in diverse fields in the mathematical sciences ranging from pure mathematics (analysis, operator theory) to applied mathematics (mathematical modeling, differential equations) to computer science (information retrieval, high performance computing). The REU includes the use of cross-project discussion to advance knowledge across different fields in the mathematical sciences with a focus on engaging undergraduates in serious research. The REU activities have been conceived and organized so that participants will have transformative learning experiences on- and off-campus, and will work in an environment that fosters interaction. The program goals are to nurture undergraduates? interest and skills in research, improve their ability to utilize complex constructions and analyze complex issues, and provide them with the mathematical sophistication required for successful research careers in the mathematical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students from diverse backgrounds will be recruited nationwide, and will interact with each other and with experienced faculty. Students will spend eight weeks devoted exclusively to working in teams on original research in the mathematical sciences under the close tutelage of a faculty mentor. The REU will require weekly visible products, presentations at regional and national conferences, preparation of papers for submission to research journals, attendance at sessions on post-graduate opportunities, and visits to other REU sites. The REU students will network and develop professional relationships with the larger mathematical sciences community by participating in a number of off-campus professional events. Participants will be seamlessly integrated into the existing Ursinus Summer Fellows research program which will expose the students to scholarly investigations in a wide range of fields. The REU places a special emphasis on recruiting students who would not otherwise have an opportunity to participate in a research project. Ursinus College is one of the more diverse campuses among highly selective liberal arts colleges, and the PI has a record of, as well as a commitment to, involving students from underrepresented groups on research projects.</AbstractNarration>
