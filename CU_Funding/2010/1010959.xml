    <AbstractNarration>LOOP is the working title for a multiplatform project to promote environmental and scientific literacy about sustainability for children ages 6-9 and their families. Unlike most educational materials for this age group, the LOOP approach requires the audience to learn about the interconnectedness of environmental and human systems in a cross-disciplinary manner. Produced by WGBH, the center piece of the project will be a television series designed for PBS with accompanying digital media on the web and an extensive "Get to Know Your World" outreach initiative. The U.S. Forest Service is one of the project's partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this development stage, the project will: &lt;br/&gt;- Conduct front-end research to obtain a baseline understanding about what kids know about environmental sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;- Further develop and test LOOP's proposed creative style. &lt;br/&gt;- Produce an animatic (a simple mock-up) of a full episode and accompanying live-action video, with input from Content Directors.&lt;br/&gt;- Perform formative evaluation to assess the learning impact of the animatic and live-action video to inform series production.&lt;br/&gt;Concord Evaluation Group will conduct the front-end research to assess children's knowledge of environmental sustainability and formative evaluation of the animatic pilot. Global Mechanic is the animation producer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the potential to (1) inform the field on how to enhance young children's understanding of complex ecological concepts; and (2) "push the envelope" by exploring how mass media can support local environmental investigation and promote outdoor family explorations. Introducing children to systems thinking, especially around environmental subjects, could make a significant contribution to their understanding of and approach to STEM.</AbstractNarration>
