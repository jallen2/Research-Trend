    <AbstractNarration>This project is to utilize a combination of new and existing space- and ground-based data to characterize the mechanisms and pathways by which large-scale atmospheric wave drivers are able to modify the low-latitude ionospheric dynamo and subsequent motion and density of the whole ionosphere. The region of wave-ionosphere interaction and vertical coupling will be observed directly using the highly precise Arecibo incoherent scatter radar (ISR) in Puerto Rico, while COSMIC satellite measurements of ionospheric electron density, TIMED satellite wind measurements, and ground-based GPS measurements of total electron content will be used to identify the global structure of planetary-scale waves that underlie the observations. An initial focus of the analysis will use existing data from these platforms acquired during a major stratospheric warming event and strong ionospheric wave activity, and new ISR data will be acquired from Arecibo Observatory as part of the project. This work will support the education and research training of a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student as well as involve research participation by undergraduates. This collaborative effort is a partnership between two universities, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Arecibo Observatory.</AbstractNarration>
