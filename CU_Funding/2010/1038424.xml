    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the Modern Mathematics Workshop, which will be held in conjunction with the 2010 SACNAS National Conference in Anaheim, California, on September 29-30, 2010. The award provides partial support of faculty and post-docs to participate in a two-day workshop which describes the mathematical underpinning of the upcoming 2011-2012 year programs at a consortium of US- based Mathematics Institutes. The American Institute of Mathematics (AIM), the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI), the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), the Park City Mathematics Institute (PCMI), and the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI) have all agreed to host the two-day workshop. By joining together, they aim to make the Workshop attendees feel welcome to participate in their programs, and become familiar with all the opportunities that the Mathematics Institutes offer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will also feature a speaker who will address the underrepresented minority undergraduates in a three-hour mini-course. The speaker will encourage students to see the various ways in which mathematics acts as the glue among the STEM sciences.</AbstractNarration>
