    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarships plus comprehensive academic and social support to talented, but financially challenged students, who wish to pursue careers in biology, chemistry, mathematics or biotechnology. Serving a student population composed of 45% Native American, 28% African American, and 24% White with 72% women and 28% men, the project is increasing the: &lt;br/&gt;1) number of students enrolled in mathematics and science/curriculum transfer programs; &lt;br/&gt;2) number of students receiving assistance from Student Support Services programs; &lt;br/&gt;3) retention of students to transfer or degree achievement; and, &lt;br/&gt;4) graduation rate of African American, Native American and female students in mathematics and science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is developing the support network necessary for student achievement through a campus-wide effort. Academic performance is being supported through student learning communities, facilitated study sessions, one-on-one tutoring, faculty mentoring, counseling, and support through Student Support Services and electronic communities. Internships, job shadowing and/or faculty-led research opportunities are available to enhance learning and achievement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project impact is significant through incorporation of existing resources with newly developed activities to address the unique needs of rural, predominantly minority students. Research with trained professionals or introductions to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals in business and industry is advancing discovery and understanding and leading to greater achievement and degree attainment. Students are being prepared for successful transitions to work or baccalaureate degree programs, resulting in highly qualified candidates for jobs including jobs as public school science and mathematics teachers. Additionally, the opportunity to transfer scholarship funding to the university is a unique feature of the program. The project is establishing a model for achievement that can be replicated in many other disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
