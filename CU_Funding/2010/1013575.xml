    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at developing a key sensor component in a wireless wearable system for weight and physical activity management in everyday life. The unique advantage of the proposed wearable system is its ability to monitor and provide feedback regarding body weight, physical activity levels and caloric energy expenditure throughout a waking day (not just exercise) while being virtually imperceptible by the user and others. The main research objective of this SBIR project is development of a novel method for seamless weight measurement by a capacitive sensor embedded in the shoe insole. The research will involve design of the sensor plate topology, characterization of the sensor in loading experiments, and implementation of software methods for real-time capacitive measurements focused on lowering the total cost of the sensor system. The anticipated technical result is a durable and low-cost sensor that will enable creation of the wireless biofeedback device for weight and physical activity management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can potentially involve a large portion of the U.S. population. Most Americans and many adults worldwide (over 1 billion people) are overweight or obese. Studies show that the effects of overweight and obesity on public health are comparable to those of cancer. Since physical activity is one of the best methods to prevent weight gain and maintain weight loss, there is an urgent need to develop tools that assist in increasing physical activity and promote wide-scale modification of lifestyle behaviors. The proposed wireless wearable system will facilitate bringing a new kind of a physical activity monitoring device to market. This wireless system can be used by individuals interested in weight management, active adults and athletes. The system will facilitate weight loss and help to prevent weight gain by encouraging small and sustainable changes in daily physical activity via an interactive electronic interface. In the long run, the proposed system may contribute to lowering the nation?s spending on obesity-related healthcare expenses, currently estimated at $147 billion a year. The technology will have numerous markets: Health &amp; Fitness, Athletics, Consumer Fitness, Medical Rehab, Research, and even computer games.</AbstractNarration>
