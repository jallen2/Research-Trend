    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds for research and development to advance the search for the direct detection of dark matter Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) with liquid xenon (LXe) as target and detector medium in next generation, large volume, two-phase time-projection chambers (TPC). These types of detectors have been most successfully exploited by the XENON collaboration, with the XENON10 prototype and the XENON100 detector. The latter is currently the most sensitive dark matter experiment in operation underground with a target at the 100 kg mass scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group will develop and test a two-phase Xe TPC prototype to validate the design of the next generation XENON1T experiment. A key requirement for the realization of multi-ton LXe detectors is the demonstration of electron drift over a meter length, under a field of at least 1 kV/cm. At the same time, one has to demonstrate the liquid xenon purity required to allow ionization electrons to drift across such large detectors. The Collaboration has designed a detector system which will be able to address these and other questions relevant to XENON1T. The goal is to get results within one year, and most of the equipment items could also be used in the actual XENON1T development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this award comes about since the XENON science addresses questions about fundamental properties of the Universe, with all the ingredients to captivate the interest and imagination of students and the general public alike. The research and development work will advance the application of LXe detectors and related technologies in fields beyond particle astrophysics, including national security and medical imaging research.</AbstractNarration>
