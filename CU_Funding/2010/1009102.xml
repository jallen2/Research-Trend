    <AbstractNarration>Yip&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009102&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleagues study the interaction&lt;br/&gt;between the defect structures in materials (such as phase and&lt;br/&gt;grain boundaries) and the background heterogeneous medium. The&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity can come from intrinsic atomic structures,&lt;br/&gt;externally imposed forcing, or even numerical approximations. &lt;br/&gt;The emphasis is on understanding the structure and propagation of&lt;br/&gt;interfaces. Due to the highly nonlinear interaction between the&lt;br/&gt;materials interface and background inhomogeneity, many new&lt;br/&gt;features arise, most notably boundaries between patterns instead&lt;br/&gt;of pure phases, and pinning and de-pinning transitions. In terms&lt;br/&gt;of mathematical disciplines, the project is related to the&lt;br/&gt;concept of homogenization of singularly perturbed problems in&lt;br/&gt;which multiple scales coexist. To tackle nonlinear problems as&lt;br/&gt;in the current setting, new techniques and interpretations beyond&lt;br/&gt;traditional approaches are required. The project investigates&lt;br/&gt;the structure and propagation of boundaries between patterns, and&lt;br/&gt;the connection between pulsating waves and singular&lt;br/&gt;perturbations. Both the discrete and continuum regimes are&lt;br/&gt;analyzed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project is highly interdisciplinary and is&lt;br/&gt;well-motivated by problems coming from applied science, in&lt;br/&gt;particular materials science. It brings together rigorous&lt;br/&gt;applied analysis, numerical simulations and modeling in a variety&lt;br/&gt;of physical phenomena. It emphasizes the connections between&lt;br/&gt;multiple scales, as practical materials often are composed of&lt;br/&gt;structures that have greatly different length scales. Results&lt;br/&gt;can lead to better understanding of how applied forcing and&lt;br/&gt;changes of external environments can affect the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;materials responses. This in turn can lead to the manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;of stronger and better materials.</AbstractNarration>
