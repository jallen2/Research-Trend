    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a costeffective&lt;br/&gt;butanol&lt;br/&gt;production and purification process. The specific aim of this project is to scaleup&lt;br/&gt;a butanol production&lt;br/&gt;system from a small, ?laboratory scale? ,2 liter volume, to a 200 liter culture volume in order to&lt;br/&gt;determine the feasibility of its utility for production of practical amounts of the valuable biofuel.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are that the process should be configurable for fuel&lt;br/&gt;and/or hydrogen production by individuals safely and with negligible environmental impact, and that&lt;br/&gt;demonstration of the feasibility of production of fuels by ?microrefineries?&lt;br/&gt;could foster growth of a&lt;br/&gt;network of ?cottage industries? devoted to local fuel and biochemicals'&lt;br/&gt;production that could provide&lt;br/&gt;increased opportunities for employment in rural areas where carbohydraterich&lt;br/&gt;waste streams are&lt;br/&gt;available. The growth of the dairy products industry in eastern South Dakota has resulted in the&lt;br/&gt;production of copious amounts lactosebearing&lt;br/&gt;whey. Given that cheese plants employ energyintensive&lt;br/&gt;processes and incur significant costs to reduce the biological oxygen demand of waste&lt;br/&gt;streams, it is expected that members of the dairy industry could become enthusiastic customers of&lt;br/&gt;Gaea's butanol production process, provided that this project is able to demonstrate the feasibility of&lt;br/&gt;using their excess lactose for the economical production of fuels that could be used onsite&lt;br/&gt;or sold.</AbstractNarration>
