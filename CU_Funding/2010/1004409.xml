    <AbstractNarration>CNS - 1004409 &lt;br/&gt;REU Site: Digital Forensics Research In Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;Wolfe, Victor &lt;br/&gt;University of Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a renewal proposal with the main topic of digital forensics ? the relatively new science of examining evidence in digital form, such as that which exists on storage media and is communicated in network activity. The project continues to be a cooperative project among researchers and faculty in the Computer Science Department The University of Rhode Island. It aims to bring six to ten undergraduate students to computer forensics research during a 10-weeks REU site. The goals of the project include higher computer science retention rates, greater numbers of students who are women and from minority groups who will continue in computer science and related majors. It also aims to increase recruitment of graduate programs, and to develop skills which will prepare students in a variety of occupations.</AbstractNarration>
