    <AbstractNarration>This three-year REU Site program builds on the substantial research strengths at the University of Maine. The focus on sustainable forest bioproducts is highly topical and of great global importance in the area of sustainable energy alternatives. Ten US undergraduate participants will conduct research advancing their knowledge of the field in general and one of the thematic elements in detail, specifically: 1) sustainability and life cycle analysis, 2) feedstock extraction/modification, 3) process control and sensing, 4) nanomaterial production and utilization, and 5) new product development. In addition the program includes an international component whereby, six Chilean students on a mutual exchange with six US students will participate in this program. Ongoing relationships exist between the University of Maine and Chilean faculty in Forest Resources and Engineering disciplines at the University of Chile in Santiago, the University of Bio-Bio in Concepcion, Chile and the University of Concepcion-UDT. The international component will allow students to learn the nuances of technical practices in the forest products industry in Chile, and discuss business, marketing, technology and environmental issues. At the end of the summer, REU student final presentations will be held at the University of Concepcion-UD in the format of a research conference. The entire conference will be streamed to the US so that the U of Maine based research teams can participate. Through participation in this REU Site program students will be better prepared to collaborate with international scholars and will develop a broader international perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site will specifically recruit minorities through extensive use of existing linkages with primarily minority serving institutions. All participants on this award will be non-UMaine students. The involvement of students in exciting research in the area of sustainable energy alternatives enhances the likelihood that they will consider post-graduate study and broaden the base of the Nation's technical manpower. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EHR/EPSCoR).</AbstractNarration>
