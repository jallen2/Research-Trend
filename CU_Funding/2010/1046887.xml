    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and test a novel media to remove phosphorus from waste water, a growing problem where new technology is needed. Early test results of the proposed approach are promising; showing three times more capacity and longer life than alternatives used today, while being less expensive. The media is a highly porous geoceramic containing nano-iron. Early results show a distinctly different phosphorus removal pattern than other media. This program will evaluate media performance and different filtration configurations. Mechanisms for phosphorous capture will be examined in order to enhance removal rates and media life. Modeling will predict performance requirements and designs will be developed for field testing to be conducted under follow-on work. Preliminary evaluations will be done for phosphorous recovery and regeneration of the media.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are to provide effective approaches to address phosphorus water contamination problems that are a major cause of degradation of water in streams and lakes. High phosphorous creates problems, such as toxic algae growth in lakes and degradation of natural areas, such as the Florida everglades. Phosphorous comes from on-site wastewater systems and water runoff from agricultural and other locations. Efficient, low maintenance technologies are needed to reduce discharge levels. Media with a higher capacity and longer life can provide an economic alternative to mitigate the negative effects that phosphorous has on the environment, while possibly leading to ways of recovering the economic value of the phosphorous.</AbstractNarration>
