    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This Materials World Network project explores the fundamental understanding of vertical strain-control in vertical strain controlled nanocomposite (VSCN) systems, which allows growth of strained layers far in excess of the conventional critical thickness. The project involves extensive collaboration between Dr. Haiyan Wang from Texas A &amp; M University (TAMU) and Dr. Judith Driscoll from the University of Cambridge (UCAM). Funding for the latter is provided by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in the UK. The broader impact of the research is: 1) junior researchers are involved in international multidisciplinary training and are gaining complementary research experience at both universities and at Los Alamos National Laboratory; 2) the materials science and engineering curricula at both universities is being enhanced; and 3) the results are being disseminated to a much broader audience through the summer research program for high school teachers at TAMU, the Woman Engineer Forum and the Woman Mentor Program at TAMU, the Summer School Program at the University of New Mexico (a Hispanic-Serving Institution), Annual Girls School Association events and the Cambridge Science Festival at UCAM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project is concerned with studying VSCN films that can give better physical properties compared to single layer or multilayer films. Basic scientific research is focused on understanding the limitations to strain, interface compatibilities, and lateral ordering. New systems are being grown and explored to demonstrate the power of the VSCN method, and finally demonstrations of the functional applicability of the strongly enhanced VSCN systems are being carried out. Various characterization techniques, such as high resolution XRD and TEM (combined with STEM and EELS), as well as physical property measurements are being utilized to investigate the structure-property relationships of VSCN films.</AbstractNarration>
