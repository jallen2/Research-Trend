    <AbstractNarration>There is a rising demand to scale application performance by distributing&lt;br/&gt;computation across many machines in a data-center. It is difficult to write&lt;br/&gt;efficient and robust parallel programs in the data-center setting because &lt;br/&gt;programmers need to worry about reducing communication overhead while handling &lt;br/&gt;possible machine failures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates a new data-centric parallel programming&lt;br/&gt;model, called Piccolo, that can simplify the construction of in-memory&lt;br/&gt;data-center applications such as PageRank, neural network training etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-memory applications can hold all their intermediate states in the aggregate&lt;br/&gt;memory of many machines and benefit from sharing these intermediate states&lt;br/&gt;between machines during computation. Traditionally, these applications&lt;br/&gt;have been built using low-level communication-centric primitives such as MPI,&lt;br/&gt;resulting in significant programming complexity. The recently popular &lt;br/&gt;MapReduce and Dryad also do not fit well with these applications&lt;br/&gt;because their data flow programming model lacks support for shared states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike data flow models, Piccolo explicitly supports the sharing of mutable,&lt;br/&gt;distributed states via a key/value table interface. Piccolo makes sharing&lt;br/&gt;efficient by optimizing for locality of access to shared tables and&lt;br/&gt;automatically resolving write-write conflicts using user-defined accumulation&lt;br/&gt;functions. As a result, Piccolo is easy to program for, enables applications&lt;br/&gt;that do not fit into MapReduce, and achieves good scalable performance.</AbstractNarration>
