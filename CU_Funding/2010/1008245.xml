    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Lai will conduct a theoretical investigation the physics of neutron stars, which are the highly dense evolutionary endpoints of massive stars. The research will investigate the physical and astrophysical processes occurring at or near highly magnetized neutron stars and magnetars. The major goal of the project is to understand the various observational manifestations of magnetized neutron stars and use this understanding to study physics under extreme conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to characterize the various types of neutron stars and the most important physical processes in each type, and will providing tools to interpret current and future observations. The research is multidisciplinary in nature, involving astrophysics, atomic physics, plasma physics and nuclear physics, and thus is of interest to the wider scientific community. Results from this research will be incorporated into the Cornell University curriculum, and the project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
