    <AbstractNarration>The 2010 Multiphoton Processes Gordon Research Conference, held June 6-11, 2010 at the Tilton School in Tilton, NH, is the 15th in a series of biennial conferences. This international conference is well-established, yet continuing advances in atomic, molecular, optical, and chemical (AMOC) science and related technology preserve its vibrancy. The 2010 meeting is structured around contributed posters and 8 sessions of invited talks, and focuses on topics at the forefront of AMOC science including: Ultrafast coherent control, Free-electron laser experiments and theory, Generation of harmonics and attosecond pulses, Ultrafast imaging, Applications of very high intensity laser fields, Strong-field processes in molecules and solids, Attosecond science, and Controlling light. The broad range of expertise and perspective among attendees provides a unique and stimulating environment for the development of new ideas in these rapidly evolving areas. This award provides funds for students and post-docs to attend the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader aspects are that young scientists are especially encouraged to contribute to the meeting through hot topic talks, selected from contributed abstracts, and poster presentations. The Multiphoton Processes Gordon Research Conference enables these young participants to enhance their presentation skills and connect with a broad cross-section of the AMOC Science community. The unique format of the Gordon Research Conferences where attendees share all meals, and where afternoons are kept open for informal discussions and socializing, allows for extensive opportunities for junior participants to interact with the more established scientists at the conference. This year we have worked hard to increase diversity among participants.</AbstractNarration>
