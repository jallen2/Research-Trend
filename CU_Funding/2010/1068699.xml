    <AbstractNarration>Recent advancements in the experimental atomic physics, remarkable increase in computational power, and development of the high-precision methodologies to study atomic physics quantities led not only to our better understanding of the atomic properties but also to remarkable opportunities for applications in many areas of science and technology. One of such areas is the study of fundamental symmetries with atomic systems. The broad aim of this research is to bridge the gap between the accuracy of the theoretical and experimental parity non-conservation studies in atoms. The goals of these studies are to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model of the electroweak interaction and to probe parity violation in the nucleus. Interpretation of all past experiments and some of the ongoing ones requires theoretical calculations. The new method, which combines two different approaches is developed for this purpose and should be able to reach the require precision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is at the interface of the atomic physics with high-energy physics, nuclear physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology. The methods developed in this project are widely applicably to the number of problems ranging from the study of fundamental interactions to the development of future technologies, such as optical atomic clocks and quantum computing. More precise frequency standards will open ways to more sensitive quantum-based standards for applications such as inertial navigation, magnetometry, gravity gradiometry, measurements of the fundamental constants and testing of physics postulates. The present project will involve education of a graduate student in atomic physics. The student working on the project will be involved in the forefront research and educated in atomic physics and its applications.</AbstractNarration>
