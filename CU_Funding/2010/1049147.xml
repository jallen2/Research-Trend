    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to develop a novel concept for patterning single protein with ultrahigh resolution (below 10 nm). The approach is based on self-assembly and self-recognition and originates in the intracellular environment that is too crowded to allow diffusion to be an efficient mechanism for the movement of materials within the cytoplasm. Specifically, in situ polymerized microtubule (cytoskeletal filaments) affixed vertically to the tip of an atomic force microscope serves as track for purified kinesin molecular motors; under the chemical energy derived from adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis kinesin is deposited from the microtubule tip onto a glass surface situated in close proximity leading to nanoarrays of single protein. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER-developed technology benefits society in areas as: drug delivery, screening, nanoelectronics, and nanosensors. Beyond recognizing the value of this technology through the proof of principle that biological molecules can be used for printing nanoarrays with ultrahigh resolution, this research also provides solutions to patterning individual nanomaterial (both organic and inorganic). The inherent interdisciplinary nature offers tremendous opportunities for enticing and integrating students with educational experience across diverse disciplines (two graduates will be employed by this program). The advances in the field of biomimetic-based nanomanufacturing will be incorporated in two courses Cellular machines at WVU and Processing of Biomaterials at RPI. Lastly, the PI will use Society for Biological Engineers at WVU to popularize bionanotechnology by generating inexpensive posters highlighting the advances and thus contributing to public education in nanotechnology and outreach to underrepresented populations, (i.e., women, rural communities).</AbstractNarration>
