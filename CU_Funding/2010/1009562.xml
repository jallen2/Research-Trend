    <AbstractNarration>Jabbour&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009562&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The main thrust of this project is the study of&lt;br/&gt;instabilities that occur during step-flow epitaxial growth. It&lt;br/&gt;comprises three parts. The first part concerns the discrepancy&lt;br/&gt;between the stability predictions of the standard&lt;br/&gt;Burton-Cabrera-Frank model and recent experiments that have&lt;br/&gt;established the coexistence of step meandering and bunching. &lt;br/&gt;This discrepancy is traced back to the incomplete information&lt;br/&gt;that the classical Gibbs-Thomson relation delivers about the step&lt;br/&gt;chemical potential. An alternative theory, informed by&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamics, yields a framework for resolving the&lt;br/&gt;aforementioned discrepancy. The second part focuses on the roles&lt;br/&gt;of electromigration and elasticity in the onset and evolution of&lt;br/&gt;step instabilities. In both cases, appropriate generalizations&lt;br/&gt;of the Gibbs-Thomson relation are embedded in thermodynamically&lt;br/&gt;compatible formulations of the resulting free boundary problems. &lt;br/&gt;As regards electromigration, the goal is to determine if the&lt;br/&gt;interplay between the drift velocity and the jump in the adatom&lt;br/&gt;grand canonical potential along steps can explain the observed&lt;br/&gt;reversals in the current direction needed to trigger bunching&lt;br/&gt;upon transition from low- to medium- to high-temperature regimes. &lt;br/&gt;With respect to elasticity, the effect of stress on the stability&lt;br/&gt;of an isolated step against meandering and that of a periodic&lt;br/&gt;train of steps against bunching is studied. In the third part,&lt;br/&gt;the growth of nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy and&lt;br/&gt;electrodeposition is considered. Because of its small radius,&lt;br/&gt;which implies few steps, the growth of a nanowire is an ideal&lt;br/&gt;setting to examine boundary effects on step instabilities and&lt;br/&gt;compare the standard Burton-Cabrera-Frank formulation to its&lt;br/&gt;proposed thermodynamically consistent alternative. The role of&lt;br/&gt;the jump in the adatom grand canonical potential during&lt;br/&gt;electrodeposition is probed, especially whether bunching provides&lt;br/&gt;a dissipative mechanism for the minimization of the nanowire&lt;br/&gt;total free energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project develops a unified approach to a central&lt;br/&gt;problem at the junction of materials science, solid-state&lt;br/&gt;physics, and applied mathematics, namely, the investigation of&lt;br/&gt;the onset and evolution of instabilities during step-flow&lt;br/&gt;epitaxy. Through a blend of modeling, analysis, and computation,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator and his collaborators develop novel mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theories that resolve discrepancies between experimental&lt;br/&gt;observations and existing models. Instabilities play a critical&lt;br/&gt;role in the self-assembly of various nanostructures, which in&lt;br/&gt;turn strongly affect the macroscopic performance of devices that&lt;br/&gt;span a wide range of technologies, from optoelectronics and&lt;br/&gt;data-storage devices to biosensors and energy-conversion systems. &lt;br/&gt;A fundamental understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying&lt;br/&gt;these instabilities and their interplay can therefore contribute&lt;br/&gt;significantly to the design and manufacture of increasingly&lt;br/&gt;smaller and more reliable devices with tailored properties for&lt;br/&gt;specific applications.</AbstractNarration>
