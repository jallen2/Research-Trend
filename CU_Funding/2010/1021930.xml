    <AbstractNarration>PI: David A. Baum &lt;br/&gt;IOS-1021930&lt;br/&gt;The molecular mechanisms by which genes alter development when moved between closely related species &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available methods for isolating genes that cause closely related species to differ are limited by depending on the prior identification of candidate genes or on being able to hybridize the species and then isolate the causal differences. As a result, scientists are making slow progress towards the aim of identifying species-difference genes. This project is developing a new approach, transgenomics, which exploits the ease with which genes can now be moved between certain plant species. The project tests the effects of genomic fragments from Leavenworthia alabamica when introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana by transformation. These two species have many visible differences, yet are closely related. In prior work, more than 1200 A. thaliana transgenic lines were created that each contain a randomly selected fragment of DNA from L. alabamica. These were visually screened to identify DNA fragments that consistently alter plant form. For some cases where the transgenic plants resemble L. alabamica, the causal DNA sequences will be determined by testing subfragments for an ability to alter plant form. Additionally, the project will attempt to perfect the transgenomic strategy so that future experiments can proceed more efficiently with the aim of ultimately being able to screen an entire genome from a donor species in a recipient species' genetic background so as to identify genes that contributed to the differences between the donor and recipient. This work has the potential to rapidly advance our ability to determine which genes cause which traits and thereby to guide targeted efforts to design crop species with desirable agronomic features. In addition, this project will provide training to undergraduate students, a postdoctoral fellow, and a graduate student from a group underrepresented in science.</AbstractNarration>
