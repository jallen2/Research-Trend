    <AbstractNarration>This award provides continuing support for a program of research for the High Energy Physics group at Columbia University Nevis Labs. The program encompasses a broad spectrum of fundamental experiments in particle and astroparticle physics covering activities in five major ongoing programs: ATLAS; MiniBooNE/SciBooNE; MicroBooNE; and Double Chooz as well as R&amp;D work on future projects including the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) and proton decay. Studies will be devoted to characterizing the Standard Model (SM) with increased precision and looking for new physics beyond the Standard Model since this most likely holds the key to making progress in our understanding of the universe. These will include searches for effects that herald supersymmetry, the Higgs boson, and possible extra space-time dimensions. The research program will also tackle the question of the nature of fundamental particles, such as top quarks (ATLAS) and neutrinos (MiniBooNE, MicroBooNE, Double Chooz), and, through precision measurements, probe higher energy scales. In addition, the Columbia group places a high priority on broader impacts, especially education and outreach, and plans to build on its very successful past efforts to integrate these activities into its ongoing research. The goal is to engage the full educational spectrum from high school students, high school teachers, undergraduates and the general public in understanding and doing high energy physics. The activities range from individual faculty outreach efforts, such as lectures, tours, and research involvement with high school students, to structured programs like the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). A primary emphasis of the Columbia programs is to target diversity and underrepresented groups</AbstractNarration>
