    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1007255&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Constantin Teleman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research comprises several, thematically related&lt;br/&gt;projects at the interface of topology, 2-dimensional quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theory and category theory. The first project, gauged&lt;br/&gt;mirror symmetry, combines group actions on projective manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;equivariant K-theory and ideas from category theory (open-closed&lt;br/&gt;TQFTs and a conjectural Brauer group of equivariant K-theory).&lt;br/&gt;One application would be the determination of Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory of GIT quotients from the gauged Fukaya category of a&lt;br/&gt;symplectic manifold. A concrete description of gauged topological&lt;br/&gt;quantum field theories in two dimensions is proposed, based on&lt;br/&gt;recent progress by Kontsevich, Costello, Hopkins and Lurie on&lt;br/&gt;'extended' topological field theories. The PI has a concrete&lt;br/&gt;proposal for coupling a 2-dimensional TQFT to a compact symmetry&lt;br/&gt;group and quantizing the gauged theory. This combines ideas from&lt;br/&gt;physics (Landau-Ginzburg super-potentials) with earlier work by&lt;br/&gt;the PI and collaborators on equivariant (twisted) K-theory and&lt;br/&gt;the general index formula on moduli of principal bundles over&lt;br/&gt;Riemann surfaces. The second project explores the 'higher&lt;br/&gt;algebras' introduced by the PI and collaborators as simplified&lt;br/&gt;models of higher categories, and the a toy example of a&lt;br/&gt;homotopical TQFT for finite homotopy types. This is hoped to be a&lt;br/&gt;good working ground for the interaction of exotic homology&lt;br/&gt;theories with ideas from QFT. A third, closely related project is&lt;br/&gt;the construction of Chern-Simons gauge theory as a 0-1-2-3 theory&lt;br/&gt;by topological methods, along the lines already accomplished by&lt;br/&gt;the PI and collaborators for torus groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To explain the context of this research, one must recall that the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental interactions governing energy and matter in the&lt;br/&gt;universe are believed to be governed by quantum field theory, a&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated mathematical framework that has evolved from the&lt;br/&gt;beginnings of quantum mechanics over the last century. Quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theory has never been reconciled with general relativity --&lt;br/&gt;another well-supported physical theory -- and much mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research over the last six decades has centered around&lt;br/&gt;reconciling the two. Topological quantum field theory is a toy&lt;br/&gt;attempt to come to grips with the problem while avoiding the&lt;br/&gt;analytical difficulties: the notions of distance and magnitude&lt;br/&gt;(for instance, mass) are abandoned, and the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;space-time is directly related to the algebraic structure of the&lt;br/&gt;quantum field theory. Substantial progress in understanding the&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structure has been made over the last decade thanks to&lt;br/&gt;work by Kontsevich, Hopkins and Lurie. The PI's projects revolve&lt;br/&gt;around integrating these recent developments with the idea of&lt;br/&gt;symmetry -- in the form of gauge theory -- which is known to be&lt;br/&gt;indispensable in realistic physical theories. (One should recall&lt;br/&gt;that the so-called 'standard model' of particle physics,&lt;br/&gt;comprising the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions, is&lt;br/&gt;a gauge theory.)</AbstractNarration>
