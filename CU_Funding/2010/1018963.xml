    <AbstractNarration>We are living in a golden age of information where computing and sensing technology collect and generate tremendous amounts of data and the Internet facilities data storage and manipulation by the masses. A growing area of interest is how to provide this data back to the consumer to improve awareness of some aspect of his/her life. This project investigates the use of always-on interactive displays (much like a wall clock) to support awareness with a particular focus on awareness of energy consumption in the home. The goal is to identify how such displays can be designed and effectively integrated into the fabric of home life to support awareness of energy consumption habits. Researchers will investigate several important aspects of integrating feedback devices into the home, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* The tradeoffs between aesthetics and utility &lt;br/&gt;* Data privacy considerations&lt;br/&gt;* The effect of such devices on home routines and vice versa&lt;br/&gt;* Supporting motivation and system adoption in a multi-inhabitant home&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These issues are most effectively addressed by studying real people in real households. Thus, researchers will undertake user-centered methods to inspire, inform, and evaluate designs through fieldwork and long-term deployments of designs in real homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will apply to not only energy consumption awareness, but more broadly to other areas where data feedback and reflection may promote personal awareness. Examples include supporting awareness of fitness and nutrition habits or feedback of activities of everyday life (medicating, sleeping, eating, etc.) for the elderly aging in place.</AbstractNarration>
