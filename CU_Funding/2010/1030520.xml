    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposed research is to develop a new process to modify the surface function of a biological tissue scaffold. This novel printing process is a dual functional freeform microplasma surface patterning and biologics printing process which will produce maskless micro-size patterns as well as print biomolecules or living cells. Microplasma-induced surface property enhancement will be studied to identify its effect on biological activities such as cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. An engineering model will predict the extent of surface functionalization generated with the plasma patterning process as a function of key process parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research integrates fundamental plasma science and freeform fabrication technology with life sciences and tissue engineering. If successful, this research will contribute to a novel and viable process that will operate at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to conduct maskless surface treatment and biologics printing. Manufacturing advantages include cost savings by way of fewer process steps, flexibility in material choices due to the more friendly process conditions and higher resolution printing of the molecules allowing for a wider window of applications. The ability to align living cells and proteins and to guide their functions will enable a fundamental and interdisciplinary research advance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. In addition, the outcome of the research will also enable fabrication of cell-based therapeutic products, and create knowledge on developing a new generation of microplasma surface treatment techniques and biological printing systems. These will have a wide range of application in regenerative medicine, disease pathogenesis study, drug discovery and testing, and manufacturing cell/tissue-on-chips.</AbstractNarration>
