    <AbstractNarration>Participating Institutions: University of North Texas (lead), Texas Woman's University and University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Description &lt;br/&gt;This project is studying onsite, virtual, and remote laboratories used in undergraduate engineering education, garnering measureable learning outcomes (e.g., ABET) to examine the interaction effects of lab designs, instructional input, and student demographics. The goal is to establish a framework for developing a blended learning environment in which different laboratory designs (onsite, virtual, and remote) function in concert to enhance student learning and attitudes and improve educational practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information technologies have created far-reaching transitional effects on how instruction is delivered and students learn. This project is advancing an understanding of the impact of this transition on student learning outcomes and the engineering curriculum as a whole. The end products will include: (1) New labs - remote and virtual labs are being designed, implemented and evaluated through four project courses. The Virtual Instructor module within these designs is providing students a more realistic learning environment. (2) Student-centered pedagogical design - by using a project-oriented lab curriculum, students are exploring their own path to learning by discovery of their solutions to lab problems. This modality enables the students to take control over the exploration and practice problem-solving skills, and fosters creativity. (3) Enhanced understanding of differing lab designs - a comparative study is examining the differences of effectiveness in support of student learning among different lab designs which, in turn, will help educators and researchers make more informed decisions regarding future lab development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance &lt;br/&gt;The project is creating and offering laboratory instruction that appeals to students with diverse learning styles, backgrounds, and interests. The project hopes to improve the recruitment and retention of women and minority students in engineering by engaging them in the co-design of the learning experience, through a joint program with Texas Woman's University and cooperation with the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. The project, through its dissemination activities, is expected to reach a broad audience of those interested in adopting the new labs by offering a choice of delivery types (onsite, virtual, and remote) to adapt for a specific implementation.</AbstractNarration>
