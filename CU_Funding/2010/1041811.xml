    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This project will use the latest material and physical sciences tools, techniques, experience and methodology to understand the degradation modes of the daguerreotype in order to help preserve the Nation's collections of the first photographic images. The most comprehensive scientific studies of the daguerreotype were done approximately 30 years ago. In the ensuing years improved monitoring techniques have revealed that there is alarming deterioration occurring with daguerreotypes, and that our current body of knowledge does not provide solutions. The purpose of this project is to address this need. Specific goals are: (1) To develop and deploy new analytic tools and techniques, so as to understand the science of the daguerreotype and specifically its degradation pathways; (2) To use state-of-the art instruments to investigate the image formation mechanisms, the micro and nano structure of the component materials with an emphasis on the degradation markers, byproducts and dynamics; (3) To translate fundamental understanding to preservation protocols, exploiting modalities that will contribute to our understanding of basic material science, to the techniques and technology of preservation of a family of irreplaceable national heritage objects; (4) To contribute new understanding of the techniques of the original artists; (5) To develop multi-target preservation treatments and protocols for daguerreotype preservation taking into account the complex interactions with the environment found both in storage vaults and in modern display environments; (6) To contribute to the understanding of how it was possible that color images were reported by some early daguerreotypists; (7) To leverage the unique historical records and collections of daguerreotype fabrication artifacts held within the vast collections of daguerreotypes and associated technology at the George Eastman House to unravel the mysterious differences observed among the products of different 19th century daguerreotypists. (8) To train the next generation of scientists capable of addressing fundamental problems that impact preservation science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Among art and cultural heritage objects requiring advanced scientific preservation research, one category stands apart: the phenomenon of "photography." The first photographic images the world saw were those arising from the discovery of Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre in 1839 - the daguerreotype or "mirror with a memory." Quickly appreciated and commercialized, the daguerreotype thrived for only a comparatively short period, being replaced by paper and "film" based photography. During its popularity, daguerreotypes were not only used to record images of people, but to create historical records of national borders, city-scapes, and buildings. Daguerreotypes were taken by explorers to document their travels and findings. Thus daguerreotypes represent an irreplaceable record of our history that is exceptionally vulnerable to degradation and loss. As an object of scientific interest, the daguerreotype stands out because the underlying processes that create the image derives from nano-science and thus its study demands interdisciplinary, state-of-the-art tools and techniques. The overarching goal of this project is to apply 21st nanoscience and material chemistry techniques to understanding and preserving the 19th century's serendipitous "nanotechnology". A new generation of daguerreotype research is called for so museums, conservators, and conservation scientists can prevent the documented rapid deterioration exhibited by many if not all daguerreotypes. In the long term, this project will develop restorative treatments that are scientifically based. The team will address this need by understanding the degradation mechanisms and developing controllable and quantifiable conservation methods that satisfy the highest ethical standards. In addition to contributing to scientific understanding and the preservation mandate, this project will train the next generation of SCIARTisans - exceptional scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds who will also be experts in the impact and ethics of preservation of our cultural heritage objects.</AbstractNarration>
