    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to validate the hypotheses that multiscale modeling of part geometry, material composition, and physical properties is enabled through use of a suitable set of basis functions and zooming operations (zoom-in, zoom-out) that are based on grids and multi-resolution functional analysis, and enables Computer-Aided Design (CAD), computational materials design, and concurrent part-material design processes. The research will result in methods for modeling of a part's geometry, its material composition, and its physical property distributions (e.g., stiffness and strength) in a manner that facilitates engineering design, analysis, and manufacturing. The research approach involves investigating multiscale geometric modeling methods, based on a dual-representation of wavelets and surfacelets, as well as subdivision methods for navigating multiple scales. To incorporate material composition and mechanical properties, methods from computational materials design will be utilized to integrate structure-property relationships from materials science into the geometric models. Deliverables include a multiscale modeling framework for geometry and materials, a repository of multiscale material models, and demonstration and validation using physical experiments, engineering student education, and software that enhances the research and education infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research could provide a significant benefit to society by enabling engineering of complex device designs that lead to products with improved performance, better utilization of material, and fewer resources consumed in their manufacture. The new multiscale modeling framework enables the integration of part and system design with materials design and manufacturing activities. Collaborations with industry and government partners enables testing the benefits of such integration in designing complex parts with new materials. Applications ranging from complex, multi-material thermoplastic parts to photovoltaics, high performance alloy aerospace parts, and improved heat sinks for microprocessors are enabled by these advances. Participating graduate and undergraduate engineering students as well as under-represented students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research. A web-site will be established to report results and provide access to a web-enabled version of the proposed CAD technology.</AbstractNarration>
