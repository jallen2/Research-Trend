    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to develop methods for modeling Phononic Crystals (PnCs) and to characterize them experimentally. PnCs are a type of micro/nanostructure that are capable of manipulating the manner by which elastic waves travel through a material by a periodic patterning of a material's geometry. Computer simulations will be used to model the behavior of the PnCs. These simulations will then guide the design, fabrication and experimental characterization of the PnCs. Deliverables include analytical and computational tools for PnCs, theoretical and experimental results demonstrating how elastic waves move through PnCs, demonstration of how PnCs alter the thermal conductivity of a material, documentation of results, engineering student education, and engineering research experience for students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research will lead to a wide range of technological advances in the areas of signal processing and thermo-electric devices. Because the inherent geometry of PnCs give them their ability to process elastic waves (signals) these types of devices will be in a position to replace traditional digital signal processing techniques which consume relatively large amount of power in comparison to PnCs. Additionally, by manipulating phonons in materials more efficient thermoelectric devices can also be constructed that can be practically used for thermal harvesting of energy. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research as well as students from a local community college that serves only Native Americans. Course material will also be developed as a part of this award that will address the different modes of energy transport in materials and the interplay between them.</AbstractNarration>
