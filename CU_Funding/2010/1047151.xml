    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to is develop a novel "green-state" joining process that is compatible with a unique powder injection molding feedstock used for the production of metal injection molded (MIM) parts of high complexity. This project is exploring the feasibility of forming a "perfect joint". In this context, a perfect joint is defined as one that cannot be distinguished from base material by differences in microstructure, chemistry, or other material properties. The non-homogeneity of current metal joining methods such as welding, soldering, reaction bonding, and adhesive joining limits their use in certain high performance applications in which uniform properties are highly vSalued. MIM is unique in that the shaping is done in a separate unit operation from microstructural development. In the process under development, joining will take place after shaping, but before the final thermal processing step - in such a way that the interface between two contacting molded parts is completely eliminated on a microscopic scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of this project is wide-ranging. On the commercial side, this new technology will not only find high performance applications for which uniform properties are greatly valued, but also applications that are far more common. In particular, provided it is cost effective, the new joining technology will often be used to replace joints made by current expensive joining methods. This technology is expected to greatly reduce the cost of manufacturing such items. A broad area of application is in the production of hollow products. The technology could be used to produce heat exchangers for turbine engines as well as supercomputers. Inexpensively made but high quality hollow products could conceivably replace current solid parts in applications where high weight is detrimental, e.g., aerospace. On the societal side, this project initiates the partnership between a small manufacturer and an academic institution; provides practical research experience for a graduate student; exposes minority students in local high schools to opportunities in research and local manufacturing; and strengthens the manufacturing base of the U.S., providing wealth and jobs.</AbstractNarration>
