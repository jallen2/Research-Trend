    <AbstractNarration>The college is enrolling cohorts of ten low-income students per year from groups historically underrepresented in science in this project entitled the "Future Chemists Scholarships and Support" (FoCuS) program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The college has designed a curriculum, social activities and an advising infrastructure that support FoCuS scholars throughout their college careers. These efforts are designed to improve retention of the FoCuS scholars and all students in the chemical sciences beyond the first year of college. As FoCuS students matriculate, these students who are majoring in chemistry or biochemistry are being supported through several key activities: 1) scholarships; 2) a Summer Chemistry Bridge program; 3) intensive mentoring and advising; 4) cohort support systems and social activities; 5) leadership opportunities; 6) career exploration; 7) research opportunities and 8) an innovative chemistry curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In order to fill the growing gap in the scientific workforce, the college is recruiting from groups currently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (STEM) fields. This project is increasing retention of students majoring in the chemical sciences and has the potential to increase the diversity of students in the STEM workforce. The college has a long-standing interest in advising and mentoring students through cohort programs and is committed to improving diversity and providing access to education for financially needy students. For each of four years FoCuS is enrolling cohorts of 10 high achieving students from groups historically underrepresented in science. Thus, at least forty students are receiving direct funding and support, but all students enrolled in the chemistry major are benefiting from the redesigned chemistry major and support infrastructure. Results are being disseminated at conferences and through a publicly accessible website.</AbstractNarration>
