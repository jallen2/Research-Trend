    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this joint project between the University of Washington and the Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble-INP) in France is to develop an integrated experimental and meso-scale simulation approach to design porous electrochemical ceramics with multifunctional design requirements. The research focus is on the development of a framework for the analysis and optimization of the microstructure of this important class of materials. The competing requirements on the microstructure, for optimum electrochemical performance on one hand and mechanical performance and thermo-mechanical stability on the other, are being studied. Using this understanding to design optimal microstructures, to process them and characterize their performance is the central element of this integrated experimental and state-of-the art simulations investigation. High performance electrochemical systems (e.g. electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells, gas separation membranes and batteries) have microstructural requirements that include high surface area and porosity. These requirements are seemingly contradictory to requirements for reliable and stable long term performance. This apparent contradiction can be addressed by using graded, hierarchical and/or anisotropic porous microstructures. However, a systematic and scientifically based approach to design these complex microstructures has not been developed, and this is the overarching goal of this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated experimental and meso-scale simulations research project builds on and further enhances the established international collaboration between two groups with complementary expertise to address all the needed elements to achieve the overall goal of the project. The effort uses experimental techniques to process materials with complex microstructures, and experimentally and numerically investigates the effect of the microstructure on the mechanical and electrochemical performance and the thermo-mechanical stability of the microstructure. The lessons from these investigations are used to numerically design optimal microstructures, to experimentally process them, and to characterize their performance. The group at the University of Washington focuses on the experimental investigation. However, the US graduate student spends significant time with the collaborators in France to learn and use the discrete element code dp3D developed at the SIMAP laboratory of Grenoble-INP. She/he is also able to conduct simulations remotely from the US. Similarly, the graduate student from Grenoble spends significant time in the US learning the experimental techniques and approaches. This international, integrated, collaborative research effort provides a unique high quality learning opportunity for the participating students. The investigators integrate this research with educational programs for K-16 through undergraduate research and summer pre-engineering programs like Materials Camps and Math Academy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
