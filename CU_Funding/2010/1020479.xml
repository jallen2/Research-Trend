    <AbstractNarration>This project will conduct comprehensive research to construct and test detailed models of population and community ecology, with a focus on African lion populations. First, the project will investigate lion population dynamics at the level of individual social groups as well as larger-scale sub-populations, constructing statistical models with population-level, group-level, and individual variables to determine the relative impacts of short-term variability in demographic performance and environmental conditions on population growth and stability. Comprehensive data on day-to-day variation in prey availability within the ranges of 24 different lion groups will be measured and used to link the shifting mosaic of migratory herbivores and territorial behavior of the lions in a spatial food-web model across the landscape. Second, the project will investigate the role of spatial heterogeneity in stabilizing the coexistence of competing carnivore species. Cheetahs, leopards, lions and hyenas may show divergent niche strategies that create a reticulated pattern of occupancy within an overall pattern of coexistence. Third, the project will measure cycle-length of four viral diseases in the lions to test predictions of multi-host disease transmission models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will continue to train Tanzanian researchers, collaborate with Tanzanian scientists and provide research opportunities for American graduate students and undergraduates, including individuals from under-represented minorities. Results from the study will help wildlife managers to predict consequences of habitat change and fragmentation, to identify the landscape features necessary for species co-existence, and to measure the effectiveness of disease control programs.</AbstractNarration>
