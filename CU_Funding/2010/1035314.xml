    <AbstractNarration>This Phase II Noyce project is preparing science and mathematics teachers, knowledgeable in their content areas, familiar with standards based education and prepared to meet the challenges of teaching in high needs schools by: 1) recruiting highly qualified individuals into science and mathematics teaching career pathways; 2) preparing and presenting course materials that address the challenges and rewards of working in high needs schools; 3) providing early teaching experiences in these schools; and 4) supporting the science and mathematics teachers in their induction years through the assistance of former Noyce scholars currently working in similar schools. It builds on a previous Noyce Phase I award (0531856) which awarded forty-two scholarships and four stipends to prospective science and mathematics teachers who committed to teach in high needs schools. This project expands and enhances Stony Brook's commitment to working with high needs schools on Long Island and in New York City. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight two-year scholarships are being awarded to attract talented undergraduate science and mathematics majors to enter the teaching workforce. Twenty-five, one-year scholarships are being awarded to STEM professionals undertaking teacher certification studies through a Masters in Teaching program. Eight two-year stipends are being awarded to graduates of the program working in high needs schools, who have committed to contributing to Stoney Brook's teacher education programs and to in service professional development activities. School districts involved include Brentwood, Central Islip, New York City, and William Floyd. Other contributing entities include the New York State Urban Teacher Education Center (SUTEC) and Stony Brook's recently created Center for Science and Mathematics Education (CESAME)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this proposal is that it profits from and builds upon the success of prior projects in order to advance knowledge of teacher preparation, with respect to early teaching experiences and novice teacher induction practices, and how these affect teachers in high needs schools. The monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of the Phase I and Phase II outcomes are also being expanded. They are being evaluated with respect to their success in recruiting, preparing and retaining teachers in the high needs schools of the region. Longitudinal data is also being collected in order to provide data concerning the long-term program features that contribute to effective science and mathematics teacher development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project's broader impacts include: 1) improvement in the quality and quantity of mathematics and science teachers for high needs schools; 2) building of new models for the recruitment, preparation, and retention of mathematics and science teachers to meet teacher shortages, and 3) dissemination of findings that have the potential to advance knowledge in the field.</AbstractNarration>
