    <AbstractNarration>This CRPA project seeks to use the arts (theater) to explain and interest audiences about three large NSF sponsored science centers in the state of South Dakota, Washington and Louisiana. Content of the programs include the physical sciences: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Materials and famous scientists such as Richard Feynman. The audiences include a broad spectrum of the public including underserved groups such as Native Americans and other underrepresented minorities, people with disabilities, and particularly citizens in rural environments. In addition to the PI, Dr. Brian Schwartz, the project will be a cooperative endeavor with the Dusel Homestake facility in South Dakota, and the two LIGO facilities in Louisiana and the state of Washington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In cooperation with the two NSF sponsored LIGO sites in Louisiana and Washington as well as the NSF sponsored Solar Neutrino capture site in South Dakota, the PI and his team will help the local arts groups design appropriate plays that will bring science to the rural audiences near these sites. By so doing, it is hoped that the local public will be more understanding of and have greater interest in the many aspects of the scientific endeavors in their community. Thus, the developed expertise in the arts personnel should enable them to derive more productions on the science of these sites and to work with the scientists on site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to note that these productions will strive to inculcate the local culture(s) which include rural residents, Native Americans, people with disabilities, and other underserved and underrepresented audiences. Through this medium it is anticipated that science education will derived in a relaxed and entertaining atmosphere. Past experience has been centered in urban environments where the Arts are more common. This project is an experiment in rural environments where there are many fewer science centers and art productions dealing with science.</AbstractNarration>
