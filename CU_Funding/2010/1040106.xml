    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition and development of a next-generation system for measuring plant and ecosystem gas-exchange. The new instrument builds on the Carnegie Institution's work in an area that continues to provide fundamental insights for plant physiology and biochemistry, plant evolution, plant ecology, ecosystem ecology, and global biogeochemistry. The new system will incorporate recent technology developments, including cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS, for NH3 and stable isotopes) and dual quantum cascade lasers (for COS) into a single system that can measure all NH3, COS, CO2, H2O with high speed and accuracy, at the very low concentrations typical of ambient conditions, at the plant and ecosystem scale. The next-generation gas exchange system will enhance research and teaching infrastructure for a range of users, including faculty and post-docs at three of the Carnegie Institution's departments (Global Ecology, Plant Biology, Geophysical Laboratory), graduate and undergraduate students from regional universities and collaborators from around the world. Results from the studies conducted with the new system will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
