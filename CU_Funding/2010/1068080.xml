    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research of Assistant Professor John T. Giblin, Jr. at Kenyon College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cosmos is a laboratory in which we can test physics at extremely high energies. As such, information about high-energy processes in the Cosmos provides one way of understanding the fundamental nature of matter, gravity, and the interactions of particles at those energies. This award funds work that will help interpret the information we observe in the Cosmos, and will demonstrate how these observations are tied to theories of fundamental particle physics. Professor Giblin and his students will use high-performance computing to simulate models of high-energy physics, and use these simulations to predict observational consequences of these models. Once completed, this work will enable physicists to constrain a variety of different models and parameters --- results which may have implications for the design of the next generation of observational missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also addresses several broader needs. First, it provides funding for undergraduate students over the next three years. Meaningful undergraduate participation in original research is critical in inspiring the next generation of scientists and a critical part of scientific education. Further, this award will fund a "Saturday Science" program at Kenyon College. This program will bring two hundred middle-school students each year to campus and provide a sensory introduction to science. Such programs are essential, particularly in rural communities, and will help bring young students into contact with professional scientists.</AbstractNarration>
