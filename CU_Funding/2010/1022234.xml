    <AbstractNarration>In democratic settings ranging from Italy to Indonesia, we observe the coexistence of free and fair elections with a large number of allegedly criminal legislators. At the same time, there is a growing concern in many developing democracies that the electoral sphere is increasingly being restricted to a narrow cadre of politicians who boast significant personal wealth. This study considers the interactive effects between money and "muscle" in democratic politics. The project is motivated by the simple puzzle: why are politicians in democracies often rewarded, rather than punished, for their criminal connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advantage of a unique source of data, the investigators study the conditions under which candidates accused of criminal misconduct succeed in democratic societies through an examination of India, the world's largest democracy. The study attempts to address four overarching questions. First, why do political parties recruit candidates for office who possess serious criminal indictments, and what role does money play? Second, what impact does alleged criminality have on electoral performance? Third, what explains the motivations of voters in supporting suspected criminal candidates? And finally, what are the consequences of money and "muscle" for the effective functioning of democratic accountability?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aims to contribute to our understanding of the relationship between criminals and electoral that is applicable to a diverse range of democratic settings. First, this study provides a unique method of measuring criminality and political corruption that is broadly applicable to a wide range of democratic settings. Second, a better understanding of the role of money in candidate selection adds a previously under-theorized dimension to the literature on political selection. Third, this study aims to contribute to our understanding of the causes and consequences of criminal politicians, namely the underexplored motivations of voters. Indentifying and explaining these motivations can also help policymakers develop policies that could improve the rule of law and democratic effectiveness in India and other electoral democracies.</AbstractNarration>
