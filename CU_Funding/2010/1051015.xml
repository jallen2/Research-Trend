    <AbstractNarration>The Gulf of Mexico oil leak offers an unprecedented opportunity to study rapid evolution in a well-studied system: the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). This species has a rare, black form that persists at about 1% in nature. Oil contamination is likely to change the background coloration of its habitat and the conspicuousness to predators of the silver form, potentially favoring the black form. The goal of this work is to sample Florida populations before the oil hits them, and just after, so as to assess black and silver fish frequencies as the habitat changes. This work will be followed by additional surveys of long-term changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study may be profound for scientists, college students and the general public as this may be an example of selection in action that parallels the rise in frequency of the peppered moth during the Industrial Revolution. Few opportunities arise for the public to see natural selection occurring on a grand scale at a rapid pace such as is predicted under these extenuating circumstances. In addition, a graduate student will be trained in the course of this study.</AbstractNarration>
