    <AbstractNarration>East Los Angeles College (ELAC) is providing the programmatic, academic and student support necessary to increase the annual number of STEM graduates and transfers by 60 students by the end of five years, which is 64% growth over baseline. The project improves articulation at both high school to college and two-year to four-year institution levels; implements faculty advisement and counseling, assigns students to faculty mentors who help design efficient educational plans and STEM pathways; expands research and internship opportunities at university laboratories; and exposes students to professional milieus, broadens their vision of career opportunities, and helps them to develop research skills. In addition, a summer bridge program attracts high school juniors and seniors who have not previously considered STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given its large Hispanic enrollment, advancing STEM education at ELAC helps to increase Latino STEM graduates and transfers. Increased rates of graduation and transfer enable more educationally disadvantaged Latinos to enter the STEM workforce. With this project, the college's infrastructure is redesigned to focus on opportunities in STEM careers, and to smooth transfer pathways to regional universities. Faculty participation in advising, mentoring and sharing of effective pedagogical methods helps transform ELAC into a STEM transfer gateway institution. ELAC disseminates information about the project to similar types of institution, shares best practices, and encourages them to adopt procedures to increase STEM transfers and graduates.</AbstractNarration>
