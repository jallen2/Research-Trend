    <AbstractNarration>This grant will support participation of US based students in the 2010 International Conference on Highly Frustrated Magnetism (HFM2010) to be held at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD in Aug. 2010. While conventional magnetic materials feature perfect ordering of atomic magnetic dipole moments, such order does not always occur. The geometry of the crystalline lattice and the range and nature of the interactions between magnetic dipole moments can disfavor long range order and lead to "Frustrated Magnetism." The corresponding materials have very unusual physical properties which are of deep fundamental interest and hold potential for applications. Research on frustrated magnetism relies on close collaboration between a variety of physical scientists. HFM2010 will draw new talent to the field and establish new collaborations to address the scientific challenges. For students and post docs, HFM2010 will provide a view into the excitement of this cutting edge research facilitated at the beginning of the meeting by a tutorial from top experts. To keep the cost of student/post doc participation down, affordable lodging is provided in Johns Hopkins dorm rooms. The NSF grant will fund reduced registration fees for US based students and provide travel support for early career invited speakers.</AbstractNarration>
