    <AbstractNarration>This project is continuing to develop and evaluate a substantially new model for engineering education known as the IRE (Iron Range Engineering) model, built on project-based learning (PBL). In IRE, students work with industrial professionals on design projects. The goal is to produce graduates who possess integrated technical and professional knowledge and competencies. IRE students are upper-division mechanical engineering students most of whom are graduates of Minnesota's community colleges. IRE students do not take classes. All of their learning is done in the context of the industry projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The publication of Engineer 2020 in 2004 reiterated the need for a new-look engineering graduate. The IRE model has been developed with guidance from respected leaders in engineering education. In addition to industry-based PBL, the model includes outcome-based assessment, just-in-time interventions, self-directed learning, and emphasis on reflection. The emphasis of this project is on the evaluation of how engineering learners develop in the IRE model. The project is assessing the extent to which IRE students are acquiring knowledge and developing competencies recommended in national reports and by ABET (the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology). This evaluation is using various assessment tools (such as the Self-Directed-Learning-Readiness Scale, the National Survey of Student Engagement, the TIDEE design assessment system, selected concept inventories, and best-practice portfolios) to measure realized outcomes with respect to the goals. The results of this project are bring shared with the widest possible audience &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The primary emphasis of this project is on the development of learning outcomes that have been spelled out in national reports, including The Engineer of 2020 and ABET. This emphasis is in contrast with a heavy emphasis on topical material that characterizes many of the engineering programs throughout the world. Faculty members in the new IRE program invest heavily in developing the abilities of students to assess their development with respect to these outcomes. To support self assessment, faculty members are teaching the IRE students criteria that are assisting their metacognitive thinking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Successful completion of this project is providing engineering educators with a researched-based understanding of how effectively students learn engineering in project-based learning. The results of this study will make visible the extent to which students in engineering PBL develop cognitively, acquire technical competency, acquire professional competency, and the extent to which their motivation to learn is affected.</AbstractNarration>
