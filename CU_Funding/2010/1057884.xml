    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program supports the work of Professor Jon R. Parquette at the Ohio State University, which focuses on the self-assembly of hierarchical nanostructures for optoelectronic applications. The self-assembly of small molecules into one-dimensional nanostructures offers many potential opportunities for electronic and biomedical applications. Most applications require the assembly or co-integration of molecules with specific properties within the nanostructures. Thus, the self-assembly process must not only be controllable with regard to nanostructure, it must be capable of integrating these functional components. The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the nature, dimensions and composition of the nanostructures can be controlled on the nanoscale, and to correlate these structural factors with the corresponding physical, chemical and functional properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spontaneous self-assembly of small molecules into highly ordered nanostructures produces many of the functional materials found in nature, ranging from the membranes of cell walls to the amyloid fibrils responsible for a variety of neurological disorders. This work utilizes molecular self-assembly to create nanostructures that enhance the performance of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells. Progress toward the creation of low cost, organic solar cells may increase the utility of solar power and create a clean, renewable source of energy to replace fossil fuels. This program encourages the participation of undergraduates and students from under-represented groups in chemical research. Many of these students go on to graduate schools in chemistry or medical programs.</AbstractNarration>
