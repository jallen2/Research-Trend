    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial travel support for 5-10 junior scientists from the US institutes to attend the 2010 International Symposium on Nuclear Symmetry Energy to be held at RIKEN, Wako, Japan July 26-28, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the Conference is to provide the international community of nuclear scientists the opportunity to disseminate the newest developments at the forefront of the science on nuclear symmetry energy. The NSF funds will permit the PI to assist about five to ten US early career scientists with the cost up to half of their flight ticket from US to Japan. The participants include both internationally recognized senior scientists from around the world and the young and rising stars. Participation of younger scientists is essential to address the future manpower needs of this rapidly changing field and technical workforce of the nation before the US Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) comes online at the end of this decade. In the mean time, the Rare Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) at RIKEN provides the most promising opportunities to study the equation of state of dense asymmetric nuclear matter and nuclear properties for nuclei with extreme neutron and proton ratios. The conference will provide opportunities for participants to form international collaboration in experiments and in theory projects.</AbstractNarration>
