    <AbstractNarration>Once a science focused on organisms and their ecosystems, ecology now spans the study of individual molecules to the entire biosphere. This Ecological Society of America organized project is supporting an initial workshop to address the need in the ecology community to develop digital materials that are available to teach ecology at the undergraduate level. The workshop is bringing together research scientists, faculty and technology experts to: 1) identify strategies and technologies to lower barriers that hinder, and develop incentives that will accelerate, contributions to and usage of the EcoEd DL resources; 2) establish and coordinate strategic partnerships among scientists (as potential providers of resources), and educators with their students in a wide variety of settings (as both potential contributors and users) to achieve intellectual sustainability; and 3) outline strategies for the financial sustainability of EcoEd DL to ensure site maintenance and anticipate the next generation of technology.</AbstractNarration>
