    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This project is expanding an early CCLI project that developed a prototype desktop learning module (DLM) that could be used for experimentation and demonstration of basic concepts in fluid mechanics and heat transfer. The DLM is a desktop apparatus with multiple, easily removable cartridges that can be reconfigured to perform a variety of experiments. Studies have found that usage of the DLM has led to positive and statistically significant impacts on students' critical thinking skills and has also improved student scores on the Miller concept inventory. In this expansion effort, the DLM is being re-engineered to improve its functionality and serviceability. Additional cartridges are being built to support experiments in chemical, civil, electrical, and biomedical engineering. The project is also developing accompanying course and laboratory materials that incorporate modern pedagogical techniques. The new DLM and cartridges are being used in classes at five different institutions, ranging from a two-year college to a research intensive university. The impact of the DLM on student learning is being rigorously studied across all five institutions. The project is working with industry partners to move the DLM from the prototype stage to the commercial product stage. The results of the project are being disseminated through conference and journal publications and dedicated faculty development workshops at the ASEE Chemical Engineering Summer School.</AbstractNarration>
