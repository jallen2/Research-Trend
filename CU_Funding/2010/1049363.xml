    <AbstractNarration>In response to the Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Cornell University is awarded a RAPID grant to develop information infrastructure that enhances our ability to provide information on the impact of the oil spill. The project uses Internet and information technologies to engage volunteers in providing critically needed data to assess the impact of the oil spill on wildlife and the environment through time. The Biodiversity Tracker will expand the capabilities currently provided by eBird (www.ebird.org), which uses a network of volunteers to survey beaches and marshes for birds. These data are displayed on real-time, interactive maps showing locations of reported birds in relation to current and forecasted oil slick locations. Expanded capabilities will include online data forms and maps to collect and display information on oiled birds, other wildlife affected by the oil spill, and beach conditions; outreach support to engage more participants; and open access to all data through the Avian Knowledge Network (www.avianknowledge.net) and DataONE (dataone.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico will affect the region's biodiversity and ecology for years to come. Understanding this impact requires documenting the spill's effects on wildlife and the environment throughout the entire region, yet traditional biodiversity monitoring and inventorying approaches are inadequate to gather the vast amounts of data needed. The Gulf Coast Oil Spill Biodiversity Tracker engages citizen-science participants in gathering these data and makes the information publicly accessible through interactive online maps and databases. These data will enable quick responses for scientific and conservation efforts and will provide a fundamental data resource needed to monitor ongoing impacts from the disaster.</AbstractNarration>
