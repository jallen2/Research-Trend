    <AbstractNarration>The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (the IRIS Consortium,&lt;br/&gt;www.iris.edu) operates multi-user facilities for the development, deployment, and operational&lt;br/&gt;support of modern digital seismic instrumentation and data management to serve national and&lt;br/&gt;international research and education in the Earth sciences. IRIS programs are overseen and&lt;br/&gt;governed by a Consortium of 115 Member Institutions, comprising virtually every US university&lt;br/&gt;with research programs in seismology. Consortium membership also includes 107 Foreign&lt;br/&gt;Affiliates and 20 Educational Affiliates. IRIS collaborates with national and international&lt;br/&gt;mission agencies, including the USGS, NOAA, DOE, DOD and the Comprehensive Test Ban&lt;br/&gt;Treaty Organization, to leverage NSF investments to serve significant societal needs in the&lt;br/&gt;monitoring of earthquakes, tsunamis and nuclear test ban treaties.&lt;br/&gt;The preeminence of US Earth science in investigations of the Earth?s interior and&lt;br/&gt;earthquake sources rests in large part on the data and instrumentation facilities supported by NSF&lt;br/&gt;and managed by IRIS. The programs and activities to be carried out by IRIS under this award&lt;br/&gt;take their intellectual direction from a community-based long-range science plan described in the&lt;br/&gt;2009 report: ?Seismological Grand Challenges in Understanding Earth?s Dynamic Systems?&lt;br/&gt;(www.iris.edu/hq/files/publications/iris_proposals/doc/seis_plan_final.pdf). Seismology provides&lt;br/&gt;a rich source of information on the structure and composition of Earth's crust, mantle, and core&lt;br/&gt;that, when coupled with other types of data in the growing number of interdisciplinary studies to&lt;br/&gt;which IRIS is committed, continues to enhance our understanding the origin of the planet, its&lt;br/&gt;evolution through geologic time, as well as the internal forces driving plate dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes, volcanism, and the geomagnetic field. Recent developments in seismic sensor design,&lt;br/&gt;and the acquisition, transmission and storage of data have resulted in dramatic improvements in&lt;br/&gt;the resolving power of seismic imaging of Earth?s interior and characterization of the earthquake&lt;br/&gt;source. In addition to supporting basic research and discovery in the Earth sciences, the IRIS&lt;br/&gt;facilities also contribute essential data, resources and educational materials to programs with&lt;br/&gt;broad societal impact related to earthquake hazard mitigation, groundwater, energy and mineral&lt;br/&gt;exploration.&lt;br/&gt;The facilities and services managed by IRIS include:&lt;br/&gt;? Instrumentation Services - operation and support for the 150 permanent broadband&lt;br/&gt;stations of the Global Seismographic Network (in collaboration with the USGS) and a pool of&lt;br/&gt;more than 2000 portable instruments of the Program for Array Seismic Studies of the Continental&lt;br/&gt;Lithosphere (PASSCAL) for denser deployments in NSF-funded research projects both in the US&lt;br/&gt;and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;? Data Services ? free and open access through the IRIS Data Management Center to all&lt;br/&gt;data collected by IRIS programs or contributed by numerous national and international partners,&lt;br/&gt;along with support for software development, user tools, training services and data products to&lt;br/&gt;facilitate broad data utilization and encourage high quality standards in data collection and data&lt;br/&gt;management.&lt;br/&gt;? Education and Public Outreach - creating materials and tools to encourage the public&lt;br/&gt;and educators at all levels to explore seismological data and advance awareness and&lt;br/&gt;understanding of seismology &amp; Earth science, while inspiring careers in geophysics.&lt;br/&gt;Under the new Cooperative Agreement with NSF starting in 2011, IRIS will merge its&lt;br/&gt;long-standing support for Polar studies in both the Antarctic and Arctic with its other core&lt;br/&gt;services; move towards integrated management, starting in 2013, of its core programs with the&lt;br/&gt;related facilities of the USArray component of EarthScope; and continue to explore emerging&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to support research and hazard mitigation efforts in earthquake prone areas of the&lt;br/&gt;developing world.</AbstractNarration>
