    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to investigate architectural design approaches to enable pervasive community-shared sensor grids composed of contributed sensor nodes from multiple sensor networks across different administrative domains and ownership. Two fundamental components of this research which allow controlled sharing of sensor nodes? hardware resources and software programmability are: (1) a low-overhead virtualization of the nodes themselves, including layer-2 bridging support and the ability to switch the mote network context among multiple application entities to form transient -underlays- that connect motes across multiple domains, and (2) a P2P overlay network of the sensonet-Internet gateways that is responsible for dealing with authentication, authorization, formation and teardown of these underlays. &lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome of the research is set of network applications that will enable Internet users to contribute their sensor hardware and to carve their own sensor network from these shared resources in a GENI-style sharing. This has the potential for promoting participatory sensing among ordinary citizens, for playing a role in urban sensing and emergency response system in the future, and for influencing the development and commercialization of embedded sensing platforms. A more short-term impact during the course of the project is recruitment and retention of students by coupling class projects with experimentation on design prototypes, especially targeted towards engaging students from under-represented groups into research.</AbstractNarration>
