    <AbstractNarration>1033810&lt;br/&gt;Misture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer many potential advantages for the conversion of renewable, carbon-based biofuels to electrical power, most notably the opportunity to provide fuel-flexible power systems for a variety of applications ranging from small scale to large scale. However, there are several technological issues with SOFCs that use hydrocarbon streams, many of which can be related to reliability of the anode. To address the anode reliability issue, recent work has shown that traditional Ni metal SOFC anodes can be partially or fully replaced by oxides which substantially improve performance in carbon-based biofuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to incorporate high-activity, oxide-promoted metal nanoparticle catalysts into the SOFC anode that can tolerate a dirty biofuel environment and can be periodically regenerated. Materials of interest are oxide spinels, which are reduced in the fuel stream to yield metal nanoparticles supported by defect spinels. Regeneration of the anode requires an oxidation/reduction process in which the metal colloids are resorbed into the spinel under oxidizing conditions and then reduced, thus regenerating the catalyst. The proposed research will develop a quantitative understanding of the function and interplay of the oxide-supported metal catalyst with the mixed ionic/electronic conducting oxides. A rich array of chemical composition is available in the spinels, which will allow for studies on the effects of promoters and catalytic metals or alloys that include, for example, Ni, Co, Cu, Mn, and Ru. Characterization of the reduction and regeneration processes for the spinels, as well as measurements of the ionic/electronic conductivity under wet and dry hydrogen or methane gas, will provide fundamental information to guide the development of the composite anodes. Performance of single button cells with composite anodes of varying composition will allow for the quantification of the impact of each component of the composite, and provide data to elucidate the mechanisms responsible coking resistance in the SOFC application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A student team of graduate and undergraduate students will carry out research, education, and outreach activities as an integrated effort. As part of K-12 outreach, the student team will provide hands-on demonstrations on biofuels topics to middle and high school students through existing programs, including Engineering and Materials Science Day, Success in College in Engineering, and Science on Wheels. This student team will also develop a website which will highlight research efforts in biofuel SOFCs, the role of undergraduates in that research effort, and speak broadly to the cultural and social impacts of green, renewable energy. This website will be designed to indirectly support the New York State Leadership and Assistance for Science Education Reform (LASER) program, which provides research-based products and services to support K-12 science education.</AbstractNarration>
