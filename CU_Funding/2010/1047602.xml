    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0603957&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Helmut Hofer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of symplectic geometry has a large interface to other&lt;br/&gt;mathematical disciplines, like algebraic geometry, differential&lt;br/&gt;topology (particularly in small dimensions) and dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;to name a few. Dr. Hofer's project is concerned with the study of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental aspects of symplectic geometry, its applications to&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems, as well as the development of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;technology to address analytical problems arising in the&lt;br/&gt;field. One part of the project is devoted to the study of&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) which currently is the most general&lt;br/&gt;and most comprehensive theory of symplectic invariants. Another&lt;br/&gt;part develops a general approach for studying certain classes of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations as they occur&lt;br/&gt;in SFT. These methods potentially should have other applications&lt;br/&gt;in nonlinear analysis as well. A third part is devoted to the&lt;br/&gt;applications of the theory to dynamical systems. The aim is the&lt;br/&gt;development of mathematical infrastructure, based on a&lt;br/&gt;combination of Floer theory and the theory of finite energy&lt;br/&gt;foliations due to Dr. Hofer and his collaborators. This research&lt;br/&gt;aims at the understanding of long-term behavior of iterated&lt;br/&gt;area-preserving disk maps with its numerous applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many physical systems like the flow of an incompressible ideal&lt;br/&gt;fluid, the movement of a satellite under the gravitational forces&lt;br/&gt;of celestial bodies, or the movement of charged particles in a&lt;br/&gt;magnetic field, to name a few, are examples of so called&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems. The mathematical theory of dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;provides tools to understand their complex behavior and allows to&lt;br/&gt;make predictions. The particular examples mentioned above are of&lt;br/&gt;so-called Hamiltonian nature and have an intricate structure&lt;br/&gt;leading to extreme complicated dynamical behavior. Stabilizing a&lt;br/&gt;beam of particles in a partic= le accelerators, or sending a&lt;br/&gt;probe on an interstellar journey, or understanding the dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of a stationary flow of an incompressible ideal fluid are&lt;br/&gt;problems whose mathematical underpinnings are touched by the&lt;br/&gt;research proposed in this project. Some of the methods developed&lt;br/&gt;potentially have application to larger classes of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations of relevance in physics.</AbstractNarration>
