    <AbstractNarration>Fault-tolerance is now a primary design constraint for all major microprocessors; however, perfect fault-tolerance is not a requirement for most designs. Instead, designs strive to maximize performance subject to an acceptable failure rate constraint. Therefore, vendors typically set a failure rate (FIT) target for each design and validate that the design meets this target with extensive pre-silicon and post-silicon analysis. One method to quantify fault masking is to use vulnerability factors. A system consists of multiple independent components that interact through well-defined interfaces. Therefore, fault masking can be quantified within a single component by focusing on its interfaces. This abstraction is called the "vulnerability stack", and is the major focus of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vulnerability stack can have immediate tangible benefits to the Computer Architecture community. First, by enabling independent vulnerability assessment of each system component, the vulnerability stack allows a designer to assess (and potentially improve) the fault-tolerance of a particular component (e.g., a user program). This enables a much broader segment of the Computer Architecture and Software Engineering communities to participate in the vulnerability assessment and remediation process; currently, these activities are typically performed by architects equipped with a microarchitectural model. A second benefit of the vulnerability stack is a substantial reduction in the overall effort required for vulnerability assessment. A third benefit of the vulnerability stack is its application to runtime vulnerability estimation techniques. These are of interest because they allow a system to dynamically tune redundancy features to match the current vulnerability environment; this can improve performance during periods of low vulnerability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will impact undergraduate and graduate education by introducing vulnerability concepts in the Computer Architecture curriculum at Northeastern University and deliver a tutorial at a major Computer Architecture conference. The project will also include participation by under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
