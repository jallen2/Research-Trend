    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on correcting common student misconceptions about fundamental concepts in dynamics courses through active inductive learning. Four primary aspects of the project include: 1) the development and testing of prototype inquiry-based, hands-on educational materials to teach engineering concepts in dynamics; 2) utilizing the Dynamics Concept Inventory and other short conceptual questions to assess the effectiveness of interventions; 3) analyzing the process of student learning through talk-aloud exercises and recordings of students conducting the activities; and 4) disseminating the prototype activities and assessment results to the engineering community. The inquiry-based learning activities will be easy to use, inexpensive, well-publicized, and disseminated through a variety of mechanisms, including traditional publications and presentations as well as web-based activities. The inquiry-based approach incorporates elements (e.g., collaborative learning) that are intended to improve the retention of underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs. Subjective surveys and analysis of the talk-aloud activities will help determine the effectiveness of the inquiry-based learning activities in these populations.</AbstractNarration>
