    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to use a new top-down Aluminum Induced Crystallization (TAIC) technology to create thin-film silicon solar modules with over 12% efficiency. First, large-grain crystallization of hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin film with thicknesses needed for solar cells will be obtained using TAIC. Second, the doping of resultant films to suitable levels by annealing samples in an atomic hydrogen environment will be studied. It is expected to create over 12% efficiency thin-film solar modules with low temperatures (less than 300 degree Celsius) required. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a method for thin-film silicon solar cell manufacturers to effectively improve the energy conversion efficiency with minimal additional cost. The limited efficiencies of amorphous silicon thin-film solar cells curtail their market adoption. While polycrystalline silicon solar cells have the highest potential of any thin-film silicon option, the manufacturability is still a concern. Current crystallization process requires temperatures in excess of 550 degree Celsius for over 20 hours. In this project, TAIC technology will be utilized to eliminate these disadvantages to manufacturing by creating very large-grain polycrystalline silicon thin films at low temperatures and in a short time (minutes).</AbstractNarration>
