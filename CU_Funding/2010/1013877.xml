    <AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for junior researchers and invited speakers participating in the "Conference on Symmetry, Separation, Super-Integrability and Special Functions," held 17-19 September 2010 at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. The meeting focuses on recent developments and new challenges in symmetry methods for analysis of mathematical models that arise in a broad range of physical applications. The conference topics include:&lt;br/&gt;-- Linear and nonlinear Lie symmetries of differential and difference equations: hidden (higher order) symmetries, differential invariants.&lt;br/&gt;-- Separation of variables theory and its relation to symmetry; applications to spinor equations and general relativity.&lt;br/&gt;-- Super-integrability of classical and quantum systems.&lt;br/&gt;-- Exact and quasi-exact solvability for Schrodinger eigenvalue equations.&lt;br/&gt;-- Relationship between symmetries and super-integrability of differential systems (especially hidden symmetries) and the theory of special functions.&lt;br/&gt;-- q-algebras and q-special functions; Askey-Wilson polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;-- Representation theory of Lie algebras, quadratic algebras, and cubic algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will assemble leading experts, promising younger researchers, and graduate students from around the world to assess the rapid advances in the area, reach a consensus on what are the most important problems, and evaluate the most promising directions for further advances. The conference will include a panel discussion that takes stock of the field, to be documented and posted online. The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, women, and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://www.math.umn.edu/conferences/s4/</AbstractNarration>
