    <AbstractNarration>In the United States, there are over 2.6 million miles of paved roads 94.6% of which have an asphalt concrete surface, representing a $30 billion annual investment. Premature fracturing of asphalt overlays poses a significant economic and environmental burden to society and can reduce the safety of our nation?s highway and airfield pavement infrastructure. The proposed partnership between university and industry in this GOALI study will lead to the development of advanced pavement rehabilitation systems (thin, bonded overlays) that are recyclable, sustainable, and provide a safe riding surface. The proposed work plan will utilize a hybrid approach, involving advanced laboratory testing and instrumentation, development of new damage models, simulation of pavement systems, and calibration of models to field performance. This project will also improve how digital imaging can be used to understand fracture behavior in complex, layered, composite infrastructure material systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the aforementioned advancement in discovery and understanding, the broader impacts of the proposed project are: the promotion of teaching, training, and learning, through incorporation of research results in university courses; broadened participation in research by underrepresented groups through Minority Outreach Program and the Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering Program; and; broad dissemination of research results in journals, and through conference presentations, and workshops. The benefits of the proposed research to society include: a more sustainable approach to pavement maintenance; reduced life cycle costs, and; improved highway safety. Through partnership with industry, the new techniques will be validated against field projects and transferred to practitioners through regional workshops.</AbstractNarration>
