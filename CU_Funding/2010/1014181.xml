    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will employ innovative alloy nanowire manufacturing concepts to enhance the low frequency response of carbon nanomembrane for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding of cabling and electronics. Currently-employed metals present corrosion and thermal expansion mismatch concerns when bonded with composites. Shielding with carbon nanomembrane will address these materials problems and offers the added advantage of lower weight. Shielding with carbon nanomembrane has been demonstrated to be as effective as with aluminum at higher frequencies, but not at the low frequency range. This project will address this deficiency by incorporating permeable amorphous alloy nanowires into the carbon nanomembrane to enhance reflectivity, the primary shielding mechanism at low frequencies. Two approaches to amorphous alloy nanowire production will be explored. Dispersion and loading optimization studies will be performed to incorporate the nanowires into carbon nanomembrane as a minor constituent. Changes in existing membrane properties, infusibility and cure cycles will be explored to identify potential side effects of including the alloy nanowires. The goal is to demonstrate EMI shielding effectiveness comparable to aluminum at frequencies of 1GHz and lower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, is the availability of non-metal EMI shielding materials that will have the same effectiveness as metal shielding. As designs for electronics enclosures and other structural components transition to composite materials to save weight, coatings must be employed to protect electronics from electromagnetic interference due to environmental effects, proximity to other electronics, or electromagnetic weapon attack. Carbon nanomembrane presents many advantages over metal coatings for EMI shielding of composites, including weight savings, manufacturing efficiency improvements, and compatibility with composite materials and processing techniques. Improving the low frequency response of carbon nanomembrane will enable a wider adoption for this material in EMI shielding applications for electronics and cabling.</AbstractNarration>
