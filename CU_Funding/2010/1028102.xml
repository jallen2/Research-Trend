    <AbstractNarration>1028102&lt;br/&gt;Ripley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides $300,000 in total funding over 24 months to acquire two gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IRMS) systems for the Stable Isotope Research Facility (SIRF). The instruments will replace current failing ones. The instruments will be used for petrology and ore genesis, geomicrobiology, planetary processes, water-rock interaction, environmental assessment, atmospheric science and archaeology. The instrumentation will support faculty from Chemistry, Biology, Geography/Atmospheric Sciences, Archaeology and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs in addition to the Department of Geological Sciences which manages the SIRF. In addition, outsider users (~ 80 in the past three years) have utilized the facility. An instrument capable of four ion beams simultaneous measurement is requested for SF6 analysis. A more standard instrument is requested which will be used for oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen isotope analysis. The SIRF has users both at Indiana University and outside institutions. Student use is also high. The SIRF provides hands-on training for students. Training includes sample prep and instrument operation. The PI and co-PI have managed the SIRF for more than 20 years. Both Pis have a strong background in advising underrepresented graduate students. The instruments will be housed in the existing SIRF space. The facility has two full-time technical researchers. Technician salary, supplies and maintenance come from grant support and external user fees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
