    <AbstractNarration>Of the adult stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) appear to have the best potential for regenerative medicine. MSCs contain precursors that are able to differentiate into numerous types of cells but with a much lower risk of tumorigenicity. The heterogeneity of the bone marrow stem cell population makes it difficult to resolve the conflicting data on MSC plasticity. The specificity of current markers available to identify MSCs fails to separate the populations of structurally distinct cells. Hence, strategies that isolate and maintain the subpopulations of MSCs would transform the field of stem cell biology. In this work, a novel hypothesis for separating and isolating pure populations of stem cells will be tested. To test this hypothesis, investigators will use an integrative approach that couples mechanics modeling with experiments to predict the surface properties required to maintain subpopulations of MSCs. This will eventually facilitate a more uniform cell population to be established and studied for their capacity to differentiate into specific lineages, thereby enhancing their differentiation efficiency. The PI will integrate research into curriculum at Michigan State University and engage graduate, undergraduate and high school students in research in this multidisciplinary area.</AbstractNarration>
