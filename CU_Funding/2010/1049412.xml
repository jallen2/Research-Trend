    <AbstractNarration>This award supports undergraduate students attending the Laser Science Conference to be held October 24-28, 2010. The student's participation will be via the 'Symposium on Undergraduate Research'. The students will present the results of their research and discuss these with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One broader impact is the opportunity for these young students to attend a national meeting and give their first public talks. A secondary benefit arises because collaborations among them are often born in these sessions. A third impact is the networking among these students that will be so vital to their future careers as professional scientists. Also, this meeting encourages them to continue along such a career path.</AbstractNarration>
