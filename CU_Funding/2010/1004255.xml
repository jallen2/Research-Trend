    <AbstractNarration>1004255&lt;br/&gt;Monk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a timely response to the rapidly expanding field of stem cells, and to the escalating involvement of engineers in this field, American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Society of Biological Engineering is organizing the Second International Conference on Stem Cell Engineering (ICSCE). This meeting, held every two years, covers the breadth of Stem Cell Engineering and serves to promote, shape, and refine the definition of the field as a whole. The theme of this second meeting will be "Engineering Cell Fate"; the conference aims are to provide a venue: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. For scientific presentations from a diverse group of leading biology and engineering researchers who cover the breadth of Stem Cell Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;2. For interactions between academic and industry researchers, who bring different approaches and perspectives to the field. &lt;br/&gt;3. For active participation by Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers, who represent the future of stem cell biology and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;4. For bringing biologists and engineers together can help to provide an atmosphere and venue for both to discuss their disciplines and approaches, which will lead to a better understanding of the field by all. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope, theme, and aims of the meeting are committed to integrating the physical and engineering sciences with the life sciences, encouraging research and development in multidisciplinary areas, and supporting molecular and cellular research across multiple scales. This project will partially support the support the travel of 60 graduate students and three postdocs to attend the Second Annual International Conference on Stem Cell Engineering to be held in Boston, Massachusetts on May 2-5, 2010. Women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities will be actively encouraged to participate.</AbstractNarration>
