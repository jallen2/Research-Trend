    <AbstractNarration>The American Association for the Advancement of Science, Capacity Center is conducting a forum in which representatives from key stakeholder groups address the challenges involved in conceptualizing, translating, and implementing traditional and innovative evaluation approaches, strategies, and methods to assess efforts which hold the promise of transforming undergraduate STEM education. The workshop takes initial steps to foster a multi-disciplinary community that engages in cross-disciplinary dialogue and work to develop appropriate theoretically and intellectually rigorous evaluations of undergraduate STEM education. Intellectual Merit: The workshop brings members of the evaluation community and undergraduate STEM disciplinary communities together to 1) examine and improve the conceptualization and implementation of rigorous evaluation of undergraduate STEM education innovation; 2) share lessons learned and best evaluation practices; and 3) investigate and stimulate the development and/or use of innovative or traditional evaluation approaches, strategies, methods, and tools. Given that a major goal of the Division of Undergraduate Education is to transform undergraduate education, the workshop is a forum for stakeholders to examine promising evaluation approaches, strategies, methods, and tools to assess progress toward the achievement of this goal. Broader Impact: Participants at the workshop have roots in a variety of institutions. They represent a cross section of STEM disciplinary faculty who are engaged in the development and/or evaluation of undergraduate STEM educational efforts and professional evaluators who are engaged in the evaluation of undergraduate STEM education projects. Participants also represent key designers/implementers and consumers of evaluation of undergraduate STEM educational innovations.</AbstractNarration>
