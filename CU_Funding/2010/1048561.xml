    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for travel to preliminary planning meetings, and to attend a workshop at the headquarters of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. The workshop will allow US researchers to coordinate efforts with the strategic initiatives of the German Archaeological Institute, one of the largest and most archaeological organizations in the world. The US researchers will be primarily associated with the large and well-established Perseus Digital Library (with a focus on Greco-Roman Antiquity) and the group associated with the Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (with particular strength on Asian culture). Both have considerable international collaborations underway. Preliminary meetings will address the challenges of developing interoperable linguistic and geographic resources that are of great value to scholars studying long-term cultural transformations across broad geographical areas.</AbstractNarration>
