    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Bacteria have an amazing diversity of pathways for generating the energy they need to live and function. This diversity contributes to their ability to thrive in and impact different environments. Despite this importance, our knowledge of how the metabolic potential of bacteria influences ocean ecosystem function is far from complete. The main research goal of this project is to understand how the function of alternative oxidase (AOX) physiologically benefits microorganisms. AOX is a component of energy generation pathways of certain marine bacteria which are numerically dominant and/or important for chemical cycling in ocean environments. Due to the fundamental connection between energy generation and bacterial growth and survival, AOX could ultimately be linked to the contribution of these bacteria to the functioning of the ocean ecosystem.Towards this research goal, the genetically manipulable marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri will be used as a model organism in genetic, molecular, and biochemical assays. These assays will test hypotheses that AOX functions to reduce oxidative stress and DNA damage, maintain metabolic balance, and/or reduce oxygen tensions under various growth conditions. The results of these studies will provide important new information related to the benefit of AOX function in bacteria, and lay the foundation for exploration of the role of AOX in the physiology of other marine bacteria and the influence of bacterial AOX on marine ecosystem function. In addition, these studies may contribute to understanding the evolutionary history of this interesting protein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This research project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by providing opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and a postdoctoralresearcher to actively participate in the research activities. These students and researcher will be encouraged to interact with the scientific community by attending and presenting at regional, national, and international meetings. In addition, outreach seminars discussing the research will be presented at regional colleges and universities with the goal of developing relationships with faculty and students at non-PhD granting institutions to encourage talented undergraduates to consider graduate studies. Finally, scientific outreach to the general public will be accomplished through participation in the Norman Science Café, a venue that promotes informal and conversational interactions between scientists and people without formal scientific training.</AbstractNarration>
