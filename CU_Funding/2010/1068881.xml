    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a research program on the physics and astrophysics of gravitational waves, largely in support of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The primary scientific objective of this research is to help make LIGO a success, (i) by increasing its prospects of detecting gravitational waves from a wide variety of sources, and (ii) by improving its ability to extract from observed waves the rich information that the waves should carry. More general objectives are to contribute to the advance of the technology and techniques for high-precision measurements, contribute to our understanding of astrophysical systems as sources of gravitational waves, and contribute to the development of numerical methods and computer codes capable of carrying out robust and accurate simulations of highly dynamical curved spacetime. More specifically: (1) The proposed research will formulate and evaluate innovative approaches to improving Advanced LIGO's sensitivity, both in the near future and longer term. The research will also explore how gravitational-wave interferometers can be used to explore the quantum behavior of human-sized objects and search for new, unknown physics. (2) The research will continue to improve the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) and its ability to solve Einstein's general relativity equations. (3) By combined analytical techniques and numerical simulations with SpEC: (i) gravitational waveforms for binary black holes will be generated for use in LIGO data analysis; and (ii) the nonlinear dynamical behavior of highly curved spacetime will be explored. Strategies will be developed for using LIGO data to map the curved spacetime inside gravitational-wave sources. (4) Numerical and analytical tools will be applied to the study of gravitational-wave sources with matter (neutron-star binaries, neutron-star/black-hole binaries, stellar collapse), contributing to a deeper understanding of: (i) their gravitational-wave, neutrino, and electromagnetic emissions, and (ii) their possible roles in short and long gamma-ray bursts and supernova explosions. (5) The supported group will contribute to (i) the LSC's searches for gravitational-wave events in LIGO data, (ii) the improvement of LIGO data analysis infrastructure, and (iii) algorithms that will enhance LIGO's data-analysis capability and efficiency in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program will serve as a training ground for young physicists and astrophysicists. It will teach them a wide variety of research techniques, ranging from experimental design and analysis, through development and use data-analysis algorithms, to the astrophysical phenomenology of gravitational-wave sources and the study of astrophysical systems by analytic techniques and 3+1-dimensional numerical simulations. Senior personnel on this proposal will vigorously pursue a wide range of activities that reach out to the broader scientific community and the general public, through: (i) dissemination of research results and scientific data via publications, lectures and the internet; (ii) interacting with K-12 educators and students, e.g. via the LIGO outreach program, (iii) public lecturing, and (iv) active participation in the design and production of science-based Hollywood movies, documentaries, educational radio programs and multi-media shows.</AbstractNarration>
