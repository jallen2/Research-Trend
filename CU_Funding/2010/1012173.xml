    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Zi-Ling (Ben) Xue at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, to carry out fundamental studies of the reactions of transition metal complexes with oxygen and water. Competitive oxidation in the complexes by oxygen and their gradual conversion to metal oxides by oxygen and water will be investigated. The properties of reaction intermediates will be investigated, and thermodynamic and kinetic data will be gathered to understand their conversion to metal oxides. A mentoring program through the University of Tennessee Math and Science Center will help advance the careers of first-generation college students in Tennessee and attract them to the sciences. The studies will also help develop the research infrastructure in Tennessee, an EPSCoR (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reactions to be studied here have been used in chemical vapor deposition/atomic layer deposition processes to make the state-of-the-art microelectronic metal oxides that are a key component of the newest and smallest transistors. An understanding of the basic chemistry of the reactions may lead to better precursors for and new chemical routes to the microelectronic materials.</AbstractNarration>
