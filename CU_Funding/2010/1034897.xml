    <AbstractNarration>Mississippi State University (MSU) is planning to join the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Center for Autonomic Computing (CAC)" which currently is a multi- university center comprised of the University of Florida (lead institution), the University of Arizona and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. The mission of the CAC at MSU is to engage academia and industrial partners in joint efforts to accelerate both the understanding of the fundamentals of autonomic computing, and the transfer of these fundamentals into industry solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSU will bring to the existing CAC much needed complementary capabilities in the areas of model-based autonomic computing, and resource management and scheduling in parallel and distributed systems. The proposed site will closely collaborate with the industry to identify generally applicable approaches to IT management, based on scientific principles that guide the selection, modification and integration of these techniques into demonstratively efficient solutions. The properties targeted by autonomic computing include power reduction, performance optimization, increased security, fault tolerance, operational efficiency and usability, and low cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will lead the research to investigate and develop model-based techniques and mechanisms for self-management and self-healing. The planned research has the potential to significantly to reduce the cost of operating large-sale distributed computing systems and improve the reliability and efficiency of the services hosted on these systems. The proposed site will bring a contribution to the existing benefits arising from the ongoing collaboration efforts that pool resources and leverage synergies of all participants in accordance to policies and procedures specified in the CAC membership agreement. For broadening participation, the PIs plan to investigate partnership opportunities with local and national outreach programs including the Increasing Minority Access to Graduate Education program.</AbstractNarration>
