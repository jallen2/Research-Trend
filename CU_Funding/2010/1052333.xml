    <AbstractNarration>During the development of multicellular organisms, individual cells compete with one-another to produce organs of the correct size and shape. Cells less fit than their neighbors are induced by those neighbors to undergo programmed cell death. The mechanisms by which neighboring cells sense and "compare" their relative fitness are still mysterious. Among the genes related to cell competition, the neoplastic tumor-suppressor genes (nTSGs) are particularly interesting. Mutation of these genes results in over-proliferation of larval tissue. In a mosaic situation, the mutant cells are eliminated by cell competition when they are located next to wild-type cells. How the decision between cell death and proliferation is made in these backgrounds remains unclear. Recent study revealed that Mahjong (Mahj), a newly identified binding partner for nTSG Lethal Giant Larvae (Lgl), is also involved in cell competition, and over expression of Mahj prevents lgl mutant cells from undergoing cell death in mosaics, suggesting that Mahj and Lgl belong to the pathway regulating cellular competition. This project will determine how mahj and lgl regulate cell competition, and how these pathways decide between a cell?s life and death. These studies will increase our understanding of the interactions between normal and transformed cells and would provide insights into molecular mechanisms underlying cell competition. This project will involve schools, students and teachers from the local area.</AbstractNarration>
