    <AbstractNarration>Algorithms for large-scale optimization have traditionally exploited&lt;br/&gt;sparsity and structure in problem data. Many important optimization &lt;br/&gt;problems today, such as those that arise in statistical machine &lt;br/&gt;learning (ML) and in compressive sensing (CS) are extremely large-scale convex&lt;br/&gt;problems with completely dense and/or unstructured problem data. &lt;br/&gt;However, there is often sparsity and structure in the solutions to &lt;br/&gt;these problems. The goal of this research project is the development of&lt;br/&gt;first-order algorithms, including gradient methods for non-smooth functions,&lt;br/&gt;smoothed penalty methods for constrained problems, multiple splitting methods,&lt;br/&gt;alternating-direction augmented-Lagrangian methods, and&lt;br/&gt;block coordinate descent methods, for extremely large-scale convex &lt;br/&gt;optimization problems that take advantage of solution structure and/or &lt;br/&gt;sparsity. Rigorous convergence analysis for these methods will be provided and&lt;br/&gt;robust software implementations will be developed. Although these &lt;br/&gt;methods are expected to have wide applicability, the focus will be on &lt;br/&gt;applications in CS and ML. Specifically, the investigators propose to &lt;br/&gt;develop and analyze new scalable algorithms for (i) CS signal &lt;br/&gt;recovery, including algorithms that are able to exploit more detailed &lt;br/&gt;a priori knowledge in addition to sparsity; (ii) matrix rank minimization, the &lt;br/&gt;matrix analog of CS, and its variants; and (iii) a broad array of ML problems that exploit &lt;br/&gt;the special sparsity/structure of the solutions to these &lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research that is proposed under this grant is focused on the development of &lt;br/&gt;algorithms with provable performance guarantees that are capable of &lt;br/&gt;solving extremely large scale optimization problems whose solutions are &lt;br/&gt;either sparse or have special structure. Such problems arise under the paradigm of &lt;br/&gt;compressive sensing, which allows signals (e.g., radar) and images &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., CT and MRI scans) to be obtained with far fewer measurements &lt;br/&gt;than predicted by traditional theory, various extensions of CS, and in &lt;br/&gt;a broad array of problems in machine learning. All of these problems are &lt;br/&gt;aimed at extracting a "sparse" or low-dimensional true model from a &lt;br/&gt;high dimensional or dense empirical model or data. They have important applications &lt;br/&gt;in extracting information from surveillance video and hyper-spectral images, face &lt;br/&gt;recognition, medical imaging and data mining,as well as many other areas &lt;br/&gt;of strategic interest such as national security and biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
