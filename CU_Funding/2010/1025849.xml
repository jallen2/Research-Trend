    <AbstractNarration>Complex nervous systems endow animals with the ability to predict, rather than merely react to, external events. Predictions allow past experience to guide action and are critical for both perception and movement. The goal of this research project is to understand the mechanisms that underlie predictive capacities at the levels of synapses, neurons, and circuits. The research takes advantage of a model system that is uniquely suited to address these issues. Electric fish generate weak electrical fields and, by sensing changes in these fields, are able to navigate and find prey in the dark. However to properly interpret these electrosensory signals, the fish must learn to predict and cancel out components of the input that are a direct result of the fish's own movement. The problem of differentiating self-generated from external sensory signals is a very general one, faced by all animals, including humans. A number of unique advantages have enabled major progress in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms for prediction and cancellation in the brains of electric fish. Interestingly, the neural circuitry for generating predictions in electric fish is highly similar to that of the mammalian cerebellum. Though known to be important for coordinated movement, the exact function of the cerebellum is not understood. Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested that the primate cerebellum may function to predict sensory events, similar to the known function of cerebellum-like circuits in fish. This project will yield novel insights into the functions of cerebellar circuitry and the neural mechanisms for predicting sensory events. Educational outreach will take advantage of the intriguing sensory and motor capacities of electric fish to provide students and teachers with an exciting entry point into biology and physics.</AbstractNarration>
