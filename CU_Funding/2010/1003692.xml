    <AbstractNarration>SES-1003692&lt;br/&gt;Julie Kmec&lt;br/&gt;Lindsey Trimble&lt;br/&gt;Washington State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars have examined the effects of workers' reliance on social network contacts in the job search process in great detail. They have concluded that contacts benefit their network ties by granting them access to their social resources,particularly the information and influence they possess. What, however, leads contacts to assist their network ties in the first place? What determines how far contacts will go in helping their network ties find work? This study explores the factors that affect whether contacts provide assistance to the people they know in finding work. Drawing on social psychological theories of interpersonal relationships and social resource theory, this project poses three questions: (1) What interpersonal factors affect contacts? willingness to assist network ties in finding jobs? (2) Once contacts have decided to assist, what interpersonal factors influence the level of assistance they provide? (3) To what extent do contacts? social resources affect their ability to assist network ties in finding jobs? The levels of assistance they provide? To answer these questions, this project adopts an innovative methodological approach that surveys a random sample of Washington state adults about the most recent time they were asked to provide assistance to someone looking for a job, and the last time they actually assisted someone seeking work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will make a number of contributions to scholars, students, and job-seekers. By exploring the factors that affect contacts? willingness and ability to provide assistance, this research will further scholars? knowledge of work and social networks by building a framework for understanding the determinants of contact assistance. The findings from this research will be disseminated in several venues; results will be presented at professional conferences, in undergraduate courses, and submitted for publication in sociology and social psychology journals. In addition, this project will support an undergraduate research assistant who will gain firsthand survey research experience, and an understanding of the importance of social networks for finding work. Finally, the findings from this research will be submitted for publication in media that will reach a non-academic audience. This is particularly important given the current economic climate; by illustrating the circumstances that affect their contacts? willingness and ability to help them find work, the findings from this project have the potential to help the unemployed find jobs.</AbstractNarration>
