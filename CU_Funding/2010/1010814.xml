    <AbstractNarration>To fully understand the process of reproduction, it is essential to learn more about the many components of seminal fluid. These have been particularly well-studied in insects, where seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) have been demonstrated to be key regulators of the reproductive success of both males and females. This project will identify SFPs in the red flour beetle, Tribiolium castaneum, which is a worldwide, economically important pest of many different stored grains. Using a powerful combination of chemical and genetic techniques, the investigators will determine the specific effect these seminal proteins have on Tribolium reproductive success. One approach will be to use RNA interference (or RNAi), in which Tribolium will be injected with double stranded RNA that matches the genes responsible for producing those proteins. Using this technique, the investigators will be able to effectively halt the translation of the mRNA that contain the instructions to build each seminal protein. By then evaluating the reproductive performance of these knockdown males, the role these proteins play in determining the reproductive success of this species will be revealed. This project has both theoretical and practical applications. By understanding how seminal fluid proteins affect the interplay between males and females for control over the fertilization of a female's eggs, a greater understanding will be gained of the evolutionary forces at work in male and female co-evolution. Additionally, this research may reveal novel approaches to help control the reproductive output of this economically important agricultural pest. This project will likely provide training opportunities for several undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
