    <AbstractNarration>1005753 &lt;br/&gt;Sia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 36th NEBEC will disseminate the state of the art in Bioengineering research at all levels, discuss potential career choices that effectively prepare students for the workforce, and share information across interdisciplinary barriers. Specifically, the conference will include sessions in the following areas: &lt;br/&gt;- Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering &lt;br/&gt;- Biomechanics &lt;br/&gt;- Advanced Biomedical Imaging Technologies &lt;br/&gt;- Technology Translation into Clinic &lt;br/&gt;- Role of Bioengineering in Public Advocacy &lt;br/&gt;U.S. programs in bioengineering will need to train students to be competitive in the global workforce. The perspectives gained from the diverse group of attendees will facilitate the development of creative and effective ways maintain a competitive advantage for the U.S. in bioengineering research globally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;The 36th NEBEC will have broad impact for the Northeast bioengineering community and for engineering education. Typically this conference brings together researchers from over 40 institutions in the Northeast. The knowledge gained and experiences shared from the conference will be captured electronically and broadly disseminated via abstract books, CD ROMS, and via the IEEE website. Benefiting from the exposure to state of the art in bioengineering research and the ability to interact within an intimate setting with leaders in the field of bioengineering, students will be better prepared for both bioengineering research and bioengineering-focused careers. Students already registered in programs will have a chance to see and interact with leaders in the field as they present their work and discuss current obstacles to progress that need to be resolved. One of the main goals of the conference is to help build the confidence of bioengineering students by providing multiple speaking opportunities and to help cultivate an environment to support future leaders in the field. In this regard, numerous speaker slots have been reserved in the program for student presentations. In addition, effective educational improvement will help spawn innovations and create ground breaking bioengineering technologies, and hence benefit the society at large. Also, for the first time, AIMBE has endorsed the NEBEC meeting, and will help increase the broader impact of this impact by exploring the role of bioengineering and broader society.</AbstractNarration>
