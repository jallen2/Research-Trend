    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR), Professor Daniel Talham and coworkers at the University of Florida will explore new coordination polymer heterostructures in order to better understand the chemical and structural characteristics responsible for the enhanced magnetic and photomagnetic properties recently discovered in heterostructured thin films comprised of cyanometallate coordination polymers. The new properties result from interactions at nanometer length scales at the interface between the two solid-state phases. The proposed systems are from the family of Prussian blue analogs, for which a wide range of magnetic phenomena have been observed, including the ability to combine magnetism with photoactivity. As part of these studies, the project aims to improve and quantify the currently used solution- based thin film deposition procedures, and to extend the concept of photomagnetic coordination polymer heterostructures to multicomponent particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New synthesis and fabrication methodologies developed in the study supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) will be generally applicable to other classes of coordination polymer nanostructures and will be useful for high-technology applications ranging from information storage to light harvesting. In addition, training related to solid-state synthesis, nanoscale fabrication, magnetism, and light-induced magnetism will provide graduate and undergraduate student researchers with the skills and knowledge needed to be competitive in materials chemistry related high-technology professions. The proposed project also establishes cooperation between disciplines and among both US and international partners. Students and faculty from the Department of Physical Sciences at Concord University in Athens, West Virginia, a non-Ph.D. granting EPSCoR institution, will carry out coordination polymer synthesis associated with the project. Research tasks involve collaborative projects between chemists and physicists, providing an opportunity for students to learn the importance of interdisciplinary study and the tools necessary to communicate with scientists in different fields.</AbstractNarration>
