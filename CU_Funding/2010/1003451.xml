    <AbstractNarration>This Principal Investigator (PI) will use computational methods to address the problem of imbalanced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the solar wind, particularly near the Sun. The PI's team will develop a new computer code to solve the 'reduced MHD' (RMHD) equations for incompressible turbulence, taking account of the inhomogeneous density and background flow characteristics of the solar wind. These fundamental equations will be solved under a variety of conditions and the solutions will be used to examine plasma density effects and the heating of test-particle ions propagating within the computed electromagnetic fields. The PI's approach is novel because of its inclusion of reflected waves in his turbulence model. His numerical results will be used to test several existing theories of turbulence and to revise these theories as needed to account for wave reflection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on this work, the PI will deliver targeted lectures in plasma physics short courses developed for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and advanced undergraduate students. By providing these young scientists with specialized training and exposure to ongoing research developments, these short courses will promote the integration of research and education. The PI is also a Working Group Leader in the Solar, Heliospheric, and Interplanetary Environment (SHINE) research community, as well as a member of the SHINE Steering Committee. In this capacity, the PI will actively contribute to organizing the annual SHINE Workshop, which provides student participants with special tutorial sessions and opportunities to present their own research. By placing a high priority on student involvement, the SHINE Workshop has been an effective means of integrating research and education.</AbstractNarration>
