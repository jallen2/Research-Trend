    <AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT. Cell polarity is a fundamental biological process by which asymmetry of cell components is generated in response to endogenous programming or external cues. It is crucial for cell morphogenesis, proliferation, and differentiation in all organisms. One key concept to emerge from studies in diverse organisms is that proteins that localize to the cell cortex provide spatial cues that determine the site of growth and the plane of cell division. The fungus Ustilago maydis is ideally suited for the studies proposed here because of its ability to switch from a yeast-like to a filamentous morphology, the highly polarized growth exhibited by one of these forms, its genetic tractability, the availability of molecular and cell biological tools for its manipulation, and availability of its genome sequence. The tea4 gene was identified by the Principal Investigator in a genetic screen to isolate mutants with altered cell morphology. It codes for a protein with similarity to fission yeast Tea4, which has been shown to be necessary for the axis of polarized growth. Tea4 contains domains indicative of a role in protein-protein interactions. Ustilago Tea4 contains additional domains not present in the yeast protein, which suggests that Tea4 may have additional functions in this fungus. Deletion of the tea4 gene in Ustilago results in an altered axis of polarized growth, misplaced plane of cell division, aberrant cell wall deposition, altered cell width, and reduced rate of growth. The focus of this project is to understand how Tea4 controls cell polarity and other processes that contribute to cell shape. What we learn about cell polarity in Ustilago will be generally relevant to other cells, particularly, those that undergo changes in cell morphology and those that exhibit extreme polarization such as pollen tubes, root hairs, axonal neurons, and fungal hyphae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS. This project aims to integrate research with education at California State University-Long Beach, a comprehensive Hispanic serving institution. This university provides an excellent opportunity to recruit students from underrepresented groups and the project is ideally suited to engage undergraduate and graduate students in research. The project will make it possible for the students to learn how to pose hypotheses, design experiments to test them, critically evaluate and interpret experimental results, and learn to troubleshoot and propose alternative approaches. In addition, It will offer them the opportunity to learn basic microbiological, molecular and cell biological techniques, microscopy and image-capture analysis. The results of this research will be disseminated at scientific meetings by the PI and students, and in peer-reviewed publications. This project will also allow the PI to maintain an active research program and to incorporate findings of the research project in inquiry-based learning in lecture and laboratory courses taught by the PI. Data from this research will be provided to the students in the classroom for analysis, interpretation and group discussion so that they become active participants in discovery-based knowledge.</AbstractNarration>
