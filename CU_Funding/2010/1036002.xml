    <AbstractNarration>1005984&lt;br/&gt;Akay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neural engineering is an emerging discipline which coalesces multiple engineering disciplines including electronic and photonic technologies, computer science, physics, chemistry, mathematics with cellular, molecular, cognitive and behavioral neuroscience to understand the organizational principles and underlying mechanisms of the biology of neural systems and to study the behavior dynamics and complexity of neural systems in nature. To highlight this emerging discipline, the 5th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering will be held in Cancun, Mexico from April 27 through May 1, 2011. This project will support the travel of graduate students and postdocs to this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this conference is to highlight progress in Neural and Cognitive Engineering, an emerging field bridging molecular, cellular, systems, cognitive and behavioral neuroscience with engineering, physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science. The neural engineering conference further stimulates neural engineering research and education among neuroscientists, chemists, engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the keynote, plenary, platform and poster sessions at the conference, there will be a panel to focus on the challenges of making a career in the rapidly growing, interdisciplinary fields of neural engineering, from being hired as part of a team and finding exciting new research opportunities, all the way up to becoming a team leader and what to look for when organizing that team and choosing its members. Career options will be discussed for graduate studies and research internationally as well as within the U.S. and for collaboration among researchers and students internationally.</AbstractNarration>
