    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate a novel look-ahead operating paradigm which enables the participation of variable energy resources such as wind and solar power in both energy balancing and frequency regulation. The approach is to (1) formulate a distributed model predictive optimization model which controls the predictable portions of variable generation to provide both electric energy and regulation services; (2) leverage the near-term forecasts and inter-temporal variability of wind and solar generation to do load following and frequency regulation; and (3) introduce the novel concept of regulation service pricing and verification for variable generation resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) This project will lead to the new concept of coordinated model predictive control of distributed variable energy resources in providing both energy and regulation services. &lt;br/&gt;(2) This project will investigate the performance of look-ahead coordinated control for large-scale power systems by leveraging the spatial and temporal structures of power systems. &lt;br/&gt;(3) This project will make contributions to fast look-ahead coordination algorithms needed to advance the computational efficiency and robustness of online model predictive control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of this project will make the societal goals of Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) into affordable and clean realization in the near future. A new course on engineering and economics of sustainable energy systems will be developed. The PI will help start a university-wide student energy organization aiming at raising students? awareness of energy systems innovations. At least one female student will be supported to work on various tasks of this project.</AbstractNarration>
