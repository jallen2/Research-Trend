    <AbstractNarration>There are various instances of problems where correlated sources need to be transmitted from remote sources to a set of terminals, e.g., large scale sensor networks and distributed data storage systems. The field of distributed source coding considers coding strategies that leverage the correlation between the sources in a distributed manner while allowing the information to be communicated at a bitrate as low as possible to the terminals. This research studies practical coding schemes for the general distributed source coding problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vast majority of prior work in this area considers the case of two binary sources, or a higher number of sources with small alphabets and restrictive correlation structures. This research investigates novel constructions of distributed source codes based on Reed Solomon (RS) codes. Consecutive realizations of the nonbinary sources are viewed as coefficients of polynomials over a finite field. Each source encoder transmits evaluations of this polynomial at certain points from the field. Source recovery at the terminal is performed by multivariate polynomial interpolation with carefully chosen root multiplicities, followed by factorization. The multiplicity matrices allow us to capture the joint likelihood of the different source sequences in the decoding process, while ensuring that the decoding is tractable. The scheme is designed for multiple nonbinary sources. Corner points of the rate region for sources with arbitrary correlation are expected to be achieved in this manner. For general rate points, the approach will be extended for a large class of correlation structures that generalizes the set of structures that can be handled by current state of the art techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is integrated into the graduate/undergraduate curriculum and into senior-design at appropriate levels.</AbstractNarration>
