    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Ned Porter of Vanderbilt University for kinetic and thermodynamic studies of free radical oxidation reactions of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The goals of this work are to understand the role of tyrosyl radicals in mediating these oxidative processes, to confirm or refute the involvement in this chemistry of a previously proposed radical-oxygen bound complex, and to investigate the interaction of radical oxidation products with proteins. These oxidation reactions play a role in the development of many neurological diseases and other human ailments associated with oxidative stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include its biological significance and connection to cellular function. Studies of antioxidants involve the determination of absolute rate constants for reactions of peroxyl radicals to the examination vitamin E and C, nature's antioxidants. Professor Porter's work also provides insight into the probable role of peroxidation in the progression of host diseases. Professor Porter is the associate director of an interdisciplinary center of chemical biology at Vanderbilt who has a strong track record of training female and minority scientists. His research group is active in undergraduate research through an REU program, and has been recognized for public outreach activities through the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science organization.</AbstractNarration>
