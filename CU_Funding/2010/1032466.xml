    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The research objective of this BRIGE award is to assemble nanostructured materials and devices with superior electrical transport properties. Such materials will enable the creation of solar cells that are both highly efficient and affordable, a combination which has been elusive to date. The crucial improvement in electrical transport will be attained by using biomolecules to assemble type-II semiconductor heterojunctions. The unparalleled assembly abilities of biomolecules produce nano-architectures not possible with other techniques, but which are essential for enhanced electrical transport in these materials. Type-II junctions have spatially distinct local energy minima for electrons and holes, thus causing rapid separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The blend of bio-based assembly and type-II heterojunctions will significantly improve electrical transport within nanostructured materials and devices, transforming the field of photovoltaics and tackling the energy challenges of the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Biomolecule-assisted assembly of semiconductor heterojunctions will address the challenge of poor carrier transport in nanostructured materials and advance understanding of separation and collection of carriers within these materials. Enhanced electrical transport in bio-assembled nanostructured materials will make low-cost, efficient solar cells a reality and aid in development of general design rules for controlled assembly of nanomaterials. Furthermore, the BRIGE Award will provide support for a number of mentoring and outreach activities designed to increase diversity and broaden participation in engineering through coursework, research experience, and professional development opportunities. The PI will develop and teach a service-learning class in which undergraduates address real-world problems while serving the needs of the local community. The interdisciplinary course will nurture mentor-protégé relationships and generate enthusiasm for solar engineering projects while building working relationships between future engineers and teachers. Furthermore, the PI will expand her efforts to support and mentor undergraduate researchers.</AbstractNarration>
