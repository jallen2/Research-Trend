    <AbstractNarration>Hybrid systems, which combine discrete and continuous dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;provide sophisticated mathematical models for automated highway&lt;br/&gt;systems, air traffic control, biological systems, and other&lt;br/&gt;applications. A key feature of such systems is that they are&lt;br/&gt;often deployed in safety-critical scenarios and hence designing&lt;br/&gt;such systems with provable guarantees is very&lt;br/&gt;important. This is usually done through analysis of such&lt;br/&gt;systems with regard to a given set of safety properties that&lt;br/&gt;assert that nothing 'bad' happens during the operation of the&lt;br/&gt;system. As more complex hybrid systems are considered, limiting&lt;br/&gt;safety properties to a set of unsafe states, as in current methods,&lt;br/&gt;considerably restricts the ability of designers to adequately&lt;br/&gt;express the desired safe behavior of the system. To allow&lt;br/&gt;for more sophisticated properties, researchers have advocated&lt;br/&gt;the use of linear temporal logic (LTL), which makes it possible&lt;br/&gt;to express temporal safety properties. This proposal develops&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic tools for safety analysis of embedded&lt;br/&gt;and hybrid systems operating under the effect of exogenous inputs&lt;br/&gt;and for LTL specifications. The problem addressed&lt;br/&gt;is the following: Given a hybrid system and a safety specification&lt;br/&gt;described using LTL, can a feasible trajectory be constructed&lt;br/&gt;for the system that violates the specification, when such a&lt;br/&gt;trajectory exists? The problem is called the falsification problem.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project is implemented through&lt;br/&gt;course development, involvement in research activities of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students, efforts to&lt;br/&gt;mentor underrepresented groups, and dissemination of concepts&lt;br/&gt;through educational software developed at Rice.</AbstractNarration>
