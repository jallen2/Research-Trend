    <AbstractNarration>Weatherization can be an effective way to improve a home's energy efficiency and save homeowners money while reducing their carbon footprint. Weatherization usually involves adding or replacing insulation, installing more efficient windows, and sealing off unplanned airflow. Such measures often result in less outdoor air coming inside. Many consumer products and building materials found indoors, however, emit chemicals that can pollute the indoor air. In fact, indoor air pollution can be several times higher than outdoor air pollution; and poorly-planned weatherization that reduces ventilation can cause indoor air pollution to concentrate even more. The current research project seeks to find the best way to communicate the health risks of weatherization. The research involves the analysis of data gathered from a national survey designed to identify relationships between how people respond to risk messages and their future information seeking needs and behaviors. Other variables related to information seeking, such as attitude toward the behavior, social norms, self efficacy, self identity, perceived knowledge and past behavior, are also examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings of this study will benefit efforts to communicate the health risks of weatherization by demonstrating the relevant influence of many potential factors. If public education efforts improve as a result, then homeowners will be able to make more informed decisions about what kinds of energy improvements they wish to make on their homes.</AbstractNarration>
