    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This collaborative research project is to study the nucleation and growth of small-molecule crystalline semiconductors, to discern ways to precisely control crystal grain size, surface coverage, and donor/acceptor interfaces, with the ultimate goal to realize low-cost, highly efficient solar cells. High-purity, small-molecule organic materials promise significant advantages in photovoltaic performance. By using soluble small-molecule semiconductors, the creation of appropriate thin-film morphologies is expected to provide superior charge transport properties, potentially achieving high performance of photovoltaic devices. The project requires collaboration of mathematicians for modeling nucleation, crystal growth and phase separation of the blended semiconductors; chemists for the design, synthesis and tuning of appropriate donor and acceptor semiconductors; materials researchers for the analysis of films; and engineers for construction and evaluation of solar cells. The team will work synergistically to understand the mechanisms of grain growth, tailor donor and acceptor to maximize voltage and current, and improve surface treatments and deposition methods to allow the formation of large-area materials and devices.&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: An understanding of nucleation and growth of soluble small-molecule semiconductors is expected to have significant impact in an array of endeavors across the spectrum of electronics, including solar cells, solid-state lighting, flexible displays and radio-frequency identification tags. To maximize the training impact of this research project, the participating research groups at Kentucky and Princeton exchange researchers to enhance the cross-disciplinary training of participating students. This exchange introduces engineering researchers to organic synthesis, and allows mathematics graduate students to learn film growth and device fabrication techniques. The PIs plan to run an annual summer camp, to immerse all participants in a joint review of the project. The scientists will also continue outreach to local Schools and mentor high school students in research projects.&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Divisions of Materials Research, Chemistry, and Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
