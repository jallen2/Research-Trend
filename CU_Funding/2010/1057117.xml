    <AbstractNarration>Geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) is considered one of the most effective and promising mitigation strategies for increasing anthropogenic CO2. The proposed research will provide the underpinnings for understanding long-term sustainability of geologic CO2 sequestration strategies with a focus on nanoscale interfacial geochemical processes. Nanoscale reactions at fluid-mineral interfaces strongly influence the mechanisms and kinetics of important environmental processes, and these reactions can also be crucial in understanding processes in GCS systems. The proposed research plan will provide the basis for resolving discrepancies in reaction kinetics among data of different scales (from nanoscale to macroscale), and among laboratory and field site data in geologic CO2 injection systems. The proposed research will focus on acquiring new and more accurate information on reaction pathways and rates, including identification of critical nanoscale-mesoscale processes not previously detected, using a range of methods matched to the scale of reaction space in porous media: complementary aquatic geochemistry; the unique and powerful tools of in situ time-resolved synchrotron-based x-ray techniques and in situ flow-through atomic force microscopy. Although currently some data are available, the different scales of data for geologic CO2 injection systems have not been linked. Understandably, this creates confusion for policy makers, engineers, and local populations developing, working on, or living near CO2 sequestration sites. In establishing linkages between different scales, investigator will perform reactive transport modeling which will combine experimental and computationally-simulated data from multiple scales. Furthermore, by identifying geochemical reactions that facilitate self-fracture filling in CO2 storage, the proposed work will help us design new, secure, and sustainable CO2 sequestration. The findings will also improve academic and public understanding of climate change and geologic CO2 sequestration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating recruiting, training, and outreach programs, the research and education plans will reach a diverse audience and broaden the participation of underrepresented minority groups in environmental science and engineering. The project expands the infrastructure for research and education by developing, in collaboration with K-12 teachers, research-based educational kits for a ?lending library? and related teaching modules devoted to energy and environmental issues for local K-12 schools. It encourages direct involvement of high school and undergraduate students. The project will enhance graduate education by including international collaborative research activities through the McDonnell Academy Global Energy and Environment Partnership (MAGEEP) at Washington University. Finally, it will conduct outreach activities to increase public awareness of the energy-environment nexus and greenhouse mitigation strategies, including public lectures and hands-on demonstrations in collaboration with Washington University?s Tyson Living Learning Center.</AbstractNarration>
