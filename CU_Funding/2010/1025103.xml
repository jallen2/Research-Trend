    <AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Research in Economics:&lt;br/&gt;Risk Sharing Over the Rwandan Mobile Phone Network&lt;br/&gt;Objectives and Methods&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research investigates the economic impacts of mobile phone use in Rwanda, focusing particularly on the use of Me2U, a new system that enables interpersonal transfers of money over the Rwandan mobile phone network. Taking advantage of a unique dataset obtained from the country's primary mobile phone operator, the researchers will develop an understanding of what causes these transfers, and whether these transfers have an effect on the economic lives of the Rwandan populace. The research questions of primary interest are:&lt;br/&gt;1) How does the structure of a person's social network affect his ability to use and benefit from mobile-phone based financial services?&lt;br/&gt;2) Are phone-based transfers used as a mechanism for informal insurance and risk sharing?&lt;br/&gt;3) How do these new services affect and interact with traditional institutions for credit and insurance?&lt;br/&gt;Empirically, the analysis will combine three datasets: (i) a log of all interpersonal monetary transfers that occurred in Rwanda during the period 2005-2009; (ii) demographic and socioeconomic information collected in phone surveys by the researchers in 2009 and 2010; (iii) third party data on agricultural prices, weather, and household demographics. By matching data on phone usage to corresponding spatio-temporal economic data, the research will shed light on the correlates, causes, economic consequences of mobile-based financial services in Rwanda.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research makes two primary intellectual contributions. First, it elucidates the economic impacts of mobile phones in the developing world. The relevant economics literature has largely focused on the role of phones in reducing information asymmetries in agricultural markets; the proposed research thus adds a new perspective on the direct impacts of mobile phones and mobile-based financial services. Second, it develops new methodological techniques for the analysis of mobile phone data in Economics research. Datasets of this nature are becoming increasingly available, and can help answer many questions of economic interest. However, economists interested in development rarely use such data, and the sheer size of the datasets precludes the use of standard statistical packages. By combining quantitative methods from Economics and Computer Science, the researchers will develop analytic techniques that can make this type of data more useful in future economic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Operationally, the proposed field study will involve ten university students from the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology in Rwanda. These students, who have very limited exposure to scientific research, will be trained as surveyors and will learn the fundamentals of quantitative research. More broadly, given the rapid growth of mobile phone networks in the developing world, it is important to build a better understanding of the economic impacts of mobile phones and mobile-based financial services. Phones are commonly touted as a transformative force in international development, but little is known about whether and how phones actually improve economic outcomes and promote human wellbeing. This research investigates three different mechanisms by which mobile phones can improve the lives of those with access to the technology, and helps inform the larger debate about the role of information and communications technologies in global economic development.</AbstractNarration>
