    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Anne Baranger and Alex Scheeline at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The research projects supported in this site are in broad areas of chemistry. Undergraduates will be recruited to this site primarily from institutions that lack infrastructure to support undergraduate research, including students from Kennedy King College in Chicago. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. A sample of the projects that undergraduates will work on include: (1) the study of nonlinear dynamics in enzyme-catalyzed oscillatory reactions with Prof. Alex Scheeline; (2) the label-free detection of biomolecules using arrays of silicon photonic microring resonators with Prof. Ryan Bailey; (3) the study of the use of inorganic compounds as starting materials to make solids with interesting properties, with Prof. Gregory Girolami; (4) the study of protein and RNA folding with Prof. Martin Gruebele; (5) the study of the structure, function and folding of RNA:protein complexes using computational chemistry techniques with Prof. Zan Luthey-Schulten; and (6) the study of the synthesis, characterization and applications of metallic nanoparticles with Prof. Catherine Murphy. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including ethics training. Participants in the REU site will also work with participants in other programs on campus, including the GAANN program, the Women's Chemistry Committee (through participation in a poster session) and the intramural Summer Research Opportunity Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide research training using state-of-the-art facilities in a broad range of topics in the chemical sciences. Undergraduate researchers participating in this site will have significant, hands-on access to sophisticated research tools, and will be working with some of the leaders in a number of areas of chemistry. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
