    <AbstractNarration>The Resource Center for System Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA) expands the work of the regional center by providing programs and services to increase the preparedness of the national cyber security workforce. A survey - conducted with business, industry, government and educational institutions - identifies current and future national workforce needs, and informs curricular and professional development. The Resource Center serves as a focal point for program improvement of cyber security and information assurance curricula, instructional programs, degrees and certificates as well as for institutions interested in hosting or participating in cyber security skills competitions. A national cyber security and information assurance academy for faculty is established. The Center has established partnerships with other ATE cyber security centers and national organizations such as the Cisco Learning Institute, Skills USA, FEMA, and the Competition Industry Advisory Board to provide cyber security challenge competitions for secondary and two year college students. The partnership between CSSIA and NDG develops a standardized software that will include scheduling, authentication, replication, virtualization, curriculum integration, teaching and learning collaboration, archiving and distributable updates to work on top of VMRware to support both competitions and curricula. The independent evaluation provides information about the activities performed to reach the goals and outcomes and also the impact of the activities on the participants.</AbstractNarration>
