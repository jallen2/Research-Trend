    <AbstractNarration>This project is motivated by the following challenges that arise due to the growth of services and applications that rely on radio technologies: (i) As spatial density of spectrum usage increases more wireless systems need to coexist on common spectrum bands, (ii) The energy footprint of wireless information technologies grows at a remarkable pace that is exacerbated by the increasing density, and (iii) An increasing fraction of applications require tight delay guarantees that are incompatible with classical random access techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the program is to develop a scalable framework for providing delay guarantees in dense spectrum usage scenarios, while eliminating energy consumption in medium access arbitration. Towards this goal the project studies fundamental properties and implementations of periodic medium access schemes under which conflicting transmissions are separated in time. Inherent properties of periodic spatial systems are studied from both descriptive and prescriptive viewpoints. The scope of the program includes development of decentralized algorithms that are provably robust to propagation delays, hidden nodes, and clock drifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An energy-efficient framework for wireless access will have favorable impact on the footprint of information technologies due to both operational energy consumption and battery manufacturing. Successfully completed program will also facilitate dense usage of spectrum with predictable service quality, and thereby will lead to better utilization of an important public resource. The project has educational components at the graduate and undergraduate levels, and potential impact in upcoming networking standards.</AbstractNarration>
