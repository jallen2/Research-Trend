    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: This RAPID award provides funding that will allow the University of Southern Mississippi (USM), Mississippi State University (MSU), and Mississippi Public Broadcasting (MPB) to provide scientific information to the public in response to the BP Oil Spill via the following productions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Three One-hour Television Programs&lt;br/&gt;These moderated, roundtable discussions among scientists, journalists and educators will be a regular (short-term), timely, high-profile venue for linking the public to what science can tell us regarding the oil spill. They will be broadcast on MPB (television with radio simulcast) at one month intervals. Each program will be developed to address timely, oil spill-related topics. Each topic will be introduced by a short video package (objective two) and discussed by panelists using broad questions to focus their comments. Dr. Bob Thomas, from the Center for Environmental Communications, Loyola University New Orleans, has agreed to moderate each of these discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Thematic News-style Video Packages&lt;br/&gt;Videos will provide scripted content lasting three to five minutes on timely topics that require careful explanation (e.g., oil genesis and production in the Gulf, dispersant use, potential berm placement on Louisiana beaches). The videos will lead and focus roundtable discussion in broadcast programs. Likewise, videos will be archived on the companion Web page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Companion Web Portal&lt;br/&gt;An interactive Web page/portal will provide an online address for the broadcast audience and others. Although work to develop and populate it will begin immediately upon receipt of funding, the investigators regard this as the focus of long-term oil spill education efforts to be continued after the well is capped and news providers go home. The content developer/moderator will work regularly to update the site and respond to user feedback regarding the content, which will include: 1) an invitation to ask the questions addressed during broadcast programs; 2) video packages and unaired footage from broadcasts; 3) frequently-asked-questions with answers; 4) an annotated selection of excellent, accurate resources related to the oil spill; 5) interviews (threeseven minutes long) of experts regarding specific issues; 6) a weekly blog written by scientists. Investigators will collaborate closely on all components to ensure the unique benefits each type of media provides will work together as a coherent resource representing the science of the oil spill.</AbstractNarration>
