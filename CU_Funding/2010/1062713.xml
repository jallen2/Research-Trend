    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Chicago that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 8 students, during the summers of 2011-2013. The program focuses on cellular and molecular biology, that is, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the organization, development and mechanics of all living organisms. The Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, which is hosting the program, has about 20 faculty members participating as mentors. The projects available in their laboratories are wide-ranging but all are focused on cutting edge research, using a variety of model organisms including viruses, bacteria, yeast, protozoa, fruitflies, plants, and nematode worms, and involving both biological manipulation and observation, and mathematical modeling. Students will engage in full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and focused workshops on responsible conduct in research, on how to prepare for advanced training in biological sciences, and on professional communication skills including an intensive series of workshops on scientific writing. REU students have access to the individual mentor's facilities as well as many core facilities such as advanced light microscopy, electron microscopy and tomography, next-generation DNA sequencing, and flow cytometry. Students will be recruited to the program, particularly from disadvantaged groups, by extensive nationwide advertising, including through established informal collaborative agreements with a variety of undergraduate colleges. Students are selected based on academic record and potential for outstanding research. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool.
