    <AbstractNarration>1065935&lt;br/&gt;Michael Solem &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CGGE-India Workshop: Expanding U.S.-South Asia collaborations in Geography Education &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to The Association of American Geographers'(AAG)Center for Global Geography Education (CGGE) supports a U.S.-India workshop organized by Drs. Michael N. Solem, CGGE, Washington, D.C. and Dr. Chandra Balachandran, The Indian Institute of Geographical Studies (TIIGS), Bangalore, India. The CGGE-India Workshop will take place in Bangalore, March 2012. It is designed to activate collaborative research and education networks among geographers in the United States and South Asia. Participants will learn the basic tenets of collaborative learning theory, work together to develop CGGE geographical case studies for the U.S. and India, and plan collaborative research projects. There will be a large number of participants from both countries, including undergraduate and graduate students, early career faculty and senior academics in leadership positions from both the U.S. and South Asia, thereby introducing a whole new generation of students and researchers to topics in international collaborative geography education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop adds a South Asia component to an ongoing NSF award to the CGGE that uses Internet technology to address the need for American students to obtain international perspectives and high levels of competency in geography in order to understand and appreciate a diverse and interdependent world. Many geographers are convinced that the Internet can help build an integrated international community of scholars dedicated to collaborative research, teaching and multinational learning. The workshop is pivotal in developing virtual collaborations in pedagogy and education research that will be forged between the researchers and educators from the U.S. and South Asia. It will also provide a strong foundation for innovative professional development and learning for geography students and college professors by helping them collaborate across many scales-from the local to the international.</AbstractNarration>
