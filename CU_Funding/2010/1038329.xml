    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide travel funds to allow several graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty working in U.S. institutions to attend an international conference on plant growth and development in Tarragona, Spain from June 28-July 2, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Plant growth substances (also referred to as plant hormones) regulate almost all aspects of growth and development, beginning with seed germination through the growth of the parent plant to the development of the flower and the formation of seeds. The scientific program includes 80 invited speakers from 20 countries, each a leader in his or her respective field, together with additional investigators who were selected as speakers after the submission of Scientific Abstracts. Over 500 poster presentations will be made. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.&lt;br/&gt; This important conference will be an opportunity for young investigators working in the area of plant hormones to be exposed to the latest, ground-breaking research in the field. This is the only international meeting of its kind, devoted entirely to plant hormones, and it will stimulate research on plant growth substances in the U. S. These molecules have long been established as important for U.S. agriculture, and our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of their action is essential for the long-term sustainability of agriculture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.&lt;br/&gt; This award will provide an opportunity for young scientists to establish meaningful relationships with their counterparts from elsewhere in the world. These interactions could include the setting up of collaborative research program that will have a lasting impact on the careers of these junior scientists. Applications from individuals from minority-serving institutions and those with disadvantaged status are especially encouraged. A committee of three IPGSA Council members will be responsible for evaluating applicants.</AbstractNarration>
