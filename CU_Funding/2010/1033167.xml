    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID response is focused on post-seismic surface-deformation, coastal tsunami hazards and probable stress adjustment leading to the forecast occurrence of a second Mw¡Ý7.0 earthquake in the Port au Prince region of Haiti in the next decade or so. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his group will monitor post seismic deformation of the Leogane area of Haiti where a 2-4 m slip deficit currently exists in the near surface following the 12 January Mw=7 quake using two tide gauges with 1 mm precision and remote telemetry for this work. They will measure the tidal harmonics and seiche amplitudes of the Bay of Logane for use in coral uplift and subsidence modeling currently being undertaken by USGS. They will also install a supplemental tsunami gauge to monitor drawdown and surge should a large aftershock or an anticipated future mainshock, occur and install a GPS unit near the region of maximum uplift to monitor vertical and horizontal components of the deformation field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will be communicated by web pages and articles to the public as they become known. The availability of telemetered data is a considerable bonus and the following web page will be enlarged http://cires.colorado.edu/~bilham/Haiti/index.html to make this data available. The PI is also translating a public outreach poster into Creole and placed in a Caribbean context.</AbstractNarration>
