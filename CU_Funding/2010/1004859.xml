    <AbstractNarration>This three-year REU Site program is a collaborative effort between Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and the University of North Texas (UNT). The theme of the proposed site is energy and combustion research. Specific topics include alternative fuels combustion, solar cells, propellants and energetic materials, biodiesel fuels, and laser diagnostic development, among others. A unique aspect of this program is that students will be encouraged to participate in the program again in the following summer. This REU Site program will also allow 4 undergraduate students each year to participate in year-round, part-time research experiences 2 at TAMU and 2 at UNT. In addition to the research activities students will be involved in educational seminars, and social activities to foster the cohort experience. During week 4 of the 10- week summer program, the undergraduate students will be required to make a 10-minute presentation about their research project and its goals to the group. At the end of the program, the students will make a final presentation to the group about the results of their projects and will prepare posters. The participants will present their posters during the last week of the program along with other REU participants from the various summer programs sponsored by NSF, TAMU, and the College of Engineering (COE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will place special emphasis on the recruitment of students at lower-tier research universities, women minorities, and other ethnic minorities from universities in Texas that are not major research institutions. Texas has over two dozen universities with engineering and science programs, and many of them are located in areas that are ethnically diverse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The efficient and environmentally friendly usage of our dwindling fossil fuels and the development of alternative sources require further research in energy and combustion science. Research in these general areas is therefore important on both local and global scales. Because of the resulting visibility and urgency of the topic, energy production can serve as a stimulus for young engineers to select careers in scientific research in an energy-related field because of its broader impact for all mankind. For these reasons, coupled with the exciting and challenging nature of the many different research projects that are possible, energy and combustion research can be used as a catalyst to encourage more engineering students to consider graduate school and ultimately a career in scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
