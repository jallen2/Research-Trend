    <AbstractNarration>This project explores the implications of embodied cognition for learning and teaching at the college level. College classes and college classrooms are generally designed for the purely "abstract" thinker: a thinker who does not benefit from tangible, multi-sensory approaches to learning that are part of early childhood education but considered unnecessary and inefficient for adult learners. The term "educational technology" generally refers to desktop or laptop computers with standard GUI interfaces, and to data projectors, networks, and other familiar "smart classroom" technology. But a variety of developments in computing, computing education, and education research point the way to making "smart students" more effectively by reframing educational technology. Tangible User Interfaces offer the opportunity to combine computational power with the cognitive power of manipulatives; CS1 education with manipulatives has been promoted by some faculty; and research on learning in higher education shows that multi-sensory learning is far more effective than lecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project stems from its grounding in theory and evidence, and from the importance of its challenge to prevailing wisdom. In addition to drawing on the academic literature, the project analyzes field data from students and professionals, and conducts a laboratory study of a key proposition. The broader impacts of this work can appear in a rethinking of higher education, educational technology, and adult learning environments, making them more engaging and effective.</AbstractNarration>
