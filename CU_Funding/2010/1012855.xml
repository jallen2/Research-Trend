    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurements and Imaging Program, Prof. James Reilly and his group at Indiana University are seeking ways to improve the structural analysis of peptides using mass spectrometry. In the Reilly approach, peptide ions are photofragmented by high energy ultraviolet light instead of the conventional collisional fragmentation. Resulting data have been found to be somewhat instrument-dependent. Dr. Reilly seeks improved understanding of the photofragmentation process and its variability in order to provide a more effective protein identification approach. He is also assembling a database that catalogs and summarizes photofragmentation data, and working to develop an improved de novo sequencing algorithm. The work entails collaboration with a group interested in the theory of peptide photofragmentation. &lt;br/&gt;Because of the importance of peptides and proteins in bioprocesses, the fields of biochemistry, proteomics, and cell biology will all benefit from improvements in peptide identification and sequencing technology, particularly with respect to the ability to identify mutations, post-translational and sample handling modifications, and genome sequencing errors. Advances in proteomic technologies can impact understanding of the molecular basis of disease, which in turn should translate to improved clinical intervention. In the course of these studies, students and postdoctoral researchers are receiving invaluable training in multidisciplinary research that involves physical, analytical and biochemistry along with instrumentation and data interpretation algorithm development.</AbstractNarration>
