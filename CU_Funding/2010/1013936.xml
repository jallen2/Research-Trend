    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to enable computer generation of high performance software for image processing problems. For computing intensive functions, the by far most common approach is hand-optimization for every new platform. SpiralGen's technology has the potential to demonstrate that it is possible to automatically produce performance-competitive code (code that is a good as human-written code and takes optimal advantage of multiple cores) for an important class of image processing functions. The approach is based on a blend of mathematics, programming languages, symbolic computation, compilers, and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Image processing (including its close cousin video processing) is one of the most demanding computing domains due to its higher-dimensional nature. Key application domains that can benefit from the proposed technology include military applications (surveillance, target recognition), consumer multimedia processing, medical imaging (computer tomography), oil exploration, and computer vision. The company's technology has the ability to provide a longterm solution to the porting and optimization problem: applications are ported by regenerating performance critical components optimized for the new platform. As a result, new more capable platforms can be deployed faster.</AbstractNarration>
