    <AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the collaborative RAPID research project of Prof. Thomas Bianchi of Texas A &amp; M University, Prof. Robert Cook of Louisiana State University and Prof. Michael Perdue of Georgia Institute of Technology. The collaborative team will investigate the impact of oil contamination from the Deep Horizon Disaster in the Gulf of Mexico on the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Louisiana coastal marshes. The study aims to prove that changes in the component signature of DOM collected from the Louisiana coastal marshes will be indicative of the impact of the Deep Horizon oil spill on geochemical processes in the Louisiana marshes. The team of investigators will utilize boats from the Louisiana Marine Universities Consortium (LUMCON), located in Terrebonne, LA to collect water samples from marshes along Terrebonne Bay. The samples will be filtered to collect the DOM from the water samples. Advanced analytical methods will be used to analyze the DOM content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is crucial to elucidate the impact of the Deep Horizon oil spill on the ecosystems along the Louisiana coast. Better understanding of this impact is imperative to development of strategies to restore the marshes to their condition prior to the Deep Horizon oil spill disaster.</AbstractNarration>
