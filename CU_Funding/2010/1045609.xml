    <AbstractNarration>The Mw=8.8 Maule earthquake off the coast of Chile on&lt;br/&gt;February 27, 2010 is the 5th largest megathrust earthquake ever to be recorded and the 2nd&lt;br/&gt;largest to be recorded by modern digital seismic networks. Immediately following the&lt;br/&gt;Maule earthquake, teams of seismologists from Germany, France, the UK, and the US,&lt;br/&gt;working with seismologists in Chile, coordinated resources to deploy both broadband and&lt;br/&gt;short period seismometers and accelerometers above the rupture zone to capture&lt;br/&gt;aftershocks associated with this significant earthquake. Data recorded from these stations&lt;br/&gt;will be combined to produce an open international community data volume providing an&lt;br/&gt;unprecedented opportunity to investigate processes associated with great earthquakes and&lt;br/&gt;to image the anatomy of a subduction zone. A defining characteristic of the Maule aftershock investigations&lt;br/&gt;has been collaboration, at both national and international levels. The original involvement&lt;br/&gt;in the data collection by US teams grew voluntarily out of the IRIS community, and the&lt;br/&gt;rationale of greater efficiencies through cooperation was readily adapted by the five&lt;br/&gt;international groups working in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the researchers will carry out a broad but&lt;br/&gt;interrelated spectrum of seismic analyses to the Maule international seismic data set,&lt;br/&gt;along with a reanalysis of a selection of data collected in the rupture zone prior to the&lt;br/&gt;earthquake, to address some of the fundamental scientific objectives that motivated the&lt;br/&gt;initial data collection. These objectives fall into two general categories: (1) rupture&lt;br/&gt;processes of megathrusts, and (2) active tectonics and dynamics of an oceanic-continental&lt;br/&gt;(Andean) margin. They intend to produce an internally consistent set of data products across a range of&lt;br/&gt;analytical techniques. The PIs will share graduate students and scheduling extended visits to each others labs, thereby exposing students to a significantly broader range of experience than most students typically enjoy. Finally, they plan to engage our international colleagues by sharing some analysis tasks of mutual&lt;br/&gt;interest. Data products generated by this study will be made available to the broader&lt;br/&gt;international community via a dedicated web site.</AbstractNarration>
