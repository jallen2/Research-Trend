    <AbstractNarration>The fundamental mechanisms underlying the aging process are poorly understood. This project will employ a unique vertebrate model animal to conduct molecular, physiological, and genetic experiments to determine the role of insulin/Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling in aging. The hypothesis to be tested is that IGF signaling exerts pro-aging and/or anti-aging effects depending on the stage of life, tissue, and presence of different IGF binding proteins. The information gained from these studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which the IGF pathway regulates aging. While this work pertains specifically to fish, it will have broad relevance in understanding the nature and evolution of aging regulation in general. A better understanding of the nature and evolution of aging regulation will likely lead to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools that will increase the healthy lifespan of the aging population in the United States. The project will also yield new information about growth, nutrition, and aging interactions and may have applications in aquaculture for efficient production of animal protein. This project will integrate research with education by directly incorporating the knowledge gained from these studies into undergraduate courses. The PI teaches Animal Physiology and Molecular Endocrinology. The proposed studies are directly relevant to the topics covered in these two undergraduate courses. This project will provide valuable research and training opportunities for young scientists and students. The graduate and undergraduate students supported by this grant will participate in every aspect of the cutting-edge research. Results will be broadly disseminated. These studies will benefit society as a whole through interactions with the public by various outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
