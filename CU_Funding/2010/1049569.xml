    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry and the GOALI program of the Engineering Directorate and will support the research program of Prof. Edward Rosenberg of the University of Montana. Prof. Rosenberg and his students, in collaboration with a local company, Purity systems Inc. has developed a novel class of amorphous silica-polymer composite materials that are being commercially produced and are being used in the mining and remediation industries. In this project, Prof. Rosenberg and his students will synthesize luminescent silica polyamine composite nanoparticles and use them as luminescent probes for metal cations. The luminescence response of these particles is based on resonance energy transfer (RET) between the luminescent silicon core of the silica polyamine composite nanoparticles and surface bound ruthenium complexes. The luminescent particles will be incorporated incorporate into water filtration membranes and used to monitor metal binding to these membranes when placed in contaminated water samples. Silica polyamine composite nanoparticles will also be used novel catalysts in heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new class of luminescent nanomaterials will be used widely in critical environmental applications like drinking water purification and waste water treatment. Commercialization of this technology will have a significant impact on the mining and metal processing industry. The research program will provide excellent training opportunities to students in the area of composite materials who seek research and development careers in industry. Prof. Rosenberg will involve undergraduate and graduate students, including Native American students in the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>
