    <AbstractNarration>George Shields of Armstrong Atlantic State University is supported by an RUI award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry to determine the minimum energy structures and the thermodynamics for formation of small aerosols that will serve as neutral and ionic cloud condensation nuclei. His methods allow him to determine the relevant abundance of all the potentially relevant complexes, thus allowing his research group, consisting mainly of undergraduates, to assess which ones are of atmospheric importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is having a broad impact through its model of a deep, sustained and productive undergraduate research experience involving the same students, including minorities and women, throughout their undergraduate years.</AbstractNarration>
