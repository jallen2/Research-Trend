    <AbstractNarration>This project establishes a Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at Pace University (Pace) over a four-year period. The program provides full scholarships for two years to undergraduate students interested in studying information assurance. Scholarship recipients are required to enter the federal workforce upon graduation. To increase diversity, the program is recruiting potential scholarship candidates from students currently enrolled at Pace as well as from Pace's academic partners, particularly those attending minority institutions. This SFS program educates students to become information assurance professionals with interdisciplinary backgrounds as they are required to take courses in both information assurance and in a second discipline such as accounting or criminal justice. The graduates are therefore able to conduct tasks in areas such as computer security risk analysis, information technology auditing, cyber crime investigation and computer forensics. The program also supports educational activities to promote awareness among the general student body of the information assurance discipline and related careers in the federal government. These activities include paper competitions, research seminars, and industry outreach and collaboration. The overall impact of this program is to extend information assurance education to students with broader backgrounds and to produce a corps of information assurance professionals for the federal workforce.</AbstractNarration>
