    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit This travel grant supports approximately fifteen graduate students from United States institutions to attend the premier network protocol conference, the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP) 2010 which will be held in Kyoto Japan from October 5 through October 8, 2010. The objective of the award is to widen the audience attending ICNP and, as a result, raise the level of interactions among attendees, and increase the potential for new collaboration, new investigations, and higher quality research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Conference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for graduate students to attend this high-quality conference, this project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from seeing research presented that may be related to what they are working on, or may inspire them to try a new direction. The research community benefits from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and the introduction of new researcher perspectives. All attendees benefit from increased diversity of participants attending the conference, through discussions and other interactions.</AbstractNarration>
