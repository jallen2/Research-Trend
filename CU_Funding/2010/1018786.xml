    <AbstractNarration>Public safety first responders have a need for increased access to radio spectrum to improve interoperability between agencies in natural and human-caused emergencies, and to accommodate bandwidth intensive applications such as mission critical video surveillance. Dynamic Spectrum Access, a new paradigm that promises improved RF spectrum access and efficiency, has been hindered in its application to mission critical networks by a lack of the detailed understanding of the spectrum utilization characteristics necessary to drive system development. This project is generating the fundamental long-term and high-resolution spectrum measurements needed to characterize the time, frequency, energy, and spatial dynamics of mission critical wireless networks in a dense urban environment (Chicago). Empirical and analytical models that characterize public safety spectrum utilization are being created from these measurements. The empirical and analytical models are being used in turn as inputs to discrete-event simulations of candidate mission critical Dynamic Spectrum Access approaches in order to assess the ability of these approaches to improve capacity, while maintaining the necessary performance as measured by access delay and interference tolerance. Results in the form of the RF measurements, empirical and analytical models of mission critical spectral utilization, and system models are being disseminated via a secure download server linked to the Illinois Institute of Technology website. This research will impact Public Safety stakeholders including government agencies, public safety standards bodies, the Federal Communications Commission, and equipment providers by assessing the feasibility of applying to mission critical public safety wireless networks and facilitating system development.</AbstractNarration>
