    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award to the Mote Marine Laboratory funds the acquisition of a lab analysis system capable of simultaneous assay of up to 500 analytes, using very small sample volumes. The instrument is used to assess sublethal, but possibly significant, effects of prolonged or acute exposure to oil on critical biological functions in marine mammals and sea turtles: Although these are among the most vulnerable species to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the sublethal effects of oil exposure on these populations are poorly understood. As a result, this investment, through the NSF-RAPID mechanism, is timely and critical in light of the recent Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The instrument/system will be an integral part of a comprehensive research laboratory that will establish body burdens of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in oil-exposed individual animals undergoing rehabilitation; confirm oil-related impacts on general health by using traditional clinical measures of kidney and liver function, and use biomarkers to assess whether exposure to oil during the Deepwater Horizon spill causes genotoxic effects or significant impacts on reproductive potential or immune system function. The results will enhance understanding of the immunological and reproductive consequences of oil exposure on marine mammals and sea turtles. Results from the studies will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journal publications and though participation at regional and national scientific meetings.</AbstractNarration>
