    <AbstractNarration>This travel award supports student participation in the 6th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (CoNEXT) will be held in Philadelphia, PA, USA, between November 30 and December 3, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoNEXT 2010 and the associated workshops, includes a student workshop, a workshop on ?Re-architecting the Internet?, and a workshop on ?Programmable Routers for Extensible Services of Tomorrow?. This rich program will expose students to new ideas, and allow them to interact with other researchers. In particular, the student workshop is geared to provide students an opportunity to present their work in progress, receive feedback on their work, and obtain valuable experience in writing and presenting technical papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 10 US-based graduate students are provided the opportunity to attend CoNext. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited travel funds to attend workshops; attendance at such events is an important part of their educational experience.</AbstractNarration>
