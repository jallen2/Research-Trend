    <AbstractNarration>Although theoretical results predict that significant gains can be&lt;br/&gt;achieved from node cooperation, current wireless systems are exclusively&lt;br/&gt;built on point-to-point communication, where transmissions are separated&lt;br/&gt;in time, frequency, or space. Before cooperative techniques can be&lt;br/&gt;implemented, two key questions need to be addressed: How do they perform&lt;br/&gt;in the context of a larger network, and how do they perform in actual&lt;br/&gt;experiments?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at providing answers to both these questions by&lt;br/&gt;combining theory and experimental work. On the theory side, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators use a rigorous analytic approach that combines tools from&lt;br/&gt;stochastic geometry and information theory. The stochastic geometry&lt;br/&gt;approach permits statements about ensembles of networks, rather than&lt;br/&gt;just a single fixed network geometry, which is often more tractable and&lt;br/&gt;leads to more general results. On the experimental side, performance&lt;br/&gt;measurements are taken on small cooperative networks of software&lt;br/&gt;radio devices. They are used to derive analytical models that can be&lt;br/&gt;used at higher layers in the protocol stack and to determine the overhead&lt;br/&gt;and control traffic required to set up the cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the insight gained from both theory and experiments, novel&lt;br/&gt;cooperative protocols for wireless networks are derived.&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the project will enable significant improvements in the&lt;br/&gt;performance of wireless systems, thereby helping to overcome the&lt;br/&gt;spectrum scarcity. The results are be disseminated in form of conference&lt;br/&gt;and journal articles, tutorials, and short courses, and some ideas will&lt;br/&gt;hopefully lead to patents.</AbstractNarration>
