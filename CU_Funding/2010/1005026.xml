    <AbstractNarration>This award supported by the Chemistry Division, with additional support from: the Division of Biological Infrastructure, the HBCU-UP Program, and the Physics Division is for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Kathleen M. Morgan at Xavier University of Louisiana. The award will support eight students per summer in a ten week program, over three years. The research projects focus on collaborative research in chemistry, biology and materials science. Sample projects include: (1) genetic and behavioral studies of the nematode C. elegans; (2) the development of new materials for water and wastewater treatment; (3) the development of synthetic nanomaterials as gene transfection agents; (4) the design and study of new inhibitors for Cytochrome P450 enzymes; (5) the study of the mechanisms of aflatoxin production in fungi which are known to infect crops; (6) structure-property investigations of simple epoxides and aziridines; (7) the synthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles; (8) the development of microfluidic methods for bioanalytical applications; and (9) the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of selective estrogen receptor modulators. Besides being exposed to cutting-edge research, the students participating in this program will participate in site visits, social activities, and professional development activities. Students targeted for the proposed site include students from regional HBCU institutions and other institutions with lack of resources for research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training to a significant number of students who might not have this opportunity at their home institution. The interdisciplinary projects that the students will work on while at Xavier, are excellent examples of the kinds of cross-disciplinary work that is becoming more and more typical of the most fruitful avenues for modern laboratory research. Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
