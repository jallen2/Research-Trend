    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1041217&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Ian Agol, Robion C. Kirby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for a conference "Low-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and high-dimensional categories". The title is somewhat&lt;br/&gt;ironic, in that the low and high dimensions are in fact the same:&lt;br/&gt;3 and especially 4. The conference celebrates the occasion of&lt;br/&gt;Michael Freedman's 60th birthday and some of the current&lt;br/&gt;mathematical achievements and challenges influenced by Freedman's&lt;br/&gt;work. For manifolds of dimension 5 and higher, there is a&lt;br/&gt;well-established classification scheme, the so called surgery&lt;br/&gt;theory which includes the celebrated s-cobordism theorem that&lt;br/&gt;produces diffeomorphisms between manifolds from homotopy&lt;br/&gt;theoretic data. Dimensions below 5 are more difficult because&lt;br/&gt;there is less room to maneuver and, as a consequence, the&lt;br/&gt;s-cobordism theorem fails. For n-categories, dimensions n&lt;br/&gt;greater than 2 are difficult because of the complexity of the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial relations which describe the various ways n-balls&lt;br/&gt;can be cut, glued and rotated. Thus dimensions 3 and 4 represent&lt;br/&gt;a shared frontier of the two subjects, though this frontier is&lt;br/&gt;approached from different directions. One of the main goals of&lt;br/&gt;this conference is to promote cross-fertilization between experts&lt;br/&gt;on 4-manifolds and experts on higher categories and quantum field&lt;br/&gt;theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Freedman made groundbreaking contributions to the study&lt;br/&gt;and classification of 4-dimensional spaces (manifolds), which are&lt;br/&gt;a central topic in the study of topology, and have connections&lt;br/&gt;with algebra, geometry and physics. Ideas from physics, in&lt;br/&gt;particular quantum field theory, imply that there ought to be&lt;br/&gt;certain constructions which describe the topology of&lt;br/&gt;4-dimensional spaces, that is, intrinsic properties which do not&lt;br/&gt;depend on the measure of length or angles on the space.&lt;br/&gt;Mathematically, these theories are formulated in the algebraic&lt;br/&gt;language of category theory and require substantial new&lt;br/&gt;developments in that area. The object of the conference is to&lt;br/&gt;bring together experts on 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds together&lt;br/&gt;with experts in category theory and quantum field theory to&lt;br/&gt;explore the interactions between these topics. Additional&lt;br/&gt;geometric structures, such as broken Lefschetz fibrations,&lt;br/&gt;contact and symplectic structures, smooth structures, and gauge&lt;br/&gt;theories will also be explored at the conference.</AbstractNarration>
