    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The I3 Berkeley Science Connections Program (I3BSC) will build bridges from the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;to graduate levels for traditionally underrepresented (UR) students.&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC focuses on the mathematical and physical sciences (MPS) in an effort to open the door for&lt;br/&gt;students from diverse backgrounds to key fields of modern science, in which underrepresentation&lt;br/&gt;of both ethnic minorities and women of all ethnicities is long-standing and remains severe. New&lt;br/&gt;bridges to and into the beginning years of graduate training will be built on research experiences&lt;br/&gt;of increasing intensity for undergraduates and incoming graduate students. The research activities&lt;br/&gt;will be fortified with systematic access to structured academic enrichment and professional&lt;br/&gt;development opportunities and resources, as well as a network of peers, near peers and scientists&lt;br/&gt;who are further advanced on the academic pathway and will serve as mentors.&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC targets the transition into graduate school for undergraduates in their junior and senior&lt;br/&gt;years and through the first two years of doctoral study. It focuses on the advancement of students&lt;br/&gt;into MPS careers, particularly academic careers, incorporating and also going beyond the goals of&lt;br/&gt;retention in science majors and completion of degrees.&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC?s approaches lend themselves to study and evaluation. We will examine if and how the&lt;br/&gt;variety and frequency of interventions effects UR advancement in science and the influence of&lt;br/&gt;particular interventions. For example, the mentoring aspect of the project will provide a unique&lt;br/&gt;window into learning how mentoring affects not only the mentee, but also the mentor. While&lt;br/&gt;there is a growing set of literature around instructional beliefs and practices within the classroom&lt;br/&gt;there is little published about this more informal aspect of academic life.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC is designed to take the highly effective work of four separate NSF programs that now work&lt;br/&gt;independently from each other at Berkeley, each operating with different MPS disciplinary foci&lt;br/&gt;and targeting different points on the educational pathway. I3BSC extends each of the four&lt;br/&gt;approaches to make them more uniformly and consistently available for all UR students at UC&lt;br/&gt;Berkeley who are majoring in any of the MPS departments at Berkeley or are entering any of our&lt;br/&gt;MPS doctoral programs.&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC will create new synergies that extend the work of these four key NSF-supported programs:&lt;br/&gt;Berkeley?s NSF-California Alliance for Minority Participation Program (CAMP), which supports&lt;br/&gt;students across STEM fields in undergraduate research experiences, community building and&lt;br/&gt;professional development; Berkeley?s NSF-AGEP program, The Berkeley Edge, which increases&lt;br/&gt;URM doctoral degree production, and advances PhD students and post-doctoral fellows to&lt;br/&gt;professorial careers; a NSF-supported program for mentoring lower-division students in Physics,&lt;br/&gt;the Compass and Society for Women in the Physical Sciences joint mentoring program; The&lt;br/&gt;NSF-Explorations in Statistics Research Program, which is an intensive week-long program for&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates to explore cutting edge research in Statistics. We will include students from all&lt;br/&gt;groups that add diversity under the post-Proposition 209 definition (URMs, women, students with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities, first-generation to college), because these groups are severely underrepresented in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and physical sciences, with a primary focus and priority given to those Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;students who are eligible for participation in CAMP, Compass-SWPS-PURNA, and AGEP.</AbstractNarration>
