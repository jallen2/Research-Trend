    <AbstractNarration>The standard instrumentality for the criminal acquisition and&lt;br/&gt;distribution of images and video of child sexual exploitation is&lt;br/&gt;peer-to-peer (p2p) networks. Over 160,000 users based in the US&lt;br/&gt;are sharing child pornography (CP) using Gnutella alone. Past&lt;br/&gt;studies have found that: 21% of CP possessors had images&lt;br/&gt;depicting sexual violence to children such as bondage, rape, and&lt;br/&gt;torture; 28% had images of children younger than 3 years old; and&lt;br/&gt;that 16% of investigations of CP possession ended with discovery&lt;br/&gt;of persons who directly victimized children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work aims to make significant advances in forensics&lt;br/&gt;methods of investigating criminal acts on peer-to-peer file&lt;br/&gt;sharing networks. The project represents a unique&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary collaboration between computer science and&lt;br/&gt;criminology with close participation from existing law&lt;br/&gt;enforcement partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The project makes the following broad&lt;br/&gt;contributions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- It proposes novel methods of tagging a remote computer over the&lt;br/&gt;network with information that can uniquely identify it during a&lt;br/&gt;forensic examination. These serve as both identifiers and as&lt;br/&gt;indicia of intent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- It proposes to gather a foundational dataset regarding the&lt;br/&gt;prevalence and rate of spread of child pornography on p2p&lt;br/&gt;networks. Further, it proposes to measure and quantify the&lt;br/&gt;relationships between child abuse and the trading of child&lt;br/&gt;pornography on p2p networks. Finally, it proposes the&lt;br/&gt;development of models to detect the trafficking of deliberately&lt;br/&gt;hidden child pornography on these networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The project aims to reduce the number of children&lt;br/&gt;sexually exploited each year by thwarting the trafficking of&lt;br/&gt;their images on p2p networks and via the capture of the contact&lt;br/&gt;offenders that rape, torture, or otherwise brutalize them. This&lt;br/&gt;work will increase cross-disciplinary collaboration between&lt;br/&gt;computer science and criminology and between law enforcement and&lt;br/&gt;academia; effect technology transfer to law enforcement in the&lt;br/&gt;field of online child pornography investigations, which will help&lt;br/&gt;reduce the number of victims of crimes in the future; and&lt;br/&gt;facilitate broad educational outreach and recruitment of&lt;br/&gt;under-represented minorities in undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;research in digital forensics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL: &lt;br/&gt; http://prisms.cs.umass.edu/CNS-1018615</AbstractNarration>
