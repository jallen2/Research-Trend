    <AbstractNarration>1049628&lt;br/&gt;DeVincent Wolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for a workshop/symposium is proposed. This workshop, co-financed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (iCEINT) will engage material scientists, chemists, toxicologists, ecotoxicologists, environmental engineers and scientists, meteorologists, regulators, and other stakeholders of nanotechnology in a meaningful exchange of ideas regarding the sustainable development of nanomaterials and nanotechnology. Specifically, they propose a multi-day symposium at the 2010 Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall Meeting to provide a forum for exchange of ideas between young and established faculty from materials science and chemistry that are developing novel nanomaterials and the scientists addressing environmental issues and toxicological concerns with those materials. A key objective of this workshop is continuing dialogue toward formulating the framework for sustainable development of nanotechnology including concepts of green chemistry and policy. The workshop will also help to transfer techniques and approaches across fields and establish contacts among the next generation of researchers that will stimulate collaboration in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will cover several topics relevant to sustainable nanotechnology:&lt;br/&gt;1) Measuring nanomaterials and interfaces in biologically relevant conditions,&lt;br/&gt;2) Detection and quantification of nanomaterials in complex matrices,&lt;br/&gt;3) Predictive tools for assessing the nanoEHS risk of new nanomaterials,&lt;br/&gt;4) Biological model systems for nanomaterial EHS evaluation,&lt;br/&gt;5) Green(er) nanomaterials synthesis and manufacturing methods/LCA,&lt;br/&gt;6) Nanomedicine lessons in engineered nanomaterial toxicity and safety, and&lt;br/&gt;7) Nanomaterials for environmental remediation.</AbstractNarration>
