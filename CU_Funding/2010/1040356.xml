    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the workshop is to foster long-lasting international &lt;br/&gt;scientific collaborations to investigate the scientific foundations, design, and feasibility of a future &lt;br/&gt;international cyber architecture. Such an architecture must allow for transnational data repositories &lt;br/&gt;and be capable of enforcing both today's and future diverse security and privacy policies. Topics to &lt;br/&gt;be addressed may include, among others, how to determine whether a set of privacy or access &lt;br/&gt;control policies is consistent, whether it can be efficiently enforced, and if so what techniques are &lt;br/&gt;most effective. Different data exchange applications will require tailored mechanisms that allow for &lt;br/&gt;security, privacy, anonymity, and provenance to be maintained. Of particular interest are (1) data &lt;br/&gt;concerning malware detection (attack signatures, number/pattern of compromised systems, botnet &lt;br/&gt;membership, vulnerability pricing data, etc.), (2) network management data (traffic patterns, &lt;br/&gt;headers, routing updates, etc.), (3) social network data (usage patterns within social networking &lt;br/&gt;applications, status of data posted within these applications, etc.), as well as data from other &lt;br/&gt;domains such as (4) healthcare data (electronic health records, including images, diagnostic notes, &lt;br/&gt;laboratory reports, etc.), and (5) financial data (individual transactions, interbank transfers, credit &lt;br/&gt;reporting, etc.).The workshop will consist of several keynote talks, panels, and breakout sessions. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, information will be presented about funding opportunities to support international &lt;br/&gt;research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
