    <AbstractNarration>Multithreaded programs are becoming increasingly critical driven by the&lt;br/&gt;rise of multicore hardware and the coming storm of cloud computing.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, these programs remain difficult to write, test, and debug.&lt;br/&gt;A key reason for this difficulty is nondeterminism: different runs of a&lt;br/&gt;multithreaded program may show different behaviors depending on how the&lt;br/&gt;threads interleave. Nondeterminism complicates almost every development&lt;br/&gt;step of multithreaded programs. For instance, it weakens testing because&lt;br/&gt;the schedules tested may not be the ones run in the field; it complicates&lt;br/&gt;debugging because reproducing a buggy schedule is hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past three decades, researchers have developed many techniques to&lt;br/&gt;address nondeterminism. Despite these efforts, it remains an open&lt;br/&gt;challenge to achieve both efficiency and determinism for general&lt;br/&gt;multithreaded programs on commodity multiprocessors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to address this fundamental challenge. Its key insight&lt;br/&gt;is that one can reuse a small number of schedules to process a large&lt;br/&gt;number of inputs. Based on this insight, it takes an approach called&lt;br/&gt;schedule memoization that memoizes past schedules and, when possible,&lt;br/&gt;reuses them for future runs. This approach amortizes the high overhead of&lt;br/&gt;making one schedule deterministic over many reuses and makes a program&lt;br/&gt;repeat familiar behaviors whenever possible. A real-world analogy to this&lt;br/&gt;approach is animals' natural tendencies to follow familiar routes to avoid&lt;br/&gt;hazards and discovery overhead of unknown routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest impact of this project will be a novel approach and new,&lt;br/&gt;effective systems and technologies to improving software reliability, thus&lt;br/&gt;benefiting every business, government, and individual.</AbstractNarration>
