    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project targets development of a new approach&lt;br/&gt;to building wireless sensor infrastructure ? energy storage systems, electrical distribution, and&lt;br/&gt;packaging - that allows dramatic miniaturization of wireless sensor nodes, eliminates most&lt;br/&gt;restrictions on their shape and is environmentally-friendly. Accomplishing these goals requires&lt;br/&gt;development of innovative new approaches to fabrication of mesoscale electronic circuitry and&lt;br/&gt;thin film energy storage batteries. Laser-based approaches to making very fine feature&lt;br/&gt;conductor patterns, vias, and mechanical structures in a variety of organic and inorganic materials&lt;br/&gt;commonly used in the electronics industry will be utilized. New battery chemistry will also be&lt;br/&gt;refined to allow fabrication of miniature, flexible, thin film batteries with energy storage densities&lt;br/&gt;substantially exceeding those of any battery currently on the market. Together these innovations&lt;br/&gt;will allow nearly an order of magnitude reduction in volume of wireless sensing devices.&lt;br/&gt;Combination of the laser processing and battery technologies developed in this project will offer&lt;br/&gt;an approach to miniaturization of almost any wireless sensor that is easily adaptable to most&lt;br/&gt;sensor designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be found in many areas of everyday&lt;br/&gt;life. After an extended incubation period, wireless sensing networks are experiencing a surge of&lt;br/&gt;market growth. A market opportunity for more than 100 million sensor nodes is projected for&lt;br/&gt;2019. Potential applications come from areas as diverse as infrastructure monitoring for bridges,&lt;br/&gt;roadways and pipelines, lighting and HVAC control in buildings, electrical metering, parking&lt;br/&gt;management, patient monitoring, elderly care, seismic sensors, industrial process control, crop&lt;br/&gt;water management, and home automation. In the health care area alone, wireless sensor networks&lt;br/&gt;could potentially produce and estimated $25 billion savings world wide. Feasibility of many&lt;br/&gt;potential applications will be strongly influenced by the availability of miniaturized sensor nodes&lt;br/&gt;with suitable form factors that can be operated without maintenance for extended periods.&lt;br/&gt;Targeting miniaturization and power sources, the proposed project addresses and solves key&lt;br/&gt;historical bottlenecks in sensor network implementation. It will have a significant impact on&lt;br/&gt;these large developing markets, as well as spin-off applications in medical and consumer&lt;br/&gt;electronics.</AbstractNarration>
