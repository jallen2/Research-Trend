    <AbstractNarration>This award made to the Johns Hopkins University is supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences' Division of Biological Infrastructure (BIO/DBI), the Directorate for Engineering's Engineering Education and Centers (ENG/EEC), and the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences' Division of Chemistry (MPS/CHE). This project, housed within the Institute for NanoBioTechnology (INBT), will provide research training for 10 students for 10 weeks, during the summers of 2011- 2013. The overall goal is to give REU students a unique educational experience, with research at the core while at the same time serving as an ideal foundation for future graduate work. Students will work in labs located within the participating departments; chemical engineering, materials science engineering, bioengineering, biology, chemistry, or physics. INBT has about 20 faculty mentors participating in the program. There is a wide range of interesting and exciting projects for the students. Students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and various workshops, such as the responsible conduct of research, professional development, career workshops for industry and academia, and an overview of the graduate school application process. REU students have access to individual mentor's facilities as well as many interdepartmental labs and centers with core facilities such as microscopy, cell and tissue engineering, and others. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in bioengineering or related fields. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://inbt.jhu.edu/education/undergraduate/reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Denis Wirtz at wirtz@jhu.edu) or the REU program manager (Ms. Ashanti Edwards at aedwards@jhu.edu).</AbstractNarration>
