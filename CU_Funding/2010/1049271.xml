    <AbstractNarration>This award sponsors undergraduate and graduate student attendance at the 26th ACSAC, to be held December 6-10 2010 in Austin Texas. The ACSAC conference is a top-tier academic security conference which attracts about 200 highly skilled security professional attendees per year. ACSAC regularly brings together leading minds in academic, governmental and commercial computer security to address the most pressing problems in applied computer security and to discuss seminal works in Computer Security. In addition to keynote Invited Essays and Distinguished Practitioner talks), ACSAC includes a "Classic Papers" series, in which two or three authors of seminal papers in computer security are invited to update those papers and present lessons learned. These papers, available free on the ACSAC web site, familiarize a new generation of students with key security research developments of the past, and provide a valuable resource for undergraduate and graduate instruction. Supported students have an opportunity to meet and interact with notable figures at the conference.</AbstractNarration>
