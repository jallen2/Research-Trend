    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will conduct a feasibility study of a new method for making very densely spaced (as little as ~10-20 meters spacing) measurements of rain and precipitable water content. Measurement of rain and precipitable water content is critical to a broad range of human activities, from scientific studies of climate change to the production of electricity at hydroelectric plants. The effect of rainfall on microwave radars and communication links has been studied for decades, with impacts including: attenuation, backscatter, and polarization and phase change of the signal. While these effects are often seen as an engineering problem to be overcome, they simultaneously present a powerful opportunity to conduct science, especially in light of the proliferation of consumer satellite television. The expected outcomes will leverage off-the-shelf technology, such as three-frequency and three-look-angle microwave dishes and down-convertors, that cost less than $100 for a potentially state of the art instrument. A graduate student at Penn State University will participate in the study.</AbstractNarration>
