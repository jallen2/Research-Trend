    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the biennial teacher workshop, a critical component of LEAP (Lowell Educational Astronomy Program), which is a science enrichment and outreach program for 5th-8th grade Navajo and Hopi children and their teachers. This workshop will be held October 15-16, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LEAP program pairs astronomers with teachers for one year. The astronomer visits the classroom throughout the year, leading astronomy discussions and hands-on activities in collaboration with the teacher. The astronomer also holds star parties at the school and involves tribal educators in presenting traditional astronomical knowledge. The year-long partnership culminates in a field trip to Lowell Observatory in which the students visit the Observatory's Steele Visitor Center during the day and observe on two research telescopes at night. LEAP is primarily concerned with teacher training so that the efforts of the program have an impact far beyond the students worked with directly each year. The teacher workshop is a major part of that training, and each teacher brings a colleague from their school. The workshop thus reaches more teachers than participate directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two unique components of LEAP are: 1) the astronomers take the time to drive long distances to get to remote schools, not just once, but in a sustained effort throughout the school year; 2) the program provides all of the materials for classroom activities, allowing some classes the opportunity for hands-on activities that they could not otherwise afford. Over the past 14 years, LEAP has impacted more than 1700 Native American students and 50 5th-8th grade teachers at Navajo and Hopi Nation schools. The teacher workshop this year will enhance the understanding of science for 18 teachers at 9 Navajo and Hopi Nation schools, and will benefit their students for years to come.</AbstractNarration>
