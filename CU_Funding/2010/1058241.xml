    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Matthew Zimmt of Brown University will study ways to stabilize physisorbed monolayers on graphite in order to enable practical uses and applications of these nanoperiodic structures. Patterning strategies to be explored include modulating electrostatic interactions between aliphatic chains bearing dipolar groups, tailored packing of alkadiyne chains, and electrostatic interactions between heteroaromatic cores of adsorbing molecules. Monolayer stabilization strategies to be tested include using extremely long aliphatic chains, polymerizing diyne side chains, and polymerizing functionalized aromatic cores. Functional groups projecting from the aromatic cores of molecules in the monolayers will be used as capture elements, enabling patterned monolayers to function as ultra-high resolution (less than 10 nm size features) planar templates for capturing polymers, nanoparticles and biomolecules. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students, enhancing research infrastructure through hosting graduate student visitors from the Czech Technical University in Prague, and broadly disseminating research results through publications, presentations at national meetings, and software development to correct for thermal drifts in STM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major challenges of modern nanochemistry is to guide very small chemical objects to assemble spontaneously into precise, useful patterns over large areas. If successful, this project will yield novel strategies for the preparation of stable, patterned templates with a thickness of one molecule and an extremely high density of binding sites. The binding site patterns will direct the assembly of many other chemical species into precise, two dimensional patterns. Ultimately, such work could lead to applications in the fields of chemical sensing, nanoscale electronics, solar energy conversion, and biomedical materials.</AbstractNarration>
