    <AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Mattanjah de Vries and Dr. Stuart Tyson-Smith and their graduate students will develop a technique for organic tracer molecule analysis for archaeometry. Their novel approach is based on a specialized form of laser mass spectrometry or LMS. In the vast arsenal of powerful analytical chemical techniques that are routinely used in archaeometry, the majority is particularly suited to elemental analysis. On the other hand, analysis of organic compounds in archeological samples is more challenging, generally requiring combinations of techniques and often yielding less specific identifications. The LMS technique will address these problems by combining the selectivity of resonant laser spectroscopy with the sensitivity of mass spectrometry. As a result LMS is simultaneously highly specific and sensitive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to detect and identify organic compounds in archeological samples is highly desirable because many types of samples can be uniquely characterized based on their organic molecular composition. Examples include food residues in pottery, affording a glimpse into what people ate or drank, resins, revealing materials used for incense, or dyes from which we can learn details on ancient coloring and manufacturing techniques as well as sources of materials and their trade routes. This project is interdisciplinary in nature, as the group of Dr. de Vries in the Department of Chemistry and biochemistry at UCSB is teaming up with the group of Dr. Tyson-Smith in the Department of Anthropology at the same university. The primary goals in this pilot study are to optimize the technique, to develop a catalogue of tracer compounds for archaeometric use, and to work with researchers in the field to facilitate further practical development of applications of the technique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique combination of state of the art physical chemistry techniques with topics related to anthropology and archaeology is particularly suitable for educational projects. In addition to training graduate and postgraduate students, the research will involve undergraduate students as well as high school students, in the framework of UCSB sponsored outreach programs to minority students and high schools. In an additional collaboration students will participate from Jackson State University, a historically black college. Material from this research will also be shared with the Bay Area Museum-School Online Science Learning Collaboratory Pilot Project. In a broader sense, the ability to characterize ancient materials that were previously inaccessible to such analysis will open new windows to insights in our history and culture.</AbstractNarration>
