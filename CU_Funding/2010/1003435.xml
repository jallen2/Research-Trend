    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing students in secondary dual enrollment and postsecondary technical majors the core knowledge and skills to gain employment in the rapidly expanding Marcellus Shale Natural Gas industry in the Pennsylvania Allegheny Plateau region. Through curriculum modification of 9 technical majors at the college and professional development of secondary instructors, students in over 14 school districts and career and technology centers earn college credit in high demand natural gas occupational areas through dual enrollment. Serving a predominately rural population, these secondary schools are being assisted in recruiting students from underrepresented population, many of whom are first generation college students and women. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is developing quality, state-of-the-art curriculum units integrated into existing courses for technicians in the emerging Marcellus Shale horizontal drilling natural gas industry. Examination of technician skills needed by the industry and integration of these concepts into existing technician curricula is improving student learning for this emerging economic sector. Dual enrollment student learning is being assessed using a model that ensures parallel content in the high school dual enrollment courses and follows the national standards established by the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (NACEP). College faculty are assessing high school students through joint assessment with the high school teacher. High school dual enrollment courses, taught by the high school teacher, use the college final, graded by the college faculty, to ensure comparable rigor. Hence, college-level student learning is being assured. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The infrastructure of the technician educational pipeline is being significantly enhanced through a partnership between the secondary education system, the college, and the Natural Gas Industry. Students who complete dual enrollment credits have been found to complete college at a higher rate and underrepresented populations have an opportunity to test postsecondary experiences in the safe environment of their secondary school, resulting in increased college enrollment. The results of the project activities are being disseminated through an annual statewide education and workforce development conference and session presentations at statewide education and workforce development conferences. A web portal houses educational curricula and statewide training opportunities. Linkages to national NSF curriculum clearinghouses are being developed.</AbstractNarration>
