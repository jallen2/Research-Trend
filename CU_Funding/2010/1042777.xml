    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in "A Conference on Complex Dynamics and Hyperbolic Geometry" that will be held at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York from October 21-23, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this conference is to celebrate the many contributions of Linda Keen to the field of "complex analysis," broadly construed. The primary focus of the meeting will be on areas in which Professor Keen has had a major involvement, specifically complex dynamics, Teichmuller theory, and Kleinian groups. All three remain central and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>
