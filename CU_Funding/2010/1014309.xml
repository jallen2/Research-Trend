    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an innovative microwave surface-wave plasma source for low-cost, large-area, high-throughput conformal thin-film growth. A scalable architecture will be designed to generate high-pressure, low-temperature, narrow-gap, high-density, and damage-free microwave plasmas without the need for external magnetic fields. This project is expected to demonstrate the high-speed and large-area deposition of high-quality hydrogenated nanocrystalline and amorphous silicon thin films for high-efficiency tandem solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a new plasma source with high-speed, large-area and high-quality thin film growth for applications in photovoltaic cells and other semiconductor devices. When scaled to large-areas, current Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) and Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PEALD) capacitive systems have limitations due to large transient Radio Frequency (RF) voltages, discharge non-uniformity and generation of arcs and surface defects between two active parallel plates. In this project, a microwave surface-wave plasma source will be developed to overcome these challenges. In addition, Starfire Industries will partner with the Center for Plasma-Material Interactions at the University of Illinois to provide educational opportunities to students.</AbstractNarration>
