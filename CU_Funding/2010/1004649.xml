    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the REU site in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Toledo. Undergraduate students have a variety of cutting edge research opportunities in topics including Astrophysics/Astronomy; Atomic/Molecular/Optical Physics; Biological/Health/Medical Physics (at the UT Medical Center hospital); and Condensed Matter/Materials Science Physics (with specialization in thin films, photovoltaics, and photonics). Opportunities exist in these areas for both experimental and theoretical research. In photovoltaics, the students may have the opportunity to conduct research at local photovoltaic companies and centers, in addition to departmental research. The research projects are chosen such that the students' projects will lead to eventual publication in the appropriate professional research journals. REU students will be involved in exciting state-of-the-art research in a department that allows individualized attention, yet is large enough to give students experiences in a variety of subfields of physics. A variety of social activities for the REU students are also planned. The REU site is committed to involving students from diverse backgrounds in this research experience.</AbstractNarration>
