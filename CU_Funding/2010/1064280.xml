    <AbstractNarration>The nuclear equation of state will be studied via the use of isotopic and meson observables. One experiment has been approved at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory in Japan to study isospin diffusion in high-energy heavy ion collisions. This experiment will make use of pure beams of high energy heavy ions spanning a wide asymmetry. Isotopic production will be used to more precisely gauge the nuclear symmetry energy at energies above normal nuclear saturation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, recent data acquired in measurements at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory will be used to constrain the nucleon effective masses in nuclear matter. These results are extremely important in constraining the model dependence of transport theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future measurements will concentrate on nucleon correlation functions in heavy ion collisions and on pion production as an observable of the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ undergraduate students in order to prepare them for careers in nuclear physics. The PI has a strong record of undergraduate student training, having sent two out of three undergraduate students to graduate school during the past project period (and is planning to send two out of two to graduate school in the next year). In addition to student training, the project will solve several technical issues in detector technology, data acquisition, and high-speed electronics.</AbstractNarration>
