    <AbstractNarration>The American Meteorological Society (AMS) will bring to the United States scientists who are leaders in their national meteorological societies in developing countries for the first-ever International Forum of Meteorological Societies (IFMS). In this Forum in these scientists will interact with their colleagues from developed countries to exchange information, share experience and knowledge that could identify challenges and opportunities for meteorological and related oceanographic research, not only within their countries, but on both regional and global scales as well. Most communications between meteorological societies have occurred to date on a bilateral basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discussions and interactions at the Forum will address at least two scientific issues of a high priority -- global climate change and severe natural weather hazards. The Forum will consider ways in which professional meteorological societies can assist in identifying issues that are likely to arise from global climate change and severe natural weather hazards and will consider ways to address these issues. The latter effort will be directed at improvement of education and communications in the meteorological sciences; and of outreach programs to inform and educate decision-makers, professionals, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
