    <AbstractNarration>This project is to derive empirical estimates of the electric field-aligned (Pederson) current carried by electrons in the auroral ionosphere near 120 km (the E-region). The electron Pederson current, typically much smaller than that carried by ions, is hypothesized to be driven under conditions of strong electric fields by the dissipation of plasma instabilities known as Farley-Buneman waves. Estimates of this "anomalous" Pederson current will be inferred from discrepancies between total ground magnetic deflection as measured by an extensive network of high-latitude magnetometers and that derived from incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements using a multiple-beam transmission mode. A large set of combined magnetometer and ISR data will be used to generate statistical estimates of the anomalous electron Pederson current and associated turbulence heating rate of the thermosphere/ionosphere. This project will involve the participation of both graduate and undergraduate students during summer collaborations between SRI International and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.</AbstractNarration>
