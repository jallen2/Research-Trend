    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this work is to investigate the creation of elongated plasma channels to reach low loss propagation of highly intense and ultra short pulses used for the development of soft X-Ray laser sources.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will shed light on the complex physics of laser beam propagation through plasma and plasma waveguide formation. This study will combine theoretical simulations, experimental design and time and spatial-resolution interferometry for plasma diagnostics and include external collaboration with other leaders in the field.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The investigation will elucidate issues of intense laser beam propagation in areas such as soft X-Ray laser sources, laser particle accelerators and laser propagation in atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;In addition the research provides an excellent platform for the teaching, training and dissemination of advanced plasma physics. Graduate students supported under this grant will gain experience in theoretical and experimental physics and gain from the collaboration with other leading research teams.</AbstractNarration>
