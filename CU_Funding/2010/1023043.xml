    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;The Engaged Interdisciplinary Learning in Sustainability (EILS) project is designed to integrate new pedagogies, analytical skills and applied techniques to daily activities and practices critical to sustainability in the context of higher education. The project involves close interdisciplinary collaboration between faculty from engineering and social sciences, through creation and delivery of a series of courses, labs, teaching methods and materials in sustainability engineering and ecological design. EILS seeks to develop the field of "Sustainability Science and Sustainability Studies" (S4) and formalize it as a new intedisciplinary field. S4 is critical to a successful transition to a Nation and world that effectively and equitably protects the planet's environment and ecology. The project's approach to S4 rests on the interdisciplinary integration of technical-scientific and social science fields of inquiry, taking as its focus research into and teaching about the engineering, scientific and social science elements of current and future policy and practice. The project applies new pedagogical approaches in courses, laboratory exercises, internships, workshops and careful assessment of instructor and student achievements. The project includes elements of STEM education, cyberlearning, and technological and social literacy elements, directed toward education of skilled professionals. This curriculum includes interactive laboratories in renewable energy systems, water resources, ecological footprint, sustainable agriculture, urban design, and life-cycle analysis which are accessible to students with diverse backgrounds. Most courses will include a service learning project for students with different disciplines to work together. This provides the opportunity to learn about engineering design and real life social implementation issues. Course and co-curricular materials are supplemented by detailed instructor manuals with emphasis on learner-centered pedagogy supported by formative and peer assessment strategies and a Handbook for Sustainability Engineering and Ecological Design.</AbstractNarration>
