    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is dedicated to&lt;br/&gt;development and testing of Magnetic Valve System (MVS) enabling implementation of&lt;br/&gt;electronically controlled variable timing on camless internal combustion engines. MVS is an&lt;br/&gt;advanced actuator for intake and exhaust poppet valves utilized in internal combustion engines&lt;br/&gt;for control of flows of fresh charge and exhaust gases. LaunchPoint Technologies, Inc. will&lt;br/&gt;design and build the MVS actuator and demonstrate its operation on an experimental internal&lt;br/&gt;combustion engine. The advantages of MVS technology originate from the nature of the magnetic&lt;br/&gt;spring actuator that provides efficient control of the valve position and speed during valve&lt;br/&gt;opening and closing events. LaunchPoint?s cost-effective and robust technology will enable&lt;br/&gt;implementation of highly anticipated electronically controlled variable valve timing on a mass&lt;br/&gt;production engine.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are a combination of significant improvements&lt;br/&gt;in fuel efficiency, reduction of emissions, and improved power characteristics of conventional&lt;br/&gt;spark ignition and compression ignition engines. When a reliable, electronically controlled&lt;br/&gt;system is delivered, the economic and social impact of this technology will be broad. The MVS&lt;br/&gt;actuator can potentially be used in millions of internal combustion engines employed in&lt;br/&gt;automobiles, trucks, bulldozers, and stationary generators. It will enable implementation of&lt;br/&gt;emerging advanced combustion technologies such as Homogeneous Charge Compression&lt;br/&gt;Ignition and Compressed Air Hybrid. Widespread adoption of MVS actuators would result in&lt;br/&gt;substantial decrease of petroleum usage, adverse effects on the environment such as air pollution&lt;br/&gt;and greenhouse gas production, and improve energy independence.</AbstractNarration>
