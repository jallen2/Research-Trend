    <AbstractNarration>RNA viruses have high rates of mutation and so typically have high genetic variation and high capacity to evolve rapidly in response to host defenses. The evolutionary genetics of RNA viruses are important because the group includes significant pathogens of many plants and animals, including humans, domestic animals, and crop plants. This project will study populations of the Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus, an RNA virus that is an important pathogen of squashes, melons, and cucumbers, and will determine the influence of mode of transmission from host to host and growth within a host on the evolutionary genetics of the virus using modern gene sequencing technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project will document genetic diversity of an important crop pathogen and will illuminate the general question of how the dynamics of population growth within hosts and during transmission from one host to another influence genetic diversity of populations of an RNA virus. Results will inform management strategies for a group of pathogens that cause extensive agricultural losses. The project also provides research-based training opportunities for undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
