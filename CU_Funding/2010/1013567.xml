    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a miniature radio frequency antenna that can be configured into micropower applications for selected frequency bands into the gigahertz range. The proposed antenna is a basic component in radio frequency identification systems (RFID) which includes the use of wireless, batteryless remote ID and sensor tags for many applications. The opportunity is to provide systems with increased range making practical for the first time remote sensing in buildings, hard to access locations, environmentally dangerous for personnel with handheld units for very long durations of time. These antennas can supply power to remote sensor tags by scavenging energy from incident RF radiation. A successful outcome of this SBIR work will impact wireless ID and sensor applications across a large technology base including pharmaceutical, biomedical, smart buildings, shipping, and vehicle tracking. We propose a combined experimental and theoretical study to optimize the characteristics of this antenna in the GHz frequency range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can impact a range of applications. The use of university personnel and students enhances the contribution of this funding to science and engineering education in the US. The proposed prototyping and characterization is applicable to microwave identification and sensor systems. As we detail our modeling and optimization CAD work we will be contributing to scientific and technological understanding of electromagnetic antennas. Unique structural features of the proposed antenna increase the range between sensor tag and the reader interrogator of RFID systems. Benefits include tagging and tracking goods in shipment, goods in storage, animals, and people with high security coding in many instances to avoid misuse of the technology. The technology area is UHF wireless and the market sector is RFID systems.</AbstractNarration>
