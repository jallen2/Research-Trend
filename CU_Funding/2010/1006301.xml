    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Purdue University is to study structure-function relationship of phytoglycogen (PG) nanoparticles and identify key factors for engineering PG nanoparticle-mediated colloidal systems. Biobased nanomaterials have enormous potential in the areas of food safety and nutrition, drug delivery, personal care, and agricultural engineering. In this project, a new class of biobased dendrimer-like polysaccharide nanomaterials will be prepared from PG, which has a particle size of 30-100 nm and an exceptionally high molecular density. After being grafted with amphiphilic groups, PG can be used to form functional colloidal assemblies. An outstanding property of these assemblies is to protect and deliver lipophilic compounds, such as omega-3 fatty acids. The aim of this project is to reveal the native PG that will be extracted from the su1 mutant maize, fractionated, and subjected to chemical and enzymatic modifications. The properties of functionalized PG nanoparticles will be evaluated for their capability to realize enhanced oxidative stability and controlled release of lipids. Supported by this project, a teaching module 'Frontiers in Carbohydrate Design' will be developed and incorporated into the PIs' educational activities. This effort will greatly benefit the undergraduate and graduate students involved, as well as the industrial personnel attending the annual Carbohydrate Short Course at Purdue University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a carbohydrate polymer, phytoglycogen (PG), is extracted from a corn mutant and transformed into functional nanoparticles. PG is a dendrimer-like polysaccharide made from densely distributed branches. Phytoglycogen-based nanoparticles are digestible and biodegradable, which allows them to deliver bioactive compounds in physiological conditions. For example, these nanoparticles may protect lipid nutrients (e.g. omega-3 fatty acids) from oxidation and release them during digestion. At the fundamental level, this project will establish a new strategy for generating sustainable, environmentally benign, and economical nano-constructs that will benefit the areas of food safety and nutrition, drug delivery, personal care, and agricultural engineering. Supported by this project, a teaching module will be developed to introduce the cutting-edge development of carbohydrate science, including carbohydrate modifications, carbohydrates in food safety and nutrition, carbohydrate-based delivery systems, and carbohydrates and green chemistry. This module will be incorporated into educational activities in the campus for training undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the industrial personnel attending the annual 'Carbohydrate Short Course' at Purdue University.</AbstractNarration>
