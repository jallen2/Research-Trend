    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2010. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Samuel Diaz is "Cooperation and conflict in viruses during genetic exchange." The host institutions for this research are the University of California-San Diego and Yale University and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Lin Chao and Dr. Paul Turner, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic exchange occurs in some viruses and affects properties such as virulence and host specificity. This project uses social evolution theory to examine the roles of cooperation and conflict during genetic exchange, wherein referred to as "sex." In a process roughly similar to sexual reproduction, "sex" occurs in some viruses when genomic fragments mix during infection of a cell, creating progeny with fragments from different parental viruses. Laboratory studies have shown that depending on the density of infecting viruses, viruses can evolve strategies to exchange genetic material evenly (termed cooperation, as in sexual reproduction) or to bias genetic exchange in their favor (termed conflict, as in meiotic drive). This project uses natural isolates of the Cystoviridae as a model system to understand how viral reproductive strategies evolve in nature. These strategies play a role in the emergence of a variety of viruses and this study enhances understanding of genetic exchange in viruses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training goals include standard microbial isolation, plating, viral fitness assays, development of new genetic techniques, and theoretical and modeling skills. Broader impacts include mentoring McNair Scholars, a program proven to enhance undergraduate advancement. Outreach efforts beyond the campus walls involve high school students and teachers in the UCSD Early Academic Outreach Program and participation in the Science Matters public lecture series held at off-campus museums.</AbstractNarration>
