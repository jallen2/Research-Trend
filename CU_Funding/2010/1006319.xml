    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this grant is to conduct a workshop that brings together leading researchers from around the world, specializing in mathematics, operations research, economics, computer science, engineering, cognitive sciences, psychology, and other fields, to discuss fundamental scientific issues in creating Self-Optimizing Systems (SOS). The goal of this workshop is to formulate a cross-disciplinary research agenda to develop fundamental understanding and create a knowledge base for the design and control of SOS that are robust to unexpected failures or unplanned events. This workshop is expected enhance the fundamental knowledge base for SOS by promoting key advances in theoretical foundations and self-optimization approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this workshop will lead to the creation of a coherent scientific basis for research in SOS. This workshop will result in the development of a common set of theoretical frameworks, tool and technologies that would be available to a broad range of users to design next generation of engineered systems that can self-organize and perform efficiently in uncertain environments. These common principles and tools would allow coordinated self-organization at different levels of a system. This workshop will enhance our ability to address societal issues, for example managing large-scale infrastructure systems such as energy grid and water, and predicting natural-social phenomenon such as climate change, that result from complex interactions among large number of coupled natural and human sub-systems.</AbstractNarration>
