    <AbstractNarration>Mary Jane Acuna will conduct archaeological research at the southern Maya lowland site of El Achiotal located in northwestern Petén, Guatemala, under the supervision of Dr. David Freidel and Dr. Marcello Canuto. The site's primary occupation appears to have been between 400 BCE and 550 CE, the Late Preclassic period, and perhaps beginning earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 400 BCE. Preliminary explorations by Ms Acuna in 2009 revealed the presence of a sequence of architectural construction episodes in the temple locus of the site that reflect significant changes through time in the social and political status of the center, including the establishment of a royal dynasty. Evidence for royalty is painted on a mural that depicts royal insignia of divine kingship in a style yet unknown elsewhere in the Petén lowlands. Moreover, the iconographic representation suggests an affiliation with imagery associated with the earlier Olmec civilization of the Gulf Coast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El Achiotal's location to the west of the core area of Petén is perfect for understanding what relationship existed between early core Maya centers and frontier sites connecting the region with the western lowlands and the Gulf Coast. The Middle and Late Preclassic are critical periods in the history of emerging city-states in the Maya lowlands, and El Achiotal is likely to reveal exciting new data about the role that smaller frontier sites played during these changes. Alternative explanations about Preclassic political organization and its emergence are needed. The presence of a small site like El Achiotal with evidence for early kingship located in a strategic location along an important trade route provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the importance of the political economy in the consolidation of kingship. With its strategic location west of the core region and its unusual features, El Achiotal provides an opportunity to explore early Maya socio-political integration at a local and regional level. Ms Acuna's research will contribute to the theoretical models explaining the rise of socio-political complexity in the Maya area and help clarify how interregional relations influenced the artistic canons and political ideology that subsequently became widespread in the Maya region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both foreign and Guatemalan graduate and undergraduate students, will receive training in field methods and in the archaeological history of the region. In addition to the archaeological significance of this project, the work bears directly on the efforts to protect the rainforest in the region. The rapid deterioration of the Laguna del Tigre National Park, west of El Achiotal, resulting from modern settlement and eastern encroachment makes this project opportune. Archaeological collaboration with local populations will facilitate the dissemination of results and highlight the importance of cultural value and protection of cultural and natural patrimony, thus discouraging looting and deforestation.</AbstractNarration>
