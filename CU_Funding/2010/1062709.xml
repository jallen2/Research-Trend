    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of the project are to provide a research experience in combinatorics, number theory and graph theory for eight of the nation's most talented undergraduate mathematics students and to integrate these students into the research community at an early stage of their careers. The principal investigator and two graduate students who are program alumni will supervise the work. The program has a three decade history of attracting extraordinary students and has produced over 160 papers in well regarded professional research journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall 90% of the Duluth REU participants pursue a Ph.D. degree with 70% attending graduate school at a top institution. The most important impact of the Duluth program is the training of future generations of mathematicians who will foster undergraduate research when they become professionals. The Duluth program has served as a model and an inspiration for many other undergraduate research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program Web URL: www.d.umn.edu/~jgallian/REU.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
