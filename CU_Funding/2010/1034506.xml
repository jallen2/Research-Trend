    <AbstractNarration>1034506&lt;br/&gt;Desjardins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One approach to enhance the fuel atomization process is to capitalize upon the benefits of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) phenomena. There are many possible benefits to EHD aided atomization for combustion, such as smaller droplets, wider spray cone, and the ability to control or "tune" the spray for improved performance. The objective of the proposed work is to employ recently advanced, state-of-the-art numerical schemes to conduct direct numerical simulation (DNS) of EHD atomization and validate simulation results with experimental data. High-fidelity numerical simulations will employ recently developed adaptive interface transport techniques, coupled to a robust and accurate Navier-Stokes/Ghost fluid solver. A novel numerical scheme for EHD will be developed that incorporates both bulk dynamics and surface effects in order to achieve realistic predictions of liquid break-up and atomization. The combination of these numerical tools will permit full DNS of electrostatic-aided liquid atomization for high electric Reynolds number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: EHD flows and sprays have drawn increasing interest in recent years, yet key questions regarding the complex interactions among electrostatic charge, electric fields, and the dynamics of atomizing liquids remain unanswered. Combining recently advanced numerical simulation tools with validation experiments will permit exploration of EHD atomization with unprecedented detail. The outcomes of this research will be a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of EHD atomization, and a point of departure for robust modeling of EHD sprays using advanced numerical methods or reduced order models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Fundamental atomization statistics extracted from this project will benefit a large community by providing a theoretical foundation for new EHD model developments. Automotive and aircraft engines rely extensively on fine atomization of liquid fuels for complete and efficient combustion, and will therefore benefit from this research. The simulated flow visualizations and experimental results will be incorporated as pedagogical tools to support the graduate courses that both PIs teach. The experimental validation will be adapted for a hands-on learning module to support the undergraduate curriculum and K-12 outreach activities at the University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) Integrated Teaching and Learning (ITL) Program (itll.colorado.edu).</AbstractNarration>
