    <AbstractNarration>The massive release of oil from the Deepwater Horizon incident has been accompanied by the release natural gas, estimated at 40% the mass of the oil. Results from recent cruises to the area indicate that nearly all of the leaking gas is trapped at depths below 750 meters in the vicinity of the spill site. The impact and fate of this gas in the Gulf of Mexico is an important lingering question and the primary driver of this Major Research Instrumentation RAPID proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests MRI RAPID funding to acquire two cavity ringdown spectrometers for quantification of carbon isotope concentrations in methane and carbon dioxide, respectively. These laser-based instruments will be used to for quantification of hydrocarbon oxidation rates, for studies of microbial hydrocarbon uptake and conversion, and to aid in investigating the ecology of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria - all in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to provide meaning full data on the potential impact of dispersant use which is of broad interest. Several Gulf related experiments will benefit from this instrumentation. The PI has given over 50 interviews to popular media since the spill began in the Gulf of Mexico, and has been quoted extensively in TV, radio, newspaper, magazines and the Internet; such activities will be continued.</AbstractNarration>
