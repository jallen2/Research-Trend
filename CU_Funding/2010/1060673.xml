    <AbstractNarration>The Boscovich Physics Scholars Program at Seattle University provides scholarships to students working towards a B.S. or B.A. degree with a major in physics. The scholarships are based on both academic merit and financial need and are giving talented but economically disadvantaged students access to careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. They cover a student's unmet financial need up to $10,000 per year, renewable for four years for incoming freshmen, three years for sophomores and transfer students, and an additional year for students pursuing simultaneous bachelor's degrees in both physics and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is housed in a vibrant physics department that combines a rigorous program with a supportive and collegial environment. Boscovich Scholars enjoy close interaction with faculty, opportunities to participate in research of discovery, career mentoring for graduate school and job applications, and the Physics Opportunities Colloquium series, featuring physicists in diverse STEM careers. Students, staff, and faculty in the department form a tightly-knit intellectual community, engaging together in academic, social, and service activities. The supportive environment enhances retention, increases academic performance, and encourages scholars to pursue STEM careers. Graduates routinely go on to excellent graduate programs in physics, engineering, or mathematics or to STEM jobs in industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program supports the national priority of increasing the number of talented people in STEM fields. It particularly promotes participation by women and underrepresented minorities, and graduation rates in both of these groups are above the national average for physics degree programs. In addition to their excellent technical training, participants also benefit from a broad liberal arts education that emphasizes critical thinking, global awareness, and personal and social responsibility.</AbstractNarration>
