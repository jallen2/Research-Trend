    <AbstractNarration>The proposal aims to improve the quality of video communications, especially real-time video, over wireless networks for power limited devices. It is comprehensive in that it includes theoretical work, algorithm design, and testbed implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to study resource-constrained wireless video communication; the resources under consideration include bandwidth, power, and delay. The proposed approach is a novel delay-Power-Rate-Distortion theory, which provides a means to quantify the relationship among delay, power consumption, bit-rate, and video distortion. In this project, the PI will apply the proposed delay-Power-Rate-Distortion theory to cross-layer design that jointly optimizes the video encoder and the wireless communication component under total resource constraints; and develop a general-purpose testbed with implementation of the proposed algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ideas and approaches outlined in this proposal are expected to fill a number of important gaps in fundamental understanding of resource-constrained wireless video communication and will provide the theoretical underpinning for system design and algorithm implementation. The delay-Power-Rate-Distortion theory is expected to not only yield important principles in design methodologies for resource-constrained wireless video communication, but also to provide performance bounds for practical wireless video communication systems. The proposed design methodologies for video coding and cross-layer design will fill a critical void -- the existing mechanisms lack the capability of achieving optimal performance under total resource constraints. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The preliminary research has drawn attention from industry, which showed great interest in applying the proposed techniques to supporting real-time video over wireless networks. The integrated research and education program will train wireless, multimedia, and embedded system engineers, capable of coping with challenges of communication in the 21st century. Furthermore, the PI expects to use this project to inspire the learning processes and the discovery interests of the general public and students of all ages.</AbstractNarration>
