    <AbstractNarration>The Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) is a multidisciplinary project focused on the marine pelagic ecosystem west of the Antarctic Peninsula, one of most rapidly warming regions on the planet. The research will undertake a synthesis of zooplankton and micronekton data collected from 1991 through 2008 as part of this program, specifically to investigate spatio-temporal variability on multiple scales and to test hypotheses on the underlying causes of the variability documented. Data include community composition, abundance and biomass, from net tows and bioacoustic transects; and life history information for both Antarctic krill and the salp (Salpa thompsoni), the biomass dominants for zooplankon &gt; 2 mm. In addition, in situ rates of secondary production (growth, spawning and egg production) are available for the key species Antarctic krill. This zooplankton data set combined with the coherent multi-disciplinary data sets collected by the Palmer LTER is uniquely suited for studies of spatio-temporal variability and mechanisms underlying that variability, partially due to the fact that the time period spans three full cycles of recruitment in Antarctic krill and variability in primary production. Included are resources for multiple data base activities: completion of sample analysis and data submittal for the 0708 field season, interactions with the Palmer LTER information manager, and submittal to the LTER data directory of completed derived products as described above. Synthetic activities will formally establish collaborations with both national and international partners. In addition to published scientific articles, both raw and synthetic data will be archived with metadata. Such data are essential for ecosystem exploration, modeling efforts and ecosystem-based fisheries management underway in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Larval fish samples will be inventoried and shipped to the Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History to complete our effort to ensure the Palmer LTER zooplankton samples are available to other investigators in the future. Educational efforts include the training and mentoring of a graduate student (Master's level) and three undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
