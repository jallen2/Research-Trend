    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics at Texas State University plans to host an annual Combinatorics conference on April 24-25, 2010. The two-day conference is part of the CombinaTexas Conference Series, held annually at a different college or university in Texas since the year 2000. The conference program includes five one-hour invited talks delivered by internationally recognized researchers. These invited talks will cover recent results and open problems in the fields of Algebraic Combinatorics, Algebraic Geometry, Combinatorial Optimization, Computational Combinatorics, Quantum Graph Theory and Geometric Graph Theory, as well as applications in Network Analysis, Coding Theory and Protein Folding. In addition, the conference includes several sessions of contributed papers, a poster session, and social events to encourage communication and collaboration among participants. Special emphasis is given to the participation of graduate students and junior faculty in Combinatorics and its applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CombinaTexas conferences serve as the only regular gathering for the increasing number of researchers in the field of Combinatorics in Texas and neighboring states. The conferences provide a forum to foster scientific collaboration and to develop research networks among researchers from a large number of very diverse institutions in a large geographic region. In particular, these conferences enhance the experiences of graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs, broadening their mathematical outlook and helping them create a network of experts within their fields. The CombinaTexas Conference Series has become a major regional activity both, for researchers and educators. CombinaTexas will continue to broaden and diversify participation and to enhance the infrastructure for research and education.</AbstractNarration>
