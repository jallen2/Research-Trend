    <AbstractNarration>Midwest Verification Day (MVD) is an informal regional workshop, started by the PIs in 2009, with the goal of cultivating a regional research network in verification and formal methods. A chief concern is to provide a forum for students to present their formal-methods research in a supportive setting, and network with colleagues at other regional institutions. The program for MVD, spanning one and a half days, will consist mostly of student talks, but also include two invited talks by senior researchers. A social program is also planned, to encourage interaction among students and faculty. MVD is colocating with a local-chapter IEEE meeting on industrial formal methods, presented by industrial researchers from nearby Rockwell Collins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MVD will foster collaboration, student development, recruiting, and exchange of ideas in formal methods and verification, in the Midwest region of the country. Experience with similar events in other fields strongly suggests they play a crucial role in creating a vibrant regional research community, and offer invaluable opportunities for students. MVD will help develop talent within the region, and attract it from outside, in the industrially important area of verification. By connecting students with faculty from other regional institutions, MVD will strengthen opportunities for undergraduates to go on to graduate study, and help prepare regional graduate students for success in the international research community. The industrial connection with the local-IEEE meeting and Rockwell Collins will contribute to the long-term development of economically important interactions between industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>
