    <AbstractNarration>Noyce Abstract 1035322&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty-four secondary STEM teachers are being certified through one of three program options: traditional four year program leading to a BA or BS in mathematics or BA in biology; a two year MAT pathway for STEM professionals seeking a career change; and, a new fifth year MAT program (MAT5) for students who first wish to complete the STEM degree and continue for a fifth year to earn teacher certification. Projections are for the production of seven teachers via the traditional route, six MAT career changers and twenty-one MAT5 graduates during the five year program. The thirty-four Noyce scholar-teachers are in addition to the anticipated thirty new teachers to graduate without Noyce support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Noyce program builds on the existing Center for Educator Recruitment and partnership with College of Education Teacher Quality program, NetSCOPE. Connections to high needs schools have been established by NetSCOPE and provide Noyce scholars interaction with students, observation of classrooms and teleconferences with teachers and administrators in various school districts and opportunities to investigate research-based practices on working with diverse student needs. There are seven high needs school districts that are collaborating with the Noyce program: Cherokee County Schools; Chester County Schools; Fairfield County Schools; Lancaster County Schools; Union County Schools, York School District 1; and, Rock Hill Schools.</AbstractNarration>
