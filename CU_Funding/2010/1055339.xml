    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Mark Steinmetz of Marquette University for synthesis and investigation of biological activity of photoreleased anionic metabolites. The goal of the research is to develop a series of robust caged benzothiophene carboxamides that, when exposed to long wavelength visible light, will undergo a 6-pi electrocyclic ring closing reaction that simultaneously expels an anion of biological importance. This controlled release can be used to manipulate the metabolite levels, pH, and/or the redox states inside cells. The methodology can be extended to create photo-removable protective groups in organic synthesis and in the synthesis of bio-oligomers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include the multidisciplinary training opportunities for students, from organic synthesis to photochemistry and assessing the regulation of cellular processes via metabolic uptake. There are potential benefits to chemistry, biology, and medical science because of the generality of the methodology and the potential for temporal and spatial controlled release, for example, of ions across membranes through ion channels. Professor Steinmetz has an excellent track record of ethnic diversity in his research group.</AbstractNarration>
