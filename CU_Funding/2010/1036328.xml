    <AbstractNarration>The project builds on the synergy among creativity, self-regulated leaning, and motivation, and presents a new holistic conceptual framework of Self-Regulated Learning and Creative Problem Solving (SRL-CPS). The SRL-CPS conceptual framework is defined as learning and problem-solving processes and involves self-monitoring and self-correction of the following three common aspects: motivation, metacognition, and strategic action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will test the following hypotheses: (1) Problem-based Service Learning (PBSL) using engineering design as pedagogy could promote students' awareness of and demands for cognitive and metacognitive knowledge and strategies in self-regulated learning and creativity. (2) Scaffolding Creative Problem Solving in PBSL using question prompts could better facilitate under-served minority students' creative learning. The research will measure and compare the changes in students' academic dispositions, such as creativity, self-efficacy, problem solving skills, under the different proposed instructional scaffolding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Univ 100 Community Service Learning is required course at Jackson State University for all freshmen and will serve as the environment for the SRL-CPS study. The project will arrange student participants in Univ 100 into project teams for their service learning project. The scaffolding will be provided to students in the form of question prompts in various conditions as different intervention in the research design. The question prompts are categorized as metacognitive prompts, procedural prompts, elaboration prompts, and reflective prompts. The impact of different interventions will be determined by comparing the data from each scaffolding intervention group with the control group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to impact the creativity and problem solving skills of students from underrepresented populations. Further, this project is designed to bolster these students' perceptions of themselves as engineers and innovators. A working model for preparing students to be creative and innovation may result that is theory-driven and may be applicable in other disciplinary fields.</AbstractNarration>
