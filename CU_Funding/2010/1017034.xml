    <AbstractNarration>As seen by the proliferation of commercial-grade malware, attacking networked applications is a profitable enterprise. There are two advantages malware authors currently have against us. The first advantage is that because users run a diverse set of applications on their systems, anti-virus and anti-malware programs must exhaustively search for specific malware instances across all pieces of software on a system. Malware easily thwarts this through the use of polymorphism, metamorphism, obfuscation, and cryptographic packing, placing a financial burden on anti-malware vendors and a performance burden on their users. The second advantage malware authors enjoy is that while there are a lot of applications to attack, each software target is static across many client machines. As a result, malware authors only need to reverse and exploit a single instance of an application in order to compromise thousands of machines. This project examines two novel approaches for reversing the advantages held by malware authors. The first approach explores a white-listed execution model that extends integrity-checks beyond the operating system and into the running application in an on-line manner. The second approach explores the on-line, run-time transformation of applications in order to force a malware adversary to reverse and exploit a new application for each new client it wishes to compromise. Finally, the project aims to demonstrate the impact these techniques have on the cost of developing malware.</AbstractNarration>
