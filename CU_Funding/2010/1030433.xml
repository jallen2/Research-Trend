    <AbstractNarration>PI: Mark D. Regnerus&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Nicolette D. Manglos&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Texas, Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use qualitative data from Malawi and missionary archival data from London to examine the extent to which public political involvement by churches has been shaped by their role as increasingly prominent social welfare providers. It compares two types of churches: those that were planted in the missionary period and retain ties to foreign religious bodies, and those rapidly-growing Pentecostal churches that have been independently founded by local actors. The study has the potential to enlighten practical understanding of the effects of neoliberal privatization, as well as advance sociological theories of why and when religious groups become major political players. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The study will produce information for NGOs and foreign aid organizations on the actual extent of social welfare work already being done by local churches in order to inform program design. The historical information will also be provided as a useful resource to research participants and religious leaders for understanding what has worked and what hasn?t in engaging the state on behalf of their constituents.</AbstractNarration>
