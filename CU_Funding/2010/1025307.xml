    <AbstractNarration>Temperature sensing is critical for survival: animals must avoid conditions that would freeze or burn them and choose the best conditions for growth and reproduction. To achieve these goals, animals possess highly sensitive temperature sensors. However, the mechanisms by which these sensors operate at the molecular level are largely unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown whether differences in these sensors contribute to the adaptation of different animals to different environments. This research project,entitled "The molecular basis of thermal preference variation in Drosophila", addresses these basic questions by combining molecular, genetic and physiological approaches to study the thermal sensors of Drosophila fruit flies from different climates, ranging from temperate regions to the Mojave Desert. By comparing the molecular properties of thermal sensors from different fruit fly populations and examining how these properties affect behavioral responses to temperature, this study will provide fundamental insights into how thermal sensors respond to temperature at the molecular level and how these sensors contribute to variations in animal behavior. As closely related thermal sensors are found in vertebrates as well as in other invertebrate species, results from these studies will have direct implications for thermal sensing and behavior across a wide range of animals. In addition to the scientific impact, this project also incorporates an experiential learning opportunity for undergraduates, directly engaging students in scientific research examining natural variation in temperature sensing among Drosophila populations.</AbstractNarration>
