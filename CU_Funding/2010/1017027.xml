    <AbstractNarration>Software errors frequently arise because a component of the program does&lt;br/&gt;not correctly follow a well-defined protocol for accessing some stateful&lt;br/&gt;resource. Common examples include programs that misuse resource handles&lt;br/&gt;provided by the operating system, incorrectly deallocate the same memory&lt;br/&gt;or other resource multiple times, or fail to properly sequence calls to&lt;br/&gt;a complex program module. Such protocol violations lead to software&lt;br/&gt;crashes or unintended behavior, potentially with disastrous&lt;br/&gt;consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objective is to develop programming language technology to&lt;br/&gt;allows software developers to conveniently describe protocols over&lt;br/&gt;stateful resources. This technology will uncover such bugs at design&lt;br/&gt;time by statically checking whether the program is appropriately&lt;br/&gt;following the desired protocols, thereby ruling out the wide class of&lt;br/&gt;software flaws. The new language mechanisms will be general purpose,&lt;br/&gt;practical, and suitable for use in a wide variety of applications&lt;br/&gt;ranging from memory management to traditional protocol implementation.&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will create a compiler infrastructure prototype and&lt;br/&gt;establish the correctness of the approach by a machine-checked proof of&lt;br/&gt;type soundness. The primary broader impact of the project is the&lt;br/&gt;development of technology to help eliminate such programming errors&lt;br/&gt;early in the software-design life cycle to decrease the cost of building&lt;br/&gt;correct, reliable software.</AbstractNarration>
