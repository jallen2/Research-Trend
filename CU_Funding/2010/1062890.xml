    <AbstractNarration>This award to the University of Kentucky will provide research training to 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks each summer from 2012-2014. The program focuses on suburban ecology -the interactions between organisms and an environment that is heavily modified by human activity, with special focus on invasive species. Faculty researchers from five departments have designed a diverse array of projects for student participants. Students are expected to do full-time research as well as participate in a weekly lecture/discussion series covering topics such as the scientific method, responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, the interface between ecology and public policy, and post-graduate opportunities. REU students have access to activities and facilities at two ecological research sites and their individual mentor's laboratory. The program will recruit from diverse institutions using personal visits, traditional mailings, and a dynamic web presence. Students will be selected based on academic record, research performance, potential for research, and an interest in teaching science. Students will be tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influence of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://darwin.uky.edu/~erf/reu/ or by contacting the PI (David Westneat at biodfw@uky.edu).</AbstractNarration>
