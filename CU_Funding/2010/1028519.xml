    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is the development of low-threshold, high-switching speed, programmable/reconfigurable, single-mode nanolasers. The proposed transformative program will address important problems that pertain to nanolasers including electrical injection and tunability.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposed program are in the fundamental understanding of optical processes in sub-wavelength scale nanocavities, development of material growth techniques, and demonstration of nanolasers with following features: i) physical footprint 20-30 times smaller than state-of-the-art, ii) electrical injection, iii) wide tunability (tens of nanometers). The photonic crystal nanobeam cavities, based on an optical waveguide perforated with 1-D lattice of holes, enable efficient control of spontaneous emission at sub-wavelength-scale. Furthermore, their physical footprint is exactly the same as that of an optical waveguide, and therefore, they represent the smallest possible high-Q cavity geometry. Finally, by taking advantage of their flexibility, dynamical wavelength tunability over a wide wavelength range, with negligible steady-state power consumption, can be achieved. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed program is the development of techniques and devices for efficient light generation, collection, and localization, with applications ranging from optical and quantum-optical communication to life sciences and bio-chemical sensing. The program represents a unique interdisciplinary research and educational opportunity for students that encompass laser theory and design, epitaxial material growth, nanofabrication, and device characterization. An essential component of the program is outreach: the team members will continue their collaboration with Museum of Science in Boston, their involvement in the development of high-school physics curricula, and participation in Research Experience for Undergraduates program.</AbstractNarration>
