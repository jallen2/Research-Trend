    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop an enhanced pulse oximeter prototype ready for external demonstration. The key innovation of the prototype will be the Intelligent Data Extraction Algorithm (IDEA), which during Phase I demonstrated extraction of embedded hemodynamic information from photoplethysmograms, including left-ventricular stroke volume and cardiac output. IDEA will evolve in sophistication to increase diagnostic range and accuracy. Both extended evaluation and preliminary clinical validation studies will take place in order to assess the reliability of measured hemodynamic values and trends. Close interaction with doctors will help define clinical uses for this new technology. If successful, the final prototype will enable the noninvasive measurement of valuable hemodynamics with associated error bars (confidence intervals) including stroke volume and cardiac output. Other features include resistance to strong motion artifacts, continuous and real-time operation, and utilization of existing sensor hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to solve noninvasive measurement of valuable hemodynamics that cannot be met with current technology. During anesthesia, surgery, and recovery, our IDEA-enhanced pulse oximeter can track the patient?s hemodynamic evolution throughout, warning against possible adverse reactions or ?silent hemorrhages? that do not show up in any standard monitoring equipment. In the neonatal ward, it can monitor babies born with congenital heart disease or poor blood flow. At home, it can be used to monitor patients with chronic heart conditions (the top killer in the US) and warn doctors about developing acute problems such as arrhythmias and heart attacks. In the battlefield and disaster areas, our device can dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of triage to save the lives of injured soldiers and victims. Many other medical practices would benefit from the use of noninvasive and continuous stroke volume and other hemodynamic monitoring to expand the amount of vital information available at the patient care area and eliminate the need for risky invasive procedures.</AbstractNarration>
