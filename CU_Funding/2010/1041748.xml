    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program within the CHE Division supports work by Professor John F. Berry at the University of Wisconsin ? Madison to carry out fundamental studies of the redox properties of sulfur and selenium bound to transition metals. These studies will test the hypothesis that a new oxidation state of sulfur, subsulfide, can be stabilized by coordination to transition metals. This investigation involves examination of the electronic structure of previously reported sulfur/transition metal compounds, as well as newly designed compounds, using a variety of physical methods. Electrochemical and chemical reactivity of coordinated sulfur species will be investigated so that the electronic and chemical properties of the subsulfide ion may be elucidated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oxidation and reduction chemistry of sulfur and the nature of sulfur-sulfur bonding are critical to many important biological problems and new technologies. The development of subsulfide chemistry can have a long-term impact on the understanding of disulfide bond formation in proteins, and can potentially lead to new technologies such as new catalytic processes and dyes for photovoltaic devices.</AbstractNarration>
