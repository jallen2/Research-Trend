    <AbstractNarration>The most challenging problem facing creativity-based technology research stems from the multitude of hypotheses, concepts, descriptions, interpretations and definitions of what "creativity" means and how it can be described or modeled. It is understood and accepted that "creativity" holds the key to innovation, which can be defined as a qualitative jump from one level to another. It becomes obvious that research into "creativity" can only exist if it is seen as fundamental research and applied research at the same time. This is exactly the point where science, art and technology can intersect with the greatest benefit to all. This reciprocal interchange between science and technology and human creativity and innovation needs to be understood beyond discipline boundaries. To bring research and understanding of "creativity" to fruition for innovative approaches in science and technology and to reciprocally engage fundamental research in potentially non-scientific environments requires a truly open and cross-disciplinary framework. Initiatives supported so far in this area - drawing on research, development and production and spanning natural sciences, computer science and informatics, engineering and humanities including fine, performing and applied arts, educational science, psychology and philosophy - are promising and have yielded new insights. As these research projects by design and necessity have to cross academic and research boundaries, they need sustained support to enable, focus, coordinate and disseminate their activities and results within their own field as well as to other research outside of their more immediate scope. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this workshop is to define in concrete terms a platform that sustains cross-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary research, collaboration and exchange in the integration of quantifiable and qualitatively defined paradigms at the intersection of creativity, technology, research and innovation. This area of research can be subsumed under the heading of "creativity-based technology research and technology-based creativity research". In contrast to established platforms and network infrastructures to support the field in international arenas, there are few supported platforms - such as symposia, conferences, publications or internet-based resources - that are dedicated to establish communication and continuity in creativity-based technology research in the United States. Activities in this workshop will build upon results from prior NSF workshops in support of creativity-based technology research, and also upon research projects funded during the three-year tenure of the NSF CISE IIS CreativeIT program from 2007 to 2010. Objectives for this workshop are to: 1) Identify key issues in infrastructure needs to support creativity-based technology research; 2) Develop concrete plans toward the development, management and constituent involvement in a distributed network infrastructure for the sustained support of the field; and 3)Identify leading institutions that will move forward on proposals to possible supporting agencies and foundations. Based on these outcomes, the following actions may be defined: 1) Initial definition of a network structure of key institutions that can develop a proposal to the NSF and/or other funding entities to support the network structure; 2) Collaborative research proposals as an extension of existing research projects, which are currently limited to one center or to one sub-field where other centers may have complementary research expertise and capacity; 3) Commitment, timeline and structure of future tasks required to consolidate the initiatives coming out of this workshop with the goal of developing a network of centers, researchers and creative practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
