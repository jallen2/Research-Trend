    <AbstractNarration>Species delimitations are essential to many aspects of evolutionary biology, including systematics, conservation, and ecology. The goals of this research project are to test species delimitations in Hawaiian Pritchardia plants with molecular and ecological data, and to interpret the history of colonization and subsequent expansion of Pritchardia, one of the most species-rich plant genera in Hawaii. Pritchardia (Palmae) is an exceptional study system because of its economic importance, high endemism, number of endangered species, and numerous poorly understood species complexes. It is also a conservation priority for native species in the United States. Data from species ranges and habitats will add to baseline information on species that are included in the Plant Extinction Prevention Program of the State of Hawaii. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this study will provide critical data for conservation efforts and will be published and reported to rare plant conservation and management groups and the Department of Land and Natural Resources. Pritchardia is the seventh largest plant genus in Hawaii and this study will provide further evaluation of ongoing comparative studies including patterns of endangerment, speciation, and colonization. This research will also serve as a basis for a collaborative taxonomic revision of Pritchardia species.</AbstractNarration>
