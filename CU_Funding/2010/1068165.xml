    <AbstractNarration>Experiments on ultracold atoms are enabling us to learn about the quantum mechanics of collections of particles, giving insight into phenomena which is both intellectually stimulating and possibly applicable. This award supports a theoretical study divided into three parts: (1) The researchers will engineer a system which will allow cold atom experimentalists to "mock-up" one of the most important models of high energy physics: Quantum Electrodynamics. (2) The researchers will produce new insight into a classic model of condensed matter physics: the Hoffstaedter model. (3) The researchers will study how newly accessible geometries modify one of the most exotic phenomena from semiconductor physics: the fractional quantum Hall effect. These three studies all involve "gauge fields", and are woven together by a number of intellectual threads. The intellectual merit of the first topic is that opens up a new research direction, and paves the way towards using cold atoms to study models which are relevant to high energy physics. This is a novel, and potentially transformational, direction for cold atom physics. The second topic is fundamental, and has intrigued physicists for half a century. Not only does it have intrinsic intellectual merit, but the new capabilities of cold atom systems means that this physics is now experimentally relevant. The primary intellectual merit of the third topic lies in its importance for current experiments, which naturally involve quasi- one dimensional geometries. The third topic also naturally builds on important NSF sponsored theoretical work recently completed by researchers from the condensed matter community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award features several broader impacts. First, much of the work will be performed by graduate students, who will learn both physics, and the tools of scientific research. Second, the principal investigator is involved in an important project aimed at addressing the national shortage of high school physics teachers. He is active in Cornell's efforts to give undergraduate physics students teaching experiences, and helping encourage them to become teachers. Third, the principal investigator is involved in more general efforts to increase the numbers of undergraduate physicists trained at Cornell, with a particular interest in diversity issues.</AbstractNarration>
