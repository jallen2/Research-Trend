    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Harvard Forest that will provide research training for 11 weeks for 9 students during the summers 2010-2014. This award is also supported by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) program. The Harvard Forest Summer Research Program in Forest Ecology will enhance the ability of students to undertake interdisciplinary research and work with teams of researchers to collaborate on cutting edge projects. Teams of students and mentors will work to integrate empirical data with analytical and statistical models to investigate the impact of climatic changes on forest ecosystems. The research results will contribute to the development of practical forecasts of 21st century environmental change in New England and the eastern U.S. areas, and quantify the degree of uncertainty in these forecasts. Results are disseminated widely in senior theses, oral and poster presentations at regional, national, and international meetings, and in peer reviewed publications. In addition to their own research, students attend weekly research seminars and participate in workshops focusing on professional development including choosing and applying to graduate school, preparing scientific talks and papers, engaging in the discussion of the ethical conduct of research, and writing about science for general audiences. The program will actively recruit a diverse group of students from cultural and ethnic groups that are traditionally underrepresented in scientific careers. Applicants are selected based on an essay, letters of recommendation, and expressed interest in specific projects. There is no minimum GPA or prerequisite course requirement. An evaluation plan will assess participants' (1) acquisition and enhancement of scientific research skills; (2) satisfaction with the REU educational experience; and (3) post-program plans for education and scientific career development.
