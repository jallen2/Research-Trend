    <AbstractNarration>The "BRCC to LSU Engineering Pathway to Success" S-STEM Program (Baton Rouge Community College (BRCC) to Louisiana State University Baton Rouge Campus (LSU)) provides financial support for approximately 35 academically talented, financially needy students who have completed the Associate of Science in Engineering degree at BRCC and transfer into an engineering degree program within the College of Engineering at LSU. The specific discipline areas include nine engineering fields. The project is administered by the Office for Diversity Programs within LSU's College of Engineering, with collaboration from BRCC and oversight by an Advisory Panel. The focus of the intellectual merit centers around the project providing a model for blending the elements of recruitment, retention, and placement into an integrated, comprehensive but non-intrusive program that promotes student success in transitioning from the community college to a large state university (LSU). The broader impacts center around the project's focus on providing increased opportunities for a larger, more diverse population of students, non-traditional, underrepresented and first generation, to obtain a BS in engineering degree. Many students who attend BRCC do so for financial and/or requirement issues that prevent them from directly attending LSU as a freshman.</AbstractNarration>
