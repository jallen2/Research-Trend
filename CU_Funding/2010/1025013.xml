    <AbstractNarration>This award will cover participant costs for the 12th Symposium on Study of Earth?s Deep Interior (SEDI). The meeting will be held in Santa Barbara, CA from July 19 - 23, 2010. The funds will be used to support approximately 30 young researchers at US institutions to attend the SEDI meeting in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEDI is an international scientific organization dedicated to the Study of the Earth's Deep Interior. The primary research focus of SEDI is to advance our understanding of the past, current and future state of the Earth's deep interior and to explore the consequences for structures and processes observed at the Earth's surface. The 'deep interior' is broadly interpreted to include the core and lower mantle, but interest inevitably extends to the surface, for example, in the study of mantle plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth's deep interior, material properties at extreme conditions, structure and dynamics of the core and mantle, core-mantle interactions, and the nature and location of deep geochemical reservoirs, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will contribute to interdisciplinary education of US graduate students and young researchers by fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop-style meeting. The international format complements efforts by US national groups such as CIDER and will be useful to those funded under or seeking funding from the NSF CSEDI program. The structure of SEDI is intrinsically interdisciplinary, providing many opportunities for intra- and international collaborations on a broad range of topics that contribute to our understanding of the deep earth and other planetary interiors.</AbstractNarration>
