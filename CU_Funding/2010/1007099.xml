    <AbstractNarration>1007099&lt;br/&gt;Huang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Conference on Sustainable Water Environment was first organized by the PI and Professor P. C. Chiang of the National Taiwan University in 2005. The first five meetings were held mostly among the participating countries in East Asia, namely Taiwan (the First and the Second meetings), Japan (the Third meeting), Singapore (the Forth meeting), and Korea (the Fifth meeting). The 6th Conference will be a much expanded event by increasing participations from around the world, including Africa (Ghana, Egypt, and South Africa), Asia (India, China, Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan), Europe (Span, Germany, Netherland, UK), New Zeeland, Australia, and Brazil. Since the scale of US participation was relatively low in the past five events, the PI proposes to hold the 6th Conference in U. S so as to increase US participation at and strengthen its involvement with this important scientific gathering. Water is the most important natural resource. It is a necessary substance for the support of life, and there is no substitute for it. In the past decade, the drastic population and economic growth around the globe greatly have stressed the water environment at a scale not seen in many generations. Climate change has worsened the situation of water stress worldwide beyond what is currently happening. There is great urgency to learn the impacts of climate change on the water environment and how to respond to the impacts as to achieve sustainable water environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Conference will achieve the following three objectives: 1) to provide an open forum for the exchange of information on recent advances in sustainable water research and practices among countries at various stages of economic development; 2) to enhance public awareness on sustainable water environment, and 3) to form an international alliance on sustainable water research. Technical papers to be presented in the proposed conference cover five major technical areas of current importance in water: 1) impacts of climate change on the water environment, both natural and built, and responses to the impacts; 2) water conservation and reuse; 3) emerging contaminants, e.g., nanomaterials and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs); 4) integrated watershed management, and 5) aging and energy issues of water infrastructures. Information related to field and/or laboratory observations of temperature effects on water quality is scarce. Technologies dealing with mitigation of water quality affected by climate change are urgently needed in order to remediate impaired water bodies. Innovative technologies and forward-looking management systems are needed to conserve, recycle, and reuse "used" domestic, agricultural and industrial waters. For example, membrane technology and catalytic reaction systems are promising for the renovation of contaminated water. Understanding the fate, transport, and transformation of emerging contaminants, specifically PPCPs and nanomaterials in the aquatic systems hold the key to better management of water quality. A holistic approach to watershed management is crucial to the protection and deployment of natural resources while keeping the water environment sustainable. Renewal of national water infrastructures with energy-efficient systems is essential to sustaining water for the service of man and society. The proposed conference will provide insight into the core of water sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference will bring together water experts and professionals from around the world to discuss and exchange results of their research on water quality and resource conservation. Globally, the conference will facilitate the formation of a sustainable water network for dialogue and possible collaboration in sustainable water research among developed and developing countries. Nationally, the proposed conference will provide an opportunity for young scholars to exhibit and to showcase their research on sustainable water environment. Moreover, the results of a panel discussion on research needs for sustainable water environment will be useful to program development at the federal level. Additionally, the proposed conference will bring about broad public awareness on the importance of water and the need of sustainable water.</AbstractNarration>
