    <AbstractNarration>This project will continue work developing and using accurate techniques to calculate the properties of nuclei and nuclear matter. Quantum Monte Carlo techniques will be used to solve Schroedinger equation for protons and neutrons interacting via realistic two- and three-body potentials. The accuracy of the methods and this nuclear Hamiltonian are verified by reproducing and comparing the structure and response of nuclei to experimental results. The methods will then be used to predict the properties of nuclei that are difficult or impossible to produce and measure in the laboratory. These data are needed to understand astrophysically important systems and processes such as neutron rich matter, neutron stars, supernovae, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Superfluidity has major consequences in neutron star matter. We will use the same methods to study both the nuclear systems and the related phenomena in cold atomic gases. Many of the pairing and superfluid mechanisms important in nuclei and nuclear matter can be studied and verified in these systems where detailed experimental results are becoming available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quantum many-particle methods developed within this project have broad applications across many areas of physics. These include the nuclear physics aspects directly relating to the proposal, the cold atomic gas work, and electronic structure. The methods previously developed within this project have been applied in each of these areas. The goal of predicting the properties of rare isotopes can guide experiments and save valuable time and resources. The project will train both undergraduate and graduate students, give them exposure at national and international conferences, and provide for dissemination of the results.</AbstractNarration>
