    <AbstractNarration>The St. Louis STEM Scholars (S3) Academy is designed to increase the number of financially needy students seeking degrees in six science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The goal is to prepare students so they may complete associate degrees, matriculate to four-year institutions, and enter the STEM workforce. Experienced faculty and staff and industry partners support student recruitment and career placement and select sixteen S3 Academy scholarship recipients each year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This five-year project continues successful practices by: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Increasing the number of students receiving degrees in biotechnology, chemical technology, computer science, engineering science, engineering technology, and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Increasing the academic success of S3 Academy students compared to non-S3 Academy students. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Increasing the number of women, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities in the S3 Academy as compared to STEM students at the college. &lt;br/&gt;(4) Maintaining the S3 Academy community. &lt;br/&gt;(5) Strengthening college partnerships with academic and industrial STEM leaders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project advances knowledge and understanding within six STEM fields by providing scholarships and multiple support services, thereby increasing number of students studying and succeeding in these high-quality academic programs at the college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project prepares S3 Academy students to participate as scientists working together on task forces to solve problems; communicate effectively; and learn lifelong skills adaptable to workplace changes. The S3 Academy opens doors that otherwise would remain closed to many students. Through dissemination, the college aims to make the S3 Academy a model program for replication at community colleges nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
