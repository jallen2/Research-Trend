    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Karl Haushalter and Adam Johnson at Harvey Mudd College for three summers, commencing in 2010. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. Each year, a minimum of two students will be recruited from Mt. San Antonio College (Mt. SAC) -- the largest single campus community college in the state of California. Faculty from Mt. SAC will work on research, as well. The research projects span the sub-disciplines of chemistry, including analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, physical and theoretical chemistry. Sample projects include: (1) the study of the formation and control of nanoscopic two-dimensional structures in diblock copolymers; (2) the theoretical study of the electronic coupling element in electron transfer reactions and applications of density functional theory; (3) the study of the Claisen rearrangement in trimethylsilys substituted allylic alcohols; (4) the study of the DNA glycosylase initiated repair of covalently modified nucleosomes; (5) the study of the catalytic asymmetric hydroamination of substituted aminoallenes; (6) the spectral characterization of green surfactant phase diagrams; (7) the discovery of new secondary metabolites from endophytic fungi grown in co-culture; (8) the systematic thermodynamic study of a library of mesomorphic liquid crystalline compounds; (9) the study of dye-sensitized solar cells using porphyrin dyes on nanostructured zinc oxide; and (10) the biomimetic and bio-friendly synthesis of biologically-active compounds. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, with a special emphasis on communication. In addition to research, students will work with disadvantaged, first-generation college bound students affiliated with the Upward Bound program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in chemical problems of relevance in a broad range of chemistry sub-disciplines. Recruiting partnerships will be developed with a regional community college with a large population of underrepresented students. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
