    <AbstractNarration>This project explores a new frontier called Persuasive Sensing that brings together advances happening in two fields, namely sensor networks and persuasive technology. Today, advances in sensor networks are making it possible to capture, detect, and analyze data. However what is missing is to present relevant information mined from sensor data to subjects about their daily life and activity rhythms and using feedback mechanisms to alter human behavior. It is now demonstrated that human beings normally follow an approximately 24-hour fluctuating rhythm known as circadian activity rhythm. This is an exploratory research project to design and engineer such a prototype system. The data obtained from environmental sensors as well as body-wearable sensors are fused together to generate meaningful feedback to persuade end-users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is novel in several ways. First, the idea to fuse environmental sensor data that detects activity in space (or location) along with body-wearable sensors that collects physiological health data and utilize both to detect circadian activity rhythms has not be done before. Second, while sensor networks have been used in healthcare applications before, our persuasive feedback based on mining the data and benchmarking it against normal activity and the ability to detect patterns that identify onset of diseases or pathologies is novel. Third, the artificial neural network data mining algorithms that can identify patterns from circadian activity rhythms and then match those against a database of known rhythms will be a significant novel contribution. Finally, people are very different when taking suggestions. In order to achieve effectiveness, the system needs to monitor and learn from human reactions from previous suggestions and adapt. Broader impact includes the use of wireless sensor networks along with persuasive technology design that will open up new possibilities for prevention and help address chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Employing post docs and graduate students, this project will train and educate the next generation of workforce in Healthcare IT and integrate research findings into classroom. Findings from the research will be incorporated into a graduate level course at Claremont Graduate University.</AbstractNarration>
