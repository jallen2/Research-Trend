    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation of students in the 2010 Gaseous Electronics Conference related to Plasma Science that will be held on Monday, Oct. 4 - Friday, Oct. 8, 2010 at the Maison de la Chimie in Paris, France. The Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) is an annual topical meeting of the American Physical Society (APS) sponsored under the auspices of the Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (DAMOP). This year's conference will be held jointly with the Japanese International Conference on reactive Plasmas (ICRP). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEC has a strong tradition of encouraging and promoting student participation. The GEC has an enviable reputation of being the first conference that many of the leading members of the community presented their research results as graduate students. Student participation in this year's GEC is particularly important to the professional development of young scientists and engineers. With the GEC being held in an international venue, this may be the first opportunity for US graduate students to travel internationally to present the results of their research. As part of the GEC program, there will be tours of laboratories at several French universities and CNRS facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEC is the leading international conference in the science and technology of low temperature plasmas (LTPs) and collision physics (CP). The conference has been the venue of the first presentations on world leading developments in investigations of LTPs and CP, from lighting and lasers, to plasma materials processing and plasma-medicine. The invited speakers represent the world's leading scientists in LTPs and CP. This year's conference is expected to continue the tradition of their being presentations on the state of the art in plasma physics and engineering, and collision physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this award include the opportunity for young U.S. scientists to attend one of the most important conferences in their field held at an international venue. They will have the opportunity to observe firsthand the scientific and cultural diversity of the field, and establish what will hopefully be career long collaborations with their international counterparts. Special efforts will be made to support graduate students who are women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
