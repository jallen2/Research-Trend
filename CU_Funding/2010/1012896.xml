    <AbstractNarration>This award is made by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Chemistry Division and the recipients are Terry Bigioni and Jacques Amar of the University of Toledo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate the role of forces and kinetics that control the self-assembly of ligand-passivated colloidal nanoparticles. Experiment and theory working together are to advance our knowledge of nanoparticle interactions for assembling high-quality 2D films of different colloidal nanoparticles with a range of ligands and solvents. The vast majority of non-aqueous nanoparticles are ligand-passivated, yet no comprehensive theory exists to describe their interactions. By studying both sub-monolayer and multilayer growth, the interactions and kinetics that control 2D and 3D assembly may be elucidated. Epitaxy in a regime where cluster diffusion and coalescence are significant is attainable in these experiments, thus opening the opportunity to adapt epitaxial growth theory to the nanoscale. The generalization of interfacial colloidal self assembly promises to enable fast, inexpensive and facile patterning of nanoscale objects far exceeding the limits of conventional lithography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant impact reaches fields such as ultra-thin film coatings, catalysis, optoelectronics, sensors, and ultra-high density magnetic storage. Further, the theoretical and modeling strategies for assembling novel nanocomposite thin films and structures is a paradigm of materials design for a wide range of technologically relevant materials. This project provides educational opportunities by training graduate students, undergraduate students, high school students, and high school teachers in nanotechnology. The outcome of this research is used to enrich undergraduate and graduate courses, including the creation of new courses on microscopy, surface science and soft condensed matter.</AbstractNarration>
