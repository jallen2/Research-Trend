    <AbstractNarration>The SDCI/STCI PI meeting will bring together leading software cyberinfrastructure projects to discuss issues relevant to the community as we move into the future. This meeting will discuss the effective use of NSF middleware development projects by scientists and engineers so that researchers in a number of domains can make advances in their respective fields without being burdened by the interactions with the cyberinfrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will support the exchange of ideas among the current software cyberinfrastructure projects. It will potentially provide guidance on issues related to the development of robust software and to the problem of software sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will solicit participation from major science and engineering projects that rely on the national cyberinfrastructure for their computations and data management needs. Their participation will help ensure that the cyberinfrastructure software developed as part of SDCI and STCI projects will be relevant and broadly applicable to a number of science and engineering domains. The results of this meeting will then potentially guide middleware development and testing in the future</AbstractNarration>
