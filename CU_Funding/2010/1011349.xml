    <AbstractNarration>Chemical changes in DNA can alter the instructions that determine organismal development and function. DNA methylation is one important chemical change that may influence development in response to environmental cues. For example, in honeybees DNA methylation is able to specify an individual?s social form and function. It is hypothesized that DNA methylation is widespread among social insects and may play a general role in the evolution of specialized, social behavior. This research aims to compare the role of DNA methylation in the honeybee and the red imported fire ant, which have separately evolved parallel social systems. DNA sequencing technologies and methylation-sensitive enzymes will be employed to determine the extent to which the patterns and functions of DNA methylation vary in these two species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will highlight the processes that shape DNA methylation patterns in distinct social lineages and will contribute to a greater understanding of the molecular factors that affect gene activity. This will in turn lead to greater knowledge of the factors promoting the success of highly organized social systems. This research will also increase knowledge of the basic biology of the fire ant and the honeybee, the first of which is a serious, invasive pest and the second of which provides crucial agronomic services.</AbstractNarration>
