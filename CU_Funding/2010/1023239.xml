    <AbstractNarration>Imagine a situation where we could alter the outcome of an election simply by changing the number of offices on the ballot, the availability of candidates' political party affiliations, and the amount of dialogue between the candidates. We would like to think that voters would reach the same decision regardless of the campaign environment and the outcome of the election would not change, but this may not be the case. While most scholars have discarded the notion of a perfectly rational voter, one who is fully informed about the candidates and who compares the costs and benefits associated with each candidate, scholars still hold hope that voters can overcome their short-comings through decision strategies, such as heuristics (party labels) or confirming their notions about candidates enough to satisfy some minimal criteria. However, all elections are not equal. For exmaple, the November 2008 ballot in Boulder, Colorado included over 40 items on the ballot for which voters had to make a decision. In contrast, voters in Brunswick, Maine only had to deal with 7 items on the ballot. Likewise, some states hold non-partisan elections for positions such as the state supreme court, meaning that voters cannot rely on the candidates' party affiliations. In other elections, there is a lack of dialogue between candidates where a candidate will avoid issues that he or she is not comfortable with, making it more difficult for voters to compare the candidates' policy preferences. Yet, we still do not know what ramifications this has for decisions voters make.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fill this gap, the investigators examine how changes in the campaign environment affect how voters search for information. For the purposes of this project, three specific changes are explored: the number of offices on the ballot, the availability of candidates' political affiliations, and the amount of dialogue between candidates.</AbstractNarration>
