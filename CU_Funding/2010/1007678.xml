    <AbstractNarration>The investigators study statistical analysis of multinomial counts with a&lt;br/&gt;large number K of categories and a small number n of sample size. This&lt;br/&gt;"large K and small n" problem is a very challenging problem that requires thinking about statistical inference at a fundamental level. Employing an auxiliary data-generating approach to reason directly toward probabilistic inference , the PIs develop methods that are probabilistic and have desirable frequency properties. A sequence of topics to be investigated include 1) one-sample and two-sample "large K and small n" multinomial inference; 2) large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing; 3) application in genome-wide association study; and 4) associated efficient computational methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "large K and small n" multinomial inference is motivated by genome-wide&lt;br/&gt;association studies with a large number of genotypes from single&lt;br/&gt;nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data. SNPs are major genetic variants that may&lt;br/&gt;associate with common diseases such as cancer and heart disease. With new &lt;br/&gt;statistical methods and computing software to be developed in the project, the&lt;br/&gt;research is expected to generate useful tools for applied statisticians and&lt;br/&gt;scientists who are challenged by very-high-dimensional count data.</AbstractNarration>
