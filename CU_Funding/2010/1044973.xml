    <AbstractNarration>Multicore is now the default commodity approach to processor design; and research is actively exploring aggressive scaling and complex, heterogeneous approaches such as&lt;br/&gt;GPUs and hybrid GPU/CPU architectures. It has quite rapidly become essential to integrate knowledge of Multicore Computing into the Computer Science curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is seeking funding for planning and assessing development of a course called Multicore Computing in the Computer Science Department at Portland State University. The course is targeted to advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students, and spans traditional CS areas of architecture, operating systems, programming languages, parallel programming, and performance analysis. There is a pressing need for development of course related materials that can be widely and more generally useful.</AbstractNarration>
