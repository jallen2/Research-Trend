    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Arthur Stipanovic and colleagues from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry will acquire a console and probes to upgrade a 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The proposal will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) insect pheromone research, (b) NMR of cell wall polysaccharides, (c) NMR of natural products, (d) NMR utilization in biorefinery applications, (e) subunit structure and interactions in the stator domain of the vacuolar proton-ATPase of eukarotyic cells, and (f) novel biocatalytic structures for the sustainable synthesis of fine chemicals and biologically active substances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to follow the progress of chemical reactions, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solids and in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to carry out frontier chemistry related research and to train students in modern research techniques. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact on organic and bioorganic chemistry research at SUNY-ESF. The instrument will be available to users at other institutions including Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical University and LeMoyne College and for collaborations with regional companies. The resources will be used not only for research activities but also for research training of undergraduate and graduate students including those from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
