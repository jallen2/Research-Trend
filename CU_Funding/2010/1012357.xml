    <AbstractNarration>In this collaborative project, supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor David N. Beratan of Duke University and Professor Igor V. Rubtsov of Tulane University will develop methods to control electron transfer reactions. They will accomplish this goal by developing approaches to manipulate the strength of electronic communication within and between molecules; these electronic interactions influence the rates of electron transfer. The Beratan group will employ quantum and statistical mechanical theories to design, analyze and interpret inelastic electron-transfer kinetics in structures with bridge-localized vibrational modes. The goal is to develop interpretive and predictive descriptions of intramolecular inelastic electron tunneling in a variety of molecules containing an electron donor, a bridge, and an electron acceptor. The Rubtsov group at Tulane will develop ultrafast laser and multi-dimensional infrared spectroscopic methods to examine analogies between the double slit electron transmission experiment and the molecular electron-transfer problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will have a broad impact in developing intuition that may lead to applications in optical communication and solar energy harvesting. &lt;br/&gt;Professors Beratan and Rubtsov are promoting science education by providing summer research opportunities to economically disadvantaged and historically underrepresented groups. A new course cluster for first-year students is under development to examine the fundamental philosophical foundations of science.</AbstractNarration>
