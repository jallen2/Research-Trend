    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop an improved Open-Path FTIR Spectrometer for monitoring of atmospheric gases over extended distances. This will be achieved by developing a high-brightness infrared source that is heated to 2000 K by means of a diode laser. This will enable the instrument to be less bulky and expensive, and will have improved monitoring range over current systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be to provide a solution that will reduce several limitations that are found in current OP-FTIR technologies, namely, elevated capital costs, size, power requirement, and/or sensitivity. The approach will broaden the use OP-FTIR for monitoring atmospheric gases by EPA and ASTM methods, and these benefits may help implement this technology and make it applicable for other applications such as closed path FTIR systems.</AbstractNarration>
