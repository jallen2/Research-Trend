    <AbstractNarration>This NSF MRI Award funds the acquisition of a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) system at Ohio Wesleyan University. Through its endowed undergraduate research program, Ohio Wesleyan strongly supports excellence in undergraduate scientific research and research training. Students and faculty from the Departments of Botany and Microbiology, Chemistry, Geology, Physics and Astronomy, Neuroscience, and Zoology use the STEM in research, research training, student education, and outreach to area middle and high school students. Among the research projects using the STEM system are: efforts to understand how fungi can infect and kill bee mites without harming bees, humans, or honey; explorations of how feather-degrading bacteria affect the evolution of color and behavior in birds; visualization of microscopic features for descriptions of new species of parasitic nematodes; analysis of gonopodial structure in several species of Poecilia as it relates to reproductive behavior; and a range of other topics. In addition, the STEM is used in middle- and high school outreach summer programs that collectively attract 690 students annually to Ohio Wesleyan. The outreach programs promote science to students, including those from economically depressed areas of Central Ohio, reaching many young women and students from other under-represented groups. The results of the research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
