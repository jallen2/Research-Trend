    <AbstractNarration>Award: 1058049&lt;br/&gt;PI: Alexander Ramirez&lt;br/&gt;Title: A Workshop to Garner Broad Community Input on Cyberlearning and Cyberinfrastructure Workforce Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet the charge of a 21st Century cyberinfrastructure (CI) savvy workforce and citizenry, this workshop will bring together a diverse community of experts in order to establish specific recommendations on actions to support computational research and education activities that are cyberinfrastructure-based, cross disciplinary boundaries, use cyberinfrastructure to make revolutionary advances in the disciplines, deploy cyberinfrastructure-based technologies that enable innovative computational practices, and emphasize the central role of computation in all aspects across STEM disciplines in research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The framework, characteristics, and structure of learning are being greatly impacted by CI and the emerging computational sciences and engineering (CS &amp; E) fueling much of CI development. We are witnessing the emergence of CI-enabled learning, or cyberlearning, which holds tremendous potential, interest, and excitement for formal and informal education opportunities to work with and learn new ways of doing old things or new ways of doing new things, both essential in an increasingly competitive world. Education is no longer PK-20, but rather a lifelong endeavor affecting the general citizenry as well as future and current scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
