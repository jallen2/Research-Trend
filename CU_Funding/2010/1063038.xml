    <AbstractNarration>The Illinois State University REU offers an eight-week summer research experience for 8 pre-service and 4 in-service secondary mathematics teachers. Participants will explore research topics in discrete mathematics with emphasis on experimentation, formulation of researchable questions, careful reasoning and justification, and clear, precise reporting. An added emphasis will be placed on the development of lesson plans in discrete mathematics to be used in secondary school classrooms. The main objective of the project is to provide research opportunities for the participants, helping them become highly qualified teachers who can meet the national demands for increased student proficiency and who can adapt to the changing needs of our technological society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experience aims to fill a gap in current preparation of future mathematics teachers and addresses a national need for highly qualified teachers. Program content will help participants develop a 'big picture' of mathematics while the problem solving and discovery approach will allow them to experience learning in ways that align to current recommendations for mathematics instruction. Ultimately, teachers with a knowledge of and appreciation for mathematics research have the opportunity and ability to promote and develop mathematics as a potential career path for talented high school students. This program will continue to target minority and female students, typically underrepresented in mathematics research.</AbstractNarration>
