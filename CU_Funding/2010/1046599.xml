    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This proposal aims to address the need for cleaning the oil spill caused by an explosion of an oil-rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The proposed method is a rapid, straightforward, and economic solution to this problem involving novel, active, ceramic-nano-materials based systems which under exposure to the sun may take advantage of the vast visible spectrum of solar irradiation thus breaking down crude oil in water quickly and effectively into benign constituents that are safe for the environment and for the human and animal welfare. This work will provide new knowledge on how to use solar irradiation to clean-up contamination from organics that would be difficult to remediate by other means in a reasonable time frame with limited resources, and will train students and the public alike in responding effectively to an urgent need to protect the environment and sustain the quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The proposed research involves oxide-based photoassisted oxidation of organic pollutants (crude oil in salt water) and their decomposition to eco-friendly constituents, through the use of oxide photocatalysts that absorb in the visible range of solar radiation, for the fast and effective cleaning of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The novel synthesis of 3D nanogrids of the CuO/WO3 system is described in this work. Its targeted use to decompose oil spills simulants (such as benzene in sea water); actual oil spill-containing water samples will be evaluated. Prototyping of self-supported 'photocatalytic screens' for the remediation of large areas of water surface will be also explored. Training of students in state-of-the-art ceramic materials for remediation technologies is an important aspect of this project.</AbstractNarration>
