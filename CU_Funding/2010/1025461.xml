    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;#1025461&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks NSF support for the group participation of US academics in Fluidization XIII, the most prestigious international conference on fluidization, which, since 1975, has been held once every three years.US academia and industry have long played a dominant role in fundamental research and industrial applications in fluidization engineering. &lt;br/&gt;Fluidization XIII is managed by Engineering Conferences International (ECI), a global engineering conferences program and a not-for-profit partnership between the Engineering Conferences Foundation and Polytechnic University (USA). Due to the nature and prestige of the conference, the costs are prohibitive and beyond the affordability of most US academic. Therefore in this proposal, we request NSF $15,000 support for group participation of US academics (planed to equally support professors and graduate students) to help defer the high costs of conference, so that US representation in Fluidization XIII can be ensured. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main intellectual merit of faculty and students attending in Fluidization XIII conference is their participation in the most important and attractive platforms for stimulating the exchange of ideas from researchers all over the world in order to develop tools and theories for applications in the important area of fluidization with very broad application in Industries including energy, health care and food. The participation of US graduate students in Fluidization XIII will undoubtedly expand the horizons of their professional knowledge and offer fantastic research challenges in addition to facilitating student participation and interaction with the international communities. The conference, then, will be indispensable in nurturing student interests in career development in engineering and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal includes Faculty and Students participation in this conference which is a forum to exchange the new research and applications of Fluidization in the emerging science and technology. This participation will significantly enhance participant faculty and students knowledge and will positively impact their research in this area which funded by NSF or other US government agencies.</AbstractNarration>
