    <AbstractNarration>Existing Biologically Inspired Algorithm (BIA) approaches to Self-Organized (SO) networks lack a theoretical foundation and analysis. This work develops a framework to describe the types of problems that BIA can address in network control. First, this work establishes a theory of BIA network control. Here the PIs: a) broadly review the literature for BIAs that have been applied to solving control theory problems and develop a categorization of the methods; b) categorize the common problems in network control and the complexity of these problems; c) analytically demonstrate the potential of these BIAs in solving various network control problems; and d) formally describe BIA for control of wireless networks. Second, this work analyzes mutual interaction among layers in a BIA-based network. The PIs carry out an analysis of mutual interaction among layers in BIA-based networks. This includes a) analysis of interaction among layered SO-based control and b) establishment of a fundamental theory of layered architecture. Third, this work analyzes BIA-based control in wireless networks. Here the PIs conduct analyses of BIA-based control on wireless networks, to a) determine implementation issues of BIA-based control on real systems and b) perform a practical evaluation and analysis of BIA-based control through simulation and testbed implementation. This work is significant in that it provides a framing of BIA and provides a means for others to assess new approaches beyond wireless applications. The results of this work will be made available in conference and journal publications and through web sources.</AbstractNarration>
