    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to find new, generally applicable ways to facilitate the process of re-creating and modifying complex geometrical shapes that exist only in an un-structured, low-level format -- without a high-level description of its design process or of the techniques by which the original shape had been designed. The purpose is to speed up the redesign of engineering parts, consumer goods, or artistic items -- a process that often starts from a suitable precursor objects and then applies specific modifications to meet the new design objectives. An integrated system of extraction modules will be developed that turns a hierarchically flat geometry description, such as a boundary representation or a cloud of points, into a structured, higher-level representation, comprising a reasonable set of adjustable parameters. This higher-level procedural description then serves as a good starting point to introduce design modifications and enhancements. Given that the possible decompositions of a given geometrical shape are neither obvious nor unique, and the generic underlying forms may be obscured by added-on surface details or by noise from a scanning process, and that the best procedural description for a given object depends strongly on the intended design modifications,the designer will be included in this Inverse 3D Modeling process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will result in a new approach to shape design for many diverse application domains. The use of appropriately parameterized descriptions as a starting point will make re-design efforts more efficient and thus reduce time to market for the revised product. The availability of such Inverse 3D Modeling tools for re-design purposes will enhance the competitiveness of any industry branch that employs them. Moreover, understanding the fundamental operations used to generate a model, and exposing those operations in a flexible, generative way, also enhances the creative process itself. A wider impact of the envisioned modular Inverse 3D Modeling system lies in education. This approach will be used in courses on geometric design and modeling, thereby exposing students quickly to several different ways of understanding a given shape from the point of view of generating it procedurally. This broadens the experience of the students and gives them a rich repertoire of approaches to draw from, when they are faced with novel modeling tasks. Outreach activities will also focus on high-school students, who will make use of this fun computer tool to increase interest in science and engineering, and, hopefully, influence the students' career choices.</AbstractNarration>
