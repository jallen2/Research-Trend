    <AbstractNarration>Project Director: Peter Goodwin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: EPS-1049614&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Idaho&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: 22nd National EPSCoR Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Idaho EPSCoR is hosting the 22nd National EPSCoR Conference in Coeur d?Alene, Idaho on October 24-27, 2011. The purpose of the conference will be to showcase the EPSCoR jurisdictions? contributions to the nation?s science, engineering, and economic competiveness, and to explore directions for enhancing future contributions through partnerships among the jurisdictions. The conference theme will be Building New Inter- and Intra-jurisdictional Partnerships. Session topics will be based on the strengths and commonalities of the jurisdictions? science and technology initiatives, and how partnerships of the future can be enabled by cyberinfrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The conference seeks to identify opportunities for and barriers to enhancing research and education partnerships among EPSCoR jurisdictions. Conference sessions and discussions will be centered on the topics of water and energy due to the importance of these natural resources to the economy of the EPSCoR jurisdictions and the nation (Note: Sixteen of the twenty-nine EPSCoR jurisdictions have Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-1 projects with significant research emphasis on water resources and/or energy). The conference will explore how extensive EPSCoR knowledge and research infrastructure can be better leveraged to accelerate knowledge discovery, and how research infrastructure and its data streams can better contribute to the national research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The conference aims to showcase the contributions of EPSCoR jurisdictions to the nation?s science, engineering, and economic competitiveness. In addition, the conference seeks to provide a forum in which a broad range of stakeholders, including state legislators, members in academe, and private sectors can interact. These stakeholders will have opportunities to increase their understanding of the vision and values of EPSCoR and use that understanding to develop additional mechanisms for generating inter-jurisdictional and international partnerships. Conference sessions will also seek to foster innovative avenues for enhancing STEM-based education for all, with particular attention to underrepresented minorities (URM) students and those from rural communities</AbstractNarration>
