    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The proposed CAREER program involves modeling and control of neuronal networks in the brain and its application to the treatment of Parkinson?s disease (PD) using deep brain stimulation (DBS). Specific objectives are to: (i) construct a general approach for modeling complex neuronal networks where interactions occur between different brain nuclei, (ii) design computationally efficient control strategies for such networks, and (iii) apply these methodologies to the problem of restoring pathological network dynamics arising from PD with DBS. Success of the program will fundamentally impact the interface between control systems and neuroscience and create new opportunities for medical treatment of neurological disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The work introduces a systems theoretic framework to (i) understand electrophysiology and pathophysiology of neuronal networks and the impact of DBS control, and (ii) design and explore new DBS strategies to treat PD with extensive simulation before experimenting on animals and translating to patients. The modeling framework will eventually lead to safer and potentially more therapeutic DBS for PD. The ultimate vision is to apply this transformative methodology to other neurological disorders (Dystonia, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorders), impacting millions of patients worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed plan will also impact education at all levels. It includes developing a new course for senior undergraduate and graduate students on modeling and DBS control of neural systems, and reaching out to women of all ages with unique workshops and internship opportunities. Finally, engineering students will be given the opportunity to perform electrophysiological experiments with collaborator at the Cleveland Clinic.</AbstractNarration>
