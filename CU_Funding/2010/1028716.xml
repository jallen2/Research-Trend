    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to help bring closer to reality the inevitable merger of optics and electronics, or in material terms, the union of silicon and III V materials on a platform for the next generation of information technology. Specifically, it involves the use of some of the more subtle aspects of guided wave optics to realize spatial control of information-bearing optical beams in crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to extend the concept of adiabatic transitions to the optics and communications fields. For years, adiabatic transitions have played a key role in physics and, more recently, chemistry. If successful, the proposed work could have a significant impact on the U.S. optoelectronics industry, contributing to both employment and well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carrying out the proposed research requires the training of graduate students in diverse areas such as electromagnetic modal theory and semiconductor device fabrication. Graduate students engaged in this research will be exposed to ahead-of-state-of-the-art theoretical and fabrication tools. Undergraduate students will be incorporated in the project through Caltech's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program. Results and discoveries from this project will be shared with the scientific and technological communities through journal publications, conference presentations, and seminars.</AbstractNarration>
