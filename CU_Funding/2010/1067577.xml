    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Giovanni Bennardo (Northern Illinois University) will organize a 3-day workshop entitled "Cultural Models of Nature and the Environment: Self, Space, and Causality" to be held on the campus of Northern Illinois University. The goals of the workshop are to (1) examine the existing literature about the conceptualization of nature and the environment in primary food producers in 15 cultural areas; (2) obtain from these data a number of cultural models about nature and the environment in each of these cultures; and (3) synthesize the results for a new research project whereby the results of the workshop are used as the building foundation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The populations keenly aware of and most at risk to the effects of climate change are obviously those whose livelihood depends on daily contact with the changing physical environment, that is, primary food producers. The workshop pursues a deeper understanding of their cultural models of nature and the environment as well as the distribution of such models within the targeted communities. Thus, the workshop will make a contribution to the expanding literature on cultural models and impacts of climate change. The intent of the organizer and of the participants is to investigate further the cultural models developed during the workshop by the acquisition of cross-cultural comparative ethnographic and experimental data. An important goal is to comprehend the manner in which the interaction between space and self contributes to the generation of cultural models.</AbstractNarration>
