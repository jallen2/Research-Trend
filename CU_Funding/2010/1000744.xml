    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to create new computer aided design (CAD) methodologies for modeling and design of electronic systems exposed to electromagnetic interference (EMI). EMI continues to be a key design challenge as it could lead to severe reliability issues in modern electronic products. The methodologies offer a generalized perspective in terms of analyzing EMI coupling scenarios faced by electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) design engineers. The underlying framework is broad-based and can be applied to the EMC design of a wide range of electronic systems. The research formulates system-level modeling approaches, which allow optimized selection of different CAD models for different sub-systems, e.g. batteries, cables, and large enclosures. Circuits and structures representing typical EMI scenarios will be designed, fabricated, and tested, to validate the CAD methodologies, identify limitations and demonstrate reliable EMC solutions. Deliverables include system-level CAD methodologies, subsystem-level neural network and statistical models, well-documented research results, a project website, and state-of-the-art curriculum for industry engineers and university students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will have both scientific and educational impact. The research advances the fundamental design practices, e.g. design of highly-overmoded aircraft and automotive structures, with a potential for breaking the barriers in terms of simulation accuracies, speeds, and other capabilities. CAD techniques enabled by this research will offer significant cost and time reduction in engineering innovative and reliable electronic products. The research outcomes will lead to industry-oriented curriculum components at The University of Toledo and at Oklahoma State University. Engineering students and postdoctoral fellows will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in research. Through a constantly updated website, efforts will be made to offer equal opportunities to students belonging to minority and underrepresented groups. The website will also enhance the public awareness on various aspects of EMI/EMC.</AbstractNarration>
