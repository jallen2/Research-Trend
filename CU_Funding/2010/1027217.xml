    <AbstractNarration>This Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) project at Florida State University (FSU) is providing two-year scholarships to forty graduate students enrolled in computer science graduate degree programs with an information assurance focus. The students are being awarded scholarships in four cohorts of ten students each and the project includes activities to reinforce and invigorate the cohort structure. Through a formal relationship with Florida A&amp;M University, the project is making a focused effort to recruit students from underrepresented groups into the program and has academic support programs to foster their success. FSU has received the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security (NSA/DHS) Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) designation and the NSA/DHS Center of Academic Excellence in Research designation. The project includes an assessment and evaluation plan coordinated by an independent evaluator to ensure that the project achieves its objectives. The project's results are being disseminated through conference and professional presentations.</AbstractNarration>
