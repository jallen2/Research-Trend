    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to examine the role that political parties and interest groups play in the selection of state supreme court justices. This research will examine an array of different campaign activities to determine whether the involvement of parties and interest groups varies depending on the type of selection system, the competitiveness of the race, the broader political environment, and the type of group. This project will survey political parties, interest groups, and court candidates to determine the type and level of involvement of parties and interest groups in the selection of state supreme court justices. This data will help to clarify how the selection process affects the impartiality, independence, and accountability of state supreme court systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars, policymakers, and the public have long debated whether state supreme court justices should be elected or appointed, and if the former, what type of election system is preferable. This debate is often framed as a fundamental dichotomy between judicial independence and judicial accountability, the former usually associated with judicial appointment, the latter with judicial election. However, despite the rapidly expanding research in this area, it is still not well understood to what extent political parties and interest groups have become involved in selecting justices, though their participation implicates both accountability and independence. The findings from this project will contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of judicial elections.</AbstractNarration>
