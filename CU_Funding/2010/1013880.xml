    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an integrated carbon nanotube (CNT) cold cathode structure for high power vacuum electronic devices including x-ray sources and microwave tubes. This project will utilize a proprietary CNT electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technology and advanced micro-fabrication techniques. It is expected to demonstrate the integrated CNT cathode with one or few pixels and establish the road map for development and production of multi-pixel cathode structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a CNT cold cathode structure with more reliable performance for high-power and high-current applications, significantly reduced cost and improved manufacturing consistency and reliability. The CNT based field emission x-ray technology has the potential for applications in diagnostic medical imaging, radiation therapies, homeland securities and industrial inspections. Currently, the wide deployment of CNT cold emission cathode depends critically on the reliable mass production of low-cost integrated CNT cathode structures, which will be addressed by this project.</AbstractNarration>
