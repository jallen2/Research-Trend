    <AbstractNarration>Technical merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the organization and teaching of a five-day short course for graduate students and other early career scientists on the opportunities and challenges in the processing and analysis of much increased volumes of time series data. The primary goal is to inspire a new set of leaders who are more able to exploit the large volumes of data coming from the NSF's EarthScope program. The emphasis of the short course is on seismic data from USArray. The short course is held at Northwestern University in August of 2010 and builds upon and draws from an earlier short course on these themes, which was held in the summer of 2009. The PIs are designing and delivering the program in collaboration with USArray and IRIS and a small number of guest instructors. The course takes place in a computer laboratory in the main library of Northwestern University. The curriculum includes lectures followed by hands-on exercises, and finishes with student group projects carried out during the five days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project directly addresses issues of human infrastructure through workforce development. The top short-term goal of this project is training of the next generation of seismologists in 1) the use of the best current generation data analysis tools and 2) feeling empowered to further develop the tools currently available to the seismological community. This project represents a community-based approach to specialized educational content. We intend to collect and share the student projects through a student-designed and -maintained wiki. Course materials will be also organized and posted to the web in collaboration with the Education and Outreach Program of the Incorporated Research Institutions or Seismology.</AbstractNarration>
