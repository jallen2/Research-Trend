    <AbstractNarration>This REU site engages 11 undergraduate students in the key elements of research on sustainable land and water resources that are essential to improving management practices, with a focus on the interdisciplinary nature of this research. Students work on one of three teams on projects that integrate the Earth-surface dynamics, geology, ecology, limnology and paleolimnology, and hydrology principles and techniques required for sustainable land and water management and restoration. They will use an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods. One team will focus on stream restoration-related experimental work at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, one team will examine the effects of surface water management practice on groundwater resources in Montana, and one team will investigate paleolimnology and current habitat conditions of wild rice lakes in northern Minnesota. An All-Team Gathering at the conclusion of the program will expose all students to laboratory experiments at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory and include an ethics program that considers student research in the context of the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global climate change and associated impacts on our national waterways has led to new pressures for the development of excellence in land and water resource management. This is true to an even greater extent on Native American reservations; which deal with complicated resource management issues and lack young Native American scientists to meet current needs. Both researchers and practitioners need, now more than ever, to understand physical and ecological processes in quantitative ways that form a firm foundation for predictive approaches to resource management. Through participation in one of three teams, all students leave this REU with a robust understanding of the quantitative predictive research and management approach critical to sustainability of land and water resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students from groups underrepresented in the Earth sciences are the major focus of our recruiting efforts, and will comprise at least 75% of the students in the program. In addition, students will be prepared for careers in land and water resource management in the U.S. in general, and specifically related to Native American reservations.</AbstractNarration>
