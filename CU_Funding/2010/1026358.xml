    <AbstractNarration>1026358&lt;br/&gt;Hofmann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: U.S.-New Zealand Dissertation Enhancement: Biochemical Consequences of Ocean Acidification on Larval Development in a Temperate Sea Urchin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a doctoral dissertation enhancement project between Dr. Gretchen Hofmann and her student Paul Matson in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Dr. Mary Sewell in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Ocean acidification (OA) is expected to be one of the most pervasive impacts of global climate change on marine systems. While calcifying organisms are predicted to be at greatest risk from decreased ocean pH, many other taxa may be at risk, particularly during environmentally sensitive early life-history stages. The project will investigate the impacts of ocean acidification on the physiology and biochemistry of larval sea resources during larval development. Lipids represent the primary energy source fueling larval development in a large number of marine taxa. The abundance of particular classes of lipids such as triglyceride, an energy storage lipid, can be a useful metric of physiological state. The rate at which these lipids are utilized during development may also provide useful information regarding larval metabolism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is sufficient overlap of interests between the University of California and the University of Auckland to indicate that they can successfully pursue the activities proposed and that the interaction will benefit both sides. Results from this research will increase our knowledge regarding the potential costs of developing larvae in an acidified ocean, and what impacts it may have on populations in near-future climate change scenarios. It will also provide useful insights into changes in metabolism. This research will provide the US graduate student an excellent opportunity to receive a global research experience. It is anticipated that he will maintain contacts and collaborations with the New Zealand researchers and students throughout his career</AbstractNarration>
