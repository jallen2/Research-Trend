    <AbstractNarration>With the nationwide shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs), practices are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver two vital and conflicting patient-centered metrics: 1) Timeliness i.e. ensuring patients get access to care as quickly as possible; 2) Patient-physician continuity, i.e. ensuring patients see their own PCP as much as possible. This proposal will develop new stochastic optimization approaches for addressing timeliness and continuity through the lens of physician flexibility - the ability of a physician to see patients of other physicians. Physicians in primary care are inherently flexible; however, the management and efficient use of this flexibility has to consider the balance between timeliness and continuity. The research will explore the design and optimal use of flexibility at different but interlinked levels of the capacity planning hierarchy involving two streams of uncertain demand, non-urgent and urgent, each with different timeliness and continuity requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results will be used to develop optimal policies and insights on capacity allocation and dynamic patient scheduling under different flexibility configurations, as well as to develop heuristics that can be easily implemented in practice. Since primary care has the broadest possible reach, improved access and continuity has the potential to benefit the population as a whole. Furthermore, the findings should be applicable to other healthcare and general service settings where timeliness and continuity are essential. Close collaboration with a primary care physician trained in operations research and a wide range of clinics, rural and urban, academic and non-academic, will ensure the quick transfer of results. The case study of a community clinic in Western Massachusetts will be used to disseminate research findings in undergraduate and graduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
