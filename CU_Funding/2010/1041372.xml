    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this symposium is to bring together the researchers from around the world working on fundamental issues and applications that are critical to furthering the understanding of bulk metallic glasses. Experimental as well as theoretical and computational efforts have been made that promise to uncover new details of glass formation, deformation mechanisms, and basic phenomena in transport, phase transitions, magnetic properties, corrosion, dynamic response, and fracture mechanics. Topics of interest include: 1. Applications and prototyping of BMGs including customer requirements, systems issues in incorporating metallic glasses, alloy design issues and process design; 2. New alloys and the principles needed for the physical and mechanical design of alloys; 3. Structure-property relations for BMGs including mechanical characterization and mechanisms of mechanical behavior and flow; 4. Glass forming ability and relations to properties including diffusion and devitrification kinetics; 5. Processing methods and opportunities; 6. Theories and modeling of glass forming liquids and BMGs including ab initio methods for property prediction, MD simulations, the physics of collective interatomic behavior and continuum techniques and constitutive property design.</AbstractNarration>
