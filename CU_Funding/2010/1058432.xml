    <AbstractNarration>The University of California San Diego (UCSD) proposes a planning grant to&lt;br/&gt;build the Partnership for Expanding "Exploring Computer Science" (PEECS)&lt;br/&gt;with the goal of increasing the number of underrepresented minority and&lt;br/&gt;female students from San Diego County that graduate from high school&lt;br/&gt;interested in and prepared to pursue college majors in computer science and&lt;br/&gt;related fields. PEECS was inspired by the BPC Alliance, "Into the Loop," which&lt;br/&gt;introduced a new course, "Exploring Computer Science" (ECS), in the Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;Unified School District. ECS is an introductory course that could be a&lt;br/&gt;steppingstone to Computer Science Principles, the proposed new Advanced&lt;br/&gt;Placement (AP) course. These two courses have the potential to transform&lt;br/&gt;high school education in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CS Principles course is being piloted at UC San Diego this year. Together&lt;br/&gt;with the facts that "Into the Loop" personnel live in the San Diego region,&lt;br/&gt;there are close ties between the UCLA and UCSD campuses, UCSD Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;is already involved in revamping their freshman curriculum, and UCSD's San Diego&lt;br/&gt;Supercomputer Center (SDSC) has a well-established technology and computational&lt;br/&gt;science professional development program for pre-college teachers (SDSC&lt;br/&gt;TeacherTECH), this puts San Diego at the right time and place for a major&lt;br/&gt;overhaul of its high school computer science programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PEECS proposes to pave the way for a successful expansion and adaptation of&lt;br/&gt;ECS into a new region, San Diego County. There, multiple school districting&lt;br/&gt;structures, policies, processes, and academic community cultures present their&lt;br/&gt;own new challenges to change. Experiences gained in adapting the ECS program&lt;br/&gt;to the diverse needs of the San Diego region will provide valuable lessons as&lt;br/&gt;the wider dissemination of ECS and CS Principles goes forward. This planning&lt;br/&gt;grant will bring together the important stakeholders to develop the necessary&lt;br/&gt;partnerships and directions for this effort.</AbstractNarration>
