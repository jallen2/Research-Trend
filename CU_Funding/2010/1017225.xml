    <AbstractNarration>The Semantic Web is based on describing the meaning ? or&lt;br/&gt;semantics ? of data on the Web by means of metadata ? data describing&lt;br/&gt;other data ? in the form of ontologies. The World Wide Web Consortium&lt;br/&gt;(W3C) has made several recommended standards for ontology languages&lt;br/&gt;which differ in expressivity and ease of use. Central to these&lt;br/&gt;languages is that they come with a formal semantics, expressed in&lt;br/&gt;model-theoretic terms, which enables access to implicit knowledge by&lt;br/&gt;automated reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress in the adoption of reasoning for ontology languages in&lt;br/&gt;practice is currently being made, but several obstacles remain to be&lt;br/&gt;overcome for wide adoption on the Web. Two of the central technical&lt;br/&gt;issues are scalability of reasoning algorithms, and dealing with&lt;br/&gt;inconsistency of the ontological knowledge bases. These two issues&lt;br/&gt;are being addressed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scalability issue has its origin in the fact that the expression&lt;br/&gt;of complex knowledge requires sophisticated ontology languages, like&lt;br/&gt;the Web Ontology Language OWL, which are inherently difficult to&lt;br/&gt;reason with ? as witnessed by high computational complexities, usually&lt;br/&gt;ExpTime or beyond. This project builds on recent new developments in &lt;br/&gt;polynomial time languages around OWL in order to remedy this. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, in this project efficient algorithmizations and tools are &lt;br/&gt;developed for the largest currently known polynomial-time ontology language, &lt;br/&gt;called ELP. Reasoning with knowledge bases with expressivity beyond ELP is&lt;br/&gt;enabled through approximating these knowledge bases within ELP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inconsistency issue has its origin in the fact that large knowledge&lt;br/&gt;bases, in particular on the web, are usually not centrally engineered,&lt;br/&gt;but arise out of the merging of different knowledge bases with&lt;br/&gt;different underlying perspectives and rationales. &lt;br/&gt;In this project tools are developed for efficient, i.e., &lt;br/&gt;polynomial-time reasoning with inconsistent ontologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concrete outcome of the project is an open source reasoning&lt;br/&gt;system which is able to reason efficiently with (possibly)&lt;br/&gt;inconsistent knowledge bases around OWL, in at least an approximate&lt;br/&gt;manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page at &lt;br/&gt;http://knoesis.wright.edu/faculty/pascal/projects/tron.html</AbstractNarration>
