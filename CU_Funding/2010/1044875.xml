    <AbstractNarration>This project will make use of challenge-based learning activities in a comprehensive redesign of the first thermodynamics course (FTC). Challenge-based activities will be carefully crafted to support students as they develop deep conceptualizations of entropy and available energy by seamlessly coupling micro and classical scales of thermodynamics so that they are equipped to design and develop tomorrow's state-of-the-art energy technologies. Each challenge-based learning module will both integrate several thermodynamic concepts and foster independent and group research and problem solving among students. Further, most learning modules are oriented around comparisons of energy conversion technologies and will support students as they explore theoretical analyses and practical applications of these technologies. Student learning in this transformed course will be evaluated in several ways, including comparison with traditional students in a second thermodynamics course. Materials for teaching the transformed course will be reviewed by an external advisory board composed of members from industry and academe. In addition to offering broader impact in the way of better preparing next generation engineers with improved understanding of thermodynamics and energy related issues, the comprehensive course redesign will: 1.) influence many engineering students across several disciplines (e.g., mechanical, petroleum, civil, and nuclear engineering); 2.) use challenge-based learning modules in the course redesign, which emphasize problem/challenge-based approaches to conveying concepts that will improve student learning, success, and retention, including among underrepresented students; and 3.) make use of multiple dissemination mechanisms such as an advisory board with members from industry and academe, a project web site, journal articles, conference presentations, and active engagement with ME department heads.</AbstractNarration>
