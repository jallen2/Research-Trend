    <AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator: Joseph T Hupp&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Gordon Research Conferences&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: 1060462&lt;br/&gt;Title: Renewable Energy: Solar Fuels GRS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support for the Graduate Research Seminar (GRS), to be held immediately preceding the Third Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Renewable Energy: Solar Fuels. The Gordon GRS meeting will be held in Ventura, CA on January 15 and 16, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gordon GRS meeting will bring together junior researchers (graduate students and post-doctoral fellows) from a variety of disciplines, including engineering, materials science, chemistry, biology, and physics, to explore a Grand Challenge of the 21st Century: the scalable transformation and storage of energy from sustainable, carbon neutral sources. Realizing that sunlight is by far the most abundant renewable energy resource, and that a globally scalable method for the capture, conversion, and storage of sunlight will likely involve the production of fuels, the GRS will focus on the scientific challenges involved with producing fuel directly from sunlight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon GRS will provide to participants a state-of-the-art view of the important emerging science of Solar Fuels. Specifically, presentation topics will focus on ?Advanced Architectures for Charge Generation and Separation and Molecular Insights into Solar Fuels Catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon GRS meeting will provide networking opportunities and perspectives on new research being pursued by peers, thereby enhancing the scientific understanding of the GRS participants. The enhanced understanding will enable these junior researchers to contribute more effectively and more knowledgably toward solving the important scientific and technological problems posed by the global need for sustainable and renewable sources of energy.</AbstractNarration>
