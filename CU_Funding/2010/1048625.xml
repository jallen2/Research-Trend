    <AbstractNarration>1048625&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop novel thermoelectric materials for use in prototype thermoelectric modules to promote the cost-effective conversion of waste heat in vehicle exhaust systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal addresses four elements that are critical for successful implementation of thermoelectric devices for waste heat recovery from vehicle exhaust. These include development of new thermoelectric materials, system-level modeling, heat sink development, and reduction of thermal and electric resistances at material-material interfaces. The thermoelectric materials of interest are silicides, in which the lattice thermal conductivity of both the p- and n-type material will be reduced through nanostructuring, hence increasing the efficacy with which the material will perform in waste heat recovery scenarios. Once developed, the new material will be incorporated into thermoelectric modules, and the modules will be installed on a 6.7 liter diesel engine to measure system performance under realistic operating conditions. A system-level model will be developed and utilized to identify opportunities to further increase and optimize the overall design. Material properties will be measured at the PIs institutions as well as at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The successful development and implementation of new thermoelectric materials and module designs will improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. Graduate students will be involved in the research. Video course modules specific to thermoelectric waste heat recovery will be developed and disseminated via the Internet for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Outreach to a broad segment of the local population will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>
