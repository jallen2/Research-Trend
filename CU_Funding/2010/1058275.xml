    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop and cost effectively manufacture natural anthocyanin colorants as alternatives to synthetic dyes. The food, dietary supplements and beverage market has decisively shifted towards utilizing natural colorants. Technologies available currently are not adequate to meet the current and projected demand for natural colorants cost effectively. The ChromaDex process utilizes microbial production techniques to manufacture high purity, low cost anthocyanins in large quantities for use as a natural colorant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research spans several industry segments. More and more synthetic dyes and colorants are being pulled from the marketplace due to health and safety concerns. Anthocyanin natural colorants eliminate the health and safety concern that is growing among consumers over the use of synthetic products in food and pharmaceuticals. These colorants can be utilized in natural dye sensitized solar cells, as anti-oxidant dietary supplements etc. Every pound of anthocyanin produced by the fermentation approach replaces an equivalent pound of synthetic colorant and helps to conserve the world's oil supply, protect the environment and provide safe food products.</AbstractNarration>
