    <AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: RAPID: Formation, Persistence and Mobility of Oil Emulsions after Major Spills at Sea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Berrin Tansel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Florida International University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: 1043467&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Response to oil spills at sea involve containment of the floating oil (slick) with booms and surface removal. Initially the major fraction of the oil floats, hence, this method can be affective for containing small spills. Over time, waves and tidal action result in dispersion and emulsification of the oil slick (i.e., formation of stable small droplets). Emulsified oils can remain within the water column for extended periods of time and can move with the underwater currents. There are significant knowledge gaps relative to emulsification rates and patterns of large oils spills at sea (i.e., effects of weather conditions, waves, tides); partitioning profile of oil between slick and emulsion phases over time; persistence and mobility of dispersed oil droplets in water column; and transport characteristics of emulsified oils in relation to surface slick. Immediate short term research effort will focus on integrated analysis of data from satellite images of surface slick size and patterns, weather conditions (i.e., wind, temperature), and marine conditions (wave height from NOAA Bouy data). The data sets will be coupled with data from water samples collected at various locations over time to characterize persistence and mobility of emulsions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives are: (1) Investigate emulsification rates and patterns of large oils spills at sea (immediate short term); (2) Characterize persistence profile and mobility of emulsified oil at sea (short and long term); (3) Determine critical emulsion formation and transport characteristics based on field observations in South Florida marine and coastal waters and data in the Gulf coastal areas and marine environment. The research plan consists of the following tasks: (1) Coordination and communication with agencies and researchers to exchange data and information; (2) Field data analysis in the Gulf; (3) Field data and assessment in South Florida coastal and marine environment; (4) Analysis of data to determine critical emulsion behavior parameters; and (5) Macro scale assessment of emulsion behavior and persistence characteristics in subtropical environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research will include dissemination of findings through the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Council of Disaster Risk Management (CDRM) Outreach Committee efforts thorough development of informative modules on oil spill risks and emulsion formation, development of a course module on emulsion behavior, and journal papers.</AbstractNarration>
