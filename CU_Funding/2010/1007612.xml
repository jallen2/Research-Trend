    <AbstractNarration>This proposal describes plans for the Thirteenth Meeting of New&lt;br/&gt;Researchers in Statistics and Probability to be held in the campus of&lt;br/&gt;British Columbia, Vancouver, during July 27--July 30, 2010. Housing, meals,&lt;br/&gt;and conference facilities will be provided on campus. This conference&lt;br/&gt;series is organized by and held for junior researchers. The primary objective&lt;br/&gt;is to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new researchers.&lt;br/&gt; In contrast with large meetings, this conference will be restricted&lt;br/&gt; in size, with a target of 85-90 participants. Sessions will be followed&lt;br/&gt; by panel discussions and breaks to facilitate interactions.&lt;br/&gt; Participants will be statisticians and probabilist who have&lt;br/&gt;received their Ph.D. within the past five years or are expecting to receive&lt;br/&gt;their degree within the next year. Each participant will present a&lt;br/&gt;talk or poster. Topics will range across a variety of areas in statistical&lt;br/&gt;research from theory and methods to applications. Senior speakers will&lt;br/&gt; discuss topics of particular interest to new researchers.&lt;br/&gt;Panel discussions during the conference will cover the topics of journal&lt;br/&gt;publications, opportunities in statistics laboratories and industry,&lt;br/&gt;funding, mentoring, and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is based on its human resource&lt;br/&gt;development. The professional development of new researchers is&lt;br/&gt;stimulated by promoting their interaction, creating networks of&lt;br/&gt;colleagues (which is usually difficult at a large meeting, such as&lt;br/&gt;the Joint Statistical Meeting). Participants present their work&lt;br/&gt;in a smaller, more controlled conference environment, maximizing&lt;br/&gt;their intellectual interaction and growth. The primary goals of the&lt;br/&gt;conference are professional education of new researchers and to help&lt;br/&gt;create a network among these junior researchers, both are vital parts&lt;br/&gt;of professional growth. Women, minorities, and the disabled are&lt;br/&gt;explicitly encouraged to attend, and we have an established track&lt;br/&gt;record of attracting participants from these categories.</AbstractNarration>
