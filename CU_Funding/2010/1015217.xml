    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is, in part, a meeting of the Principal Investigators that have been funded by the Joint DMS/NIGMS Initiative to Support Research in the Area of Mathematical Biology. However, it also includes researchers who have not been supported by the program, but whose interests lie at the interface between the biological and mathematical sciences. The purpose of the meeting is to promote collaborations between the biology and mathematics communities, facilitating the advance of biological and biomedical research. Specific aims are to provide a forum for PIs to share experiences, exchange ideas, and explore new collaborations; to inform NSF and NIH program officials of opportunities and challenges in promoting scientific advances at the interface between biological and mathematical sciences, and establishing and sustaining successful collaborations between biologists and mathematicians/statisticians; and to identify "big" problems in biology that require innovative mathematical approaches. The workshop includes speakers covering a wide range of biological and mathematical research, as well as poster presentations, and will be held at the University of Maryland on April 26-27, 2010.</AbstractNarration>
