    <AbstractNarration>The State University of New York at Oswego proposes an ADVANCE IT Catalyst project that will initiate a series of activities to further the hiring, retention, and success of women in STEM disciplines on the campus. This project will have three main objectives: 1) to undertake a data collection process that supplies both quantitative and qualitative information to better understand the present status of women STEM faculty and to determine any barriers to employment, retention and promotion; 2) to investigate best practices at institutions similar to ours that have resulted in the participation and advancement of women in STEM, especially those that have had IT grant in the past or have them presently; and 3) to present and publish data and other research through the development of programs, workshops, and symposia, to lay the groundwork for institutional transformation that will result in more women faculty in STEM fields, particularly at the associate and full professor levels. Project findings will help to lay the groundwork for institutional transformation with a campus information project that will lead toward the development of an IT ADVANCE grant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellect Merit: Currently, there exists little information about how faculty at comprehensive institutions advance professionally. It is widely known, however, that the balance between research and teaching at comprehensive institutions differs from that of research intensive institutions, resulting in different policies and procedures, different assessments of faculty work, and different criteria for success. The SUNY Oswego ADVANCE IT Catalyst will be well positioned to increase the knowledge of the success of women faculty at comprehensive institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By exploring the institutional supports for and barriers to women in STEM areas at a public, comprehensive institution, the SUNY Oswego ADVANCE IT Catalyst project will serve as a model for other comprehensive institutions and provide support for their work toward systemic change that improves career outcomes for a women faculty in the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
