    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to understand the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary (MIDR) nature of education and learning research and how it has developed over time, with a focus on cognitive science, an area of particular importance to education research. Investigators from Search Technology Inc will study proposals funded by two NSF education research programs (ROLE and REESE). Using bibliometric methods they devised, they will examine the references cited in the proposals to characterize the MIDR nature of the projects. They will also analyze the publications produced by the projects and track the dissemination of that research knowledge via the papers that cite those publications. The investigators will focus additionally on the work of key cognitive scientists and highly-cited ROLE/REESE-derived publications. Using social network analysis and science mapping, the investigators will track STEM community engagement with this educational research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to advance measurement, analysis, and visualization tools to help quantify science and science policy. In particular, these offer empirical evidence on much-touted, but little measured, MIDR. The results should have important implications for STEM education researchers who wish to understand trends in their fields, for cognitive science and education research communities that have traditionally not engaged one another's literatures, and for science policy analysts and program developers.</AbstractNarration>
