    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is bringing together a selected group of experts and practitioners from the engineering, geosciences, and earth sciences communities. The workshop participants are discussing and developing consensus about whether and how data-driven modeling and visualization approaches can best be used to improve hydrology education. Specifically, workshop participants are 1) identifying specific needs for cross-cutting data, modeling, and visualization digital resources that are valuable to the broader hydrology education community, 2) developing a strategy about how to bridge the gap between data-driven applications needed in upper division courses and those required in more general courses, 3) identifying key design criteria for a community cyberinfrastructure by which instructors can discover, download, publish, interconnect, modify, review, and collaboratively develop curriculum materials for data-driven cyberlearning related to hydrology, and 4) identifying the best ways to engage the larger community in the effective use of data-driven curricular materials and achieve broad dissemination, adoption, and use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is producing a report that serves as a starting point to build a larger community wide effort to harness the available research and teaching resources for developing and using geoinformatics modules in hydrology education. In addition, the report also identifies the shortcomings of existing resources, and identifies opportunities for future research and development activities to improve hydrology education.</AbstractNarration>
