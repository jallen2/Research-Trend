    <AbstractNarration>How does expertise develop in motor skills? Through research conducted on a challenging task--balancing a stick on the fingertip--some of the secrets of motor expertise have been discovered. Counter-intuitively, random perturbations may be a key component of the solution. Research conducted by John Milton and his students at Claremont McKenna College (a primarily undergraduate institution) suggests that expertise depends on an underlying "drift and act" control strategy, in which unconscious corrective actions are made only when deviations become sufficiently large. Voluntary corrective movements are more likely to be disruptive than effective. The investigators will extend this work to balancing on a wobble board in order to establish the fundamental importance of intermittent control for maintaining balance in an unpredictable, noisy environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Milton brings together an international team of scientists to work with undergraduate students to advance our understanding of expertise development in balancing. The investigators focus on balancing tasks for three main reasons: 1) the tasks are sufficiently difficult to allow identification of levels of expertise; 2) they are sufficiently constrained to permit careful comparisons between observation and prediction; and 3) expertise can be dramatically increased with just a few days of intensive practice. High speed motion capture technologies are used to simultaneously monitor the positions of the stick, body and eye movements (a measure of visual attention) as expertise develops and key elements are varied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project is designed to excite and motivate undergraduate students, while at the same time teach them to work effectively in international teams. Because proper balance control is essential for the expert performance of many motor tasks, it is anticipated that studies of balance control will provide potential solutions for problems ranging from minimizing the risk of falling in the elderly to the development of two-legged robots and novel rehabilitative strategies.</AbstractNarration>
