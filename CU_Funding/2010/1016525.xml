    <AbstractNarration>There is an abundance of challenging problems in physics and engineering, such &lt;br/&gt;as fluid flow in industrial foams and vuggy reservoirs, which are &lt;br/&gt;characterized by high porosity and complex material structure. Traditionally, &lt;br/&gt;these flows are modeled by Darcy's law relating the macroscopic pressure &lt;br/&gt;gradient to the macroscopic fluid velocity. For highly permeable media a more &lt;br/&gt;suitable model is given by Brinkman's equations, considered in this project. &lt;br/&gt;The internal structure involves multiple spatial scales and permeabilities &lt;br/&gt;varying over many orders of magnitude (high contrast). Thus, the development &lt;br/&gt;of numerical methods for Brinkman's equations that are robust with respect to &lt;br/&gt;the contrast and accurately capture the fine scales is a difficult theoretical &lt;br/&gt;problem with important applications to engineering and geosciences. There are &lt;br/&gt;numerous methods for efficiently computing multi-scale porous media flows &lt;br/&gt;governed by Darcy's law. These include in particular multi-scale finite &lt;br/&gt;element methods, subgrid approximation, multi-grid, and domain decomposition &lt;br/&gt;methods. Developing an efficient multi-scale approximation for Brinkman is a &lt;br/&gt;challenging task, which cannot be addressed using methods available in the &lt;br/&gt;Darcy case. The first objective of this project is a development and study of &lt;br/&gt;numerical subgrid method for Brinkman's system. The second goal is to &lt;br/&gt;represent accurately the fine features of the solution, which cannot be &lt;br/&gt;captured by the numerical subgrid approach alone. An extension of the &lt;br/&gt;algorithm by alternating Schwarz iterations in order to resolve these features &lt;br/&gt;will be developed, theoretically justified and practically tested. The third &lt;br/&gt;main objective is to utilize a multi-scale finite element space and an &lt;br/&gt;enrichment of the coarse space by adding basis functions resulting from the &lt;br/&gt;approximate solution of certain small local generalized eigenvalue problems. &lt;br/&gt;This will allow to devise an iterative method that converges independently of &lt;br/&gt;the contrast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phenomena in engineering such as heat and mass transfer, fluid flows, and &lt;br/&gt;materials, are routinely modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs). The &lt;br/&gt;solutions of the PDEs are subsequently used to design and develop new &lt;br/&gt;materials or new technologies with wide range of applications. These &lt;br/&gt;applications require complex models with multiple space scales, which in turn &lt;br/&gt;make the solution task challenging and computationally very intensive. The &lt;br/&gt;proposed work is motivated by the needs for design and manufacturing of new &lt;br/&gt;materials and/or more accurate description of oil reservoirs or aquifers. &lt;br/&gt;However, developing efficient and robust solution techniques for computing &lt;br/&gt;flows in media with complex internal structures will significantly broaden the &lt;br/&gt;areas of application for which the numerical simulation is feasible. Since &lt;br/&gt;numerical simulations are key to better understand, control, and optimize the &lt;br/&gt;modeled processes the proposed research will eventually benefit other areas in &lt;br/&gt;science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
