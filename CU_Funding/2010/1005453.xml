    <AbstractNarration>The intellectual merit of this research is to develop both theoretical and practical aspects of quantum computing with ultracold neutral and ionic polar molecules. General interest in polar molecules is based on the fact that they can be controlled with relatively small external electric fields and entangled by the long-range dipole-dipole interaction. The study will include an investigation of molecular ions trapped near the surface of a superconducting chip considered for quantum information devices. It will also search for effcient ways to form gases of neutral polar molecules with high densities and trap them in optical potentials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this study are in improving knowledge of the molecular properties of neutral and ionic molecules and thereby helping to set up realistic models for the experiments at US universities. These combined efforts will lead to improvement and development of reliable and effcient quantum physical systems for quantum information processing. The outreach of this project will include the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to get experience with state-of-the art computational programs, learning to write research papers, prepare and give presentations at conferences. While participating in the proposed research students and postdoctoral researchers will explore the new and exciting field of quantum information and computational physics at the frontier.</AbstractNarration>
