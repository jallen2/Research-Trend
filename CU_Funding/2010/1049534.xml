    <AbstractNarration>This travel support enables U.S.-based students to attend the 18th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL), held in San Jose, California, USA, November 2-5, 2010 (http://acmgis2010.cs.ucsb.edu/). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS conference has established itself as the world?s premier conference to foster research in the areas of Spatial Data and Analysis and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The conference provides a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation aspects of GIS ranging from applications, user interfaces, and visualization to storage management and indexing issues. It brings together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners carrying out research and development in novel systems based on geo-spatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary discussions and research in all aspects of GIS. It is the premier annual event of the ACM Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (ACM SIGSPATIAL). The conference seeks to continuously advance the state of-the-art in spatial data management and spatial data analysis and broaden its impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial travel support and conference registration for 20-25 qualified U.S. based graduate and promising undergraduate student participants. The students will greatly benefit from attending this conference, as they will be able to partake in the current state-of-the-art in the area of geo-spatial systems and applications, present their work, and potentially make connections for research collaborations and research mentoring. The total number of ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS participants in the past has been in excess of 250 participants, with a majority of the participants from the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia. The conference participation has shown a steady increase in the past few years due to the growing importance of geographic information. A strong representation of U.S.-based graduate students at ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in the important research areas crucial for U.S. infrastructures and applications that critically depend on geo-referenced information.</AbstractNarration>
