    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will genetically engineer a thermophilic bacterial strain capable of expressing and secreting all the enzymes necessary for biomass hydrolysis and that can grow on minimal media in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The National Energy Plan Renewable Fuel Standard mandates the production of 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels from non-food based crops by 2022. In order to achieve this goal, an economically feasible process to hydrolyze biomass must be developed. Production of cellulosic ethanol currently involves pretreating biomass with steam, acid or base to make it more accessible to enzymatic digestion. Enzymes, namely those possessing cellulase, xylanase, â-xylosidase and â-glucosidase activities, will be added after pretreatment to hydrolyze the biomass to its constituent five and six carbon sugars that can be fermented to produce fuel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be low cost bio-fuel made from local biomass. This could reduce and stabilize energy prices, strengthen the national energy security, reduce the fiscal deficit, create American jobs and promote economic development.</AbstractNarration>
