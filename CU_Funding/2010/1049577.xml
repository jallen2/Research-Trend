    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the research is to investigate the application of new imaging technologies to capture the complete response of reinforced concrete walls exposed to fire. Several reinforced concrete walls are planned to be tested at the University of Notre Dame under a National Science Foundation sponsored project. These walls will be instrumented with traditional strain gages and temperature sensors. This project augments the existing measurements by using advanced photographic methods to provide more complete description of the surface movements and temperatures, and using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to measure moisture distributions through the thickness of the walls. The comparison of the measurements made by traditional sensors and the proposed new technology will validate this new experimental data collecting approach for future applications. The images generated by the new approach will also be used to develop better visualization of the test specimen response and aid in correlating the temperatures, moisture movement, strains, cracking, and concrete spalling with structural failure. Simultaneous measurements of the deformations, temperatures and humidity with the proposed technology will provide a complete description of the response, leading to better modeling methods, improved performance prediction approaches, and enhanced design procedures for reinforced concrete walls exposed to fires. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, when successfully completed, is expected to provide a more versatile approach to make accurate and comprehensive response measurements in structural testing. The new approach is also expected to avoid the use of the traditional lead wired sensors used in structural testing that are sometimes difficult to manage. The project will provide a more convenient method to collect much needed data to develop better methods for fire resistant design of structures. With this new research and testing capability, the project will enhance the research infrastructure at the University of Texas at Tyler, a primarily undergraduate institution, to provide advanced knowledge and training to undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
