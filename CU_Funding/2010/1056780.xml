    <AbstractNarration>Cold atomic clouds are a necessary step on the way to molecular cloud and star formation. To study how these clouds form out of the warm neutral medium, Dr. Stanimirovic will use two next-generation radio facilities for sensitive HI absorption observations of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. The so-named "21-SPONGE" survey will provide the first quantitative description of the basic physical properties of the warm neutral medium in the Milky Way. A second survey conducted at facilities in the southern hemisphere will provide the census of cold gas in the Magellanic Clouds. These surveys will be complemented by a study of interstellar turbulence as a potential key agent for seeding the cold cloud formation. Once the data is obtained, a systematic comparison of synthetic HI spectra derived from numerical models with observations will test the reliability of simulated data sets and will expose missing physical processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exploration of the interstellar clouds in the Milky Way continues to introductory astronomy classes at the University of Wisconsin, Madison through the development of the Astronomical Observation Laboratory -- a "radio observatory" dedicated to student learning. Three undergraduate students will work with Dr. Stanimirovic to develop radio astronomy tutorials suitable for lower-level astronomy classes. With its three small radio telescopes, the Astronomical Observation Laboratory will also allow upper-level, project-based courses to focus on problem-solving and collaborative learning. Undergraduate students from other campuses will be able to use Astronomical Observation Laboratory remotely from their classrooms and work with the radio tutorials.</AbstractNarration>
