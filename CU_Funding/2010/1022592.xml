    <AbstractNarration>United Tribes Native Technicians for the Environment (UT.NT4E) is an NSF-TCUP Initiation grant project that proposes to offer a foundation Environmental Technology AAS degree program along with short-term certification programs using embedded technology and research within coursework. United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) leverages the support of existing regional partnerships and grant programs to provide a cohesive academic STEM program with intensive student support while strengthening UTTC?s STEM faculty knowledge and teaching practices. The project addresses residential expertise needs in the areas of environment, land, natural resources and energy development along with addressing national goals for math, science, and technology skills development among Native American people.&lt;br/&gt;UT.NT4E proposes to educate the whole person employing intensive student support for STEM students.&lt;br/&gt;Andragogical practices will encompass state-of-the-art math, science, and technology instruction and adult learning concepts. Intensive and long-term staff development assures UTTC STEM faculty has access to adult learning principles, content knowledge and teaching practices as well as advanced degree/certification support. UT.NT4E faculty will work hand in hand with STEM students and general education instructors to provide enhanced STEM courses at UTTC. Peer teaching and mentoring are fundamental to this project. Emphasis on research affords the students ample opportunity to actively study issues important to them. The staff development and student support system ensures that UT.NT4E students successfully complete the Environmental Technology or other STEM degrees to either matriculate into a four-year degree programs or to enter the workforce highly-qualified to perform technician skills.&lt;br/&gt;The UT.NT4E program is evaluated using a multi-dimensional evaluation plan Based on the Phillip?s Model which uses data collected from eight categories to answer key questions regarding the overall accomplishments of the program and suggested strategies for improvements. The categories are student count, student satisfaction, student learning, American Indian Contemporary and Traditional values, experiential learning/internships, Impact on Indian Country, Return on Investment and Intangibles.&lt;br/&gt;UTTC is supported by five federally-recognized Tribes based in North Dakota and has a national reputation for excellence in education by Tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). UT.NT4E utilizes an advisory board composed of TCU administrators, faculty, regional environmental experts, and community members to assist in decision-making processes.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impacts: This project will increase the numbe</AbstractNarration>
