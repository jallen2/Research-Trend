    <AbstractNarration>University of California-Berkeley is planning to join the existing Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi)" currently comprised of the University of Arkansas (lead), and 9 other universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of California at Berkeley (UC-B) is proposing to become an additional research site for the multi-university Industry /University Research Center (I/UCRC) called Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). This new research site will focus on the biotechnology sector. This industrial sector has some unique challenges including being heavily regulated and the inherent uncertainty of biological products and ingredients. Biotech sector includes the biotech pharmaceuticals (biopharmaceuticals) industry. The UC-B research site will complement and not duplicate the research capabilities that already exist within CELDi. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A research focus on biopharmaceuticals within CELDi will also have broader impact, both in terms of research and in terms of outreach. Research has the potential to positively impact the cost and availability of biopharmaceuticals, which will play an increasingly large role as a critical element of healthcare. The Berkeley site will have an education and outreach component. UC Berkeley has a strong and explicit commitment to diversity, and through research projects and courses designed with the input of industry members, a diverse group of graduate students will be educated on critical operations issues in the industry. Member firms will have a forum to share experiences, leading to more effective biopharmaceutical production, and seminars will help to disseminate advanced operations management techniques to the industry. The proposed research and outreach program can help to sustain and grow this industry, which will ultimately have a tremendous positive impact on the US economy and on the world.</AbstractNarration>
