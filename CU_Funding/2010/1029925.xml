    <AbstractNarration>We will develop novel bowtie nanoantennas and resonant tunneling diodes to convert the mid-IR portion of the solar spectrum to electric power. We will take advantage of the large enhanced electric field by the lightning rod effect and by the gap plasmon resonances to enhance the in-plane electric field in the ?knot? of the bowtie and increase the efficiency of electron tunneling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our approach will initially complement solar cells by converting infrared blackbody radiation from the earth, at night, during rainy days or from heat generated by the inefficient solar energy conversion during day time. Then, we will extend this technology to higher frequencies and will challenge current solar cells for solar energy conversion of the visible spectrum. This research will enhance our understanding of efficient coupling to nanoantenna in the mid-IR and the visible spectrum and will help us understand the physics of tunneling at very high frequencies which is not well understood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our new devices will impact the field of solar energy collection and will allow collection of energy from spectral regions that were previously ignored. We anticipate that our novel technology will eliminate the need for large volumes of relatively expensive semiconductors and will allow for much more extensive harvesting of energy from ambient radiation. A new experiment on energy scavenging will be introduced in our undergraduate class in optoelectronics and will complement the solar energy laboratory being established in our Department.</AbstractNarration>
