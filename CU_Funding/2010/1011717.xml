    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;Located in an international center of bio-innovation, San Francisco State University has more than two decades of success at training a diverse student population for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This award is supporting an innovative two-year interdisciplinary science master's program (SMP) that is preparing students to advance into professional careers in the applied life sciences. The program's focus is on biotechnology, including the emerging area of stem cell research. This industry has the potential to fuel economic growth for the bay area, California, and the nation. This new program is responsive to calls from biotechnology industry leaders for a new generation of scientists with interdisciplinary knowledge who have familiarity with emerging technologies and some business acumen. The proposed program incorporates close partnerships with research institutes, industry, and public/non-profit service agents. The program curriculum includes professionally-oriented, innovative graduate coursework in molecular and developmental biology, biosciences, business and management, communication, ethics, teamwork skills, and a rigorous internship and related research component. These SMP courses are also available to graduate students in other STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The project is increasing the number of masters' graduates, particularly minorities and individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, who are working in rapidly-advancing STEM fields. By drawing together faculty and researchers across the campus and community, the program is providing comprehensive mentorship and career development opportunities, fostering new avenues for collaborations. It is promoting the implementation of innovative interdisciplinary graduate level curricula, increasing research and workforce productivity, and serving as a foundation for expansion into other STEM areas on SFSU campus and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
