    <AbstractNarration>This project utilizes existing climate change datasets, activities, and resources to develop a model teacher professional development tool kit and program for climate science. The target audiences for the tool kits are formal (teachers) and informal (naturalists, museum) educators who conduct teacher professional development. The secondary audience is secondary Earth science teachers. The tool kit is being developed in collaboration with educators from Benton Central Jr.-Sr. High School (Indiana) and St John's Lutheran School (Michigan), a naturalist with Tippecanoe County, IN, and represenatives of the Environmental Education Association of Indiana. The project is divided into three phases. The first phase focuses on the development of the teacher professional development tool kit and program. The second phase involves using the tool kit to conduct teacher professional development, field testing, evaluating, and revising the tool kit. The third phase involves a summer institute to prepare formal and informal educators to use the tool kit, disseminating the tool kit to organizations and institutions, and establishing a Project Climate Science network.</AbstractNarration>
