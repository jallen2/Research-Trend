    <AbstractNarration>This basic research aims to establish a general theory for designing feedback control mechanisms to drive robotic systems that swim like fishes or crawl like snakes. The design method will enable propulsion with agility and energy efficiency. The control algorithm is inspired by the central pattern generator (CPG) --- neuronal circuits that command muscle contractions to achieve rhythmic body movements during animal locomotion. The CPG is an interconnection of multiple neurons with simple individual dynamics, exhibiting a collective behavior perceived as a pattern. What makes CPGs an attractive object for engineering applications is its ability to adaptively choose the pattern of body oscillation appropriate for varying environments. This exploratory research will investigate the potential of the CPG architecture to provide a viable foundation for a new system design methodology to achieve coordinated oscillations of mechanical systems by feedback control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent behaviors of CPGs could provide a central idea for innovative design of engineered systems with new functionalities. A theory that relates local interactions to the resulting global pattern would help identify, predict, or avoid, for instance, traffic congestion and instability in power grids. Synergistic effects between neuroscience and control engineering will be exploited in both research and education. The educational goal of this project is to provide students with a broad dynamical systems view point that applies not only to the design of engineered machines but also to understanding of biological phenomena. The goal will be approached through multidisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in a teamwork environment, and by incorporating research findings into control engineering courses. The results will be broadly disseminated to both neuroscience and control communities through conference presentations, journal publications, invited seminars, and tutorial workshops, to enhance cross-cultural fertilizations.</AbstractNarration>
