    <AbstractNarration>Workshop on Design of DNA Origami&lt;br/&gt;to be held 26 April, 2010&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will support a day long workshop on design of DNA origami immediately prior to the 7th conference on the Foundations of Nanoscience (FNANO 2010).&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is designed to outfit each participant with information and tools that will enable them to design DNA nanostructures using the templated DNA origami method. Participants will return to their home institutions equipped with software, DNA sequence information, experimental hints and tips, and experience with AFM imaging that will allow them to design, fabricate and image a test origami structure. Workshop participants will also have the opportunity to attend the 2010 FNANO meeting, which this year features a double track on self-assembled DNA nanostructures. Most of the main researchers in DNA origami (Nadrian Seeman, Paul Rothemund, William Shih, Ebbe Andersen, Eric Winfree, Satoshi Murata, Masayuki Endo, Akinori Kuzuya, Hao Yan, Chengde Mao, Thom LaBean) attend this meeting. Coupling the workshop with the conference will enable younger scientists (postdocs, grad students, and junior faculty) to interact professionally with many of the top researchers in DNA origami.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be open to up to 15 NSF-supported participants, including 5 graduate students, 5 postdocs, and 5 junior faculty members. The workshop will be publicized to attract a wide range of applicants, who will be selected by the conference and program chairs of FNANO. The chairs will choose participants who are relatively new to FNANO, who will increase the diversity of the conference attendees, and who are likely to actually put the workshop content to use in their research.</AbstractNarration>
