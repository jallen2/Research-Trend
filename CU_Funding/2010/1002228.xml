    <AbstractNarration>Ultra-Low-Power Complementary Logic with On-Chip &lt;br/&gt;Directly Assembled, Highly Adaptive 2-D Graphitic Platform &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(NSF # 1002228)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to demonstrate ultra-low-power-dissipating complementary logic prototype built upon on-chip directly assembled 2-D graphitic platform, towards achieving all-carbon electronics without involvement of scientific handyman methods. The approach is to use highly-adaptive material and device scheme to implement complementary logic configuration, combined with an innovative strategy to integrate chemical assembly into carbon circuit fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The proposed research is the first effort to demonstrate graphene complementary logic, addressing challenges towards carbon-based information processing. The research is based on innovations at several levels: (1) on-chip direct assembly and monolithic integration of patterned graphene platform, (2) employing electronically flexible, highly adaptive bilayer graphene for both switch and interconnect, (3) graphene CVD growth on ultra-thin metal catalyst, (3) implementation of complementary-channel logic switches, and (4) a versatile, seamlessly integrated carbon fabrication strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: If successful, the research would breakthrough key identified barriers towards manufacturing-worthy carbon integrated circuits, challenging the silicon dominance. The research would make far-reaching ideas in electronics, directing the field toward a new transformative technology. From a broader view, the proposed integrated carbon fabrication platform may have impacts on a spectrum of potential applications, as well as heterogeneous integration of multiple functionalities. The research opens opportunities for students to acquire multidisciplinary experience in devices, circuits, materials, and nanofabrication. Outreach efforts will broaden participation of under-represented groups in research programs. The dissemination of research discoveries by publications and its inclusion in new curriculum development will ensure broad impacts to scientific, educational, and general public community.</AbstractNarration>
