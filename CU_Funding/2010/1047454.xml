    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to&lt;br/&gt;develop a revolutionary, yet simple and well-designed technique for the cost effective&lt;br/&gt;deposition of compound semiconductor epitaxial material mesa arrays on large (300mm)&lt;br/&gt;silicon wafers. The subsequent processing steps integrate smoothly with silicon CMOS&lt;br/&gt;(Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) processing similar to the current SiGe&lt;br/&gt;(Silicon Germanium) BiCMOS (Bipolar CMOS) technology. Previous attempts at the&lt;br/&gt;integration of III-V materials with silicon have had limited success due to many factors&lt;br/&gt;including high cost, CMOS incompatibility, small wafer size, and a lack of technological&lt;br/&gt;and market readiness. In contrast, the proposed solution is very cost effective, and it&lt;br/&gt;builds on recent technological progress in advanced materials deposition and handling.&lt;br/&gt;The vehicle chosen for the demonstration of this technology is the fabrication of high&lt;br/&gt;speed VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser) arrays on silicon. The immediate&lt;br/&gt;application is in high speed interconnects for computer systems and peripherals including&lt;br/&gt;next generation USB (Universal Serial Bus) cables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the following&lt;br/&gt;aspects: This technology can merge the advanced compound semiconductor materials&lt;br/&gt;with the superior processing and efficiency of silicon ICs. This will end years of isolated&lt;br/&gt;development and will bring new electronic and optoelectronic device capabilities to&lt;br/&gt;mainstream silicon processing. In electronics applications, high speed and high power&lt;br/&gt;transistors based on InP, and GaN device technologies will be processed with silicon&lt;br/&gt;CMOS on large wafers. This will integrate advanced analog and power functions with&lt;br/&gt;silicon CMOS based control and processing. In addition, it will offer an alternative route&lt;br/&gt;for the continuation of performance enhancement in silicon ICs independent of feature&lt;br/&gt;size reduction. In optoelectronics, the integration of GaAs and InP based optical emitters&lt;br/&gt;and receivers on silicon will allow the miniaturization and cost reduction of optical&lt;br/&gt;transmitter and receiver modules. The seamless integration of optical and electronic&lt;br/&gt;functions on silicon chips will lead to faster interconnects and will significantly reduce&lt;br/&gt;the cost per bit in fiber optic signal transmission.</AbstractNarration>
