    <AbstractNarration>Many of life's major decisions and issues about which individuals negotiate concern outcomes that will be experienced far off in the future (e.g., health decisions, vacation plans, business deals, retirement options, military strategy). In this project it is argued that just as the amount of time or temporal distance from when negotiation outcomes will be experienced can be an important element of negotiation, so too can the amount of physical (geographical) distance in a negotiation. The proposed research relies on a framework that treats temporal and physical space as manifestations of the same concept (distance). Prior research by the principal investigator has demonstrated that increased temporal distance is beneficial for individuals during certain types of negotiations (e.g., integrative situations - where parties involved have different priorities across the issues under dispute). The current research investigates whether large amounts of distance in negotiation increase individuals' focus on higher level information (motives, values, dispositions) in the midst of lower level, contextual information, which should both benefit as well burden certain interpersonal and group dynamics. The research will also examine whether and to what extent negotiations that involve smaller amounts of distance will produce desirable outcomes under alternative circumstances. Ultimately, by conceptualizing temporal and physical distance in negotiation under the same theoretical umbrella, these research tests novel predictions and addresses important gaps in the negotiation domain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will permit a junior investigator to further develop a program of research already under way, and to support a graduate research assistant.</AbstractNarration>
