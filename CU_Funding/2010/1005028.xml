    <AbstractNarration>Bard College's REU will introduce students from a wide variety of backgrounds to mathematics research at a highly selective liberal arts college where mathematical and scientific research by undergraduates and faculty members is burgeoning. The problems given to students will be part of active and current research areas in pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and mathematical computation. Throughout the summer, students will be exposed to theoretical constructs, computational techniques and real world applications, and will develop background and skills that will help to prepare them for further study or employment in a mathematics-related career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a way to broaden access to, and the impact of, mathematics in the larger community, Bard will offer some REU slots to talented sophomores who are just beginning to consider careers in mathematics, as well as to students who have decided to major in mathematics as late as their junior year. We are determined to make this experience a tipping point for students who are mathematically talented but undecided about whether to pursue a career in mathematics. Moreover, with its attention to students who arrive early or late to mathematics in their college careers, Bard's REU will help to retain mathematical talent that might otherwise disappear when individuals with unorthodox academic preparation fail to fit into more traditional math and science programs. Thus, Bard's REU will increase the base of U.S. citizens who are highly trained in mathematics. Moreover, Bard's REU will contribute to broadening this mathematically qualified base by prioritizing gender parity in the students selected, as well as diversity in race, ethnicity, and mathematical background.</AbstractNarration>
