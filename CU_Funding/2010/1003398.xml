    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this grant is to conduct a workshop that will bring together experts to address fundamental systems engineering research issues in complex product design. These experts will include: practitioners and theorists in systems engineering; general systems theorists; researchers in engineering design; and social scientists from economics, psychology, and organization theory. This workshop will focus on the normative theory of engineering design that encompasses the aspects of organization and complexity that are essential parts of these development programs. The goal of this workshop is to identify a research agenda to facilitate the formulation of a theoretical basis for the design of large, complex products. The deliverables for this workshop include a summary report of findings, publication of workshop recommendations in leading systems and design journals, and briefings to the sponsors and other agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this workshop will lead to the creation of a foundational theory that is essential for progress in the disciplines of engineering design, systems engineering, and multidisciplinary optimization. A rigorous normative theory underlying the design of large complex products and systems can lead to methods of systems engineering, product management, engineering design, and design optimization that can reduce poor performance on these projects, and thereby revitalize the aerospace, automotive, and other heavy equipment industries.</AbstractNarration>
