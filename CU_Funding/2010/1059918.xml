    <AbstractNarration>This is a small EAGER award to support the application and testing of models of traditional knowledge that have been developed in cooperation with Arctic communities and researchers by applying them to the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe. The Arctic has been at the forefront of defining and developing models based on the traditional knowledge of Arctic indigenous peoples. This research project will utilize research approaches developed in the Arctic for documenting arctic environmental change through indigenous knowledge and apply them to the Port Gamble S'Klallam case. PI Andrews notes that the insights gained in the Arctic are deeper than just observations of environmental change; they incorporate indigenous cultural perspectives of the natural environment as "social spaces" and incorporate the "personhood" of land and marine resources, thus engendering use and management responsibilities and guidelines. The Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe's interest is in utilizing their traditional knowledge to inform long term decision making and management decisions about the environment and natural resources in the homelands of Puget Sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a community participatory research project, the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe is collaborating with Andrews to explore how indigenous knowledge can inform a deeper understanding of the environmental change they are experiencing in their homelands, with the objective of informing both Tribal and State management practices. The PI will be working with the Port Graham S'Kallam Tribal elders and knowledgeable community members, as well as natural resource program staff to develop a model that can synthesize scientific and indigenous knowledge in order to develop an effective management and restoration program.</AbstractNarration>
