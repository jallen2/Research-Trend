    <AbstractNarration>During eight weeks each summer of 2010-2012, 12 undergraduate students will have the opportunity to visit K-State and carry out research projects under the mentorship of the mathematics department's faculty. This REU targets a mixed population of students from community colleges in Western Kansas who might otherwise not have an opportunity to experience mathematics work and consider graduate studies, and students preparing for graduate studies in mathematics. Since half or more of the student population we plan to recruit will be early in their studies, and hence expected to have limited experience with mathematical proof, the REUs will feature a series of talks by Philosophy faculty on epistemology of mathematics and propositional logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the REU are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Help students to be independent researchers;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- enhance their understanding of basic mathematics and the&lt;br/&gt; areas involved in their own project;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- develop a sense of "sound" mathematical reasoning;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- create a sense of community among the REU students and&lt;br/&gt; our own students and faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU will also offer panels on graduate school and how to apply, and Graduate Record Exam (GRE) prepping workshops that we currently offer to our own math majors. Added features of this REU are a weekly meeting of participants to discuss their progress, eventually leading to a closing conference in which the students present their results, and the availability of a "floating trobleshooter." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All our mathematician mentors have experience directing undergraduate research; often, and according to the student's investment, leading to publications, awards, and admission in Group I graduate programs. Social activities will be shared with the concurrent Physics and Biology REUs and the university-wide Summer Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (SUROP). The PIs will use the human resources of the NIH grant "Kansas Bridges to the future" to recruit participants in Western Kansas, and a collaboration with the Multicultural Engineering Program to assist in recruiting Native American students.</AbstractNarration>
