    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a unique low toxicity Type I interferon in augmenting the wound healing process caused by thermal burns. Wound healing can be a long and painful process, especially for burn patients who, depending on the total body burn size and skin loss, must endure months of skin grafting, the possibility of life-threatening infections with no guarantees of success, as well as altered skin appearance, reduced skin function and scar tissue formation. The effects of this novel interferon on wound healing will be investigated using the following three specific aims: 1) prove the efficacy of the interferon in augmenting the wound healing of burns; 2) demonstrate the mechanism of action of the interferon by investigating the underlying molecular processes; and 3) prove that the interferon has low toxicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader commercial impacts of this research are tremendous. Every year, over 2 million Americans require treatment for burns. About 100,000 of these burn victims are hospitalized and about 11,000 die. The 2009 US National Burn Repository reported that the mean hospital charge for each patient with acute burn injuries was $53,465. A definite unmet need still exists to develop novel therapies that result in decreasing healing times, minimizing complications and reducing subsequent healthcare cost savings. This novel interferon is expected to accelerate the wound healing process and minimize scar formation which will have a profound positive impact on the quality of life for the patients and reduce healthcare costs.</AbstractNarration>
