    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will implement service learning in an early construction engineering course at the University of North Carolina- Charlotte. The project seeks to engage students and contextualize learning using active/collaborative pedagogies. Students will partner with Habitat for Humanity as part of an existing course in the degree program; learning gains will be assessed by an external evaluator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project, if successful, will be to build partnerships between the PI's institution and community-based charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity. Students in construction engineering will be exposed to a diverse group of volunteers, which may broaden their perspective. The project plans to disseminate their service learning model to partner schools.</AbstractNarration>
