    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this ATE Regional Center is to address the demonstrated high demand for renewable energy technicians in southern and central California as a multi-county consortium. This project allows the Center to complete objectives in five areas: 1) development and refinement of modular in-class, on-line, and hybrid renewable energy curricula integrated into degree pathways; 2) implementation of a technical teacher professional development program in renewable energy that will allow current and future teachers for community colleges and high schools to acquire the technical knowledge and pedagogical skills to teach renewable energy in their classrooms; 3) development and implementation of a 2+2+2 pathway through partnership with high schools and universities to allow students interested in renewable energy careers to have a defined career ladder with multiple exit points integrated with industry certifications and college certificate and degree attainment; 4) continuous assessment and evaluation with embedded targeted research on curricular and professional development strategies to ensure that student, faculty, and industry goals are attained; and, 5) dissemination of both the products and the partnership process to maximize the impact both regionally and nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The faculty team is experienced and has worked together to develop curricula, share equipment and expertise, conduct joint professional development, and collaborate with employers for the benefit of their students and their programs. The new wind and solar curricula have been well researched, and the pilot Wind Boot Camp has won international recognition. The curricula are tied to industry and degree skills standards and certifications through a rigorous, documented process of testing regionally skills standards developed in cooperation with national leaders of industry in renewable energy. The consortia has acted as a strong advocate for AS and BS technical degree programs for the region and plans to have new technical BS programs sponsored by CREATE in operation in year four in cooperation with three California State University and University of California partners. CREATE is also developing, adapting, and disseminating curricula and material for other colleges needing support in the areas of renewable energy (specializing in wind and solar and electromechanical technologies). The assessment and evaluation team is experienced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;The center colleges act as demonstration sites for regional technical workshops that pilot-test new curricula or delivery systems and innovative professional development, especially in the area of technical teacher training. The strong partnerships with renewable energy employers, state agencies, and programs across the country aid fulfillment of the high demonstrated technician need by a diverse and gender balanced student and faculty base. The consortium colleges are a diverse mix of predominantly minority/HSI community colleges, serving 8 counties, that promote greater access to the high paying renewable energy jobs for all students, including populations that are underrepresented in renewable energy careers.</AbstractNarration>
