    <AbstractNarration>The unifying idea behind the investigator's research&lt;br/&gt; is to isolate combinatorial structures that govern or&lt;br/&gt; arise from continuous data. Projects based on this&lt;br/&gt; idea range from computational geometry of polyhedra to&lt;br/&gt; equivariant algebraic geometry. First examples&lt;br/&gt; include a variety of open problems concerning the&lt;br/&gt; computational complexity of shortest paths on convex&lt;br/&gt; polyhedral spheres, as well as the deeper geometry&lt;br/&gt; controlling this complexity. The polyhedral methods&lt;br/&gt; underlying the metric combinatorics that arises in&lt;br/&gt; this context have potential applications to&lt;br/&gt; graph-coloring questions, to the construction of&lt;br/&gt; cycles representing characteristic classes on&lt;br/&gt; piecewise linear manifolds, and to algorithmic&lt;br/&gt; questions in computational biology. The central&lt;br/&gt; issues shed fundamental light on the nature of&lt;br/&gt; convexity and polyhedrality in combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt; topology. In other projects under the umbrella of&lt;br/&gt; extracting discrete phenomena from continuous objects,&lt;br/&gt; the investigator and his colleagues study the&lt;br/&gt; combinatorics of degenerations of algebraic varieties,&lt;br/&gt; often in the presence of Lie group actions. The&lt;br/&gt; irreducible components in such degenerations can index&lt;br/&gt; summands in formulas from combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt; representation theory, thereby giving geometric&lt;br/&gt; explanations for the formulas' positivity. The&lt;br/&gt; degenerations themselves are defined using techniques&lt;br/&gt; from symbolic computational algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many systems in nature and throughout mathematics&lt;br/&gt; involve continuously varying quantities, such as&lt;br/&gt; volume or temperature. Surprisingly, finding order in&lt;br/&gt; such systems is sometimes equivalent to isolating&lt;br/&gt; finite or discrete pieces of information---analogous&lt;br/&gt; to identifying the solid, liquid, and gas phases of a&lt;br/&gt; material---from the underlying continuous framework.&lt;br/&gt; In the investigator's research, the revealed discrete&lt;br/&gt; structures produce abstract mathematical rewards of&lt;br/&gt; deep aesthetic and theoretical significance. However,&lt;br/&gt; concrete applications, especially in the form of exact&lt;br/&gt; algorithmic calculations by computer, often arise as&lt;br/&gt; byproducts of characterizing continuous systems by way&lt;br/&gt; of discrete data. The investigator uses his research&lt;br/&gt; as a context in which to foster a vertically&lt;br/&gt; integrated mentoring environment, modeled on&lt;br/&gt; interactive advising programs more common in&lt;br/&gt; laboratory sciences, aimed at involving undergraduate,&lt;br/&gt; graduate, and postdoctoral students in their&lt;br/&gt; development as teachers as well as researchers.</AbstractNarration>
