    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on providing intelligent and timely instruction through feedback and guidance while solving multi-body statics problems. The computer-based tutor being developed grants students tools to work on truss problems, with reasonably wide latitude to select subsystems, draw free body diagrams, and write and solve equations of equilibrium, in whatever order the user chooses. The tutoring system takes a cognitive-tutor-like approach in which the actual work of a user is viewed in light of an underlying model of student and expert cognition. The underlying model builds upon a conceptual framework in Statics, which has also led to the now widely used conceptual test, the Statics Concept Inventory. The tutoring system communicates the goal structure that underlies the solving of truss problems, which is similar to other multi-body statics problems, promotes a correct, general understanding of the problem-solving knowledge and of the strategic decisions for achieving an efficient solution, and provides immediate feedback on errors relative to the model of desired performance. The development focuses on the usability of the system, the ability of the system to interpret user work as would an instructor viewing paper and pencil work, and on the learning gains of users. This project extends cognitive style tutors to engineering domains, advancing understanding of how to promote learning and education and incorporates that understanding into a practical instructional tool. The infrastructure for education will be enhanced through the development of next-generation computer-based tutoring systems that can serve engineering education broadly. Materials will be disseminated and made available in a sustained way through the Open Learning Initiative, where the OLI Engineering Statics course is currently accessed by thousands of users. The project teams with a college that provides the first 2 years of engineering studies and feeds significant numbers of minority students into Georgia engineering schools. Also, by adapting the tutor so as to provide a stimulating and motivating experience for high school students who study trusses in physics courses, the project is expected to increase the numbers of high school students who choose engineering as a career.</AbstractNarration>
