    <AbstractNarration>This project, a collaboration among Southern Methodist University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, builds on the national investment in the George E. Brown Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). This work integrates state-of-the-art experimental and educational tools into the undergraduate education curricula by using web-based technologies that enable real-time video monitoring, tele-control, and execution of experiments. The project is creating educational modules that build on existing curricula and provide students at the three campuses with new educational tools for better understanding of various theoretical geotechnical engineering concepts. These tools include physical modeling, visual observation of the response of soil and soil-foundation systems, use of instrumentation, interpretation of acquired data, and use of an interactive 3D data viewer for analyzing the measured response. Cross-university teams of students can access, interpret, evaluate and exchange relevant technical information via the Internet, thus bringing major experimentation into geotechnical engineering classes.</AbstractNarration>
