    <AbstractNarration>The WPI REU program in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics provides a unique educational experience for students of the mathematical sciences by introducing them to research in an industrial environment. It provides a glimpse of the many career possibilities which are open to students with a strong mathematical background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students work in teams on problems that come directly from local business and industry. Students work closely with a company representative to define the problem and develop solutions of immediate value to the company. They work closely with a faculty advisor to formulate the problem mathematically and maintain a clear focus on the mathematics at the core of the project. Industrial problems rarely fit into one area of mathematics and this fact is an important part of the research experience. Many projects require some combination of classical analysis, modelling, statistics, optimization, and computer programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from the projects completed in the REU program are of direct importance to the industrial partners and impact research and development at these companies. Further, projects developed for the REU program are often modified for use in secondary school mathematics curricula in order to improve student motivation and generate interest in careers in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program provides challenges to students not faced in standard undergraduate programs and develops skills not always developed in traditional educational programs, such as (a) communication at several levels, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening; (b) problem formulation as an interactive, evolutionary process; and (c) the ability to work with a diverse team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WPI REU Program in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics has existed since 1998 and, since that time, we have worked with 130 students who have come from 99 different U.S. colleges in 31 states and Puerto Rico; exactly 59 of the 130 students were female. Of the 99 universities that have been represented at the REU program over the last 12 year, half of them do not offer a PhD program in mathematics. Altogether, we have worked on 37 different industrial projects sponsored by 17 different companies. Students from the REU program often go on to pursue graduate degrees in mathematics and in other fields, and they also pursue careers in finance and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
