    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to determine the nanoscale material deformation mechanisms induced by magnetic field assisted nanomachining, and to computationally model the nanomachining material removal mechanisms. The completion of this objective will enable machining of surfaces with a roughness value less than 1 nanometer for high-aspect-ratio components such as micropores (20 microns in diameter, 200-250 microns in depth) fabricated by ion or X-ray lithographies. The research approach consists of three tasks. Task 1 is to understand the nanoscale material deformation mechanisms by free abrasive machining, which will drive the development of a model of the material removal mechanism and ferrous particle mixed slurry motion in an alternating magnetic field. Task 2 includes experiments designed to reveal the ferrous particle mixed slurry behavior and abrasive cutting motion in simulated finishing conditions. The results obtained from Tasks 1 and 2 provide feedback for Task 3: optimization of the surface finishing of micropore wall surfaces in silicon and nickel microfabricated chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the outcomes of this research will reveal the physical energy-based surface and sub-surface deformation mechanisms of brittle and ductile materials in the nanometer range and provide a new finishing technology to improve the surface roughness and form accuracy. Moreover, a new design concept for ion and X-ray lithography processes (including magnetic field assisted nanomachining as a post-processing step) will be proposed to achieve desired surface functionality. This new technology will lead to the development of higher value-added next generation microelectromechanical systems and emerging nanoelectromechanical systems used for a variety of equipment from healthcare products to high-resolution astronomical telescopes. The multi-disciplinary research plan will provide a stimulating learning environment for both graduate and undergraduate-level students. The investigators will develop a new mentoring program for underrepresented undergraduates to create relationships that lead to an improved support network that better engages the students in the university engineering experience and enhances their long-term retention in engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
