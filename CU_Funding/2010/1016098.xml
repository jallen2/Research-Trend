    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1016098&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jean-Francois R. Lafont, Michael&lt;br/&gt;W. Davis, Pedro Ontaneda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to provide funding for the conference&lt;br/&gt;Geometry, Topology and Dynamics in Negative Curvature to be held&lt;br/&gt;in Bangalore, India, during the week of August 2-7, 2010. The&lt;br/&gt;conference is an official satellite conference to the 2010&lt;br/&gt;International Conference of Mathematicians (held in Hyderabad,&lt;br/&gt;India). The goal of this conference is to bring together&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians working on different aspects of negatively curved&lt;br/&gt;spaces. It will bring together three distinct communities of&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians: geometers, topologists, and dynamicists. It will&lt;br/&gt;provide a forum for sharing the most recent developments in the&lt;br/&gt;study of spaces of negative (and more generally, non-positive)&lt;br/&gt;curvature. A selection of topics that will be touched upon in the&lt;br/&gt;conference include: (1) Gromov hyperbolic groups, CAT(0)-groups,&lt;br/&gt;and geometric group theory, (2) spaces of metrics (Teichmuller&lt;br/&gt;space, moduli space, representation varieties), (3) links with&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional topology (Geometrization conjecture, mapping class&lt;br/&gt;groups), (4) links with high-dimensional topology (Novikov&lt;br/&gt;conjecture, Borel conjecture), (5) analysis on boundaries of&lt;br/&gt;groups and spaces, (6) Anosov flows and dynamics, (7) flows on&lt;br/&gt;homogeneous spaces and applications to number theory. We expect&lt;br/&gt;the conference to provide a "snapshot" of the current state of&lt;br/&gt;our knowledge in matters related to nonpositively curved spaces,&lt;br/&gt;as well as to provide a roadmap for future research in this&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curvature is a fundamental notion in geometry. Zero curvature is&lt;br/&gt;the most physically familiar, and corresponds to an ordinary flat&lt;br/&gt;surface. Positive and negative curvature can be described&lt;br/&gt;relative to the familiar zero curvature setting as follows: one&lt;br/&gt;tries to "flatten" the surface near a point, and looks to see if&lt;br/&gt;there is too little or too much fabric to achieve the&lt;br/&gt;flattening. For instance, the surface of a cone or of a cylinder&lt;br/&gt;can be unfolded to lie flat, so these also have zero curvature.&lt;br/&gt;But if one tries to flatten the surface of a sphere (think of the&lt;br/&gt;skin of an orange), there is not enough fabric to do this&lt;br/&gt;(i.e. the skin of the orange splits), which corresponds to&lt;br/&gt;positive curvature. Alternatively, if one tries to flatten a&lt;br/&gt;saddle shaped surface, folds appear. There is too much fabric,&lt;br/&gt;which corresponds to negative curvature. A space of nonpositive&lt;br/&gt;curvature can now be described as one having the property that,&lt;br/&gt;near every point and for every pair of directions, it looks&lt;br/&gt;either flat or like a saddle shaped surface. Surprisingly, such&lt;br/&gt;spaces are much more prevalent than one would initially&lt;br/&gt;guess. Aside from the field of geometry, they naturally appear in&lt;br/&gt;numerous other fields of mathematics: topology, dynamics, number&lt;br/&gt;theory, representation theory, etc. Aspects of nonpositive&lt;br/&gt;curvature have also made an increasing appearance in more applied&lt;br/&gt;fields, wherever there has been an interest in understanding the&lt;br/&gt;"shape" of objects (special relativity theory, crystalline&lt;br/&gt;structures in organic chemistry, configuration spaces in&lt;br/&gt;robotics, etc). This conference will bring together international&lt;br/&gt;experts working on various aspects of nonpositively curved&lt;br/&gt;spaces.
