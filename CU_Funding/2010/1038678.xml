    <AbstractNarration>The development of neutral theory has had a profound influence on our understanding of the dynamics of genes, cells, populations and communities by illuminating the case in which types are of equal fitness and hence random or chance events have predominant influence. In particular, neutral theory provides a null model whose failures indicate when mechanisms other than chance are important. However, biologists still lack a way of testing neutral theory that clearly identifies the trait differences driving any specialization or differentiation that exists. The goal of this project is to explore a novel idea for testing neutral theory, using patterns of species' richness, relative abundance, and phylogeny along trait axes. If tangible, the resulting theory would both clearly identify important trait differences, and be robust to uncertainty and complexity in both the population and community contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project could set the stage for a great deal of future work aimed at gaining an understanding of the mechanisms maintaining diversity in specific systems, knowledge that is vital to our ability to manage, conserve, and restore our biological resources. In addition, the investigators will work to encourage the participation of women in mathematical biology by running a focus group on topics related to the research at a summer camp for girls organized by the Women in Science and Engineering program at the University of Michigan. Finally, the PI will integrate the research into General Ecology and Population and Community Ecology courses, and make teaching materials available on-line.</AbstractNarration>
