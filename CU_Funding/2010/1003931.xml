    <AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) at Columbia University. LDEO is located in Palisades, NY. The program will support ten students/year during a ten week summer research program. The intellectual focus is very broad as Lamont-Doherty has over 100 PhD level scientists, and the students have a wide range of mentors whom they can choose. Interns pursue a summer of research, interspersed with special semi-weekly lectures on topics like scientific writing, science careers, ethics, as well as research practicalities such as computing hardware/software resources, and methods for viewing/analyzing scientific data. The program ends with student-authored research poster presentations, including written abstracts and a final paper. This program is not a field-based program, but students have access to global databases and excellent computer equipment. Students will be encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed journals and participate in national conferences following the summer research program.</AbstractNarration>
