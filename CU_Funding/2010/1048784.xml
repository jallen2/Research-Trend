    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Dale Teeters and colleagues Tyler Johannes, Kenneth Roberts and Kerry Sublette from University of Tulsa will acquire a cyber-enabled benchtop high-resolution, accurate-mass, liquid-chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) determination of apurinic/apyrimidinic lesions in DNA, (b) generic engineering of algae to produce biofuels, (c) characterization of artificial i-motifs, (d) screening of proteasomal peptide products, (e) identification of intermediates in the biodegradation of organic compounds, and (f) selective carbon-carbon bond fomation methods and isolation of natural products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. Liquid chromatography is a separation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis. It separates a mixture into its several constituent chemicals which are then analyzed and identified by the mass spectrometer. It is one of the fastest growing and most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques. Because of this, it is important for graduate and undergraduate students to be trained in the technique. In addition to enhancing research projects, the acquisition of an LC-MS/MS will transform several undergraduate laboratories. The cyber-enabling of the spectrometer will allow outreach to many universities in Oklahoma that have significant Native American and African American populations which are underrepresented in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
