    <AbstractNarration>This award supports travel costs for U. S. attendees to the Chapman Conference on Complexity and Extreme Events in Geosciences. Extreme events in Earth and space sciences exhibit many features of complex systems in which many interdependent components lead to organized as well as irregular features. In complex systems the knowledge of the parts does not necessarily lead to the predictable behavior of the entire system. The Conference will be organized by an international team drawn from all areas of geosciences. A key objective of the conference is to target the participation by a broad-based science community, encompassing different subject areas. In particular participation by graduate students, and young researchers are important for the development of the science of extreme events and natural hazards. This award will support the attendance of U. S. graduate students, as well as other participants, including young researchers, and invited speakers.</AbstractNarration>
