    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1460426&lt;br/&gt;PI: O'Hern, Corey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the participation of US scientists and engineers in a symposium titled Statics and Dynamics of Dense Granular Matter, which will be held during the European Solid Mechanics Conference in Madrid, Spain from July 6 - 10, 2015. The symposium will focus on dry granular materials, which are suspensions in which the only interaction between particles occurs when they contact each other. The symposium will provide a way for leading research groups in the U.S. to interact with their European counterparts and other researchers from around the world. Participation by junior researchers will be encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dry granular materials appear in a variety of important industrial and natural processes. These materials pose special problems when they are processed in the dense state, because they can undergo a transition between a flowing and jammed state. The characteristics of jamming depend not only on the granular material but also on the process that leads to jamming. This symposium will cover a range of topics for such materials including packings of frictionless and frictional particles, granular suspensions, constitutive laws for dense flows, shear-induced jamming and shear thickening, and geophysical applications involving granular materials.</AbstractNarration>
