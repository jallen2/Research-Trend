    <AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site Program, Explore it! Building the Next Generation of Sustainable Forest Bioproduct Researchers aims for participants to develop and utilize new knowledge to address forest bioproduct issues impacting society in an ethical manner. The REU Site recruits minorities through extensive use of existing linkages with primarily minority serving institutions. Results are disseminated via campus and international presentations, and through journal articles and symposia. REU students work alongside middle-school teachers creating curricular modules to teach STEM principles to middle school children employing the concept of sustainable forest bioproducts as a vehicle. Participants present to and interact with FBRI faculty, thereby broadening both their and the faculty experiences. Society benefits as participants disseminate their findings, impact middle school education, obtain a broader understanding of research ethics, and further, enroll in graduate school to advance their careers. The international scientific community benefits as the REU participants present their findings to our Chilean colleagues, while learning of the parallel research performed at the University of Concepcion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a continuation of a previously funded REU Site: Explore it! Building the Next Generation of Sustainable Forest Bioproduct Researchers. This REU Site provides 10 undergraduates with a ten week summer research experience, leveraged on the focus areas of the University of Maine, Forest Bioproducts Research Institute (FBRI). Focus on sustainable forest bioproducts is highly topical and of great global importance in the area of sustainable bioproduct alternatives. Students conduct research advancing their knowledge of the field in general and one of the thematic elements, specifically: 1) sustainability and LCA, 2) feedstock extraction/modification, 3), process control and sensing, 4) nanomaterial production and utilization, and 5) new product development. REU funding provides stipends and professional development activities for 30 undergraduates over 3 years. Additional non-NSF REU funded students will participate, including 6 Chilean students on a mutual exchange with 6 US students, thereby broadening the impact of the program. Students are mentored by one of 12 Faculty, all of whom are senior personnel in the FBRI, Maine Maritime Academy (MMA) or University of Concepcion-UDT, Chile. The REU program concludes with a forest products industry field trip to Chile, and also involves a research conference where participants present their work to Chilean faculty and students. A unique set of evaluation and assessment tools are employed that allow tracking of student performance, thus enabling feedback to students and the program alike.
