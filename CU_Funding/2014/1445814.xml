    <AbstractNarration>This CISE award funds part of the core operations of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National Academy of Sciences for a period of 5 years. The CSTB provides objective, scholarly analysis, blending expertise in computer science, electrical engineering, telecommunications, and various applications and impacts of information technology (IT). CSTB's work is known and used by a wide and growing circle of agencies, officials, and experts in the field. CSTB has come to be seen as an authoritative source on IT trends, IT policies, and their implications for broader public policy. CSTB delivers its reports and provides briefings to key decision-makers and practitioners in the research, education, and policy-making communities. Its study groups engage significant numbers of women, minorities, and people from across the country. Core support enables it to plan for, oversee, and follow up on projects, and to be forward-thinking and proactive in formulating new activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding provides for the core research activities and studies of the CSTB. Through its membership of national leaders and industry, CSTB has an ambitious program of activities addressing the health of U.S. computer science, telecommunications, and their applications. CSTB engages experts from the entire IT community in mixed collaborative groups, developing ideas, explanations, assessments, and recommendations reflecting diverse points of view and rigorous peer review. It is a focal point for engaging the research community in the development of new research agendas and in raising the level of policy debate. Core support enables CSTB to plan, oversee, and follow up on projects and students and continue to provide strategic leadership in an area of critical importance to the nation.</AbstractNarration>
