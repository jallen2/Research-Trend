    <AbstractNarration>1451959&lt;br/&gt;Heldt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project proposes a shift in the design and creation of next-generation virus removal and detection technologies. Instead of screening large libraries of chemistries to determine the ones that will most efficiently remove viruses, this project will first examine the surface chemistry of the viruses. This will lead to targeted chemistries that will attract viruses and exponentially increase the efficiency of screening processes. The process to be followed will benchmark new surface evaluation techniques with currently established surface chemistry analysis to determine if chemical forces of viruses can be determined at the single-particle scale. The CAREER education plan will train undergraduate and graduate students to be role models to high school and community college students in order to attract and retain underrepresented minorities to STEM fields. The main focus of the education plan is a collaboration with Wayne County Community College in Detroit, MI to provide engaging and hands-on research opportunities to community college students. The goal is to use research as a vehicle for sustained STEM engagement and to encourage B.S. degree completion. This unique program will expose over 500 inner city students to research opportunities and expanded career options. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is built upon the hypothesis that an advanced understanding of viral surface chemical interactions and interparticle forces will enable a significant transformation in virus removal and detection technologies, dramatically reducing the cost while simultaneously increasing efficiency. The outcome may result in an increase in availability and accessibility to life-saving biotherapies. The overall goal of this CAREER project is to transform virus removal processes by creating a fundamental framework of viral surface and interparticle forces. The specific goals to be accomplished are: 1) Analyze the surface chemistry of several model viruses, 2) Quantify interparticle forces of model viruses and 3) Prototype a surface and interparticle force-informed method for virus removal. This study of surface and interparticle forces will benchmark traditional techniques against novel surface characterizations. Quantitative surface chemistry and interparticle force data will inform an innovative design of virus removal processes. Three relevant viruses will be used in this study, an enveloped mammalian virus, a non-enveloped mammalian virus and a bacteriophage.</AbstractNarration>
