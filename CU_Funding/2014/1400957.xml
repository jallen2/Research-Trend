    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Thermoelectric energy conversion allows for waste-heat recovery and it is an environmentally-friendly process; however, thermoelectric materials typically contain toxic elements. This aspect is problematic for large-scale applications and detracts from the benefits of using this technology. Therefore, finding ways to generate energy from non-toxic and low-cost materials is a high priority for thermoelectrics. This project seeks to develop methodologies for achieving high thermoelectric efficiency in systems composed of earth-abundant and environmentally safe elements. Advancing current fundamental understanding of such materials is beneficial in the development of effective strategies for enhanced thermoelectric properties. Device-related R&amp;D towards prototype manufacturing helps move the thermoelectrics industry towards low cost processes. Results from this research may also be useful for solar cells and photovoltaics, since quaternary chalcogenides are also of interest in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: A major component of this project relies on the predictive power of computational and theoretical methods for materials design. The particular class of quaternary chalcogenides and related derivatives are targeted. Modeling and first principles calculations are directed towards understanding electronic structure features due to chemical and structural features, as well as nanostructuring, to control the transport in a beneficial way. In addition, state-of-the-art synthesis and characterization efforts serve as a benchmark for the proposed theory and as conceptual input for advancing the research further. The partnership with Marlow Industries, Inc., a world leader in commercial thermoelectrics applications, provides additional experimental capabilities for materials and device testing and facilitates work towards a prototype device whose commercial potential can also be evaluated. This synergistic project involves graduate students and it is especially suitable for the USF's PhD program in Applied Physics, the only such doctoral program in the state of Florida. Outreach activities and summer teaching modules for high school students are also a part of this project.</AbstractNarration>
