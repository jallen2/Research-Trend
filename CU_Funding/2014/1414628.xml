    <AbstractNarration>Moore's "law", describing the fantastic increase in performance of transistors, the fundamental building block of computers, is approaching fundamental quantum limits of scalability and performance. These hard limits of smallest size and fastest speed coincide with the explosion of demand for electronics, from phones to the data centers underpinning the internet, and the environmental consequences of generating the electricity to power this infrastructure. One possible solution is to develop an alternative transistor based on a completely different physics: manipulation of the spin state of an electron in place of conventional voltage modulation. Over the past decade, an exciting new field of condensed matter physics, topological insulators, has theoretically postulated and experimentally realized a class of materials possessing a non-trivial relationship between electron spin and momentum. This crucial coupling between the two properties could be the link between the existing paradigm of electronics and future realizations of faster, vastly more energy efficient devices. However the current materials in which these properties are realized remain far from robust in the environmental conditions required to be more than a scientific curiosity. To better understand these existing materials limitations, this project takes advantage of an experimental technique available at Professor Yukio Hasegawa's laboratory at the Institute of Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, called spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), capable of measuring the spin states of electrons with atomic scale spatial resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SP-STM is a particularly well-suited experimental technique within this context; being surface sensitive and atomically resolved allows for the direct observation of how the theoretically predicted topological protection manifests itself in scattering at defect sites. Bismuth selenide, the most promising topological insulator to date, has a crystal structure and mechanical properties making surface preparation of samples for STM relatively facile. Measuring the out of plane spin polarization of electrons at scattering sites will clarify the existing theoretical framework used to understand topological insulators, and inform how to utilize the surface states in spin electronic heterostructures. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
