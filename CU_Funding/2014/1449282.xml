    <AbstractNarration>This study will focus on improving the detection of precursory activity prior to active volcanism at both Augustine and Veniaminof volcanoes, Alaska. The researchers in the study will carry out seismic interferometry using ambient noise recorded at these volcanoes, specifically pre- through post-eruption for the 2002 through 2013 eruptions at Veniaminof and the 2006 Augustine eruption. This method is able to resolve small temporal changes in seismic velocity between station pairs, thus allowing the detection of subtle changes in the volcano over time. A natural extension of this work will include spatial mapping of these temporal changes in seismic velocity from pre- through post-eruption at Augustine volcano. Spatial mapping of these changes in seismic velocity at Augustine will help visualize pre- through post-eruptive structural changes at the volcano. Some important questions related to magma storage and transport at Augustine will be examined including if an inflating shallow magma reservoir exists, and at what point in the eruptive cycle does the shallow magma reservoir inflate. The work will look for indications of magmatic fluid from a shallow magma reservoir, and perturbations to the upper crustal velocity structure serving as an early indicator of eruption. At Veniaminof, they will examine questions related to the progression of magmatic activity leading to eruption, including if there are indications of an inflating magma reservoir prior to eruption, and if inflation of the magma reservoir is followed by the migration of magmatic fluids to shallow depths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Augustine volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in the Cook Inlet and Veniaminof volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc. As such, both volcanoes pose major hazards to local people, air traffic, oil production facilities, and shipping activity. This study will improve our ability to detect precursory activity leading to active volcanism at both Augustine and Veniaminof volcanoes. The proposed study will also fund an early career female scientist, Dr. Ninfa Bennington, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The researchers will create an online website that displays near-real time changes in seismic velocity for both Augustine and Veniaminof volcanoes. This website will be available to both to the general public as an educational resource and to the AVO as a near-real time monitoring tool to assess volcanic activity at Augustine and Veniaminof volcanoes.</AbstractNarration>
