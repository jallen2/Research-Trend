    <AbstractNarration>Recent reports have drawn attention to the challenges the computer science education community is facing producing diverse and qualified graduates to satisfy current and projected workforce needs. This two-day workshop brings together leaders in the computing science education community to discuss the current state of computer science education, identify challenges faced by computer science educators, and identify innovative approaches to address these challenges. Participants come from a diverse range of schools including research universities, small liberal arts colleges and community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result is a report that summarizes the challenges and approaches identified at the workshop. The publication adds to the current body of knowledge in computer science education by providing focus and direction to research efforts over the next five years. The report will be disseminated via the Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) mailing list that reaches over 5,000 educators across the country. It will additionally be presented and discussed at the annual SIGCSE and regional computer science education conferences.</AbstractNarration>
