    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Andrey Vilesov of the University of Southern California, through the auspices of the Gordon Research Conferences, will support the participation of early-career U.S. scientists in an important conference for researchers studying the physics and chemistry of small clusters of atoms and molecules. Providing exposure and opportunities for in-depth interaction between young U.S. scientists to the leaders in the field is an important part in the young scientists development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subjects of this conference (Molecular and Ionic Clusters: Structure and Dynamics of Isolated Particles) are important in understanding the interaction of solutes with solvents (most of the chemistry taking place in the natural environment) as well as understanding the unique chemistry that takes place in atmospheric aerosols. The conference provides a unique venue for bringing together both experimental and computational/theoretical physical chemists.</AbstractNarration>
