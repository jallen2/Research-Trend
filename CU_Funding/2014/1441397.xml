    <AbstractNarration>This award provides travel grants to 20 students to attend the IEEE Cluster 2014 Conference which will be hosted in Madrid, Spain, in September 2014. The students will participate in the regular conference activities and a special student program comprised of sessions that target research presentation training, research experience and career guidance, and industry interaction as well as two lunch sessions with invited speakers. The students have the opportunity to present their own work, and receive valuable feedback from both fellow students and experienced researchers working in the field of cluster computing, and interact with academic and industry researchers in the cluster computing community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is often used as the primary venue for interaction between academic and industrial researchers and designers. Historically, the conferences have attracted top research papers from both academia and industry, and many innovations published in the proceedings have been influential in the understanding of emerging applications and computing systems. Increasing the attendance of students in will expose more students to the exciting developments in the field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the field, which will impact both industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>
