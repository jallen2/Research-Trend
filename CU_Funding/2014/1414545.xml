    <AbstractNarration>The proposed work involves developing an innovative human-technology interface (HTI) system, which allows users to operate and interact with electronic devices solely with expressions and thoughts. The proposed HTI system, with a mobile app as the user interface, will utilize self-learning algorithms along with low-cost commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has always been a need for a more natural and faster human-technology interaction (HTI) experience that goes beyond the traditional button and the latest touch-technology. Outcomes of the proposed research will revolutionize HTI and will provide an effective paradigm that can be applied to a broad range of areas such as mobile devices, home automation systems, audio video systems, video game consoles and auto electronics. Outcomes will be strongly leveraged to foster collaborative networks with multidisciplinary teams of investigators in academia and industry to establish a strong extramurally funded research program to explore other innovative HTI concepts.</AbstractNarration>
