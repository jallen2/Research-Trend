    <AbstractNarration>Manufacturing and service enterprises consume a significant portion of energy; consequently, they impact the environment and sustainability of our societies. There have been a number of initiatives to improve energy efficiencies of homes and commercial buildings. However, over the last five decades energy productivity in industrial enterprises has not kept pace with the remarkable strides that have been made in improving labor and material productivity. At present, and in the foreseeable future, there are significant opportunities to improve energy productivity in these enterprises by reducing energy waste, using better technologies and techniques for designing and managing their operations. This workshop will provide a critical role in defining a roadmap for research and innovation into improving energy-efficiency of all aspects of manufacturing and service enterprise operations, by bringing together researchers in academia, government, and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be organized around sessions focused on the following topics: building operations, logistics operations, grid operations, and factory operations. Leading researchers from academia, government and industry will be invited to contribute via keynote addresses and by serving as panelists. In order to ensure significant participation, poster presentations are solicited as well. In addition, breakout sessions will serve to obtain input from participants on short-term and long-term research needs.</AbstractNarration>
