    <AbstractNarration>The proposed workshop will expose the underrepresented students to major milestones achieved in research on emerging computing paradigms, and will attempt to engage them in critical research issues. The plan is also to expose them to the challenges of interdisciplinary research. Additionally, the workshop will provide the attendees a platform for further networking and potential mentoring opportunities. The inclusion of women and minority experts from academia as well as industry laboratories in the workshop will make this latter goal achievable. Furthermore, the workshop has the potential to foster a sense of community among (underrepresented) students and researchers in fields related to emerging computing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The national need for including women, minorities and other underrepresented groups in STEM areas e.g., in science and engineering, is well known and cannot be overstated. This is particularly true in fields related to computing. The present proposal aims to broaden participation and addresses the lack of representation of minority and women in the particular area of emerging computing and microelectronic design automation. Since the workshop will be attended by underrepresented graduate students as well as by leaders in academia, industry, recruiters and program directors from various federal agencies, it will create a powerful networking, mentoring environment to enhance collaboration and further opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
