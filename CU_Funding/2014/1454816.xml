    <AbstractNarration>Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are not just rare and exotic; recent observations of nearby galaxies have demonstrated that SMBHs are a central component of almost all galaxies. Based on these observations, the best evidence suggests that both the SMBHs and the galaxy grow in mass over time. How does this happen? The researcher has a plan of observations that will show the connection between these central beasts (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. However the observations are difficult. Most SMBHs in the Universe are hidden from view: too distant to measure the gravitational pull on the stars by the SMBH, or too dim from the lack of gas falling onto the SMBH. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher plans to use optical telescopes, which look at the sky automatically and repeatedly every night, to find rare transient events: when stars pass too close to SMBHs. A 'starved' (dormant) black hole will reveal itself when an unlucky star passes close enough to be torn apart by tremendous tides expected near the SMBH. Based on the brightness of the flare, when the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) happens, they will be able to weigh the central SMBH, estimate the black hole spin, as well as constrain the mass, radius, and internal structure of the disrupted star.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has several major intellectual merits: 1) The researcher clearly lays out the status of measuring intermediate-mass and supermassive black hole properties with tidal disruption events and convincingly details how to find thousands of TDE candidates. 3) They plan to increase the sensitivity of Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey with stacking analysis and using the dataset to classify transients of all flavors is the step towards efficiently filtering observations with the new Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. 3) The researcher will help other scientists' research by sharing their machine-learning algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will enhance the Maryland GRAD-MAP program, which encourages women and under-represented groups in STEM fields. She will leverage established success of GRAD-MAP in improving retention rate among physics majors at local minority serving institutions. Her previous experience in GRAD-MAP is significant. PS1 database offers a useful source of data for short research projects as part of the winter workshop. Their experience with PS1 will ensure that the use of this database is maximized. The GRAD-MAP program has evidence of success with five of seven participants following through with research programs during the summer. There is the potential to take 5 success stories and turn them into many more new success stories.</AbstractNarration>
