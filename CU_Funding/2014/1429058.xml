    <AbstractNarration>Geophysical instruments are routinely used in archaeological research to measure different properties of the soil. These instruments can "see" beneath the surface without excavation or disturbance to the site and are used in archaeology for locating intact deposits, revealing information about site organization, and aiding in the placement of excavation units. The University of Southern Indiana (USI) will utilize NSF-MRI funds to purchase a resistivity meter, which is one of most common methods of geophysical prospection used in the Midwest. This instrument will significantly add to the university's ability to produce high quality research and well-trained and employable students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator is currently engaged in a number of research projects that will be greatly facilitated by the acquisition of this instrument. Primary among these is a planned multi-year program of research at Mann, a pre-contact Native American site, dating to A.D. 100-500. Mann is, without a doubt, the most significant site of this time period in the state of Indiana and one of the most important in the midcontinent as a whole. The site is remarkable for its sheer size (430 acres) and the presence of many large earthen mounds. However, the singularly distinctive characteristic of the Mann site is the presence of dense and widespread habitation areas in association with large-scale earthwork construction, a combination of traits not seen elsewhere in the Middle Woodland. Despite the site's unique character, there has been relatively little archaeological research performed at Mann. Recently, the State of Indiana has acquired portions of the site with the goal of preservation in mind. Now that this window of opportunity has opened up, USI is ready to undertake much-needed research at this important site. Geophysical survey at Mann will allow the State to better develop plans for the interpretation and preservation of the site and will assist in developing future land acquisition priorities should the opportunity arise for the purchase of additional parcels. Finally, teis instrument will also be integrated into the teaching/training of USI's undergraduate students. These courses will give anthropology students hands-on experience with cutting-edge instruments used in archaeology and prepare them for future work in the field. Results of the research will be made available to the public through online distribution of the resulting data and reports, and a series of public lectures geared toward a lay audience.</AbstractNarration>
