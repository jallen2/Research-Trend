    <AbstractNarration>IRES: Closing Oceans: Assessing the Dynamics of Turkish suture zones&lt;br/&gt;PI: Catlos, co-PI: Elliott, Kyle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 1:&lt;br/&gt;This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides four weeks of geological field-based research and training experiences across Turkey for 12 US students. Over the next 3 years, these students will investigate suture zones,i.e.locations where ancient ocean basins closed across the country. Turkey contains a large number of these zones, which are key locations used by geologists to understand how continents grow. Continental growth is considered one of the most important problems facing Earth Scientists, yet models for the process are debated, due in part to a lack of geologic record. Because of its extensive outcrops of ancient rocks associated with suture zones, Turkey is an ideal location to study this process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IRES program has societal value, as Turkey's suture zones can be associated with important ore and mineral resources or are regions of major, present-day geologic hazards. Older faults that worked to close the ocean basins today form regions of active earthquake activity or have generated topography that leads to large landslides. Understanding the locations and ages of Turkey's ancient suture zones has an impact on diverse topics, including mineral exploration and hazard reduction. This proposal includes partnerships with faculty at three Turkish universities (Dokuz Eylul University, Middle East Technical University, and Karadeniz Technical University) who will serve as mentors. Students chosen to participate are underrepresented in the geosciences and are selected via Jackson School and UT Austin outreach programs. Students will partner with Turkish researchers to explore a range of geological concepts discussed in their courses while making a significant impact on our understanding of processes related to the formation of continental crust. Students will apply innovative methods to address scientific questions involving both the timing and impacts of Turkey's suture zones, including electronic-based field mapping techniques and new geochemical approaches. This in turn will lead to insight into how the past geological history of Turkey impacts its present day concerns, including the development of economically important resources and hazard mitigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 2:&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how continents grow is recognized as one of the most important geodynamic problems facing Earth Scientists. Models for the process are debated, due in part to a lack of exposure of the geologic record. Because of its extensive exposures of ancient ocean suture zones and crustal fragments, Turkey is an ideal location to study this process. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides four weeks of geological field-based research and training experiences across Turkey for 12 US students. Over the next 3 years, these students will investigate the arc accretion processes that occurred in Turkey during the closure of branches of ancient ocean basins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the IRES program has societal value, as paleogeographic reconstructions are used to identify important economic resources that formed during specific times in Earth's history and assess geologic hazards that result due to reactivation of older faults or mass movement of rocks. This proposal includes partnerships with faculty at 3 Turkish universities (Dokuz Eylul University, Middle East Technical University, and Karadeniz Technical University) who will serve as mentors. Students chosen to participate are underrepresented in the geosciences and are selected via Jackson School and UT Austin outreach programs. Students will partner with Turkish researchers to explore a multidisciplinary range of geological concepts discussed in their courses while making a significant impact on our understanding of processes related to the formation of continental crust. Students will apply new and innovative field mapping, geochemical, and geochronological methods, lending greater insight into the history and mechanics of the assembly of Turkey.</AbstractNarration>
