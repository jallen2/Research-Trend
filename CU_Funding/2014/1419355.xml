    <AbstractNarration>The 16th annual Rustbelt RNA Meeting will be held October 17-18, 2014 at the Marriott City Center Downtown in Pittsburgh, PA. The meeting is an annual regional conference that promotes sharing of new research in RNA science, broadly defined. Recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in the identification and characterization of RNA switches and enzymes, as well as genome-wide approaches to RNA folding and regulation. A major goal of the meeting is to provide opportunities for trainee professional development through presentation of talks and posters; to meet that goal the majority of the talks and presentations will be given by students, postdoctoral associates and early-career faculty. These presentations are a key mechanism for trainees to interact with senior researchers and fellow students in their field. These interactions often form the foundation of long-lasting professional relationships and collaborations. Meetings such as this one fulfill a key mission of NSF by providing educational and development opportunities for the next generation of science professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's meeting will draw regional participation from the Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic United States and provide students and PIs with the chance to learn and share RNA-related research. The meeting will cover topics ranging from long non-coding RNAs to tRNA modification to RNA structure-function studies. The meeting will feature a keynote lecture by Professor Manuel Ares Jr. (University of California, Santa Cruz), former president of the RNA Society and HHMI Professor. Unique features of the meeting will include 1) oral presentations in each session from research conducted by undergraduates, 2) featured poster area highlighting works from undergraduate researchers and PUIs, 3) travel awards for undergraduate and underrepresented minorities, and 4) a workshop on career transition for trainees hosted by group leaders from industry and academic research institutions.</AbstractNarration>
