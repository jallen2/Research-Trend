    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the Chicago Botanic Garden (Glencoe, IL) will support the training of 10 students over 10-week periods during the summers of 2015-2017. This REU Site's focus is on plant biology and conservation, spanning from genomic to ecosystem levels. Mentors are drawn from the Garden, Northwestern University, and partner institutions. Mentors' diverse areas of expertise enable students to conduct research on a variety of topics, including evolution, pollination, conservation, genetics, invasive species, soil science, and restoration ecology. Students participate in professional-development activities; field trips; and weekly discussions addressing topics like ethics, graduate school, and scientific communication. The REU program is integrated into a near-peer training continuum: participants are paired with graduate student co-mentors and high school mentees. Target participants include students from groups underrepresented in the sciences, those who are the first in their family to attend college, non-traditional students, veterans, and students who lack extensive research opportunities at their home institutions. Students are recruited nationally and are selected based on their academic record, statement, letter of recommendation, potential to benefit from the experience, interviews with prospective mentors, and program goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from groups underrepresented in the sciences and schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. In addition, the Garden hosts affiliated interns who add to the diverse research community experienced by REU participants. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. All participants will present their findings at a large, multiple-institution symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are tracked to evaluate the effects of this research experience on their future academic and career paths. Information about the program is assessed through follow-up surveys, including use of an REU common assessment tool.
