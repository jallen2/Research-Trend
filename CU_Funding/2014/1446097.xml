    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this NUE program, Nanotechnology Education for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing, at Oklahoma State University (OSU) under the direction of Dr. Matthew J. Klopfstein, is to educate undergraduate students in core nanotechnology topics for high precision Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing by developing educational modules for key undergraduate courses in engineering, measurements, manufacturing, mechatronics, automatic control, and vibrations. R2R manufacturing of flexible materials offers significant advantages over batch processing including better yields, high speed automation, and the potential to mass produce finished materials at substantially lower costs. The project team plans to systematically develop curriculum material in nanotechnology and high precision R2R manufacturing in the following six undergraduate courses: Introduction to Engineering, Measurements, Manufacturing Processes, Mechatronics, Automatic Control, and Vibrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large number of OSU students, approximately 800 undergraduate students per year, will be potentially impacted by this curriculum, including up to 400 first-year engineering students. In addition to significantly impacting the undergraduate curriculum and student learning in high precision R2R manufacturing, the proposed project will broadly impact a number of other education and outreach activities. These activities include involvement of underrepresented students, interaction with middle/high school students and teachers, and opportunities for undergraduate students to interact with practicing engineers. The project team will work with three programs at OSU: Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP), the Multicultural Engineering program (MEP) and the Women in Engineering, Architecture and Technology (WEAT) program to actively recruit and retain students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
