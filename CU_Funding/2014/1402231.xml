    <AbstractNarration>1402231&lt;br/&gt;Sung&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to develop comprehensive chemical kinetic models for diesel fuel combustion. The methodology will also be important to fuel research for many other applications, including aviation, propulsion, industrial combustion, power generation, and several other chemical processes. The chemical kinetic models and the underlying methodology will be widely disseminated through the principal investigator's research website, presentations, and publications. The PI's research group participates in the NSF GK-12 program, where local high school students experience ongoing research through laboratory tours and presentations, to promote interest in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A three-year research program is proposed to fill in gaps in fundamental combustion data on fuel components and mixtures relevant to diesel fuel that is commonly proposed for use in next-generation engines. These newly-acquired data, along with the available literature data, will be used to develop and validate predictive chemical kinetic models (in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) to predict combustion chemistry at engine relevant conditions. Specifically, autoignition characteristics of lean-to-stoichiometric mixtures of various fuels will be investigated at pressures and temperatures in the ranges of 10-75 bar and 600-1100 K, respectively. Rapid compression machines will be used to determine ignition delay while species evolution will be measured using in-situ mid-IR absorption spectroscopy and ex-situ gas sampling. The outcome of the proposed study will greatly help reduce the design cycle for improved engine efficiency and reduced emissions.</AbstractNarration>
