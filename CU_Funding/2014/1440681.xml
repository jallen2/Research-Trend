    <AbstractNarration>The University of South Dakota's CC*IIE Networking Infrastructure: Science DMZ for Campus Bridging and Computationally Assisted Research project aims to improve scientific data movement by isolating research network traffic from the friction of the traditional campus network. Traditional enterprise networks are designed to support applications serving a variety of organizational missions as well as security measures to protect the organization's financial and other sensitive data. The result is a network that is neither designed for nor capable of serving the mission of data intensive research. The dedicated research network (Science DMZ) supports the following objectives: (1) Provide friction-free access to wide area networks; (2) Support streamlined end-to-end data flows from experimental data acquisition through analysis and post analysis; and (3) Ensure secure performance of data transfer applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Science DMZ enables a multidisciplinary collaborative research campus, supporting campus bridging in several disciplines including: particle physics, neuroscience, materials science, biomedical research, biology, and renewable energy. Laid out in the wider context of the USD's Campus Cyberinfrastructure plan, the project incorporates national best practices in network implementation and measurement as well as federated authentication. The implementation plan includes a dedicated Data Transfer Node, specifically configured to enable data transfers across wide area networks. These goals are being realized through network optimization with tools such as perfSONAR for monitoring network performance. The project accelerates the adoption of national best practices in big data movement and contributes to South Dakota's continued competitiveness as an EPSCoR state.</AbstractNarration>
