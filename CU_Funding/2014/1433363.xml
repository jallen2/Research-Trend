    <AbstractNarration>PI: Susan M. Lunte&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1433363&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Gordon Research Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: 2014 Bioanalytical Sensors GRC/GRS, Newport, RI, June 21-22, 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layperson description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bioanalytical sensors play a critical role in managing diseases in terms of diagnosis and prognosis as well as in selecting treatments and tracking their effectiveness. Highly novel and unpublished research will be presented and freely discussed at the 2014 Bioanalytical Sensors Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Graduate Research Seminar. These discussions will form the basis for new collaborations between diverse conference participants and will assist new researchers in developing and enhancing their programs. The interactions and ideas sparked by this conference will lead to future development of biosensors and monitoring systems for disease diagnosis and health management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 GRC on Bioanalytical Sensors will focus on the interface of materials and biology. Sessions on sensing at interfaces, new nanomaterial platforms, and optical and mass spectrometric-based sensors have been included in the program. Emerging and enabling technologies for the measurement of proteins and small molecules in cells, tissues, and whole organisms will also be presented. These include new approaches to in vivo sensing, novel microfluidic platforms, and separation-based sensors. The Graduate Research Research Seminar (GRS) that precedes it will provide an intimate environment in which graduate students and postdocs with a broad range of knowledge and skill sets can freely discuss their work and ideas in a highly intellectual and rigorous manner. The focus of the GRS is on biosensor development and field applications, including point-of-care sensors for clinical, environmental, agricultural, and food testing. Specific topics will include nanomaterials, microfluidics, engineered surfaces, multiplexed detection in complex matrices, and signal transduction methodologies. Keynote speakers for the meetings will be leading scientists in the areas of point-of-care diagnostics, sensor biocompatibility, separation science, and nanomaterials. Due to the unique format of the Gordon Research Conferences, all participants will have ample opportunity for discussions regarding research that is being presented orally as well as in the poster sessions. An important goal of this conference is to foster cross-disciplinary work and generate new research collaborations. The current program also has a high degree of diversity with regard to speakers and participants, including individuals from academia, government, and the private sector. Special consideration has also been given to the inclusion of women and minorities; there are also a significant number of international researchers included in the program. In addition, emerging investigators (new faculty, graduate students, pre- and postdoctoral trainees) will be given ample opportunity to present and discuss their research during the two meetings.</AbstractNarration>
