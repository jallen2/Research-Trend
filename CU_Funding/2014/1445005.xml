    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support to students and researchers to attend a Workshop o Defects on Wide Bandgap semiconductors. Some of the budget will also be used to partially support meeting expenses. The meeting will take place in the University of Maryland, College Park MD on September 22, 2014.. It is the first in its series to foster the important field of defects in wide bandgap semiconductors paving the way toward a better understanding of the fundamental limitations existing in power devices and electronics. Key researchers in the field have been invited to participate in the symposium A strong student and young researcher participation is also expected.</AbstractNarration>
