    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL PART: This project will provide 10 undergraduate students each summer with an introduction to materials research while encouraging interested students to pursue a graduate degree in a materials-related field. During the 10-week program, students will participate in independent research projects under the guidance of Cornell faculty. A stimulating cohort experience will be created through a leadership workshop, weekly seminars, field trips, a presentation workshop, a concluding symposium, and a variety of informal activities. In addition, a teacher-training program that specifically targets teachers in schools that serve large underrepresented minority and low socioeconomic status populations will increase student achievement in science by providing professional development activities for 5 middle school and high school teachers per year. The two-summer progressive program will include both a six-week team-research experience that introduces teachers to materials research as well as a six-week independent research experience to enable in-depth exploration. Both programs will include curriculum development activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL PART: An exceedingly wide variety of scientific and engineering research will be accomplished under this program, exploring materials-related topics in biomaterials, energy, soft materials, and hard materials. Individual projects will range from the development of new materials for high performance batteries to studies of mechanical properties degradation in injured cartilage to the computational design of materials for next-generation microelectronics. With the guidance of top researchers and their groups, participating undergraduates and teachers will construct scientific apparatus, perform experiments, model material properties, analyze data, and contribute to the general materials knowledge base and to their own education and training.</AbstractNarration>
