    <AbstractNarration>This is funding provides partial support to about 18 dissertation stage US-based doctoral students to participate in the Doctoral Colloquium that is a part of the IEEE Viz Conference to be held November 9-14, 2014 in Paris, France. The Doctoral Colloquium at IEEE VIS is a research-focused meeting which has taken place annually at the visualization conferences since 2006, and has helped launch the careers of a number of outstanding young researchers. The primary goal of the Doctoral Colloquium is to allow students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders and with their peers, who will provide helpful feedback and fresh perspectives. The workshop will support community building by connecting beginning and advanced researchers and foster a network of colleagues across the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visualization, or the use of interactive graphics to support data analysis and understanding, has become an integral part and critical component of many application areas. IEEE VIS is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, now bringing together about thousands researchers and practitioners from around the world with a shared interest in techniques, tools, and technology. VIS consists this year of the 25th Annual IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis), the 20th Annual IEEE Information Visualization Conference (InfoVis), and the 9th Annual IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology Conference (VAST). It will also include the IEEE Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV), the workshop on Beyond Time and Errors: Novel Evaluation Methods for Visualization (BELIV), and the International Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec). The papers will be published in the special conference issue of IEEE Transactions of Visualization and Computer Graphics -- a widely cited venue.
