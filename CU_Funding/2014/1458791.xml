    <AbstractNarration>This student scholarship project will study and refine the important elements that assist talented biology, chemistry and physics majors at local community colleges in smoothly transitioning into Bachelor's degree and research programs at a four-year institution and then on to PhD programs or research careers in the sciences. The project, Retaining Emerging Alamo Colleges Talent in STEM (REACT-STEM), will support at least 20 scholars, providing each with up to $10,000/year for up to 3 years. Students from the Alamo Community College System will be recruited and provided with support mechanisms to increase retention, provide mentoring and guidance, help to find undergraduate research laboratory opportunities, and assist them in applying to PhD programs of national prominence. The project will conduct assessments to identify the methods that are most effective in recruiting and supporting students and launching their careers in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Retaining Emerging Alamo Colleges Talent in STEM (REACT-STEM) project will implement activities to fulfill four objectives: 1) Encourage community college student matriculation to a four-year university and program recruitment through effective advertising and interaction with existing student success programs. 2) Facilitate transfer student transition and retention at the University of Texas San Antonio through financial assistance, pre-semester boot camp, weekly Strong Transitions meetings, connections with peer mentors and connections with research PI mentors. 3) Promote academic excellence through enrollment in the Honors College, faculty mentoring, peer study connections and professional guidance and tutoring. 4) Promote STEM career development, self-efficacy, and identity by creation of Individual Development Plans, attendance at seminars, field trips to local biotech companies, career services presentations, research experiences and volunteer outreach activities. Assessment of the efficacy of these different activities will help contribute to expanding the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which scholarship projects of this type are successful.</AbstractNarration>
