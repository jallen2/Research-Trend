    <AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;The Nanotechnology Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) with a Focus on Community Colleges at Rice University will provide community college students in the Greater Houston area with summer research internships in the field of nanotechnology. The program aims to engage traditionally underrepresented students in the STEM fields by recruiting from community colleges including those that are primarily minority serving institutions. Through laboratory experiences and interactions with faculty, post-docs, and student mentors at Rice University, REU participants will be exposed to STEM research, applications, and careers. Studies show that participation in undergraduate research supports the transition from two-year to four-year colleges and provides a pathway to graduate school and research careers. Students in this program will work on projects that involve real-world applications in the field of energy, medicine, and environmental health. In addition, the program provides considerable training and mentoring of these students not only through the support of the participating Rice faculty, staff, and students but through its strong infrastructure established to promote diversity and student success. A main outcome of the program is to impact students, who otherwise would not have considered STEM research or careers, with enriching and transformative research experiences resulting in a more diverse and expanded STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;The Nanotechnology Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) with a Focus on Community Colleges at Rice University will provide ten community college students in the Greater Houston area with a ten-week summer research internship in the field of nanotechnology. The program aims to impact traditionally underrepresented students in the STEM fields who are represented in significant numbers in the local community colleges. Through laboratory experiences and interactions with faculty, post-docs, and student mentors at Rice University, REU participants will be exposed to STEM research, applications, and careers. Studies show that participation in undergraduate research support the pathway to graduate school and research careers. In addition, the program provides considerable training and mentoring of these students not only through the support of the participating Rice faculty, staff, and students but through its strong infrastructure established to promote diversity and student success. Rice University has made demonstrable strides in the field of nanotechnology with its extensive research facilities, interdisciplinary collaboration, and landmark breakthroughs. This REU program will provide opportunities for students to conduct research involving STEM applications in energy, medicine, and environmental health. Nanotechnology is multidisciplinary, and thus, the research usually brings together many fields of engineering and science. Students will have various research areas for participation that include: synthesis and characterization of new nanomaterials; air and water purification; photonics and plasmonics; medical imaging, diagnoses, and treatment; and clean energy.</AbstractNarration>
