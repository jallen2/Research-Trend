    <AbstractNarration>This request is for support to broaden and diversify the student participation&lt;br/&gt;in the 23rd International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT&lt;br/&gt;2014). PACT is the premier event that brings together researchers from architecture, compilers,&lt;br/&gt;applications and languages to present and discuss innovative research of common interest.&lt;br/&gt;The students receiving travel support will benefit from the opportunity to engage in the technical, &lt;br/&gt;professional, educational and social exchanges that PACT fosters. &lt;br/&gt;The conference serves as an open forum to exchange research results and develop new ideas,&lt;br/&gt;as an educational platform to expose students to new research methodologies, tools, and infrastructures,&lt;br/&gt;and as a social event to network and prepare students as future researchers. &lt;br/&gt;More broadly, this travel support will increase the attendance of under-represented minorities&lt;br/&gt;and talented undergraduate students, attracting them to graduate schools.</AbstractNarration>
