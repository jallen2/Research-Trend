    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to support a 1.5 day workshop for potential users of the newly created PhantomNet Mobile Testbed, that is being supported by an NSF CISE Research Infrastructure (CRI) Community Infrastructure Award. This workshop will be held on the campus of the University of Utah in fall 2014. PhantomNet is a testbed facility aiming to enable research and teaching at the intersection of mobile networking, cloud computing and software defined networking. PhantomNet leverages the time-tested Emulab testbed control stack and is integrated with the Emulab instance at the University of Utah. There are two primary goals for the workshop. The first is to provide potential users of the facility with hands-on exposure to the testbed to enable them to understand how PhantomNet can be used in their research and teaching. The second is to garner input from the target user community about the desired functionality of the testbed to enable the PhantomNet team to prioritize development tasks for the remainder of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As it is freely and remotely available to all academic institutions, the hands-on teaching that PhantomNet enables as part of this workshop is expected to better equip teachers and students alike in domains that are critically important to modern society. In addition, getting input from the user community relatively early in the development of the facility will help the PhantomNet team adjust their development priorities to better serve the community needs.</AbstractNarration>
