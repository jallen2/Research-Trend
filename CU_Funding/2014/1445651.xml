    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is to assess the research needs and opportunities in the development and implementation of a national-scale Learning Health System (LHS). Realizing such a transformative vision represents a profound socio-technical challenge requiring not only collaboration among multiple and diverse stakeholders, but also a new cross-disciplinary science of cyber-social ecosystems to address the myriad novel scientific research challenges the LHS presents. The proposed workshop will be convened at a cross-disciplinary, integrative symposium on January 5-6, 2015 at the 48th International Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS-48). Bringing together the workshop with this conference will leverage a unique opportunity to develop an understanding of the fundamental knowledge needed for the development of a LHS and the new cross-disciplinary science of cyber-social ecosystems within a broad scientific community, including those for information technology, systems science, healthcare and other non-related fields. The workshop is expected to have a significant impact on the development of a research agenda for a Learning Health System. Leveraging the multidisciplinary expertise at the HICSS-48 conference will be an important next step in moving this work forward and advancing a new science.</AbstractNarration>
