    <AbstractNarration>Organizations in the U.S. and Canada collaborate extensively in collecting and sharing various types of cyberdata for purposes of border security, environmental management, economic production, health protection, and other shared goals. Organizations of all major types--governmental, private-sector, and non-profit (or NGO)--have responsibilities that involve major coordination with cross-border network partners. Recent revelations about privacy breaches have led to concerns on both sides of the border about cyberdata privacy and security. The extant turmoil over cross-border cyberdata privacy makes this project a fit with the timeliness key element of the RAPID program. This research aims to examine how Canadian and U.S. workers in all major types of cross-border organizations handle cyberdata in their efforts to achieve both cyberdata privacy and security, and important inter-organizational (especially cross-border) goals. The study provides information about data privacy and security strategies useful to organizations, governments, and individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study have broad implications for theory and research, not just for knowledge of influences on cyber data privacy, but also for the broader national- and organizational culture, identity, and values lines of scholarship. On the practical side, the findings have bearing on education, policy-decision making, and training about cybersecurity practices and privacy protections at the cross-national, national, and organizational levels. The results may provide security, border-management, and border-spanning organizations with information and ideas relevant to creating technologies and systems that successfully integrate cyber-data collection and sharing by organizations, with privacy concerns and rights of individuals.</AbstractNarration>
