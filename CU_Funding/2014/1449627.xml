    <AbstractNarration>The March 2011 Great Eastern Japan Earthquake (GEJE), resulting tsunami, and Fukushima Dai-ichi&lt;br/&gt;power plant safety systems failures were catastrophic for Japan, and have influenced risk&lt;br/&gt;perceptions and policies globally. The nature of that influence remains an active area of&lt;br/&gt;social scientific inquiry. Early findings suggest that risk communication and management inadequacies&lt;br/&gt;contributed to the social amplification of events. The symposium will provide&lt;br/&gt;a timely opportunity to synthesize emerging social and behavioral risk research findings regarding&lt;br/&gt;these extreme events, develop a risk communication and management research agenda to address&lt;br/&gt;the challenges identified, and inform ongoing international risk communication and disaster&lt;br/&gt;risk reduction efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research to date on the nature and consequences of Great Eastern Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and Fukushima-related risk communications identifies a wide range of contributory factors, ranging from lack of scientific consensus&lt;br/&gt;and public misconceptions about the risks, to social amplification of risk by the media, lack&lt;br/&gt;of transparency by management, and insufficient public engagement. Nevertheless, an overarching&lt;br/&gt;synthesis and assessment of theoretical implications and resulting risk communication research&lt;br/&gt;questions stemming from these events is lacking, and would advance the related risk and decision&lt;br/&gt;sciences. Extreme events of the last decade have increased in impact, heightening the global focus on&lt;br/&gt;the necessity of disaster risk reduction. International efforts to improve the evidence base&lt;br/&gt;for risk management include the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) supported by the&lt;br/&gt;United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), the International Council&lt;br/&gt;for Science (ICSU), and the International Social Science Council (ISSC) and UNISDR activities,&lt;br/&gt;including its lead role in developing a post-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action. Risk Interpretation&lt;br/&gt;and Action (RIA) is a key activity of the IRDR, with the aim of understanding how people, both&lt;br/&gt;decision-makers and ordinary citizens, make decisions, individually and collectively, in the&lt;br/&gt;face of risk, and thereby contributing to an integrated research approach to disaster risk&lt;br/&gt;reduction, to ultimately decrease disaster risks worldwide. The proposed symposium advances&lt;br/&gt;this agenda, as well as integration of this research with research on the communication and&lt;br/&gt;management of extreme technological risks, and enhances collaboration between Japan and the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. in the social, decision and risk sciences.</AbstractNarration>
