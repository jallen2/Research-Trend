    <AbstractNarration>NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and require a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science and engineering. The fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the future. This fellowship to Maria Vasquez supports a research and training plan at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the laboratory of Lars Tomanek and includes a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science. The research examines how heat and hyposalinity stresses affect both native and invasive species of mussels in field and laboratory experiments. The research introduces the Fellow to molecular genetic and proteomics techniques and provides research mentoring to undergraduate students, including those from groups under-represented in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intertidal marine organisms inhabit a stressful environment with multiple environmental stressors that can perturb physiological tolerances thereby shifting species ranges of both native an invasive species. This research utilizes proteomics, a method to observe global protein abundance, to understand tolerance limits and potential environmenatl impacts on two intertidal mussel species by testing responses to multiple environmental stressors. In addition, the potential role of sirtuins (involved in post-translational modifications) as a mechanism in the stress response of marine intertidal invertebrates is being investigated. The research integrates both complex methodologies and experimental designs to better simulate the multiple stressor environment inhabited by marine intertidal species.</AbstractNarration>
