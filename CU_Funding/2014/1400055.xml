    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory for the 2014/2015 academic year. This series consists of three mini-conferences in Atlanta, on the campuses of Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Georgia State University. These conferences will be scheduled in November 2014, February 2015, and April 2015. Each conference will feature two one-hour lectures by one distinguished researcher, several one-hour lectures by established researchers mainly from the Southeast, and several thirty-minute talks by junior researchers and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory, begun in 2010, has become a major event for the combinatorics community in the Southeast, providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and institutes within the southeast region of the United States. The featured lectures and other invited talks cover a variety of topics in graph theory and combinatorics. These conferences have inspired young researchers and will continue to provide opportunities for young researchers and graduate students to interact with each other and with established researchers.</AbstractNarration>
