    <AbstractNarration>This project is to create a specialty symposium titled Weather Radar and Hydrology (WRaH). This symposium will discuss the rapid advances in radar-based estimation of precipitation contributing to the improvement of understanding the state-of-the-art precipitation processing tools and products. It is expected to shed light on several issues of radar-based precipitation products which include: 1) Enhancements in radar-based precipitation processing algorithms resulting in improved precipitation products; 2) Bias correction methods for radar-based precipitation; 3) emerging tools to incorporate precipitation products in distributed hydrologic modeling efforts, 4) precipitation products that can be made available for real-time applications, 5) new approaches to rainfall-based hydrologic design standards utilizing historical radar rainfall data and 6) lessons learned from national and international experiences of use of radar data for variety of applications. The economic drivers of radar-rainfall technology are important to the US and, eventually, the world economy. This symposium activity will lead to improved hydrologic design standards derived from radar rainfall data and create economic development opportunities for many agencies.</AbstractNarration>
