    <AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is supporting fundamental research of Professor Jimmie D. Weaver at Oklahoma State University. Professor Weaver will study photoinitiated electron transfer as a means of activating halogenated arenes, heteroarenes, and polyfluorinated arenes towards carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. This research will provide fundamental understanding of the reactivity of transient radical and radical ion species as well as new methods for the construction of important chemical motifs. Proposed routes are shorter, more efficient and allow the syntheses of previously inaccessible structures. In addition, Professor Weaver will integrate the research and educational components of this project by providing a nontraditional based lab experience which exposes undergraduates to cutting edge research, as well as an outreach program aimed at stimulating curiosity in science among elementary students. His research group will develop a database of essential information on the relevant electrochemical properties of molecules in an easily accessible online platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, new methods will be developed for the photochemical synthesis of alkylated, arylated, and alkenylated arenes, heteroarenes and polyfluorinated arenes by formation of strategic carbon-carbon bonds. Changes to the leaving group, the electronic structure of the arene, and the photocatalyst all factor into the nature of the observed reaction. A variety of mechanistically distinct reactions will be developed. This research will facilitate: 1) the design of safer reactions that do not involve highly reactive chemicals, 2) the use of less expensive chemical processes for which no prefunctionalization is needed, and 3) the development of reactions with high chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance.</AbstractNarration>
