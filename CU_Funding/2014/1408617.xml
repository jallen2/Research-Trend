    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Many energy conversion, energy storage, and information processing technologies involve ion diffusion through nano- or mesostructured inorganic solids. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, this project involves integrated theoretical and experimental research aimed at understanding and controlling such ion diffusion processes, with the overarching goal of yielding both new materials and new fundamental knowledge with broad impact on future technologies involving ion diffusion. This project also aims to provide advanced education and training in interdisciplinary materials chemistries, preparing participants to be future leaders in science, engineering, and education. Special emphasis is given to integration of research and education at the undergraduate level through (a) aggressive involvement of undergraduates in the proposed research, (b) incorporation of experiments and concepts from the proposed research into the University of Washington (UW) undergraduate laboratory curriculum, (c) collaboration with faculty from undergraduate institutions, including hosting such faculty and their undergraduate students as visiting scientists at UW, and (d) mature outreach activities at North Seattle Community College and various Seattle high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The research is focused on detailed investigations of ion diffusion mechanisms in II-VI semiconductor nanocrystals, balancing experimental and theoretical efforts by applying a combination of sophisticated spectroscopic and chemical techniques in conjunction with rigorous analytical methods and first-principle electronic structure theories and molecular dynamics to study ion (H+, Li+, K+, etc.) diffusion into/out of colloidal II-VI semiconductor nanocrystals with systematic variation of key structural parameters. The project objectives include investigating the kinetics and thermodynamics of ion diffusion in II-VI semiconductor nanocrystals, developing new complex-composition nanomaterials guided by theory, and exploring such processes and materials as model systems for next-generation ion batteries. The deep fundamental understanding of ion diffusion in nanostructures gained from this research promises to define the guiding principles needed for creating new ion battery frameworks and new complex materials by design.</AbstractNarration>
