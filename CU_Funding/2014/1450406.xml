    <AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to the sixth Midwest Verification Day (MVD), to be held at the University of Missouri-Columbia in October 2014. MVD is an informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a regional research network in verification and formal methods. The funds will help support U.S. based students, with a special focus on PhD. students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend MVD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area. An event like MVD is a helpful stepping stone on the way to successful engagement with the broader international research community.</AbstractNarration>
