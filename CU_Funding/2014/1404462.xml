    <AbstractNarration>Direct detection of cosmic gravitational waves, an upcoming "disruptive innovation" in the field of astrophysics, will revolutionize our understanding of the universe in novel and plausibly unexpected ways. The key instruments for the new discoveries in the United States are the detectors of the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, aLIGO. The research program of the Columbia Experimental Gravity group supports upcoming gravitational wave discoveries by improving the quality of the aLIGO data-streams available for astrophysical science extraction. The group also pioneers data analysis involving multiple cosmic messengers and gravitational waves. Many cosmic objects with strong gravitational fields also possess the strongest magnetic fields, the densest (bulk) nuclear matter, and the highest neutrino fluxes in the universe. Mergers and emissions of these objects can guide us to new physics, and can tell us about elusive cosmic events. Combining information from different windows on the universe, including gravitational waves, will enable us to reconstruct cosmic mysteries of our times. Students from high school through graduate level will have the opportunity to participate in this research. The urban setting and existing outreach infrastructure of Columbia University will enable unique educational and outreach activities based on this research that target schools and the general public not only in the local community but also in the greater New York City metropolitan area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the critical limitations to aLIGO's scientific reach will be the artifacts embedded in the data due to disturbances in the detector's physical environment. The identification of environmental noise sources, the mitigation of their effect in the interferometers as well as the verification of instrument timing is vital (i) for ensuring a discovery that is justifiable to the broader scientific community, and (ii) for the realization of a spectrum of primary science goals for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. These all rely on achieving the design sensitivity for the advanced detectors and on achieving the lowest possible false event rates. In particular, the group will provide expertise in detector noise performance, physical environmental monitoring, and detector diagnostics studies. The anticipated "dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy" will enable detailed analysis of the science reach of gravitational-wave searches. Building on past experience the Columbia Experimental Gravity group's scientific focus will be on the foundations, implications and science extraction from joint searches that may involve neutrinos, electromagnetic and other counterparts to gravitational-waves from cosmic explosions, mergers, and other sources.</AbstractNarration>
