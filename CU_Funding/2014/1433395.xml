    <AbstractNarration>EFRI-1433395&lt;br/&gt;Balandin (Univ. of California-Riverside)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-tecnmical description: This research addresses a new class of ultra-thin film materials, termed van der Waals materials, and heterostructures implemented with such materials; specifically this project investigates novel electrical, optical, and thermal phenomena in such materials and heterostructures. The work will result in new material synthesis techniques and enable practical applications of ultra-thin film materials in electronic switches, optical detectors, low-power information processing and direct energy conversion. The novel devices implemented with the ultra-thin films of van der Waals materials have potential for high speed and low energy dissipation. The creation of all-metallic switches and electrical-optical transducers will have a strong impact on the Nation's defense needs owing to the inherent radiation hardness of all-metallic devices. The software tools developed in this project will be made freely available to a broad R&amp;D community. This research will increase US economic competitiveness, develop a globally competitive STEM workforce, and contribute to undergraduate and graduate STEM education. The project team developed a detailed Broadening Participation Plan that will impact K-12, undergraduate and graduate education of minorities underrepresented in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: This interdisciplinary project investigates the broad class of two-dimensional materials and heterostructures of transition-metal dichalcogenides, which reveal a range of novel switching phenomena related to confinement-induced modification of electron and phonon band structure, proximity effects, exciton condensation and strongly correlated phenomena. The project goals are to synthesize high-quality, atomically-thin transition-metal dichalcogenide films with controlled crystalline phase (e.g., 1T vs. 2H); fabricate suspended two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenide films and field-effect-transistor type devices; explore electrical, optical and thermal phenomena in these structures and devices; and utilize novel switching phenomena observed in these structures for the creation of low-power logic gates, all-metallic radiation-hard switches and optical-electrical transducers. To achieve these goals, the interdisciplinary project team includes recognized researchers with complementary expertise, prior experience of cooperation and an extensive publication record in two-dimensional materials. The results of this transformative research will add to the growing core knowledge about the electrical, optical and thermal properties of two-dimensional materials and heterostructures implemented with transition-metal dichalcogenides and related layered structures. The project will lead to a better understanding of correlated phenomena, excitonic effects, and the hetero-interface electronic and phonon properties of two-dimensional materials. The information about the electron and phonon transport properties of heterostructures will allow the team to exploit novel electrical and optical switching phenomena for developing innovative devices. The team will produce a detailed Materials Property Database with electron and phonon materials data for transition-metal dichalcogenide films, heterostructures, and twisted few-layer materials. The research project addresses all three EFRI thrust areas.</AbstractNarration>
