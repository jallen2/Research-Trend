    <AbstractNarration>How do our brains take the light entering our eyes and turn it into our experience of the world around us? Critically, this experience seems to involve a visual "vocabulary" that allows us to understand new scenes based on our prior knowledge. The investigators explore the nature of this visual language, exploring the specific computations that are realized in the brain mechanisms used for scene perception. The work combines data from state-of-the-art computer vision systems with human neuroimaging to both predict brain responses when viewing complex, real-world scenes, and to analyze and understand the hidden structure embedded in real-world images. This effort is essential for building a theory of how we are able to see and for improving machine vision systems. More broadly, biologically-inspired models of vision are essential for the effective deployment of intelligent technology in navigation systems, assistive devices, security verification, and visual information retrieval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artificial vision system adopted in this research is highly data-driven in that it is learning about the visual world by continuously "looking at" real-world images on the World Wide Web. The model, known as "NEIL" (Never Ending Image Learner, http://www.neil-kb.com/), leverages cutting-edge big-data methods to extract a vocabulary of scene parts and relationships from hundreds of thousands of images. The relevance of this vocabulary to human vision will then be tested using both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) neuroimaging. The hypothesis is that the application of prior knowledge about scenes expresses itself through learned associations between the specific parts and relations forming the vocabulary for scene perception. Moreover, different kinds of associations may be instantiated within distinct components of the functional brain network responsible for scene perception. Overall, this research will build on a recent, highly-successful artificial vision system in order to provide a more well-specified theory of the parts and relations underlying human scene perception. At the same time, the research will provide information about the human functional relevance of computationally-derived scene parts and relations, thereby helping to refine and improve artificial vision systems.</AbstractNarration>
