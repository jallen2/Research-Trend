    <AbstractNarration>Formal verification techniques such as model checking, satisfiability solving, theorem proving, and static analysis have matured rapidly in recent years. These techniques have a number of important applications ranging from the modeling and analysis of biological and cyber-physical systems to the verification of the safety and security of complex software systems. The Summer School on Formal Techniques trains students in the principles and practice of formal verification, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of this technology. It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are interested in using verification technology in their own research in fields such as computing, engineering, biology, and mathematics. Students at the school are given the opportunity to experiment with the tools and techniques presented in the lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 edition of the Summer School is the fourth in the series takes place during May 19-23, 2014. Topics covered in this school include logic, formalization, interactive theorem proving, SAT and SMT solving, model checking, program semantics, modeling and verification of security protocols, and software reliability. The students cooperate in solving challenging problems while learning to use cutting-edge tools and techniques.</AbstractNarration>
