    <AbstractNarration>This program is to study and develop single-photon detectors that employ photoconductive gain regions associated with trapping photo-excited carriers in quantum dots. These detectors have a unique ability to sense individual photons and are a key enabling technology for linear optics quantum computing and the security of quantum communications. In addition, the realization of quantum repeaters requires the storage of quantum information. Quantum-dot-based detectors have the unique ability to function in both capacities and may play a fundamental role in developing quantum networks. The UW-La Crosse Physics Department has ~150 majors and offers an optics emphasis track in physics and engineering. This collaborative research program will help UW-L attract students interested in optoelectronics and quantum technologies and prepare them for future careers in these fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be a collaborative effort between the PI at UW-L and Dr. Richard Mirin at NIST-Boulder. The goal is to advance the state of quantum-dot-based single-photon detectors, making these devices suitable for practical applications. The PI will design the single-photon detectors, conduct measurements, model the detection system, and analyze the data. The research group at NIST will grow prototype samples using to a state-of-the-art molecular beam epitaxy system and fabricate the devices in their clean-room facilities. The goals of this collaboration are to improve the number resolution, speed, and efficiency of the single-photon detectors while raising their operating temperature by optimizing the detection circuitry and integrating the devices with solid-immersion lenses, and optical cavities. These novel detectors provide a key enabling technology for linear-optics quantum computing, for increasing the security of quantum communications, and for studying the quantum nature of light.</AbstractNarration>
