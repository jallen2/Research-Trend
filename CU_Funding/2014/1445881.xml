    <AbstractNarration>1445881&lt;br/&gt;Khine, Michelle&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Irvine&lt;br/&gt;Title: UC Bioengineering Symposium: Educational Awards to be held in Irvine, CA on June 18th-20th, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layperson description&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of this UC Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium is to bring leading experts in biology, medicine, materials, and engineering with industry leaders to translate innovative engineering technologies and methodologies to effectively sense, diagnose and treat medical disorders and diseases. &lt;br/&gt;This symposium will draw new participation and foster interdisciplinary research and education, particularly students and junior faculty, including underrepresented groups. There will be numerous networking opportunities to stimulate scientific and technical discussion with senior investigators and industry leaders. We will also have a focus on engaging women at the undergraduate level to stay in the engineering field. We will have special emphasis on undergraduate senior design awards. The broader impacts and goals are to develop a robust pipeline for discovery and development of medical therapies, diagnostics and research technologies to cure diseases and injury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;Biomedical grand challenges facing our society can be addressed in part or in whole by interfacing stem cell -, synthetic -, or systems biology with biomedical engineering tools (including microfluidics, nanomaterials and nanotechnology, cellular and molecular machines, bioinspired materials and structures) and engineering principles (such as biophotonics, transport phenomenon, drug delivery). By drawing leaders from each of these fields (from both industry and academia) together to discuss ways to address pressing medical issues with the most cutting edge technology in a highly interactive venue, we will enable progress at the interface of science, engineering, and medicine. Requested funding for this proposal will enable support for registration fees for the best student participants, provide funding for student awards (oral and poster presentations and innovation competitions) and provide funding for junior faculty awards (innovation competition).</AbstractNarration>
