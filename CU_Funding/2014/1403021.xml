    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will develop an automated system for continuously running a research-based, observation-driven, real-time simulation of the solar corona and inner heliosphere at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC). Every day, or more frequently, the system will automatically restart a new simulation of the state of the solar corona using the latest solar magnetogram as the input and the result of the previous simulation as the initial condition for the new one. A prediction of the realistic three-dimensional (3D) and time-dependent distributions of the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind parameters throughout the solar corona and inner heliosphere is one of the most challenging scientific problems in space physics. The task becomes even more difficult if the simulation is routinely performed in real-time, on a daily basis, with the latest magnetogram data incorporated as an input for the model together with the capability to validate the model using a continuous flow of observational data. The Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) model of the solar corona, already available in the CCMC, will be used for the effort. To validate the model, synthetic extreme ultraviolet images will be produced to compare with the images as observed with NASA satellite instruments. The coupled model prediction will be continuously validated with the solar wind parameters measured by the ACE satellite. The intellectual merit of the research is the development of a research-based model that can be used to better understand the propagation of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), both in real-time when CME signatures are observed in coronograph images, and for historical analysis and research of interesting events. The broader impact of the project is that a new generation of global models of the Sun-heliosphere system will be delivered to the CCMC to enable broad use by the solar-heliophysics community. The project will involve the training of a junior female postdoctoral researcher and will enhance infrastructure for research and education.</AbstractNarration>
