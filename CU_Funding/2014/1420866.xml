    <AbstractNarration>Computer systems are pervasive in all aspects of modern society. The&lt;br/&gt;software running on these systems, however, is difficult to implement&lt;br/&gt;correctly, and many failures occur after software is already released to&lt;br/&gt;the public. Unfortunately, these "post-deployment" failures are often&lt;br/&gt;the most difficult to fix. Failing runs are difficult to reproduce and&lt;br/&gt;analyze, as information about these failures is much more difficult and&lt;br/&gt;costly to obtain than failures occurring before software release. The&lt;br/&gt;PI's research will address this problem by making post-deployment&lt;br/&gt;failures more informative without sacrificing the end-user experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project will tackle this problem on two fronts. First,&lt;br/&gt;deployed programs will perform low-cost, customizable tracing to enhance&lt;br/&gt;core memory dumps produced by failures. The project will investigate methods&lt;br/&gt;using both static and dynamic analysis to reduce the cost and improve&lt;br/&gt;the utility of traced information. Second, the enhanced memory dumps&lt;br/&gt;will require development of powerful new automated postmortem analyses&lt;br/&gt;to partially automate the process of debugging and program&lt;br/&gt;understanding. These analysis results can then be used to further&lt;br/&gt;inform useful tracing strategies via dynamic feedback from previous&lt;br/&gt;failures. Thus, information about a particular post-deployment fault&lt;br/&gt;could continually improve as more failures are observed. This automated&lt;br/&gt;iterative improvement of postmortem analyses has the potential to&lt;br/&gt;substantially reduce effort required to fix post-deployment faults, thus&lt;br/&gt;leading to faster and more accurate patches, resulting in greater&lt;br/&gt;reliability for the software we all rely upon in our daily lives.</AbstractNarration>
