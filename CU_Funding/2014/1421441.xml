    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing scalable mechanisms to debug, monitor, and&lt;br/&gt;assess the quality of the complex distributed systems that represent&lt;br/&gt;the backbone of modern software infrastructure. These methods are&lt;br/&gt;necessarily highly-automated; they reason about the operation of&lt;br/&gt;distributed systems while treating the components of such systems as&lt;br/&gt;black boxes. This means that the methods do not require source code,&lt;br/&gt;programmer annotation, or developer input to troubleshoot a&lt;br/&gt;distributed system. Instead, they rely on detailed information&lt;br/&gt;gleaned from pre-existing log messages that are nearly ubiquitous in&lt;br/&gt;every large-scale distributed system and data extracted via binary&lt;br/&gt;analysis of components as they run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new methods, termed telescopic analysis, combine the ability to&lt;br/&gt;collect extremely detailed, low-level information about systems&lt;br/&gt;executing large numbers of requests with "big data" analysis that&lt;br/&gt;mines insights and create models of system operation from the corpus&lt;br/&gt;of detailed observations. Telescopic analysis uses targeted,&lt;br/&gt;sample-based logging and/or binary analysis to generate substantial&lt;br/&gt;quantities of high-precision data about specific runs of the system&lt;br/&gt;under observation. It then combines these observations into models&lt;br/&gt;that capture the aggregate behavior of the system. Comparing the&lt;br/&gt;general model with the detailed observations of each run allows&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how that run conforms to or deviates from the common&lt;br/&gt;operation of the system. The project is also developing tools and&lt;br/&gt;query languages that allow understanding of the results of such&lt;br/&gt;comparisons, both in aggregate and as pertains to specific runs, for&lt;br/&gt;performance analysis, debugging data quality failures, understanding&lt;br/&gt;outlier behavior, and performing "what-if" analysis.</AbstractNarration>
