    <AbstractNarration>Although great advances are being made to build more efficient and environment-friendly solar machines for green energy production, it still remains a challenge to design solar cells that are both efficient and inexpensive. This is the main reason to study naturally-occurring photosynthetic complexes found in plants and bacteria: these organisms contain evolutionarily optimized architecture capable of yielding near 100% efficiency in converting sunlight to potentially viable energy. Since many of the key photosynthetic processes occur extremely fast, limited information can be obtained experimentally. This makes computational studies especially useful and motivates our development of accurate and reliable mathematical models based on quantum and classical physics to simulate the sub-nanometer and femtosecond chemistry. In collaboration with Dr. Young Min Rhee at Pohang University of Science and Technology in Korea, this research will combine two computational methodologies to develop an accurate representation of how sunlight is converted to chemical energy in naturally occurring photosynthetic complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reaction center is a subunit of the Photosystem II pigment-protein complex where exciton to charge-transition manifold quantum transition occurs. Several groups have studied this complex and yet, it still remains unclear why some charge-transfer states are created while others are not. This study will focus on developing a unifying model for the reaction center. The protein environment can be treated as classical point charges for the exciton manifold. However, for the charge-separated manifold, the charged chromophores will significantly polarize the local environment and a static charge description will not be sufficient. Thus, this study will build a polarizable representation of the protein for the QM/MM and MD calculations. The overall energy landscape will be implemented into quantum dynamics algorithm to simulate energy transfer and conversion. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>
