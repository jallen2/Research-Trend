    <AbstractNarration>Coral reefs have profound ecological and economical importance but face environmental challenges, including seawater temperature rises, ocean acidification, and ultraviolet radiation. Corals exist in a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellate algae. Understanding how this symbiosis protects the system from heavy metals could simultaneously address one of the most important questions in environmental biology, namely, how organisms maintain homeostasis in changing environments. This project will investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying coral symbiosis, using genomic information from both coral host and algae symbiont. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Nori Satoh, professor of the Marine Genomics Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology. This collaboration will allow a unique opportunity to access cutting-edge expertise and data: The lab recently decoded the genome of Acropora digitifera, a coral that is one of the most sensitive to environmental changes, and also produced the first draft assembly of a dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium minitum, nuclear genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the environmental challenges coral reefs face, heavy metal exposure may be one of the least studied. The lab recently identified candidate genes for eight members of metal-complexing proteins in A. digitifera, although they did not determine a homolog of the metal-responsive transcription factor (MTF1) gene, despite its cited significant role in metal detoxification in other marine biology. The proposed project will analyze the genome of S. minitum to determine candidate genes for metal-complexing proteins, particularly the MTF1 gene that was not present in A. digitifera. Candidate genes could provide preliminary evidence that their byproducts may be symbiotically used by the coral, which apparently cannot produce certain metal-complexing proteins on its own.</AbstractNarration>
