    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to help support a number of U.S. scientists, including graduate students, postdocs and junior scientists to attend the "2014 US Volcano Seismology workshop" to be held at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage on April 29, 2014. The aims of this workshop is to bring together the U.S. volcano seismology community in a one day long series of small- and large-group discussions aimed at developing a community-driven plan to address the key outstanding scientific and technical challenges in the field of volcano seismology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations of volcano-seismic phenomena generally provide one of the most reliable bases for forecasting hazardous volcanic phenomena. As a result, the number of seismically-monitored volcanoes has increased dramatically in recent years, resulting in a large proliferation of high-quality data sets. This workshop will address questions related to the effective organization and exploitation of this large data set to address some of the most critical outstanding issues in the field, and it is part of an international concerted effort to advance the field through large-scale collaborative research, tool-building and resource sharing.</AbstractNarration>
