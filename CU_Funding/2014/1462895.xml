    <AbstractNarration>Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, is poised to revolutionize manufacturing. Its transformation into a manufacturing platform requires the ability to reliably create shape as well as desirable properties. Currently there is little understanding on how the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts relate to the printing process. This award supports fundamental research on mechanics of the layer-by-layer photopolymerization process common to many 3D printing system. It provides knowledge on how mechanical properties of the printed materials emerge from the printing process and how distortions occur. The knowledge gained provides solutions to the selection of printing parameters that yield parts with desirable properties. Such knowledge will enhance the use of photopolymerization based additive manufacturing for a wide variety of applications in healthcare, biomedical, aerospace, and automotive industries. This research involves several disciplines including mechanics, physics, chemistry, manufacturing, and materials science. The associated activities include underrepresented groups in the multidisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In photopolymerization based additive manufacturing there exist strong interactions of optical absorption, chemical reaction, species diffusion, phase change and volume shrinkage. Consequently, the layered deposition processes result in a material with dramatically different mechanical properties than the same polymer processed in bulk. This award supports research to investigate the relationship between print parameters and resulting product characteristics. The outcomes will bridge the knowledge gap between the printing process and the geometry and properties of the printed part. The research team will perform experiments to systematically investigate mechanical properties of the material within the printed layers and of the interfaces. The experimental observation will facilitate the establishment of theories and computational models. These models are defined in the context of continuum mechanics considering not only stress and strain but also the printing conditions and chemical processes. The computational models will be used to conduct parametric study to identify optimized printing parameters.</AbstractNarration>
