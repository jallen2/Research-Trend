    <AbstractNarration>PI: Grimm, Michele J. &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1417109&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Wayne State University &lt;br/&gt;Title: 2014 Summer Bioengineering Conference/World Congress of Biomechanics - Student Participation; July 6-11, Boston, MA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for students to attend the 2014 Summer Bioengineering Conference (SBC) sponsored by the Bioengineering Division (BED) of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). The conference will be held July 6-11, 2014, in Boston, MA. This year, the SBC will be held in conjunction with the 7th World Congress of Biomechanics (WCB). Both the Summer Bioengineering Conference and World Congress of Biomechanics are highly regarded conferences with excellent technical content and offering ample networking opportunities. Features of the conferences include plenary lectures, student competitions, and cutting-edge presentations and posters that are peer-reviewed. The Scientific Program Committee and the thus far scheduled Keynote Speakers include nationally and internationally recognized experts in the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, a Symposium Focused on Neural Functionality Failure Analysis and Augmentation will be initiated. This Symposium will be organized jointly by the ASME Design, Device, &amp; Rehabilitation and Tissue &amp; Cellular Engineering Technical Groups, and it will address the challenges posed through the Obama administration?s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. Funded students will be specifically encouraged to attend this Symposium, which enhances the scientific content of the conference and offers attendees, including students, the opportunity to be exposed to this exciting and challenging area of research. Conference attendees include engineers and scientists from various disciplines. Thus, the conference enables exchange of ideas among scientists with different backgrounds and serves an important cross-fertilization role. The conference organizers pay special attention toward increasing participation of students and young investigators, women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities with targeted efforts.</AbstractNarration>
