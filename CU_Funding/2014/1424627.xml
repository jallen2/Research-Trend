    <AbstractNarration>Whelton&lt;br/&gt;1424627&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An accidental spill of a currently unknown quantity (estimated between 3,000 and 7,500 gallons) of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol from a coal preparation plant in Charleston, WV has compromised the drinking water supply for up to 300,000 water users in Charleston and nearby counties. This tragedy has caused the ban of use of potable water and has resulted in closure in several establishments including schools and business. President Obama issued a federal disaster declaration for the state on Friday, January 10, 2014 to provide federal aid for the state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utility and government responders do not have the information needed to determine the extent of plastic pipe contamination and their ability to be decontaminated by clean water flushing. It is well known that plastic drinking water pipes are particularly susceptible to chemical permeation.This project will explore the processes that control contaminant fate with plastic polyvinylchloride (PVC), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipes and contaminant desorption during flushing activities. These materials are also used in ice makers, refrigerators, and dishwashers. &lt;br/&gt;This project team will:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Investigate premise plumbing system drinking water quality,&lt;br/&gt;(2) Determine the role of contaminant concentration, pipe material type, and diameter on observed chemical concentration during stagnation,&lt;br/&gt;(3) Quantify diffusivity and solubility values for several organic contaminants and pipe materials,&lt;br/&gt;(4) Determine significant relationships between chemical fate, physiochemical properties, and plastic pipe properties, and&lt;br/&gt;(5) Elucidate the ability of flushing activities to remediate contaminated plastic pipes. &lt;br/&gt;The results of the project will be:&lt;br/&gt;(1) incorporated several in-class drinking water contamination investigation activities that require them to go through the same fact finding processes as the emergency responders, utility staff, and homeowners;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Presented results at an AWWA National conference to the drinking water utility and regulatory industry; and &lt;br/&gt;(3) Submitted a research paper to an environmental science and engineering focused journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the larger gaps in our scientific understanding of the effect of chemical spill of 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM), in the drinking water treatment plant and hence the potential risk to consumers, is the "solubility" of the chemical in plastic pipes or is adsorption to pipes, tanks and infrastructure in a treatment plant. Then, once ad- or absorbed, how long will it take to be released into the water as time progresses. These information will then be evaluated in the overall long-term effect of the spill.</AbstractNarration>
