    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI will perform research in the algorithm design and analysis of high order numerical methods. These algorithms are used to solve scientific and engineering problems arising from diverse application fields such as aerospace engineering, semi-conductor device design, astrophysics, and biological problems. Even with today's fast computers, it is still essential to design efficient and reliable algorithms which can be used to obtain accurate solutions to these application problems. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity will be a suite of powerful computational tools, suitable for various applications mentioned above. These tools are expected to make positive contributions to computer simulations of the complicated solution structure in these applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms to be investigated include the finite difference and finite volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods, for solving hyperbolic and other convection dominated partial differential equations (PDEs). While the emphasis of this project is on algorithm design and analysis, close attention will be paid to applications. Topics of proposed investigations will include the study on high order accurate bound-preserving algorithms and applications, an inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for high order numerical boundary conditions for finite difference schemes on rectangular meshes when the physical boundary is not aligned with the meshes, WENO schemes with subcell resolution for nonconservative problems, Lagrangian type finite volume schemes for multi-material flows, energy-conserving discontinuous Galerkin methods for long time simulation of wave problems, efficient discontinuous Galerkin methods for front propagation problems with obstacles, superconvergence analysis of discontinuous Galerkin methods and its applications in adaptive computation, simple WENO limiters for discontinuous Galerkin methods in unstructured meshes for problems with strong shocks, multi-scale methods based on the discontinuous Galerkin framework, analysis and numerical solutions for traffic and pedestrian flow models, turbulence simulation in cosmology, and study on aggregation and coordinated movement in computational biology. Problems in applications will motivate the design of new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms; mathematics tools are used to analyze these algorithms to give guidelines for their applicability and limitations; practical considerations including parallel implementation issues are addressed to make the algorithms competitive in large scale calculations; and collaborations with engineers and other applied scientists enable the efficient application of these new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
