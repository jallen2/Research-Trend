    <AbstractNarration>Both healthy and diseased tissues are composed of multiple cell types whose interplay underpins their&lt;br/&gt;functions. Even within a given cell type, individual cells will differ in their exact state due to distinct external&lt;br/&gt;influences, cell's history, or random noise. Such heterogeneity presents a major challenge for modeling and&lt;br/&gt;understanding biological tissues. Rapidly progressing single-cell measurements can now provide&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive data on cell state, enabling unbiased analysis of composition of complex tissues. Such&lt;br/&gt;measurements, however, are inherently noisy and require specialized statistical and computational tools for their&lt;br/&gt;analysis. The project will develop sensitive statistical methods for identification and characterization of&lt;br/&gt;biologically distinct subsets of cells from single-cell transcriptome data, and will apply them to investigate cellular&lt;br/&gt;composition and function of neural tissues in humans, mice and other organisms. Such characterization will&lt;br/&gt;likely provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying brain development. The developed tools will be&lt;br/&gt;widely applicable in other biological contexts. Finally, the instructional material created by this project will&lt;br/&gt;introduce beginning and advanced students to the fundamental set of statistical and computational techniques&lt;br/&gt;necessary to understand modern biological measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop an approach for analysis cell heterogeneity based on the single-cell transcriptome&lt;br/&gt;data. Model-based factor analysis will be used to capture the structure of the transcriptional heterogeneity within&lt;br/&gt;the measured cell populations in a way that is highly tolerant of technical and biological variability inherent to the&lt;br/&gt;single-cell measurements. Methods for incorporating available spatial information and predicting spatial&lt;br/&gt;localization of subpopulations will be developed. Statistical methods will be developed to identify gene&lt;br/&gt;regulatory dependencies from single-cell data. The approaches will be applied to analysis of transcriptional&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity and regulatory processes in neuronal tissues of humans and model organisms. To facilitate&lt;br/&gt;teaching of relevant analysis methods, the project will develop a series of interactive exercises, which will&lt;br/&gt;illustrate common counting processes that underlie the assumptions of most analysis methods, statistical tools&lt;br/&gt;for estimating uncertainty from count data, and common algorithms used to process single-cell sequencing data.&lt;br/&gt;To reach wider student audience the interactive instructional tools will have an adaptable difficulty level and will&lt;br/&gt;be directly accessible over the web.
