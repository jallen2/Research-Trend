    <AbstractNarration>Ethnic enclaves are no longer socially isolated from the mainstream economy and may hold the key to reversing the economic decline of urban areas or aggravating social inequality within the metropolis. Even so, research on the economic development of U.S. immigration gateways and ?global cities? has paid scant attention to how new immigrant elites in these enclaves mobilize transnational capital and work in collaboration with public officials and economic development organizations to promote land intensification and development in economically-stagnant neighborhoods. This research examines the emergence of pro-growth coalitions made up of immigrant entrepreneurs, political leaders, large-scale developers, and transnational investors from the Pacific Rim that have built their fortunes around luxury condos, office buildings, high-end restaurants, and other profitable ventures in fast-growing ethnic enclave economies. It will evaluate how such economic development ties in with the commercialization of culture, the privatization and fortressing of public spaces, environmental damage, heightened segregation between the rich and the poor, and impacts on workers and residents, The study involves an intensive case study of two highly-developed ethnic enclave economies in the Korean entrepreneurial center of Koreatown and the Chinese core of Monterey Park, Los Angeles--both of which have experienced rapid growth and (re)development as a result of their ties to the global economy. The findings will inform local government officials and policymakers regarding working with immigrant leaders on issues of economic development and devising strategies for balanced growth to reduce overdevelopment, environmental damage and interracial conflict.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to identify the main characteristics of the immigrant elite, their strategies for promoting their agenda to the local government, and the resulting impact on social relations and inequality in a racially-diverse metropolis. Data come from 120 semi-structured interviews with the major leaders for and against development, including transnational agents, local elite, public and quasi-public authorities, community-based organizations, and residents/ activists. Data also include census and other secondary materials, which describe the steady progression of enclave growth, the political characteristics and influence of residents and businesses, and the demographic backdrop for gentrification, displacement and potential neighborhood conflicts. The findings will advance understanding of the politics of land use, investment and development which are increasingly linked to economies beyond U.S. borders as a result of real estate investment from overseas, and how this can delocalize decision-making processes away from municipal governments and complicate local growth control efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;</AbstractNarration>
