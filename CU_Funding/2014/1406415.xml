    <AbstractNarration>The Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) will jointly organize a small invitation only workshop to explore an integrated approach to nano-electronics from materials to systems to be held in October 2014 at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, India. The primary goal of the Forum is to identify future research directions for highly functional, space-limited, digital and analog systems that must operate with extremely low energy consumption and utilize new physical principles by exploring the fundamental science of future information technologies. Leading academic and industry researchers from the US, Europe, and Asia will attend this workshop, but only the US participants will receive benefits of NSF support. The SRC is also seeking intellectual support from NSF community to run the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the outcome of the workshop, albeit somewhat technical in nature, is expectedly very large. The potentially critical role of nano-electronics in future information technologies cannot be underestimated. Thus, one of the several goals is to explore novel approaches that may set the national agenda for research in this domain possibly leading to new NSF programs in the future, as is also the case with SRC. In the long run, the outcome will benefit the educational arena as well via adoption of technical material in new courses and university curriculum. To this end, in addition to the main scientific program, a tutorial day for disseminating educational material will also be organized preceding the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
