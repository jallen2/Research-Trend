    <AbstractNarration>SES-1406244&lt;br/&gt;Javier Auyero&lt;br/&gt;Marcos Perez&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is much research on the factors that contribute to a person's involvement in social movements, but most studies focus on the recruitment phase and ignore what happens once a person is already participating. This project studies the experiences of participants in a social activist movement, with the purpose of addressing this central limitation in the current understanding of activism. Specifically, the research will focus on a social movement that emerged in the late 1990s in Argentina, when groups of activists began to organize unemployed workers in order to demand access to jobs and relief programs. For the last fifteen years, these groups have played a crucial role in countless poor neighborhoods, managing workfare plans, providing social services, and creating opportunities for petitioning the government. Our project focuses on an intriguing puzzle. The profile of most new members and the way in which they join the movement hardly seems conducive to sustained activism. However, after recruitment some of them become increasingly committed, making substantial sacrifices to stay involved, while others leave as soon as the relative costs and benefits of participation change. The investigators will use life-history interviews with current and former activists, as well as participant observation of events carried out by their organizations to explain this divergence to address a more general question: why do people follow different trajectories after joining a social movement? The PIs hypothesize that particular trajectories are followed based on the intrinsic rewards of participation. Through the interplay between a person?s background and his or her experiences in a movement, some activists gradually begin to see participation as an end in itself and consequently make efforts to stay involved. In contrast, other people fail to develop this perspective, and hence when participation becomes too demanding or costly they are more likely to leave. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will generate a greater understanding of grassroots organizations in both developed and developing nations. Findings could potentially help government agencies better address the demands of underprivileged populations. Activist movements provide a space for petitioning the authorities and serve as effective communication channels between disadvantaged groups and state officials. Study results could also inform strategies to reinforce community institutions in poor neighborhoods, offering solutions to the deterioration of public life and reducing the levels of marginality and interpersonal violence.</AbstractNarration>
