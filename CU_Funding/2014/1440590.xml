    <AbstractNarration>UCF has established a Cyber Infrastructure Engineer (CI Engineer) position to serve as a bridge between UCF's Computer Services &amp; Telecommunications organization and the campus research computing community, as well as a catalyst and link to the broader community of CI Engineers. This new CI Engineer position leverages the research network that is being constructed at UCF. This position expands UCF's capability to perform basic research by focusing on cyber infrastructure dedicated to meeting current and future research needs. Responsibilities for this position include the expansion of UCF's research network and Science DMZ in close operation with campus IT staff, extension and execution of UCF's long-term Cyber-Infrastructure plan, and participation in the wider community of growing Cyber-Infrastructure professionals at other institutions, both regionally (through Florida LambdaRail) and nationally (through Internet2). Additionally, this effort helps meet the accelerating data transfer needs of campus research by facilitating and participating in research relating to the use of software defined networking and performance monitoring of high-performance research networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCF's full-time cyber infrastructure engineer position is expected to expand and improve access for faculty, graduate student researchers, and undergraduates to high performance computing resources, both on and off campus. Moreover, the University expects this CI Engineer position to help broaden the general understanding of best practices for research-focused cyber infrastructure by participating in the growing community of CI engineers at universities throughout the country.</AbstractNarration>
