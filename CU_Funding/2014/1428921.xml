    <AbstractNarration>MRI: Acquisition of High-Speed Cameras with Quantitative Stereo Imaging and Digital Image Correlation Capabilities for Multidisciplinary Research and Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visualization and imaging are important aspects in the processes of discovering and understanding new phenomena. Because of recent advances in imaging technologies and related hardware and software, improved capabilities to perceive and measure three-dimensional events at high-speeds allow for investigating various phenomena at a more detailed level than ever before. Furthermore, as new materials, devices, and systems move beyond the exploration stage and relatively simple configurations to more complex ones, high-resolution analysis and testing become critical issues and particularly to those involving both, spatial and temporal domains. These state-of-the-art imaging instruments will provide new capabilities for three-dimensional imaging of a variety of collaborative and multidisciplinary projects spanning from testing materials and systems at the meso- and micro-scale to biomedical, manufacturing, and energy applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These high-speed cameras with quantitative digital image correlation will facilitate the complete three-dimensional investigation of transient events with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. Examples of the use of these high-speed cameras at Worcester Polytechnic Institute will include a- high-resolution acoustic-solid interactions and micro-/nano-systems; b- measurement of bubble departure diameter rand frequency under extreme heat fluxes for electrically driven liquid film flow boiling over surfaces enhanced with nano-mats; c- capturing both instantaneous damage initiation events (occurring at micro-/nano-structural features such as secondary phases/metal matrix interfaces, grain/phase boundaries, defects, etc.), as well as crack propagation phenomena at various growth rates; d- investigating the structure and turbulent mixing processes of dust-air flames; and e- understanding of MRI-guided deep brain surgery through quantitative assessment and optimization of motion of the piezo crystals and surrounding tissue.</AbstractNarration>
