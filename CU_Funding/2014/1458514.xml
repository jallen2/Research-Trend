    <AbstractNarration>This project at SUNY Geneseo will address the national need for more and better trained geoscientists by increasing recruitment, retention to graduation, and preparation for and placement in careers or geosciences graduate programs and by combining scholarships and academic and career services. Through many student support and enrichment activities, this project will enhance interactions between SUNY Geneseo and academic institutions including SUNY Buffalo and SUNY Binghamton where many new geosciences graduates from the college pursue M.S. or Ph.D. degrees. In addition, connections to regional geosciences industries, including the American Rock Salt Company and Stell Environmental Enterprises, as well as government and academic research programs such as NASA, DOE, and a variety of National Laboratory and Research Experience for Undergraduates programs, will be strengthened through the development of opportunities for student research and internships. Together, these improvements will increase the number and quality of research opportunities for undergraduate geosciences students, increase opportunities for students to participate and present at professional and scholarly conferences, and address the national need to increase the number of geosciences students to fill jobs in oil and gas, environmental service, and mining industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will target students majoring in geology, geochemistry, and geophysics at SUNY Geneseo and is designed to meet three objectives: (1) increase recruitment and enrollment of academically talented students with financial need by at least 20%, (2) enhance retention and graduation within four years by at least 10%, and (3) increase placement in a geosciences or related science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) career or graduate program by 13%. The project leadership will work with the Office of Admissions and twenty alumni who are geoscience teachers at high schools in western New York to recruit academically talented scholars with financial need to the program. Cohorts of scholars will be brought together by (a) taking the same classes, (b) engaging in supplemental instruction programs, (c) participating in field trips, (d) interacting with graduate students and alumni, and (v) engaging in research and/or internships. The program goals will be accomplished through two primary components: (i) enhanced student support programs, and (ii) experiential learning opportunities. Career placement-related program components will be supplemented with support from the Office of Career Development. The scholarship program will allow SUNY Geneseo to implement and assess support services for geosciences students, including Supplemental Instruction (SI), Workshops with Graduate Students, a Geology Alumni-Student Program, field trips, research experiences, and internships. SI is a proven method to increase retention and graduation rates in many STEM disciplines; however, the effectiveness of SI has not been tested in the geosciences. This program will fill that void and provide insight into best practices and effective measures for promoting retention, graduation, and placement in the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>
