    <AbstractNarration>CRII: CSR: Rethinking Operating System Structure for Wearable Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wearable computing devices are playing increasingly important roles in areas like education, business, and healthcare. However, the major metrics of wearable devices, most notably interactive performance and energy efficiency, are far from satisfactory. To address this challenge, this CRII research project examines the key component of a wearable device, namely the operating system, and explores designs that fit in the unique characteristics of wearable devices. Wearable devices have unique form factors and usage models, and highly specialized workloads, and the operating system needs to be virtually specialized for different workloads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a comprehensive characterization of existing wearable workloads on current and emerging hardware platforms, and a set of structuring principles for guiding the design of wearable operating systems that can be specialized for multiple types of workloads. The project develops an operating system prototype whose design follows the principles and thus demonstrates the effectiveness of the principles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project leverages collaborations with industry leaders to foster a broad impact on the commercial development. The project outcomes will be integrated into the operating system course curriculum. The research program offers a platform for involving undergraduate students in publishable research and for promoting science and engineering to high-school students, and under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
