    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three-day workshop "Advances in Nonlinear Analysis", to be held March 13 - 15, 2014, in the framework of the 2014 Theme Semester on Analysis and Convex Integration in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of the conference is recent developments in nonlinear analysis and partial differential equations, including geometric analysis, geometric measure theory, optimal transport, harmonic analysis, potential theory, and calculus of variations. Some leading experts in these areas are confirmed as participants and will give lectures. Special attention is paid to recruit junior participants and members of underrepresented groups. Ample opportunity is provided to graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work. The workshop is a part of a one semester thematic program including several minicourses in the research areas at the University of Pittsburgh.</AbstractNarration>
