    <AbstractNarration>Tissue engineering has focused on the generation of tissues using a patient's own cells to transplant failing tissues. By doing so, patients would avoid organ donor lists and immunosuppressive drugs, two of the biggest current obstacles for those in need of new organs. Although tissue engineering has shown success in small volume tissues, larger volumes have posed a greater challenge due to the inability to sustain cells in 3 dimensions (3D) both during growth and after implantation. Recent work has shown that the use of a bioreactor, a system that uses fluid flow to sustain cells in 3D, allows growth of large volume tissues. This research introduces a second population of cells to form a blood vessel network, to address sustaining the engineered tissue once implanted. This engineered tissue will then be implanted and assessed within a large animal bone graft model. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ming-Huei Cheng at Chang Gung Medical Center in Taiwan, who has previously established and translated a large animal bone graft model to human application. Integration and function of a live, engineered tissue implanted into an animal could present a realistic solution for large volume regenerative medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To test this concept, adult stem cells previously used to form bone tissue (mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)) and endothelial cells obtained from adult peripheral blood (endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs)) will be used to form live tissue within the bioreactor. ECFCs and MSCs isolated from autologous pigs will be co-cultured using an aggregate angiogenesis assay in fibrin hydrogels to form interconnected vascular networks. Current research suggests that the presence of ECFCs improves the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, forming mineralized scaffolds. Multiple scaffolds will be cultured to form large volume tissues in a perfusion bioreactor. This nascent tissue will be implanted against the periosteum to promote tissue integration and remodeling. To assess integration and function of the scaffold, bone mineralization and vascularization will be quantified over time using histology. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Science Council of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>
