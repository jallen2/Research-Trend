    <AbstractNarration>This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a REU site at the University of South Florida. The site will recruit undergraduates from across the nation to participate in research topics related to ubiquitous sensing, which includes current topics such as fixed and mobile sensing networks, location-based services, participatory sensing, and human-centric sensing applications. Ubiquitous sensing is an area of current interest that is well-suited to undergraduate research productivity. The students will interact with faculty mentors and their research groups to solve large community problems in areas such as health care, transportation systems, and biometrics, in a simple, fast, and cost-effective manner. This site should help develop a group of computing professionals who can develop the systems of the future that impact society and enhance our quality of life. The REU experience provides students with the foundations and inspiration to pursue computing careers and research in areas that are rapidly evolving and impacting all of our citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed REU site offers state-of-the art facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in explorations of problems related to ubiquitous sensing. Students will learn how to use current tools and techniques to solve those problems that have direct impact on people. The team will use proven strategies to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science including Hispanic students from a group of institutions in Puerto Rico and Florida as well as African-American students from their partner institutions. The students will participate in research and professional development activities all designed to achieve the goals of retaining and graduating undergraduate students in computer science and engineering, recruiting students from groups traditionally under-represented in computing fields, and increasing recruitment of students into graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>
