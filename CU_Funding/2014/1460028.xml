    <AbstractNarration>The National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Testing and Assessment is conducting this study to determine the best available methods to assess student skills in teamwork, communication, self-regulation of behavior, academic tenacity, and grit. These skills, also known as interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies, have begun to gain recognition as important to student success in college generally and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) specifically. Indeed such factors may be as important to college success as traditional thinking and reasoning skills, which already have a deep research base to guide instruction and assessment of student performance in STEM. The report resulting from the study will be able to provide guidance to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To conduct the study, the NRC is convening a committee of experts to identify and analyze the current state of knowledge of this field. This work builds on other NRC reports, such as Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century (NRC, 2012), which identified three broad domains of competence: cognitive (e.g., thinking, reasoning), interpersonal (e.g., communication skills), and intrapersonal (e.g., self-regulation). The committee's report will establish principles and priorities for the development and use of assessments related to the range of interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies.</AbstractNarration>
