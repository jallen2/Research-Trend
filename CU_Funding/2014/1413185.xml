    <AbstractNarration>Muscle contraction is a fundamental biological process. The same molecular machinery that powers voluntary movement, heart contraction and gastric motility is responsible for diverse cellular processes, from cell motility to cell division. A detailed understanding of this process could revolutionize, among other things, prosthetic design and treatments for heart disease and cancer. However, understanding muscle contraction is difficult because it spans vastly different size scales. Contraction starts with molecular interactions that cause the relative sliding of two sets of protein filaments. This sliding causes subcellular, cellular and macroscopic structures to contract. Over the past hundred years, measurements have been made at each scale, from classical studies of whole muscle to recent single molecule experiments. Despite this wealth of data, there is no widely accepted theory of muscle contraction suitable for, say, prediction of locomotor strategies or understanding how molecular defects lead to heart disease. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a quantitative description of whole muscle, single cells and single molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accomplishing this goal requires the development of 1) models that accurately describe molecular measurements; 2) methods to efficiently simulate these models; and 3) techniques to bridge size scales. This project focuses largely on the first two requirements. These will be achieved through three specific aims, each to be completed in collaboration with an experimental lab. The investigators use Monte-Carlo simulations, numerical solution of partial and ordinary differential equations (PDEs and ODEs, respectively) and analytic solution approximations to develop and validate 1) an integro-PDE model of molecular interactions; 2) an ODE model of activation; and 3) an integro-PDE model of myosin binding protein c. Each step in model development will be tested and refined by quantitative comparisons to experiments. The final result of the project will be a rigorous, experimentally validated molecular model of muscle, which will not only be a critical step toward a bottom-up model of muscle contraction, but will also represent an important contribution to muscle biophysics. Further, the mathematical techniques and equations used to develop this theory have applications beyond muscle contraction, applying more generally to geometrically constrained chemical reactions that occur in a variety of systems (e.g. adhesion of cells to surfaces, bundling of cytoskeletal filaments and frictional sliding).</AbstractNarration>
