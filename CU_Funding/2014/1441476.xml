    <AbstractNarration>1441476&lt;br/&gt;Chandran&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel Grant Proposal to Support Participation of US Researchers at the International Water Association Workshop, Global Challenges: Sustainable Wastewater Treatment and Resource&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, as a society, we live in a resource constrained world, while facing global, interlinked challenges associated with lack of quality water, energy and food (the water-food-energy nexus). To meet many of these global challenges of the future in a sustainable fashion, wastewater must be acknowledged as a renewable resource for water, energy, nutrients and other materials. The current practice of wastewater treatment, which focuses on using energy and chemicals to remove constituents, must change to the new paradigm focused towards what can be recovered, especially since population growth is depleting resources. The rapidly growing urban centers in developed and developing countries are in severe need of wastewater treatment while simultaneously promoting resource conservation and reuse. As the water sector looks to face the new challenges with innovative solutions that protect the environmental, public health, and global sustainability, minimizing use of resources and maximizing the recovery of resources from wastewater is destined to become the focal point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wastewater contains valuable resources such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Whereas untreated wastewater threatens human health, ecosystems, biodiversity, food security and the sustainability of water resources, the carbon present in the wastewater can be recovered to generate energy while nitrogen and phosphorus recovery can supplement nutrient demand for agriculture. There are many innovative approaches and technologies for energy neutral nutrient removal and recovery. The drivers for resource recovery and energy neutrality include decreased energy demand and carbon emissions, marketable commodities, and improved efficiency at reduced cost. Notably, these very benefits of resource recovery oriented thinking can additionally promote access to wastewater treatment and sanitation for the majority of the world's population, which currently lacks such access (2.5 billion people). However, prior to the widespread implementation of resource recovery (whether in developed or developing settings), a proper framework (technical, economical and practical) and appropriate technologies need to be identified. This workshop is expected to significantly help towards this effort. This workshop will support only US personnel and expose these faculty and students to the needs and developments from across the globe on topics related to resource recovery, thereby laying the pathway for them to potentially pursue and lead this field. This activity is cofunded by the NSF International Science and Engineering Section.</AbstractNarration>
