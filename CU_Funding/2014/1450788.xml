    <AbstractNarration>1450788 - Ierapetritou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to provide support for a workshop on Process Intensification that will take place on September 30 and OCtober 1, 2014. The objective of the workshop is to create a forum where the main contributions in the area of process intensifivation will be reviewed and the remaining challenges will be identified. Bringing together academic, industrial and government participants, the workshop will provide a forum to identify past successes and look to identify gaps in knowledge that future research needs to fill. It is hoped that this will lead to identification of roadblocks to progress in this area as well as efficient ways to overcome these difficulties so that future efforts lead to more efficient, green and commercially competitive industrial processes. The workshop will involve at least 40 participants from academia, industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the workshop should not only help US industry but also generate new educational advances. New Process Intensification projects will create many educational and training opportunities where US students can naturally acquire fundamental skills while engaging in cutting edge research that is very relevant to domestic industry. It is expected that the concepts generated will qucikly find their way into the syllabi of core courses such as reaction engineering, separations, unit operations, process design and control, etc. One of the breakout sessions will specifically address educational opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
