    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to explore the operation principle of transmitarray antennas. The proposed research will investigate the transmission properties of novel antenna elements inspired by complementary geometries and gradient index metamaterials. Based on these element innovations, this project will address two important concerns in transmitarrays: the bandwidth enhancement and beam shaping. A thorough study will be carried out to understand the bandwidth limits of a transmitarray; and both multi-resonant element and multi-resonant aperture approaches will be applied to increase the antenna bandwidth. To shape the radiation beam, an efficient synthesis algorithm based on the intersection approach will be developed for large-aperture transmitarrays. Using this algorithm, a single-feed quad-beam transmitarray will be developed to demonstrate the advanced radiation capability of the transmitarray. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits &lt;br/&gt;Compared to existing high gain antennas, the transmitarray antenna is a transformative concept with unique radiation principle. Because of the simultaneous magnitude and phase control of the antenna elements, the transmitarray exhibits numerous advantages, such as low profile conformal geometry, high radiation efficiency, and advanced radiation patterns. The broadband performance and multi-beam operation are attractive merits of transmitarray antennas to be studied in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The transmitarray concept has wide applications in many science and engineering missions such as Earth remote sensing and spatial power combining in high energy systems. This project will also provide an exciting learning environment for both undergraduate and graduate students to obtain knowledge in electromagnetics, microwaves, and antennas. It will help to improve the environment for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in Mississippi (an EPSCoR State) and to generate qualified work force, which includes under-represented groups, for future scientific and engineering development.</AbstractNarration>
