    <AbstractNarration>While many efforts have been made to instill technical and professional skills in engineering graduates,there has been little change in the pedagogy of most engineering education institutions in the U.S.In order to see real, sustainable improvement in engineering education practice, we must have positive change in both the behaviors of the participants and the systems within which these participants act. This work will gather case data and apply organizational theory models to better understand the change management activities and opportunities in one successful model program, Iron Range Engineering, a 100 percent problem-based learning program that grew out of a collaboration between a two-year and a four-year institution. This exploratory study will also lay the groundwork for a larger study to create a guiding model for others trying to build and implement sustainable change in engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By completing a case study of a successful change effort in engineering education and applying organizational management models to analyze this effort, this project will increase the ability for others in engineering education to create and sustain change both&lt;br/&gt;within a single course/classroom and across curricula. This will create better infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;for engineering education to meet the challenges set out by society, industry, government, and the profession in national reports on engineering education.</AbstractNarration>
