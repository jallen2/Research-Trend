    <AbstractNarration>Health impacts from mercury typically occur from consumption of mercury-contaminated fish, but most mercury pollution is emitted to the atmosphere. Impacts from mercury pollution in the aquatic environment depend on atmospheric transport, chemistry, and deposition processes. In recent decades mercury oxidation and deposition of oxidized mercury compounds have been found to be particularly important steps in mercury biogeochemical cycling. Atmospheric oxidized mercury measurements are made routinely by dozens of research and regulatory groups around the country, and these measurements have informed recent regulatory efforts by EPA and other agencies. Currently, no commercially-available method exists for verifying atmospheric oxidized mercury measurements. Further, recent research has shown that commercial instruments for oxidized mercury do not report accurate measurements under some atmospheric conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team proposes to commercialize an automated calibration device that generates ultra-trace concentrations of gas-phase mercury compounds. The team has developed a permeation oven and flow and processing system to generate ultra-trace concentrations of gas-phase mercury compounds for calibration of atmospheric mercury equipment. It uses uniquely-designed permeation tubes to pass controlled amounts of mercury compounds into an inert gas stream. All wetted parts in the instrument are extremely inert and precisely heated to allow for quantitative passage of reactive and semi-volatile compounds. The system is designed for atmospheric mercury, but the technology can also be used for other reactive compounds.</AbstractNarration>
