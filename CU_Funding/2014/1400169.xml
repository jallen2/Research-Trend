    <AbstractNarration>This investigation will produce wearable renewable power sources that will eliminate or reduce (1) waste streams associated with battery disposal/recycling in personal/wearable systems and (2) surgical procedures required for battery replacement in implantable electronics. A strong education program, tightly coupled to research, will train students to become next-generation leaders on sustainable energy. The education program includes 1) involvement of a large number of undergraduate students in research, which reflects the strong appeal of this research to the younger generation; 2) development of courses related to mechanics design of energy harvesting; and 3) strong outreach activities to K-12, college students, and general public. This stretchable mechanical energy harvester is expected to serve as a compelling tool for introducing the public to the STEM fields, such as through interactive museums display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to combine the advanced engineering design principles and basic research on fundamental aspects in materials, mechanics and manufacturing to develop personal-scale sources of renewable power, which will play critical roles in the sustainable growth of personal/wearable electronics and implantable biomedical components, both of which are quickly emerging as key support technologies for the rapid, global expansion of an aging population. The specific systems involve high performance, stretchable mechanical energy harvesters, capable of mounting on nearly any surface (e.g., glass, paper, biological tissues, textiles, automotives, building structures) in nearly any configuration (e.g. flat, curved, dynamically deformed) and at nearly any scale (e.g. micro to macro). Studies conducted under this award will develop enabling technologies, and optimize the system to realize the specified performance goals such as high-areal coverage, large stretchability, and precise control of strains in devices.</AbstractNarration>
