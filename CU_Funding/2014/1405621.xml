    <AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate studies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) is the host site for the 2014-2016 (Cohort XII) BD program that supports a graduate student cohort of 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM Ph.D. students from LSAMP campuses across the nation. The Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ALSAMP) BD Activity provides extensive training in specific STEM disciplines as well as professional development and guidance that promote peer mentoring and leadership in the scientific community. Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants are required to attend special topic seminars concerning graduate school&lt;br/&gt;matriculation designed specifically for the program and procedures for applying for NSF and other fellowships. Retention strategies are carried out by providing the best available research experiences and resources, establishing appropriate faculty guidance and quality mentoring and providing the support needed to accomplish the goal of earning doctoral degrees. Students will be linked to projects such as the NSF Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP), Integrated Graduate Education Research and Traineeships (IGERT), the Southern Regional Education Board Doctoral Scholars Program (SREB), Alabama Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (Alabama EPSCoR) and other STEM graduate education programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the two year award period, students remaining in UAB doctoral programs are guaranteed a continuation of the same level of financial support through a combination of departmental fellowships and additional financial support from the university. BD students not remaining at UAB are assisted in connecting to doctoral programs of their choice at other institutions and securing fellowship and other support at the selected institution. All ALSAMP BD students are tracked into STEM doctoral degree programs and the workforce, including the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best practices for recruitment and retention of graduate researchers are implemented and built upon lessons learned from previous ALSAMP BD host sites. The findings, lessons learned, and impact of the activities are disseminated through publications and presentations at national meetings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, the Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ALSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate activity has supported 114 underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students in in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics [STEM] disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce, both in academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing the future professoriate, as well as the scientific workforce, the value added is seen in the visibility of minorities in science and engineering, increasing representation and providing role models and motivation for the next generation.</AbstractNarration>
