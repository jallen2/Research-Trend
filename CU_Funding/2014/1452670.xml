    <AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early CAREER award proposes theoretical research to investigate the static and dynamic magnetization properties in spin transport electronic (spintronic) devices. Spintronics aims to use the electron spin in addition to its electric charge to develop highly functional and energy efficient devices. In this context a better fundamental understanding of the involved static and dynamic magnetic properties within the confined device setting is of paramount importance for a widespread adoption of spintronic technologies. The complicated interplay of different material parameters and their modifications are essential for the performance of new spintronic devices for their scalability and efficiency. In this project a unique combination of different modeling capabilities will allow a detailed analysis of the functionality of proposed new spintronic devices for energy efficiency in electronics. The main goal of the research project is to enable the theoretical prediction and the computational design of new spintronic materials and devices. In this project the principal investigator will seamlessly integrate educational activities at all levels of education through research experiences for local high school students, undergraduate students and training of graduate students. Based on experience the principal investigator plans to establish "Girls in Physics" events at the University of Alabama with the goal to spark the interest of young female high school students in Alabama in a possible career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A theoretical understanding of the static and dynamic magnetization properties for a widespread adoption of spintronic technologies requires basic knowledge of fundamental mechanisms responsible for magnetization relaxation, anisotropy and spin polarization and their interdependencies within a confined device setting. The proposed research plans to combine first principles and tight-binding calculations for material design with dynamical simulations to predict the functionality of new spintronic devices. The unique combination of different modeling capabilities to allow a complete analysis of the functionality of proposed devices will enable the theoretical prediction and the computational design of new spintronic materials and devices. In addition, the proposed research will lead to a better fundamental understanding of the complicated interdependencies of the involved material parameters within a confined device setting.</AbstractNarration>
