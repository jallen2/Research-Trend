    <AbstractNarration>PI: Ioana Pavel Sizemore/Adam de la Zerda&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1438340/1434465&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Wright State University/Stanford University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative proposal: Developing a battery of methods for the study of the trafficking mechanisms and transformations of silver and gold nanomaterials in human cells &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extensive use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in consumer products and industry and the use of many kinds of NPs in healthcare as diagnostic and therapeutic tools require an understanding of their potential toxicities. However, as observed by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, there are only a limited number of techniques that could expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which nanomaterials influence cell behavior. The main scientific goal of this project is to fill these knowledge gaps by developing a battery of tools for the study of the trafficking mechanisms and transformations of environmentally representative AgNPs and biomedically relevant gold nanorods (AuNRs) in human cells. Key parameters, which will be considered in order to test the efficiency and practicality of the proposed methods, will include nanomaterial shape, surface charge, dose, and exposure time. The methods that are to be developed will be captured and shared through Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). In addition, the knowledge gained from the proposed research will be used in setting up new course modules and will be disseminated into the broader community, e.g., through interactions with a local museum and development of two hour hands-on laboratory modules for over 100 K-6 through K-9 students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A battery of interdisciplinary methods (ICP-OES/TFF, Raman-SERS/MatLab codes, and electron microscopy /bioassays) will be used for the study of the trafficking mechanisms and transformations of environmentally representative silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and biomedically relevant gold nanoparticles (AuNRs) in human cells. Key parameters that will be considered to test the efficiency and practicality of the proposed methods will include nanomaterial shape, surface charge, dose, and exposure time. To accomplish their goals, The PIs propose two specific aims. In Aim1, the PIs will characterize the physico-chemical properties of NPs, according to the U.S. EPA standards, before cellular exposure and then at various benchmark times during cellular trafficking. In Aim 2, using their suite of tools, the investigators will study the trafficking mechanisms of AgNPs and AuNRs in human cells as a function of nanomaterial shape, surface charge, dose, and exposure time.</AbstractNarration>
