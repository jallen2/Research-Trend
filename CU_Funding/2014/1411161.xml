    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the conduct of an National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop will be held at the University of Maryland on April 7 and 8, 2014. It is expected that there will be about 150 attendees. The workshop will have a one-and-a-half-day format including a training session on good proposal writing practices, talks by previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review, and a review session during which the attendees will have a chance to obtain reviews on project summaries of their own draft CAREER proposals. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with NSF Program Directors both one-on-one and in mock panels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help to prepare young faculty for careers in education by giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing and by preparing them to write and submit better CAREER proposals. The results of the workshop include training for young faculty, better opportunity for young faculty with an emphasis on women and minority faculty, higher award success rates for the attendees, and ultimately better research resulting from better written proposals.</AbstractNarration>
