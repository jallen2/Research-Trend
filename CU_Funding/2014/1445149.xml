    <AbstractNarration>Bioinformatics and Biomedicine research are fundamental to our understanding of complex biological systems, impacting the science and technology of fields ranging from agricultural and environmental sciences to pharmaceutical and medical sciences. The research requires close collaboration among multi-disciplinary teams of researchers in quantitative sciences, life sciences, and their interfaces. The 8th Annual IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine will provide an open and interactive forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary research and education in Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, facilitating the cross fertilization of ideas and bridging knowledge gaps. The scientific program will cover synergistic themes on genomics, systems biology, translational bioinformatics, and cross-cutting bioinformatics infrastructure to promote new research collaboration. Two special panels, Big Data and Bioinformatics, and the Bioinformatics Educational Workshop will foster discussion on research and education opportunities and barriers. As an effort to engage young researchers, BIBM-2014 has involved them in the meeting organization and has included mentoring activities in the conference program. This support will provide the crucial funding needed to support the participation of early career researchers and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, as a training opportunity for the next generation of scientists and engineers, thereby, broadening the scientific impact of this international conference.</AbstractNarration>
