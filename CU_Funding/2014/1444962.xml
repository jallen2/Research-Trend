    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel multi-antenna MIMO (multiple input multiple output) wireless transceiver architecture to meet the exploding data rate requirements of emerging wireless applications driven by the proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The new continuous aperture phased (CAP)-MIMO transceiver architecture is important because it represents a promising and practically viable approach for realizing the full potential of emerging millimeter-wave (mmW) technology, operating in the 30-300 GHz band, in addressing the wireless data rate challenge with dramatically enhanced power and spectrum efficiency compared to existing systems operating below 5 GHz. The project will result in a prototype of a millimeter-wave CAP-MIMO transceiver. This CAP-MIMO prototype has the following unique features: a hybrid analog-digital architecture, an analog front-end for spatial multi-beamforming, and a multi-beam selection mechanism. These features provide several advantages when compared to the leading competing designs based on phased-array principles in the emerging millimeter-wave wireless technology market including: multi-Gigabits/second speeds, unprecedented electronic multi-beam steering and data multiplexing capability, and a viable architecture for optimizing the fundamental performance-complexity tradeoffs inherent to millimeter-wave MIMO systems. &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Electronic multi-beam steering and data multiplexing capability is critical to realizing the full potential of millimeter-wave (mmW) MIMO systems both in terms of performance (power and spectral efficiency) and functionality (point-to-multipoint network operation in both static and mobile environments). However, existing approaches to mmW MIMO systems ? including conventional designs based on digital beamforming and phased-array-based extensions to multi-beam MIMO ? fail to address fundamental performance-complexity tradeoffs that are critical to technology translation. The CAP-MIMO prototype developed in this project will provide a definitive demonstration of the critical multi-beam steering and data multiplexing capability and help identify viable pathways for technology translation. The hybrid analog-digital prototype will leverage two key translational elements for filling the technology gaps: a lens-based front-end antenna for analog beamforming, and a digitally-driven multi-beam selection network that enables joint hardware-software optimization of transceiver complexity. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs, will receive invaluable inter-disciplinary training and experience involving innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation through: prototype design, development, testing and demonstration; market analysis, business plan development, and evaluation and refinement of commercialization strategies; and interactions with other students and faculty involved in both the engineering and business aspects of technology development. &lt;br/&gt;The personnel involved in this project will also engage various potential partners, including large and small companies in the wireless industry, to get feedback on the project activities as well as to facilitate technology licensing, development, and eventual commercialization.</AbstractNarration>
