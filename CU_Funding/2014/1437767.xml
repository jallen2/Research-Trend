    <AbstractNarration>CBET 1437831/1437767&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micelles are tiny self-assembled capsules that can be customized for a variety of technological applications, including carrying drug molecules to a specific location inside the body as well as cleaning up environmental spills. Micelles can be composed of molecules made of two kinds of linked polymer chains, called block copolymers. Micelle behaviors can be finely tuned by changing the molecular structure of the block copolymers, and thus purposely designing the uptake amounts and release rates of interior compounds (such as drugs). This collaborative project explores the structure of block copolymer micelles as well as the block copolymer motions. By combining advanced analysis methods, the investigators will determine how the micelle-encapsulated compounds affect micelle structure and motions, and the exchange of compounds between micelles and their surroundings. This information will help scientists and engineers precisely formulate micelles for new applications in drug delivery, advanced lubrication, oil extraction, personal care products and other industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to systematically examine the effects of small molecule additives, co-solvents, and encapsulated drug molecules, on the structure and dynamics of block copolymer micelles. Targeted model additives (tetrahydrofuran and doxorubicin) will be employed to uncover the influence of such additives on micelle structure and dynamics. Small angle neutron scattering and multi-modal nuclear magnetic resonance will be used to investigate the effects of additive-polymer interactions on micelle equilibrium structure, polymer chain and micelle dynamics, and release rates of encapsulated compounds. The combination of these techniques will provide a comprehensive picture of key micellar dimensions and highly specific dynamical information including free unimer exchange kinetics, block and polymer chain dynamics, micelle diffusion processes, detailed solvent dynamics and exchange of additives in and out of micelles, and rates of fission and fusion.</AbstractNarration>
