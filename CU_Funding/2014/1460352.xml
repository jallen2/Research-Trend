    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) award at the University of Rochester will support twelve students per year for ten weeks of research in fields including particle, nuclear, and cosmic ray physics, optics and quantum optics, condensed matter physics, biological physics, plasma physics, astrophysics and geophysics. The faculty research groups' combination of enthusiasm and discipline motivates students and contributes to the quality of their research. Individual guidance and mentoring foster each student's skill at navigating the world of science - giving talks, writing articles - as well as his or her intellectual development as an independent researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. The program includes a mini-course in Linux/Unix. REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, participate in tours of University research facilities and social outings and may also take part in the department's summer outreach activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences.</AbstractNarration>
