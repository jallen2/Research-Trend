    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at Indiana University (IU). The program will support up to 15 participants for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-17 to carry out experimental and theoretical research projects in a broad range of areas in the IU Physics Department and the IU Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter (CEEM). Special programs for the students include orientation sessions on lab safety, weekly seminars on current research in physics, discussions on professional development and scientific ethics, and short progress reports. At the conclusion of the program, the students will present their results in talks at a closing symposium and develop a way to share their results to a technical audience. They will also be encouraged and supported to continue working on their projects as well as to present their work at professional meetings during the following academic year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program provides promising undergraduate physics majors with significant and challenging experiences in scientific research in a research-intensive environment. Students will be matched to projects appropriate to their level and interests, and early contact of students and mentors will be encouraged. The participants will gain original research experience by working as integral parts of ongoing research programs under the supervision of faculty members and senior research staff. Students will learn about a broad range of current research areas through seminars and peer interactions. The program emphasizes the development of clear, honest, and concise scientific communication and presentation skills.</AbstractNarration>
