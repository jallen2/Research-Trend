    <AbstractNarration>The conference on Manifolds, K-theory, and Related Topics will take place June 23-27, 2014 at the Inter-University Center in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Focused international research conferences such as this one play a fundamental role in the development and dissemination of ground-breaking research in mathematics. This conference will serve as a forum in which researchers can announce major new results and explain their ideas to other experts in the field, long before such results will appear in refereed journals. Researchers in topics related to the conference are widely scattered geographically. This conference will provide the opportunity for them to work together in the same place. Participants will be able to meet and learn from others in the field, continue collaborations, and develop new ones. Funding for participants from U.S. institutions will make it possible for these participants to learn about what is happening at the forefront of topology, and to share their ideas and learn from topologists from Europe and other parts of the world. This is especially important for early-career mathematicians as they are expanding their research interests, and looking for new collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together experts in manifold topology, K-theory, and homotopy theory to learn about recent advances and promote collaboration among researchers in these fields. Plenary speakers for the conference will be Gunnar Carlsson (Stanford), Michael Ching (Amherst), Ralph Cohen (Stanford), Bjorn Dundas (Bergen), Kathryn Hess (EPFL), John Klein (Wayne State), Nick Kuhn (Virginia), Ib Madsen (Copenhagen), Randy McCarthy (UIUC), Charles Rezk (UIUC), Hiro Lee Tanaka (Harvard), Ulrike Tillmann (Oxford), Nathalie Wahl (Copenhagen), Shmuel Weinberger (Chicago) and Michael Weiss (Munster). The work of the plenary speakers reflects the major themes at the interface of manifolds, K-theory, and homotopy theory that will be the focus of the conference. These themes include mapping spaces of manifolds, the calculus of functors, factorization homology, the local and global structure of algebraic K-theory, homotopy theory, and applications of topology. The conference program will consist of lectures by the plenary speakers, together with parallel sessions of contributed talks by conference participants. &lt;br/&gt;More information about the conference can be found at https://sites.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/dubrovnik-topology-2014/.</AbstractNarration>
