    <AbstractNarration>Atmospheric rivers are responsible for bringing large quantities of moisture to the arctic, Pacific Northwest, and California coastlines, leading to heavy precipitation. It is not fully understood how the vertical distribution of moisture and aerosols affects precipitation processes, especially in terms of precipitation efficiency and the flux of moisture that reaches northern latitudes and is available for interaction with cold fronts. It would be advantageous to be able to use direct information on the vertical distribution of moisture and precipitation to investigate the sensitivity of the models to the physics parameterizations during this type of event. While the model tuning approach has in general been successful for the current climate, it is not necessarily expected that as climate changes, the same will be true. Therefore, to make simultaneous measurements of the large-scale vertical distribution of hydrometeors and moisture in these regions of high moisture flux to have a more reliable basis for predicting precipitation is crucial. Airborne measurements of moisture using GPS radio occultation can be used as a targeted method of observation to provide data to address this scientific question, in concert with other airborne and satellite observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent simulations indicate the possibility of detecting the presence of large raindrops from forward scattering effects measured on left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) GPS signals. If this can be shown to be feasible, then airborne GPS radio occultation measurements could not only provide refractivity profiles from normal RHCP signals, but also provide indications of the presence of heavy precipitation and precipitation rates from differential LHCP minus RHCP signals. As a first step in this direction, some preliminary measurements during heavy precipitation events will be made using the existing GISMOS instrument. A NASA DC-8 flight operation in October-November 2014 on flights from California to Chile, then transects across the Drake Passage will provide such an opportunity, which would test data collection with alternate antenna configurations, on the transect over the inter tropical convergence zone where heavy precipitation is likely. Flight tests during August 2014 would also provide a means for performing some needed maintenance on the GISMOS instrument, to prepare it for future work on missions dedicated to atmospheric river events, and for use by the larger NSF community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The attempt to develop this original and innovative use of GISMOS for precipitation sensing simultaneously with moisture sensing with high vertical resolution will advance effective modeling of precipitation processes. The project will focus on the physical phenomenon of atmospheric rivers, an important process of moisture transport from the tropics to mid-latitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The refurbishing and preparation of the GISMOS instrumentation for continued use by the NSF community as part of the HIAPER suite of instrumentation enhances infrastructure for research by contributing to the Lower Atmospheric Observing Facility. The modifications make it possible to use the GPS/INS component of GISMOS separately from the GPS remote sensing components, and directly benefit any researcher using the GV aircraft by substantially increasing the accuracy over the existing instrumentation.</AbstractNarration>
