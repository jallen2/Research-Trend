    <AbstractNarration>The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) will hold its 2014 National Conference in Los Angeles, California, October 16-18, 2014. The National Conference aims to present research from diverse disciplines, share advanced research and discoveries, interact with attendees, and mentor science students. This award will support participants at two scientific symposia. The session will consist of talks in topics of algebra, number theory, and combinatorics at a wide range of mathematical levels. Talks will be 30 minutes and will leave time for a closing question and answer period. One symposium will introduce accessible research topics for students with a post-calculus background, providing a wide range of interesting problems to motivate undergraduates to pursue further research and work in mathematics. The second symposium will provide current cutting-edge mathematical research done by mathematicians from underrepresented groups as well as provide a venue to meet and interact with researchers interested in mentoring underrepresented students in mathematics. The website for the SACNAS conference is http://sacnas.org/events/national-conf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These scientific symposia sessions address a variety of broader impacts in the mathematical community. First, by organizing these sessions during one of the nations largest conferences for Hispanics and Native Americans, the symposia will reach students and professionals from traditionally underrepresented groups in academia. These participants will have the opportunity to see and contribute to current mathematical research presented at the 2014 SACNAS National Conference. In addition, conference participants will be able to hear from mathematicians who come from groups traditionally underrepresented in the mathematical sciences and from mathematicians who have successfully mentored and advised underrepresented students in numerous mathematical research projects. This will give participants an opportunity to hear about possible research projects, meet new mentors and/or advisers, and begin to build a research community beyond their institutions.</AbstractNarration>
