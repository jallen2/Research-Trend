    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this MRI acquisition is to enhance existing research programs, facilitate and promote new multidisciplinary research, and enrich the educational curriculum at University of Michigan-Dearborn (UMD). The requested hybrid and versatile magnetron sputtering/e-beam/evaporation thin film deposition&amp;coating instrument is the next generation thin film deposition system, with unique capabilities of versatile sputtering, electron beam, thermal and organic evaporation, this is the latest and highest quality thin film deposition platform under the same high vacuum chamber. The proposed acquisition of the requested instrument will have great potential to bring more students to engineering and science areas addressing emerging technology demands in the Southeastern Michigan region. This acquisition will significantly enhance the research quality, quantity and visibility, not only at UM-D campus, but also at nearby institutions in the Southeastern Michigan area, and will set the stage for increased levels of interdisciplinary collaborations. The requested instrument with its unique properties will also enable a wide variety of cross disciplinary research initiatives in the Southeastern Michigan region, including General Motors (GM) Global R&amp;D research center, Oakland University, Lawrence Technology University and Henry Ford Community College, as well as education and outreach efforts for K-12 students. Overall, the Principal Investigators expect the requested instrument will impact more than 126 users from 27 research groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested hybrid and versatile magnetron sputtering/e-beam/evaporation thin film deposition&amp;coating instrument will critically provide the fundamental framework for UMD campus in all engineering and science departments to enhance their research efforts and to have a positive impact on associated research and education training. With its unique hybrid and versatile magnetron sputtering, e-beam and evaporation capabilities, multilayer high quality and ultra-thin films can be deposited combining dielectric, metal, semiconductor, organic and magnetic materials with superior interface properties. In situ characterization of a broad range of material properties can be achieved. The requested instrument will enable the exploration of a variety of cross-disciplinary research activities: advanced intelligent and energy efficient vehicle system utilizing integrated optoelectronic devices; high quality and ultra thin functional thin films for next generation photovoltaic cells and solid state lighting devices; batteries; data storage; bioMEMS and microfludics for biomedical engineering; and nanoparticles for health care.</AbstractNarration>
