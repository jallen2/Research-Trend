    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT TITLE&lt;br/&gt;Promoting Student Education and Outreach at the 18th Annual Green Chemistry &amp; Engineering Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This award supports student travel, registration, poster session, and workshop for the 18th Annual Green Chemistry &amp; Engineering (GC&amp;E) Conference sponsored by the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute? (ACS GCI) and its organizing committee made up of scientists from other non-profit organizations, U.S. government agencies, academic institutions, and industry. The theme of the conference is Advancing Chemistry, Innovating for Sustainability. The conference will be held June 17-19, 2014, in Bethesda, MD. The PI for the award is Jennifer J. MacKellar of the ACS GCI. Green chemistry and engineering are areas of study that are essential to providing sustainable solutions to global problems. Green chemistry looks for ways to make new or existing chemicals without using or producing harmful materials; green engineering looks for ways to manufacture new or existing materials less expensively and with less harm to the environment and public health. This conference attracts important researchers and business leaders in green chemistry and engineering and, thus, is an excellent opportunity for attracting the most talented students to plan a career in this area. Additionally, students participating in this conference are exposed to topics not commonly encountered in traditional university courses and conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference emphasizes, through the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate negative impacts on human health and the environment, green chemistry and green engineering approaches to achieve the twin goals of economic prosperity and sustainability. Green chemistry and green engineering are important tools in preventing pollution at the source and providing solutions to global sustainability challenges. Educating the innovators of tomorrow is a crucial part in securing the well-being of the future. This highly successful interdisciplinary conference and workshop provides a proven opportunity for students to receive and apply information that will propel them into research for and development of innovative and sustainable solutions. Workshop participants will learn about the latest developments in green chemistry and engineering while being challenged to consider the broader economic, social and political context in which these developments occur. Through the student workshop, students will learn how to conduct outreach activities and advocate for green chemistry and engineering within their local community. The 2014 GC&amp;E Conference will provide participants the opportunity to explore international green chemistry educational collaborations as part of revitalizing efforts of the GCI International Student Chapters.</AbstractNarration>
