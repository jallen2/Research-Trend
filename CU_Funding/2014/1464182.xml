    <AbstractNarration>This workshop builds upon the expertise and experience of a diverse set of scholars who are experts on multilevel phenomena in an effort to solve relevant problems within the organizational sciences (which naturally require a multilevel perspective, as organizationally-relevant phenomena are nested within levels across time). These scholars will present novel developments in the field, as well discuss and develop new paths for solving complex organizational problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is associated with its attention to the inherently nested nature of organizational phenomena. Scholars within the organizational sciences are increasingly aware of the complex, multilevel, and dynamic nature of applied problems within and between organizations. By including as the two keynote speakers the specific scholars whose book (Klein &amp; Kozlowski, 2000) serves as the seminal work for modern multilevel research in the organizational sciences, the workshop will have the opportunity to look backwards and forwards in making sense of this issue. Moreover, the mixture of panel discussions, individual presentations, and group conversations will serve as a fertile context for advancing and refining new processes, models, and thoughts on multilevel theory and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop's broader impacts are connected with its goal of developing recommendations and guidance for researchers in organizational sciences. Through the work of the experts participating in the workshop, the workshop may produce an edited volume, a special issue at a leading journal, and/or a special research forum at a top journal in an effort to disseminate cutting-edge guidance on the development and application of multilevel research in the field.</AbstractNarration>
