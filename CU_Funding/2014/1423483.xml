    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1423483&lt;br/&gt;Hrenya&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support a new conference titled Frontiers in Particle Science and Technology, which will be held in Chicago from April 29 through May 1, 2014. The conference, which is organized by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, will focus on the interactions among particles and the bulk behavior of particulate systems. It will feature a blend of keynote presentations, submitted talks, and poster sessions by researchers from academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate systems are ubiquitous in manufacturing, especially in the manufacturing of advanced products such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and specialized polymers. Despite their importance, particulate systems still pose challenges in manufacturing. The conference will emphasize cooperation between scientists and engineers in academia and industry and will help bridge the gap between fundamental theory of particulate systems and industrial practice. Support from NSF will be used to help young scientists and engineers, including postdoctoral and graduate students, attend the conference. It will provide these young attendees with opportunities to meet senior researchers in the field from academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>
