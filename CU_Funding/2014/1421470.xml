    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to provide financial support to students who are full time at an US Institution to attend a leading optical engineering conference in their field. The Approach is to have recipients give oral or poster presentations on selected topics relevant to the meeting, and engage with many experts in their field for encouragement into the profession of optics manufacturing and the opportunity to get feedback on their work. Intellectual merit: Presenting research results at a professional meeting and responding to questions and/or comments regarding the work is an essential part of any plan for educating students. Understanding and getting educated on the bigger picture of optical manufacturing is essential for the next generation leaders. Broader impact: This meeting is important as it addresses manufacturing of optics, a key enabling technology in our century. An estimated 500 people from academia, industry, and government laboratories will attend. On the educational level, concerted effort are made to engage and include students in technical conferences and meetings, with strong consideration at equal technical merit to underrepresented students. The overall goal is also to get "new blood" into the profession for our collective future.</AbstractNarration>
