    <AbstractNarration>PI: Fainman, Yeshaiahu&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 1445158&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-San Diego&lt;br/&gt;EAGER: Cartridge lab-on-chip (CLOC) for Mobile Health&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile health (mHealth) uses mobile technologies for health research and healthcare delivery in concert with the more general electronic health concept which encompasses a wide range of services that are at the cutting edge of healthcare and information technology, including access to electronic health records, electronic prescribing, telemedicine, and health informatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The realization of a portable, affordable medical diagnostic platform will have a profound impact on the global level. The proposed research will not only advance the basic science and technology of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems, but will also lead to the development of additional LOCs that do not require external optical components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and develop a smartphone interface system that would enable rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable measurements with simultaneous detection using a medical sensing and diagnostic platform (MSDP) with a disposable cartridge lab-on-a-chip (CLOC) biochip. For integration with advanced mobile platforms They will utilize Google's open hardware platform, Project Ara, exploiting Java programming language which is commonly used by all mobile smartphone companies, including Google's Android. This device will include the use of an inexpensive, single use, disposable and universal CLOC that would be available in both developed and developing countries. The MSDP will perform detection on-chip, obviating the need for bulky detection equipment, paving the way for a truly portable medical diagnostic add-on for future smartphones.</AbstractNarration>
