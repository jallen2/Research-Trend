    <AbstractNarration>Despite advancements in the capability and quality of instrumentation aimed at microphysical measurements within clouds, serious gaps remain that in turn have implications for understanding of earth's weather and climate. Many of these can be traced to inherent uncertainties and limitations of measurement technologies employed aboard cloud-penetrating research aircraft and, just as importantly, the design and behavior of numerical algorithms used to process these raw data. As these instruments have evolved, so have the methodologies for associated data processing and interpretation, however this evolution has not progressed systematically and so processing approaches developed by different groups have too-seldom been evaluated against one another in order to firmly determine optimum processing methods and associated uncertainties. The intellectual merit of this workshop centers upon participant travel support to allow a more diverse group of established experts and students to undertake a carefully organized discussion, evaluation and documentation of a comparatively large selection of processing and analysis methods and associated algorithms that are presently being applied by the international meteorological research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this workshop will include educational opportunities for both early-career workshop participants and students contributing to and later accessing workshop publications, and by facilitating involvement of workshop participants drawn from underrepresented groups. Following the meeting, a technical review of the algorithms that describes their essential components, how they are implemented and their inherent uncertainties and containing a comprehensive bibliography to guide new students and practitioners will be formally published in either the Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology or Atmospheric Measurement Techniques. Benefits will ultimately extend to the atmospheric sciences community at-large, who will for the first time have a firm basis on which to compare diverse cloud microphysical datasets.</AbstractNarration>
