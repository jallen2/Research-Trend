    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer&lt;br/&gt;electronics market (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance,&lt;br/&gt;low power, small footprint multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices,&lt;br/&gt;are all directly microfabricated on a common ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and processed using machine learning&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to exceed $6 billion&lt;br/&gt;dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to&lt;br/&gt;reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion&lt;br/&gt;market. This can have a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with&lt;br/&gt;mobile platforms, can be used to monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these&lt;br/&gt;solutions affordable will make it amenable to low income households not only in the US but also around&lt;br/&gt;the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of knowledge such as in digital sensory&lt;br/&gt;systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale&lt;br/&gt;microfabrication of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the&lt;br/&gt;application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a&lt;br/&gt;structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers, are pervasively used&lt;br/&gt;in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however, requiring higher device&lt;br/&gt;performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on the same&lt;br/&gt;package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by&lt;br/&gt;monolithically fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon&lt;br/&gt;as a structural material. Using e-Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the&lt;br/&gt;structural material, can enable easier routing to implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller&lt;br/&gt;dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as no wafer bonding is required, smaller&lt;br/&gt;form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing low noise and higher&lt;br/&gt;performance. Phase I tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate and characterize e-Cu gyroscopes and&lt;br/&gt;accelerometers with optimal performance parameters and address any drift problems that could emanate&lt;br/&gt;from structural reliability issues associated with the MEMS elements.</AbstractNarration>
