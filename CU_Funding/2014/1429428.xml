    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical: The acquisition of a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer at the University of North Florida (UNF) is expected to benefit the entire Northeast Florida region, through research and educational collaborations with several primarily undergraduate institutions, research universities, community colleges, and local high schools. The team's research projects span many STEM disciplines, including chemistry (inorganic/materials chemistry, organic/organometallic chemistry, and chemical education), condensed matter physics, and the general area of materials science and engineering. The pedagogical impact of this instrument is also extensive because of its incorporation in a) both the chemistry and physics undergraduate curricula (i.e. in advanced labs and in various undergraduate research projects), b) outreach activities both for the general public and for high school students, and c) teachers' education events on the UNF campus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) is the ultimate structural characterization method for chemical compounds and solid-state materials, providing information about bond lengths and angles and the 3D picture of molecules and extended systems. For solid-state materials it probes missing bonds, structural changes, and anisotropy, which is important information for understanding/tweaking the materials' properties. Pressure-induced structural changes are probed with SC-XRD under pressure, with applications in macroscopic post-synthetic properties manipulation in materials. As such, the team uses SC-XRD in interdisciplinary investigations of a) magnetic and correlated materials, b) multiferroics, c) high temperature superconductors, d) molecular magnets and polynuclear clusters, and e) organic/organometallic compounds as drugs and catalysts. Enhancement of these efforts is expected from the microfocus x-ray source and/or the SC-XRD under pressure (&lt;50 GPa) capabilities of the instrument. Incorporation of SC-XRD in the chemistry and physics curricula and through undergraduate research is expected to enrich the experiential learning opportunities offered to UNF undergraduates and expose them to modern materials research. This facility is projected to benefit the entire Northeast Florida, through research and educational collaborations with at least three primarily undergraduate institutions and two research universities. Additionally, incorporation of SC-XRD in teachers' education events and field trips to UNF is poised to expose local high school teachers and students to cutting edge research and strengthen UNF's bonds to the community.</AbstractNarration>
