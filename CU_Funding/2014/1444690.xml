    <AbstractNarration>The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University was awarded a multi-year grant (May 1, 2010- April 30, 2015) to develop an ice imaging system, or "IcePod," for use in measuring the surface and subsurface topography of ice sheets. IcePod will enable research on the effects of global climate change on ice sheets and the effects of sub-glacial water on potential sea-level rise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IcePod sensors are contained in a Common Science Support Pod and operated on NYANG LC-130 aircraft during routine and targeted missions over Greenland and Antarctica. The IcePod instrument package consists of ice-penetrating radar, infrared and visible cameras, laser altimeter, inertial measurement unit, GPS receiver and data acquisition system. IcePod will also enable other instruments to be used in the modular Common Science Support Pod, and will become a shared community research facility providing data to the science community. Funding will support activities in both Greenland and Antarctica needed to commission IcePod, to develop a data reduction flow and data delivery system for IcePod data, and to engineer a UPS to provide IcePod with clean, reliable power for system operation.</AbstractNarration>
