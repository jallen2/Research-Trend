    <AbstractNarration>Pacific Wave is a distributed open internet exchange that provides high performance connectivity among US research and education networks and their international counterparts through points of presence in Los Angeles, Sunnyvale, and Seattle. These facilities are essential infrastructure providing high-performance advanced networking that enables the large-scale data flows, access to high performance computing, and remote visualization necessary for collaborative research in all areas of science and engineering including astronomy, biology, bio-medical engineering, materials science, medicine, earth sciences, high-energy physics, and oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds enhancement and expansion of the Pacific Wave production infrastructure to support multiple 100 gigabit-per-second connections among US-based research and education networks and international counterparts from countries of the Pacific Rim including Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Many research and education networks are developing novel network architectures based on Software Defined Networking to better support the demands of the science and engineering communities that they serve. Project activities also include the development of a parallel set of network connection facilities comprising a distributed Software Defined Exchange to interconnect these emerging Software Defined Networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pacific Wave Expansion project supported by this award achieves these objectives through engagement with the 17 major international research and education networks currently connected to the Pacific Wave exchange and through information and technology exchange with other awardees of the International research network connections program and the US science and engineering research community.</AbstractNarration>
