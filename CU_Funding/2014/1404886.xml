    <AbstractNarration>Professors Daniel E. Austin and Aaron R. Hawkins of Brigham Young University are supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to explore viable pathways to fabricate highly miniaturized linear-type ion trap mass spectrometers. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, simple to manufacture, portable mass spectrometer and to demonstrate its applicability to fast on-site chemical measurement problems. One such application is the monitoring of atmospheric particulates. A wide range of scientific and technical areas, including industrial, environmental, clinical, and air quality monitoring, can benefit from on-site mass spectrometric chemical analysis. This is ultimately an instrument development project, and like all new and improved measurement tools it will facilitate advances in science and technology areas that rely on these measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on the development of a miniaturized linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometer (MS), using two parallel ceramic plates onto which all necessary electrodes are lithographically patterned. The proposed two-plate concept will allow precise alignment of the electrodes, a requirement for maintaining acceptable MS resolution, mass accuracy, and selectivity with miniaturized MS. With one plate fixed, only the position of the second plate will be varied using both mechanical as well as fine piezoelectric alignments. After the plates are aligned, they will be permanently affixed with epoxy to create a miniaturized MS analyzer. Once assembled, the analyzer will be interfaced to a commercial GC to demonstrate portable GC-MS operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument construction and testing tasks involve interdisciplinary education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry and electrical engineering, two areas that increasingly work together in instrument development and for which cross-training is particularly valuable.</AbstractNarration>
