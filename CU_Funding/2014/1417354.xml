    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Andrea Ferroglia and Giovanni Ossola at the New York City College of Technology of the City University of New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data collected and analyzed by the experimental collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) allowed physicists to achieve the first main goal of the LHC scientific program, namely the discovery of the Higgs boson. In the near future, the primary goals of the LHC will be to study the properties of the new particle and to search for signals of new phenomena which are not described by the current Standard Model of particle physics. Theorists need to provide precise predictions for the measured observables. Additional theoretical challenges are provided by processes with several particles in the final state and by the presence of massive particles, such as top quarks and Higgs bosons. The PIs are experts in calculations of these complicated processes, which are necessary for fully understanding the properties of the Higgs boson (and any other particles that may be discovered in the next run of the LHC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to apply the most advanced technical tools for the calculation of radiative corrections in QCD to processes involving real and/or virtual massive particles, such as Higgs bosons, top-quark pairs, and pairs of colored supersymmetric partners of quarks and gluons. For many observables, calculations which go beyond the currently available accuracy are necessary. The PI's plan to employ and further develop the GoSam framework for one-loop calculations, effective field theory methods which allow them to carry out the resummation of large logarithmic corrections directly in momentum space, and recently introduced methods for the analytic or numerical calculation of multiloop and multileg Feynman diagrams.</AbstractNarration>
