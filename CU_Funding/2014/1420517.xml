    <AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose Global vessel and R/V Knorr, a 279?general purpose Global vessel, both of which are operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;Both vessels are owned by the U.S. Navy, have state-of-the-art instrumentation and support all disciplines of oceanographic research. They are considered Global vessels and can accommodate a scientific party of up to 32 persons for as many as 60 days. The vessels work in all the world?s oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF).&lt;br/&gt; In 2013, the R/V Knorr completed 253 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 89% of the total sailing schedule (226 days). R/V Atlantis completed 229 days at sea in 2013. NSF funded projects accounted for 97% of the total sailing schedule (223 days). In 2014, R/V Knorr is scheduled for 248 days with NSF days accounting for 52% (129 days) of the total sailing schedule while R/V Atlantis is scheduled for 301 days with NSF accounting for 276 of those or 92%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt; 1) Valeport 500 kHz Altimeters $12,800 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
