    <AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to provide travel support for U.S. participants in the conference "Cube complexes and groups", which will be held at the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark from 7-11 July 2014. (More information on the conference can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/cubescph2014/) The conference focuses on an exciting and relatively new collection of mathematical results and techniques, which have recently proved useful in resolving longstanding problems. The conference will feature lectures on current research on these and related topics, and also three short courses aimed at early-career researchers interested in working in this field. Accordingly, this proposal is largely aimed at providing early-career mathematicians and graduate students the means to travel from the U.S. to Denmark to attend the lectures and short courses and to collaborate with their European counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is on cubical geometry, broadly construed -- the study of nonpositively-curved cube complexes and median spaces and their applications in group theory and low-dimensional topology. The lectures will cover many different aspects of the topic, including its relationship with geometry, topology, and discrete mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
