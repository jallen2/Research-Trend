    <AbstractNarration>The SCCS (Strongly Coupled Coulomb Systems) meeting is an international scientific conference with a broad focus that includes topics of relevance to multiple fields including, but not limited to, energy and environmental sciences, atmospheric sciences, astrophysics, and high energy density physics. Generally, between 100 and 200 scientists, students, and post-doctoral researchers attend this conference. Topics specifically covered at the conference include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- dense and astrophysical plasmas&lt;br/&gt;- density functional theory&lt;br/&gt;- ionic liquids&lt;br/&gt;- multi-component and astrophysical plasmas&lt;br/&gt;- dusty plasmas&lt;br/&gt;- white dwarfs&lt;br/&gt;- electron liquids&lt;br/&gt;- plasmas in condensed matter&lt;br/&gt;- confined and mesoscopic Coulomb systems&lt;br/&gt;- high energy density plasmas in the laboratory&lt;br/&gt;- classical charged systems&lt;br/&gt;- developments in theoretical methods and numerical techniques&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this conference, it offers students a unique opportunity to not only learn how their research may be applied to other fields, but to also interact with top researchers within their own fields. The last time that this conference was held in the United States was in 2002. However because it took place not long after the attacks of September 11, 2001, many of the international participants were not able to obtain visas to attend. After twelve years, the organizers are finally able to bring the conference back to the US. The long hiatus from the US increases the potential impact of this conference on US science, since it will offer a more affordable opportunity for many US researchers. This is especially important for young researchers who are just beginning to build a network for future collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator anticipates a number of graduate and postgraduate students will attend. All participating students will be asked to fill out and submit an Application for Funding with supporting letters from their graduate advisors to the PI and a technical committee. All submitted applications will be carefully reviewed, and appropriate funds will be distributed to aid accepted students. Partial expenses will be reimbursed for travel, housing, and registration for each of approximately six to ten students.</AbstractNarration>
