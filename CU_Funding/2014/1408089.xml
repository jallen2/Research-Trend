    <AbstractNarration>Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds for three activities:&lt;br/&gt;-- The SuperCDMS Soudan experiment is currently taking data which will have world-leading sensitivity to dark matter for masses below 5 gigaelectronvolt (GeV). The experiment will continue taking data next year, and the full set of different analyses of the data will take place over the next two years. MIT has taken a leadership role in the low-threshold analysis, and will continue to do so. &lt;br/&gt;-- Play a central role in the design, prototyping, testing, and commissioning of the next-generation experiment. &lt;br/&gt;-- Develop and prototype new low-threshold, low-background detectors with enough sensitivity to cover all the available dark matter parameter space for masses between 1-10 GeV down to the irreducible background from solar neutrinos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, continuing the group's strong involvement in mentoring undergraduates from underrepresented groups by participating in the MIT Summer Research Program.</AbstractNarration>
