    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding from the National Science Foundation to support the International Quantum Cascade Laser School and Workshop (IQCLSW), which is to be held in Policoro (Matera) Italy from September 7-12 2014. The IQCLSW workshop serves as a think-tank where the top researchers will report on recent developments in the field of quantum-cascade (QCL) lasers, and brainstorm on promising new directions ranging from questions of basic device physics to applications. New strategic directions are expected to emerge and help define a roadmap for future development of QCL technology. An important component is the 2-day school portion, in which hour-long tutorial presentations are aimed at graduate students to rapidly acquaint them with the fundamentals of this rapidly moving field. Applications, such as high-resolution spectroscopy, chemical sensing for a variety of diagnostic uses, coherent detection, imaging, and infrared countermeasures will be discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics to be covered at IQCLSW include quantum cascade laser device design, modeling, characterization and testing, as well as the basics of QCL transport and optical confinement.. This workshop will address both the fundamental physics aspect of these devices as well as new developments. The 3-day workshop session will have approximately 30-35 invited and contributed talks, as well as poster sessions. There will be 3 keynote speakers given by figures who have played a major role in QC-laser development over a sustained time period. An important facet of this is the international scientific participation and dissemination of information, which may lead to new collaborations and advances in the state of the art. This workshop will have a significant focus on applications and will engage the nascent QCL industry. The school portion is directly aimed at the training and education of graduate-student researchers. The IQCLSW websites will archive the workshop presentations for general access. Specifically, the NSF funding will help reduce the registration fees for students, and will provide travel support for US attendees (with priority towards student presenters).</AbstractNarration>
