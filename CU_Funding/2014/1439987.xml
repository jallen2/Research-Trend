    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to participate in the Thirteenth Summer School on Exotic Beam Physics at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, July 27- August 1, 2014. The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate students who are actively involved in research, and postdocs (within 2 years of their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to nurture future scientists so that the community will have sufficient manpower to effectively use the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the elements to the enhancement of national security.</AbstractNarration>
