    <AbstractNarration>This I/UCRC Fundamental Research Program project plans to research the adaptation of in-situ self-calibration methods developed for interferometric measurement of optical surfaces to measurement of freeform optical surfaces on precision coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). In optics manufacturing, a fundamental measurement is a map of surface errors, a hit map which is used to perform corrective polishing. This project will develop calculation methods that evaluate the uncertainty point-wise in that map and enable the estimation of the uncertainty in any parametric description of the error map. Methods developed in ultraprecision interferometric metrology will be applied to contact measurement of complex optical surfaces. The result will enable new optical surface shapes to be measured, and hence made, thus opening up new design space that researchers on CeFO faculty and elsewhere can explore productively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freeform optics represent a transformative opportunity, enabling compact, light,&lt;br/&gt;high resolution infra-red imaging systems that can have broad application from automotive to manufacturing process control, defense and disaster relief. The fundamental metrology knowledge will be developed with member companies of the Center for Freeform Optics, ensuring rapid technology transfer and uptake of new methods. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the center's portfolio while potentially attracting new members. Research results will be integrated into the PI's undergraduate manufacturing class, where high tech optics inspire interest.</AbstractNarration>
