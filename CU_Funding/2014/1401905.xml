    <AbstractNarration>The award supports the attendance of twelve students to the International conference on Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation (VMCAI), to be hosted in San Diego, January 19-21. VMCAI is a successful established conference that bridges the gap between the various methodologies that are used for formal verification. VMCAI been a source for much collaboration and cross-fertilization and has attracted many of the key researchers in the related fields. Students have much to gain from attending VMCAI like learning state-of-the-art methodologies, being exposed to novel techniques, and interacting with senior researchers in their chosen area of expertise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of formal verification is becoming widely accepted. Increasing the attendance of students in VMCAI will expose more students to the exciting developments in the field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the field, which will impact both industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>
