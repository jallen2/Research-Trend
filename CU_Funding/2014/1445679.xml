    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project is to provide travel support for students to attend the 2014 Siegman International School which is to be held at Stanford University from August 3-8 2014. The requested amount is $15,000 for travel and accommodation support for 10 US students. The educational program will consist of a series of presentations on recent advances in the field of lasers given by world experts. Student attendees will have the opportunity to interact with leading scientists and engineers from academic and industry. The meeting will facilitate an open technical exchange between students and lecturers and will promote networking and professional development. The exchange of ideas and future collaboration possibilities are expected to enhance training of a US workforce in this important area of photonics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 Siegman International School on Lasers will take place at Stanford University from August 3-8 2014. The Program will consist of a variety of invited speakers who will give presentations over the course of five days on the Stanford University campus. Student attendees will participate in a program of lectures, networking and professional development opportunities, poster presentations and research sharing discussions. The following program topics are to be covered: Optical Fibers, Solid State Lasers, Nano-Lasers/Exotic Laser Systems, Silicon Photonics, and Quantum Theory of Lasers. The instructors have agreed to have daily interaction with the students. The daily interactions with the world renowned instructors are a proven vehicle for sharing of technical insights.</AbstractNarration>
