    <AbstractNarration>1406357&lt;br/&gt;La Verne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will provide funds for 6 young faculty (assistant professors), post docs and graduate and undergraduate students in the field of radiation chemistry. In the field of environmental engineering and science, one of the new technologies for the destruction of chemicals in water, wastewater and site remediation is referred to as advance oxidation. Advanced oxidation was name for any process that involves the hydroxyl radical. This radical is very highly reactive and is capable of destroying chemicals, killing bacteria and parasites and inactivating viruses. The fundamental science of the process lies in the field of radiation chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The application of radiation chemistry for solving environmental problems is accomplished using several techniques including UV/hydrogen peroxide, TiO2 irradiated with light (both UV and sunlight), Ozone/hydrogen peroxide and lastly, the electron beam process. As many of the easy environmental problems have been solved the field will turn to destructive processes to accomplish the goals. in environmental engineering, although many employ these advanced oxidation processes, few actually understand the fundamental science. Therefore, the more scientists and engineers that are trained to understand this chemistry the more effectively these processes will be applied.</AbstractNarration>
