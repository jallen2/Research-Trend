    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the international meeting "Building Bridges: 2nd EU/US Summer School &amp; Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics," which will take place June 30 to July 11, 2014, at the University of Bristol, England. The website with details is http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~mamjd/bb/index.html. Grant funds will be used to support US-based participants in the international summer school and workshop. This conference follows the success of the meeting "Building Bridges: 1st Summer School &amp; Workshop," held in Aachen, Germany, in August 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms are present in almost every area of modern number theory, and they are becoming increasingly important in mathematical physics. Current research on automorphic forms is being impacted by such topics as "Explicit Methods for Modular Forms and L-functions," "The Legacy of Ramanujan," and "The Langlands Program," which are the three mini-course topics for the summer school. Each mini-course is led by a team of two internationally-recognized researchers, and will consist of three hours of lecture each morning, followed by work sessions (in small groups) in the afternoon, focused on exercises developed by the instructors. Designated post-doctoral researchers and the instructors will provide tutorial support during these sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the summer school is a conference on automorphic forms and related topics, where participants will present cutting-edge research in all areas related to automorphic forms. This workshop aims not only to foster and strengthen a long-lasting exchange between automorphic forms researchers in the EU and the US, but also to generate and sustain a friendly, supportive atmosphere, providing encouragement to young researchers, establishing mentoring opportunities for more established researchers, and serving as a forum for exchanging ideas and forming new collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
