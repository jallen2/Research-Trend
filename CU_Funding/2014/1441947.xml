    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore surfaces capable of producing terahertz (THz) waves for novel detection and sensing applications. These surfaces have micron scale patterns that produce changes in light beam reflected from them. With proper design it is expected that these metasurfaces, will lead to THz light waves. The THz portion of the electromagnetic spectrum represents a frontier for multidisciplinary fundamental research in engineering, physics, and materials science with enormous potential impact on imaging and sensing. The proposed research will enhance the outreach programs that PI has built at the University of Alabama. PI has been active in education program for under representative minorities, veterans, and K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research can potentially lead to a new paradigm for imaging and sensing in the THz frequency region, by enabling new classes of optics components, which can replace conventional bulky counterparts for integrated optical devices. The proposed research will also lead to a new class of metasurfaces and planar photonics with the ability to operate in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, the proposed research will be able to disclose properties of optical orbital angular momentum, and its direct application to the sensing and imaging that can open whole new concepts of imaging and sensing technologies. The approach is to investigate the role of helical waves in multiple different modes for sensing biomolecules which have high chirality, and in imaging of complex media with both far-field and near-field high resolution. Based on this research, the PI will develop a new course, Metamaterials and Waves, for undergrads and graduates.</AbstractNarration>
