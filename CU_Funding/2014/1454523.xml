    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) and the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Programs, both in the Division of Materials Research (DMR), and by the Quantum Information Science Program (QIS) in the Division of Physics (PHY).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project seeks to understand and control light-matter interactions in nanoscale photonic structures for potential applications in quantum information science, i.e., information science depending on quantum effects in physics. Specifically, by studying single solid-state emitters in the presence of engineered nanostructures designed to create highly confined and intense optical fields, this project aims to create transformative technologies using quantum mechanical properties. This fundamental materials study could lead to secure long-distance communication and complex simulations. It may also enable electronic devices with enhanced performance and low-power consumption such as light sources, high-sensitivity sensors, and sub-wavelength imaging. This project has broad educational goals coupled to the research aims, with a focus on the pipeline of future scientific researchers. The project facilitates the establishment of a Photonics Academy, offering local high school students exposure to cutting-edge photonics and science careers. Research outcomes are integrated into courses and course modules at the undergraduate level. Expanded mentorship for women in physics is offered for junior female researchers ranging from undergraduate to postgraduate levels at Duke University with the aim of increasing retention of women in science and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;Addressing single quantum states, efficient state detection, and links between multiple nodes are essential building blocks for future quantum information science applications such as secure long-distance communication, quantum computing, and complex simulations. Increased understanding of quantum effects and control at the nanometer scale is essential for enabling optoelectronic devices with new or enhanced functionalities. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to understand and control light-matter interactions of and between single solid-state quantum emitters in photonic structures with ultra-small mode volumes for potential applications in classical and quantum information science. In pursuit of this goal, the project objectives are to (i) control radiative processes of single point defects in diamond by inclusion in highly engineered plasmonic nanocavities; and (ii) explore the strong coupling regime with point defects in diamond. The approach is to probe isolated nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond coupled to plasmonic nanocavities using ultrafast optical experiments, including photon statistics measurements, fluorescence lifetimes, and pump-probe techniques. The project advances the understanding of fundamental physical behavior and phenomena arising between optical fields and solid-state quantum emitters embedded in artificially structured photonic materials with sub-10 nm dimensions and this fundamental study may lead to a broad range of technologically important applications.</AbstractNarration>
