    <AbstractNarration>Conference: 2014 Plant Cell Dynamics Meeting. Madison Wisconsin, June 4-7 2014. There is a need to develop the knowledge base that will enable the rational design of improved crop species. The attainment of this goal requires an understanding of how plant cells integrate the behavior of their cellular components with their metabolism and with cell shape and size not only during the growth and development of the plant but also in the response of the plant to environmental challenges. This meeting emphasizes the participation of students (including members of under-represented groups) at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral level and will provide support for 18 attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting on plant cell dynamics seeks to promote the use of innovative methods for live cell imaging, image quantification, signal processing, and computational simulations in order to gain a mechanistic understanding of plant cellular systems. The meeting will advance this goal by providing opportunities for plant cell biologists to discuss their latest research results, develop collaborations, gain hands-on experience with current state-of-the art approaches, and by promoting the development of new tools. The meeting will provide an open forum for oral presentations and promote discussion and interaction between established investigators and newcomers to the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Symbiosis, Defense and Self Recognition Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.</AbstractNarration>
