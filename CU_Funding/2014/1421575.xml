    <AbstractNarration>The increasingly widespread use of multicore processors, whose computing power&lt;br/&gt;can only be unleashed by concurrent software, makes software defects, or bugs,&lt;br/&gt;become more common and labor-intensive to detect and repair. Runtime verification&lt;br/&gt;is a novel analysis approach that extracts information from a running system and&lt;br/&gt;uses it to detect and possibly react to observed behaviors satisfying or violating&lt;br/&gt;certain properties. Runtime verification scales well and avoids the complexity of&lt;br/&gt;traditional formal verification techniques. The techniques developed in this project &lt;br/&gt;will lead to robust production quality software by providing a scalable alternative &lt;br/&gt;to formal verification that provides many of the same guarantees for safety and security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a scalable predictive runtime verification framework&lt;br/&gt;for concurrent software. A major technical advancement over prior art is that it&lt;br/&gt;not only detects errors when they occur at runtime, but is able to predict general&lt;br/&gt;security and safety property violations before they actually surface, preventing&lt;br/&gt;bad behaviors from happening by taking proper actions defined by the users. This&lt;br/&gt;project builds upon a sound and maximal causal model, hereby providing the provably&lt;br/&gt;maximum possible prediction power on the observed trace with no false alarms. The&lt;br/&gt;core research insight of this work is to explore the maximal causality of concurrency&lt;br/&gt;with automated constraint solving, which has been studied for decades and is becoming&lt;br/&gt;increasingly powerful.</AbstractNarration>
