    <AbstractNarration>The research team is developing a shrinkage reducing admixture for application in portland cement-based materials such as concrete. This technology focuses on reducing the surface tension of the pore solution by disrupting the hydrogen bonding of water molecules in the liquid phase at the vapor-liquid interface. The basis of this technology lies in the team?s ability to predict new structures using an intelligent computer aided molecular design methodology that utilizes quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR) and inverse design logic. This is one of the first demonstrations of the use of computer aided molecular design using QSPR to discover new admixtures for concrete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concrete is one of the major building blocks of roads and structures across the globe, and each year billions of dollars are spent replacing concrete damaged due to cracking-related issues. The admixture developed by this research team would serve to help reduce shrinkage of concrete, which is one of the main causes of concrete cracking, damage and failure. Concrete that is less prone to damage would result in less cost for repair and overall, stronger, more durable structures and roadways.</AbstractNarration>
