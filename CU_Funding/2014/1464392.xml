    <AbstractNarration>Overview: Large fluxes of apparently refractory terrigenous dissolved organic matter (t-DOM) are transported through rivers to the coast each year, yet there are vanishingly low traces of t-DOM in the oceans. The removal of t-DOM is central to the global carbon cycle, yet the mechanisms that drive removal remain poorly understood. In soils, the presence of labile organic compounds is known to enhance the remineralization of recalcitrant compounds, a phenomenon known as the priming effect (PE). The PE is quantitatively important in soil systems, but has received little attention in aquatic systems despite its potential to explain C mineralization patterns at the land-sea interface. This project investigates the magnitude of PE in the coastal ocean and the metabolic and ecological mechanisms that give rise to it. It focuses on the microbial communities of US Atlantic Ocean coastal marshes. In these systems, river-borne t-DOM provides a particularly valuable and tractable model for evaluating the magnitude of the PE. The study utilizes a well-characterized DOM standard collected from a Georgia river as the model t-DOM material in a series of laboratory experiments with natural coastal microbial communities and cultures of heterotrophic marine bacteria of the Roseobacter lineage. Roseobacters are particularly appropriate biological models for this work as they are abundant in southeastern US coastal zones and are known to catabolize lignin and other plant-derived aromatic compounds. Long-term (60 day) incubation experiments will track the PE resulting from addition of labile DOM of differing chemical complexity. Changes in lignin phenols will be the primary measure of the influence of PE on t-DOM degradation, but the research also monitors a broader suite of aromatic compounds represented by optical properties and identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Measurements of the microbial response to added labile organic matter, via extracellular enzyme activities, bacterial production, community composition and gene transcript analysis, will reveal the biological mechanisms responsible for the PE. Experiments using Roseobacter strains will allow detailed investigation of the relationship between metabolic pathways, specific bacteria, and organic carbon mineralization in a well-defined experimental system. Data on gene expression, microbial activity, and DOM transformations from the lab experiments will be integrated to elucidate the specific metabolic pathways invoked as part of the PE and guide development of molecular tools to track genetic signatures along a river to coastal ocean transect in the final year of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The role of heterotrophic microorganisms in remineralizing t-DOM at the land-sea interface is a central question in biological oceanography. Components of t-DOM, principally lignin, are refractory in the sense that degradation rates are typically slow relative to other biomolecules, and yet lignin is effectively removed somewhere between land and the open ocean. The project will determine whether priming plays a role in the rapid removal of t-DOM in the coastal ocean, provide evidence for the types of labile organic matter most effective as priming agents, and attempt to discover the metabolic pathways by which the PE is mediated. These studies have the potential to reveal conserved and predictable metabolic responses that may contribute to regulation of the transformation and turnover of naturally occurring semi-labile/refractory DOM in marine environments. As climate change is likely to affect fluxes of both terrigenous carbon and nutrients to the coastal ocean, understanding the magnitude and mechanisms of PE will be necessary to predict the geochemical consequences of these changing fluxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will directly support the interdisciplinary and multi-institutional training of two graduate students and several undergraduate students. Training opportunities under a recently funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at UTK will be leveraged and extended to local UTK undergraduates participating in the project. Funding of this project will also provide support for research faculty to continue to develop an outreach program at a primarily minority high school in Newark NJ. Finally, all PIs will continue to disseminate their research results in presentations, papers and other forms on a timely basis.</AbstractNarration>
