    <AbstractNarration>From June 2 through June 6, 2014, Boston University will host an international conference entitled "p-adic Variation in Number Theory." The conference will focus on the notion that automorphic forms vary in p-adic families and the multitude of applications resulting from this variation. Over the last decade, there has been enormous progress in Iwasawa theory and the study of Galois representations fueled by advances in the p-adic variation of automorphic forms (e.g. the proofs of the Main Conjecture of modular forms and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture along with recent developments in attaching Galois representations to automorphic forms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this conference, experts will lecture on the most recent developments and applications relating to p-adic variation to bring the participants of the conference up to date in this quickly evolving field. Many young researchers will participate. Some of the conference's lectures will be delivered by recent PhDs. In addition, funding will be provided to over 50 graduate students and recent PhDs in total, to be selected through an application process. Special attention will be given to any applications received from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: math.bu.edu/Glennfest/Glennfest.html</AbstractNarration>
