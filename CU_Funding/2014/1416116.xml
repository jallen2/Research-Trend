    <AbstractNarration>In this International Collaboration in Chemistry project supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Mirkin and his research team at the City University of New York, Queens College is collaborating with Prof. Christian Amatore and his group at the Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, on molecular mechanistic studies of the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The ORR process is central to many technological systems (e.g., fuel cells, lithium and sodium batteries, catalysis) as well as biological processes, including oxidation of food and drug molecules in liver, ageing, and numerous diseases. Despite extensive research on the ORR during several decades, basic questions about its molecular mechanism remain open. Professor Mirkin is developing new experimental and computational methods to study the ORR with the aim of advancing our understanding of these fundamentally interesting and practically important electrocatalytic reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoelectrochemical techniques, including scanning electrochemical microscopy and voltammetry at the nanopipette-supported interface between two immiscible liquids are used for the mechanistic analysis of the ORR. Very fast mass-transfer, high sensitivity and selectivity of these techniques enable the detection and quantification of short-lived ionic species produced in the course of the ORR, such as superoxide. The kinetics of the intermediate formation and consumption are analyzed with the help of the recently developed KISSA-2D simulation package. The anticipated results have significant implications for fuel cells, other alternative energy systems, and sensors. The proposed activities enhance the infrastructure for research and education at the City University of New York, Queens College by stimulating the development of new instrumentation. The established international collaboration provides additional training opportunities for students in both research groups and exposes them to a wide range of experimental and computational approaches. The proposed activities provide research opportunities to high school students and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
