    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research is to develop a novel hydrogel biomaterials platform with internal alignment and signals to guide the maturation, organization and function of neuron and glial cells, thereby generating a more physiologically relevant nerve tissue model. Despite many advances in tissue engineering, the ability to control cell alignment and organization in 3D is still limited. This study will provide key knowledge for the rational design and synthesis of internally aligned hydrogel microfibers with integrated signaling cues and physical properties from a wide range of biopolymers. Through partnerships with clinical and industrial scientists, the PI and co-PI will develop functionalities of these new materials for regenerating tissues including peripheral nerve, spinal cord, skeletal muscle and microvasculature. This project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students on biomaterials, nanotechnology and regenerative medicine. The research activities will also promote the recruitment and mentoring of women and underrepresented minority students through highly effective outreach programs targeting inner-city high school students in the Baltimore area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: Matrix alignment is an important feature in many types of tissues for inducing cell organization, tissue microarchitecture, regulating cell migration and controlling biological functions. However, there is a shortage of robust methodologies for engineering alignment cues within polymer hydrogels to control the 3D spatial patterns of the encapsulated cells. This study aims to engineer a novel hydrogel microfiber platform with internal alignment with added biochemical cues to mediate neuron and Schwann cell alignment and maturation. This platform is expected to be highly effective for myelination and in generating an in vitro functional 3D nerve fascicle tissue model. The technological impact of these studies would be enhanced through the partnerships with clinical and industrial scientists, and these collaborations are expected to result in multiple regenerative biomedical applications of these hydrogel microfibers. This project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities to graduate students and undergraduate students through research and new curriculum development. Additionally, the investigators will promote the recruitment and mentoring of students from underrepresented groups through highly effective outreach programs in the campus.</AbstractNarration>
