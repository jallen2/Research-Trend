    <AbstractNarration>For over two decades NSF has been investing in the development and evaluation of giant screen films for viewing by audiences in science centers and museums. These have been highly successful in terms of audiences reached and project evaluations that indicate their impact on learning. Less well understood is how the unique attributes of giant screen films (e.g., "immersion" and "presence") affect learners in ways that differ from other film formats. This integrated research and media project will contribute to that knowledge base. Project deliverables will include a giant screen film that tells the story of the discovery of biological mimicry (the critical proof for natural selection and in turn, evolution) through the life story of Henry Bates and his travels through the Amazon rainforest more than 150 years ago; 2D dome, and 2D flat format versions; live interactive science demonstrations and educational resources; and workshops for ISE professionals. The film and the related outreach via science centers, social media, and the web are expected to reach large public audiences; workshops and web resources will reach ISE professionals nationally. A strategy for reaching underrepresented audiences through science museums and partnerships with educational societies is a part of the broadening participation effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on results of an NSF-funded workshop in which researchers, evaluators, and filmmakers began to develop a research agenda to provide evidence about giant screen attributes and their impacts on learning, the research component of this project will focus on the differences in learner knowledge among the various film formats, their unique attributes, and whether format plays a role in science interest and science identity. A baseline study will be conducted to begin gathering evidence on how each of these formats affects learning. Data on audience knowledge gains, interest, and science identity will be collected using a novel tablet-based game-like assessment pre-film viewing, immediately post viewing, and in a later follow-up. These baseline data will inform follow-on research that, over time, can better explain the unique impacts on learning of the giant screen format. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project partners include the Pacific Science Center, SK Films, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Rutgers University, and Arizona State University.</AbstractNarration>
