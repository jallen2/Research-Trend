    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences support the "2014 Colloidal Semiconductor Nanocrystals Gordon Research Conference" to be held at Bryant University, Rhode Island on July 20-25, 2014. The conference is chaired by Prof. Emily Weiss of Northwestern University. NSF funds will be used primarily to support the participation of US scientists, especially graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early-career scientists. The development of nanocrystal-based technologies for bio-applications and materials for energy conversion has potential broad impacts on society. This conference will provide a stimulating environment for significant discussions on fundamental science and technological advances at the frontier of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals research. The conference participants will be diverse with respect to area of expertise, academic level, country of origin, and gender. The interactions between scientists from different but complementary backgrounds enable fruitful discussions and catalyze new (inter)national collaborations. The conference will also provide the opportunities for students, post-doctoral researchers and young faculty, including women and members of underrepresented groups, to interact with more established members and world-leading experts in their field and to gain a better perspective of the field.</AbstractNarration>
