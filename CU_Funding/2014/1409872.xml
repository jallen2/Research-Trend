    <AbstractNarration>Smartphones and tablets with rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are&lt;br/&gt;becoming increasingly popular. Hundreds of thousands of specialized&lt;br/&gt;applications, called apps, are already available for these mobile&lt;br/&gt;platforms, and the number of newly released apps continues to&lt;br/&gt;increase. The complexity of these apps lies often in the user&lt;br/&gt;interface, with data processing either minor, or delegated to a&lt;br/&gt;backend component. A similar situation exists in applications using&lt;br/&gt;the software-as-a-service architecture, where the client-side&lt;br/&gt;component consists mostly of user interface code. Testing such&lt;br/&gt;applications predominantly involves GUI testing. Existing automatic&lt;br/&gt;techniques for testing these interfaces either require a priori models&lt;br/&gt;of the interface and are thus hard to use, or operate blindly by&lt;br/&gt;sending random user events to the application and are typically unable&lt;br/&gt;to test the application in satisfactory depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates automatic GUI testing techniques that&lt;br/&gt;systematically explore the state space of an application without&lt;br/&gt;requiring an a priori defined model. One insight behind this project&lt;br/&gt;is that the automatic construction of a model of the user interface&lt;br/&gt;and the testing of the interface are tasks that can cooperate in a&lt;br/&gt;mutually beneficial way. Furthermore, a guiding principle throughout&lt;br/&gt;this research is to design algorithms that operate with abstractions&lt;br/&gt;and heuristics that are simple enough to be understood by humans who&lt;br/&gt;do not necessarily understand the internals of the tested app. Such&lt;br/&gt;algorithms are easier to comprehend and to incorporate into a&lt;br/&gt;wholistic test process that includes automated techniques, such as the&lt;br/&gt;ones developed in this project, and manual testing and guidance. The&lt;br/&gt;techniques developed in this project benefit directly programmers for&lt;br/&gt;these apps, and indirectly the numerous users of mobile and web&lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
