    <AbstractNarration>Astronomical observations are now probing the early stages of the universe, in which galaxies&lt;br/&gt;developed and merged, and the formation of the structures in the universe at the present era&lt;br/&gt;was set in motion. An important part of this story is the chemical evolution of galaxies. The&lt;br/&gt;formation of the elements in the first stars and their subsequent dispersal are powerful tracers&lt;br/&gt;of structure formation and evolution in the early universe. This project involves the simulation&lt;br/&gt;of processes deep inside stars of the early universe that experience hydrogen ingestion&lt;br/&gt;events caused by mixing of material across the boundaries of convection zones. In 1-D stellar&lt;br/&gt;evolution simulations, these give rise to rapid hydrogen burning, with enormous energy release&lt;br/&gt;and causing nucleosynthesis by neutron capture from neutron fluxes intermediate between the&lt;br/&gt;slow (s) and rapid (r) processes. This is the intermediate, or i-process nucleosynthesis that&lt;br/&gt;is targeted in this study. Accurate treatment of the convective boundary mixing that drives&lt;br/&gt;this i-process requires full 3-D simulation. The rapid hydrogen burning that ensues, together&lt;br/&gt;with the very large luminosities involved make 3-D simulation affordable on NSF?s powerful&lt;br/&gt;new supercomputing platform, Blue Waters, at NCSA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new and powerful capability will be built in this project to simulate these events by coupling&lt;br/&gt;together 3-D simulations that cover brief time intervals with 1-D simulations spanning much&lt;br/&gt;longer times. In some cases that will be addressed, it is possible to simulate the entire event&lt;br/&gt;in 3-D. In others, 3-D simulations performed at intervals as part of a coupled 1-D and 3-D&lt;br/&gt;stellar evolution calculation will serve to recalibrate the coefficients in approximate 1-D models&lt;br/&gt;for dynamic mixing processes. Such coupled calculations will use these periodic model&lt;br/&gt;recalibrations to validate the use of the models as the calculation progresses. When unacceptably&lt;br/&gt;large revisions of model "constants" are indicated, a recomputation with 3-D recalibrations&lt;br/&gt;taken at shorter time intervals will result. This new process is called autocorrecting modeling.&lt;br/&gt;It involves periodic generation of large amounts of 3-D data from simulation codes. This data&lt;br/&gt;generation is followed by a detailed analysis of the data in terms of 1-D models. The results&lt;br/&gt;of this analysis are then fed back into the 1-D stellar evolution computation. Pioneering this&lt;br/&gt;new approach is a major challenge of the project; the database of condensed simulation results&lt;br/&gt;that will be built in the process will be a significant outcome of the project. This data will be&lt;br/&gt;made available first to collaborators and ultimately to the broad community. It will be possible&lt;br/&gt;to use this data to formulate, validate, and refine simplified models of the convective boundary&lt;br/&gt;mixing processes that are a major focus of this study. It will also be possible for others,&lt;br/&gt;potentially using quite different simulation software, to use this data to adopt an autocorrecting&lt;br/&gt;modeling approach in studies of related problems. In the first year of this project, a continuation&lt;br/&gt;of present work with the well observed case of Sakurai's object is planned along with application&lt;br/&gt;of the new techniques to simulations of low-mass, low-metallicity AGB stars.</AbstractNarration>
