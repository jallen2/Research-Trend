    <AbstractNarration>The "Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems Workshop" will take place on April 3--6, 2014 in the Department of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The workshop has also received financial support from the Department of Mathematics and the College of Arts and Sciences. The workshop focuses on several key topics in ergodic theory: specifically ergodic theory applied to actions of non-amenable groups and a study of Lyapunov exponents. The keynote speaker is Professor Benjamin Weiss from Hebrew University who is an expert in the field of ergodic theory with a research portfolio spanning over 40 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF funding for the workshop will provide support for younger researchers (graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and assistant professors), especially those from under-represented groups. Young researchers are given ample opportunities to speak, to talk and to participate in the conference activities. This workshop also strives to have a global impact in the mathematical community. Throughout the existence of the workshop, participants have come from around the world. The organizers have purposefully recruited participants and speakers from Africa and more recently from Latin America. Additionally, the workshop will continue to serve as a successful platform of recruitment at U.S. institutions for graduate students from developing countries.</AbstractNarration>
