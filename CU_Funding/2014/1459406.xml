    <AbstractNarration>Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a small but important fraction of the marine carbon pool that interacts with solar radiation and thus affects many photochemical and biological processes in the ocean. Despite its importance, the chemical basis for the formation of oceanic CDOM remains unclear. CDOM may be formed from two possible sources: 1) heterotrophic bacterial transformations of primary productivity (plankton-derived), or 2) terrestrially-derived. This project will examine the role of phytoplankton as a source of CDOM in the ocean by utilizing a powerful, new technique to measure particulate organic matter absorbance and fluorescence, discrete chemical measurements of probable precursors to planktonic CDOM, and enzymatic assays. Results of this research will provide new insights into the origin and production of planktonic CDOM and its transformation by heterotrophic bacteria. This research on CDOM will be shared broadly through a module at a North Carolina Aquarium, and streaming live feeds of shipboard activities to elementary school classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrestrial and oceanic dissolved organic matter (DOM) differ in their chemical composition. Laboratory and open-ocean observations suggest that bacterial transformation of phytoplankton DOM produces humic-like CDOM signals that are visually similar to those in terrestrial CDOM. However, prior studies of oceanic CDOM using absorbance and fluorescence fit an electronic interaction (EI) model of intramolecular charge transfer (CT) reactions between donor and acceptor molecules common to partially-oxidized terrestrial molecules found in humic substances. This project will test the hypothesis that phytoplankton and bacteria provide a source of donors and acceptors that are microbially-transformed and linked, enabling CT contacts between them and creating oceanic CDOM. To address this, researchers will systematically study phytoplankton growth, including marine snow formation. A new technique for measuring base-extracted POM (BEPOM) absorbance and fluorescence will be used to incorporate planktonic CDOM results into the EI model, and supplemented with measurements of its probable chemical precursors. Determining the time course and extent of phytoplankton POM and DOM transformation by heterotrophic bacteria during the same phytoplankton growth experiments will provide an in-depth understanding as to how bacterial transformation of marine snow-associated planktonic organic matter drives CDOM production throughout the ocean.</AbstractNarration>
