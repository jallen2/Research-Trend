    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of 17 US participants, especially young researchers and graduate students who do not have other grant support, to attend and participate in the satellite conference to the International Congress of Mathematicians. The conference is to be held at Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea, from August 13-21, 2014, and called "Complex Dynamics in One and Several Variables".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lecturers are leading researchers in this vibrant field of dynamical systems and have been chosen for their record in mentoring and nurturing young talent. They also include senior lecturers who will be at the larger conference in Korea already, so will not need much extra funding. There will be at least 6 talks by young researchers as well as participation by many Korean mathematicians already in the field or new to the field of one and several variable complex dynamics. This will lead to a valuable international exchange in an important area of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
