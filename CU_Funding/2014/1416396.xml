    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that a successful navigation assistive device designed from the study of 3D haptic feedback will enable the blind and visually impaired more mobility, which can translate to more employment opportunities and improved quality of life. Beyond this market, the design of haptic 3D navigation technology will have applications in fields that require situational awareness, particularly in fields where the visual and auditory senses can be overwhelmed or temporarily obstructed such as with first response, military, and search and rescue. There are also applications in immersive entertainment applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to perform a feasibility study into assistive navigation technology based on 3D sensors coupled with haptic vibration to provide individuals information of their surroundings. The blind and visually impaired communities are underserved by infrastructure, and especially experience difficulty when it comes to navigating new places both indoors and outdoors. To this end, modular discreet wearable haptic devices are being designed and evaluated to provide the wearer navigation information. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the study of how, where, and what number of locations haptic feedback can be used to convey detailed and crucial 3D information to&amp;#8232;the body. This will be achieved through experiments in real world settings and virtual environment testing.</AbstractNarration>
