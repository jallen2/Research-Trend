    <AbstractNarration>The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was chartered in 1990 to test the effects of increased temperature on tundra plant phenology, growth, species composition and ecosystem function. Since 2007, the ITEX-Arctic Observatory Network (ITEX-AON) has continued and expanded on the ITEX program across a latitudinal transect of five sites in Alaska and Greenland, collecting core ITEX data specifically designed to address the current needs outlined in the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) Implementation Report. The goal of this effort is to maintain the continuity of the temporally-critical datasets of the ITEX-AON in Alaska and Greenland. Core datasets include the long-term manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, ecosystem function, and surface properties on the long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of the vegetation plots on the 1km2 ARCSS grids, and a multifactor warming-moisture experiment in Greenland. The simultaneous measurement of multiple surface properties at the small scale has allowed detection of relationships not previously recognized, e.g., in moss-dominated areas of the intensive transects, higher albedo is linked to higher temperatures. Continuation of these measurements is imperative because increasing evidence points towards the critical importance of carry-over effects of the previous growing seasons on current and future responses and the inherent variability in the system precluded determination of the system response on the basis of a few years. Data from this project are freely available on the ACADIS website. The project will continue extensive outreach activities established in the initial phase, including strong relationships between the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (FTBG) and the GVSU Regional Math and Science Center and school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids, and El Paso.</AbstractNarration>
