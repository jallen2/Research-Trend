    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry supports this project which provides funds for the attendance and research presentations of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from U.S. universities at the Chemical Reactions at Surfaces Gordon Research Seminar to be held on February 7-8, 2015 at the Ventura Beach Marriott in Ventura Beach, CA. Knowledge about chemical reactions at surfaces underpins important technologies such as catalysis and economically important industries that utilize catalysis. The Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will involve seminars, poster presentations and discussion on this topic broadly, and the subsequent Gordon Research Conference (GRC) that the students and postdocs will be able to attend will focus specifically on topics of theory and computation of reactions at surfaces, environmental chemistry, fundamental mechanistic studies, catalysis, new materials for surface chemistry, and surface layer chemistry. Historically, Gordon Research Seminars and Conferences are a forum for scientists to present and discuss pre-publication results and data. The discussion serves to shape the future of the field and to provide an opportunity for scientists of all career stages and expertise to interact in formal and informal settings. Thus, the GRS/GRC provides a means to create scientific networks and to develop human resources needed to further science.</AbstractNarration>
