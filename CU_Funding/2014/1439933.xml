    <AbstractNarration>The program will provide financial support for student participants to attend the IEEE Photonics Society Summer Topical Meetings to be held in Montreal on July 14-16, 2014. The Topical Meetings provide a unique forum where members from academia, national labs, industry, and government labs working in the same field will convene in a highly interactive environment to foster active cross-disciplinary discussions. In addition, the workshop will define key strategic directions for future research in the topical areas by creating synergies between academia, industry and national laboratories, and is expected to broadly impact interdisciplinary scientific efforts. The program will also sponsor a student poster session and poster presentation awards at the conference. The Summer Topical Meetings are the premier conference series hosted by IEEE for exciting, new areas in photonic science, technology, and applications. The Meetings will also set broad directions for future research and will impact interdisciplinary scientific efforts in the five topical areas covered by the meetings. The research fields covered by the topical meetings are of considerable interest to many current programs of the ECCS division. The NSF support is expected to significantly promote student participation in the conference, and provide a unique opportunity for the students to learn about emerging fields in photonics research and to interact with leaders from both academia and industry in an intimate environment. Participation of graduate/undergraduate students, in particular those from underrepresented groups, will be fostered leveraging NSF funds to partially cover registration and travel expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics to be discussed in this year's Summer Topical Meetings span a broad range in related emerging areas of research, from materials to devices, integrated photonics, and systems. The conferences will cover five topical areas: Midwave Infrared Integrated Photonics (MWIP), Functional Meta- and Two-dimensional Materials (FMTM), Nanowire Materials and Integrated Photonics (NWIP), Nonlinear-Optical Signal Processing (NOSP), and Space-division Multiplexing technologies for high capacity transmission (SDMT). The FMTM topic will cover advances both in metamaterials, with focus on functional structures and device configurations, and in two-dimensional materials including graphene and other 2D materials, and their exciting potentials in photonics. The NWIP topic will cover nanowire related materials and devices, as well as heterogeneous integration. The MWIP topic will focus on integrated photonic technologies, optical physics, and emerging application trends of mid-IR photonics. The NOSP topic will span both traditional and emerging materials, as well as various nanophotonic platforms and advanced format and algorithms used for NOSP. The SDMT community will share the exciting advances in all areas related to SDM, from devices to system integration. These topics, proposed by experts in the respective areas and selected by the IEEE Photonics Society, represent some of the most important and intensively investigated fields as deemed by the photonics community.</AbstractNarration>
