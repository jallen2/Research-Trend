    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-1439967 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Dennis Roberson&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Illinois Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Title: Wireless Spectrum Research and Development (WSRD) Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNDERSTANDING THE SPECTRUM ENVIRONMENT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides travel support for attendees to a fifth Workshop organized under auspices of the interagency Wireless Spectrum Research and Development Senior Steering Group (WSRD SSG). The Workshop will focus on understanding the frequency spectrum environment using data and spectrum monitoring to improve spectrum utilization. It will develop research themes and proposals for R&amp;D projects that would address the challenges identified by Congress, the FCC, the NTIA, and the WSRD SSG to make spectrum monitoring and big data oriented spectrum management technologies more available to all sectors of the wireless community. The Workshop will consist of a one full day meeting on March 31, 2014 at the NSF headquarters in Arlington, VA offering a venue for over 100 participants. The Workshop seeks to bring together top industry, academic and government policy makers with expertise in the areas of spectrum monitoring, spectrum management, enforcement and related technology research and development to help inform the recommendations of the WSRD SSG. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will address the technical and policy research challenges for making significantly more spectrum available and manageable as set out in the two recent Presidential Memoranda on Spectrum. It will develop a research plan that will become a roadmap to develop research into future spectrum management and spectrum-sharing technologies that enables greater and more efficient access to spectrum. Workshop participants will start the day by hearing from key leaders about interesting projects in this area. The principle goals of the Workshop are to: (i) examine spectrum monitoring as a way to improve spectrum utilization, (ii) establish meaningful and achievable goals, and (iii) identify topics for research and standards that align with those goals. Information gathered from the Workshop will be instrumental in helping the WSRD SSG develop recommendations that will be released in a Workshop report prepared for the Office of Science and Technology Policy and made available on the NITRD website.</AbstractNarration>
