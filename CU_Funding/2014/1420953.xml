    <AbstractNarration>The ACM SIGCOMM 2014 Conference will be held August 17-22, 2014, in Chicago, Illinois. ACM SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the Association for Computing Machinery?s Special Interest Group on Data Communications. This award financially assists approximately 16 graduate students and 3 postdoctoral researchers from US institutions to attend this conference. Participation in conferences such as SIGCOMM is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and exposure to leading edge research in the field. The award will enable graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, who would be otherwise unable to do so, to attend the main SIGCOMM 2014 conference and the associated workshops. The travel grant chairs encouraged the participation of women and under-represented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This award provides travel support for US-based graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the ACM SIGCOMM 2014 conference. SIGCOMM is the flagship conference in the networking community and a highly competitive venue (with acceptance rate around 10%). Its rich program exposes participants to new ideas and cutting-edge research and allows for interaction among researchers from all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical conference in computer networks and communications. Students and junior researchers will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field. The proposed student participation is expected to have a positive impact on the students' research interests and quality. The project will promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other under-represented minorities to participate. Furthermore, the truly international flavor of SIGCOMM as an annual conference is well-known and cultivates international research interactions and presents a tremendous opportunity to students and junior researchers to increase their breadth of ideas and technical perspectives.</AbstractNarration>
