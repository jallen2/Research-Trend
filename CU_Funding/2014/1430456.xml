    <AbstractNarration>This award supports US-based participants in the Young Topologists Meeting (YTM) 2014 held at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark from Monday, June 30th to Friday, July 4th, 2014. This international meeting will bring together junior researchers in the mathematical fields of algebraic and geometric topology, and provide an opportunity for them to speak publicly about their research and to learn about recent developments by their future colleagues. Mini-courses will give broader introductions to two important subjects in the field, as seen through the eyes of more experienced researchers. The conference provides opportunities for networking, for meeting future research colleagues, and for forming research collaborations. Previous instances of the YTM have had mostly participants based at European institutions; support from this award will enhance opportunities for international collaboration by allowing more significant participation of US-based junior researchers. The diverse atmosphere at the conference and among the speakers and participants will also encourage people from underrepresented groups to pursue research careers in topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The YTM is an annual event, alternating between Copenhagen and Lausanne, Switzerland, organized mainly by graduate students and postdocs. The meeting will consist mainly of talks given by junior topologists, in addition to two mini-course lecture series given by distinguished senior researchers. The lecture series this year will be given by Jacob Lurie (Harvard University, US), who will speak about Tamagawa numbers via algebraic topology, and Lars Hesselholt (Nagoya University, Japan and University of Copenhagen, Denmark), who will speak about trace methods in algebraic K-theory.
