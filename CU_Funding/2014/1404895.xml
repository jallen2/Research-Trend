    <AbstractNarration>The Bridger Formation (~49 Ma) in southwestern Wyoming is ideally situated for examining paleobotanical and climate changes in the Eocene. While this formation has played an important role in the understanding of extinct mammals and reptiles, the abundant fossil plants have been largely overlooked, despite their potential for documenting the environment. The Bridger fossil flora provides the opportunity for unusually complete reconstruction of the original flora, because it preserves all plant organs including leaves, wood, flowers, fruits, seeds, and pollen. The fossilized plants will be examined to assess the species composition, paleoclimate, and paleoecology with a combination of botanical, paleontological, and geological approaches. These results will be compared to other Eocene floras from the greater Rocky Mountains and west coast of North America. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This work is important because the Bridger flora likely has many species that evolved and contributed to the modern vegetation of western North America. In addition, this work will document vegetational changes in response to climate shifts. Research results will be presented at upcoming conferences and published in appropriate journals in addition to engaging the greater public with a free lecture in Wyoming near the field site. A website will also be created for regular field and lab updates. Co-PI Allen will design a small, temporary exhibit showcasing the Bridger flora for display at the Florida Museum of Natural History and will continue to serve there as a volunteer interpretive guide. Allen will also mentor an undergraduate to provide him/her an opportunity to gain real research experience.</AbstractNarration>
