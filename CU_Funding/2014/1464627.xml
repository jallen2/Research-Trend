    <AbstractNarration>Center for Advanced Research in Forensic Science (CARFS)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the proposed Center is to provide a multidisciplinary forum for advancing research and innovation in forensic sciences, enhancing education in relevant scientific disciplines, and improving the interpretation and ethical communication of forensic practitioner findings. The establishment of the proposed center will address two main areas. The development of new research which will develop a better understanding of methods currently used in forensic science laboratories in terms of their reliability and accuracy. Furthermore, new ideas will be pursued to improve and develop such methods. Secondly, the partnerships with industry will help to develop solutions to address improvements required in such areas. A fundamental requirement of forensic evidence, irrespective of its type or nature, is a robust method for its interpretation. Additional research will be directed to developing new methods of interpretation. All of these areas (including specific evidence types) are noted in the NAS report on Forensic Science (2009). The impact in the judicial process will ensure that evidence is correctly weighted, and will not support a specific proposition in an unbalanced fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goals of the research are to evaluate the extent of problems encountered in certain areas and to develop solutions. The evaluation of wrongful convictions in West Virginia through hair microscopy in cold cases will allow for the analyses of the specific issues related to the cases and for the designation of more appropriate techniques of analysis. Technical evaluation of new methodologies and the interpretative nature of the evidence will be performed in projects such as the characterization and discrimination of inkjet printer inks using micro Raman spectroscopy, the unsupervised deep machine learning algorithms to predict forensic meta-information (finger position, gender, race, and age from a latent fingerprint), and the evaluation of a portable lab for body fluid identification to ensure higher precision and accuracy of results. A significant evaluation of forensic mass spectrometry (one of the most widely used analytical techniques in forensic laboratories) to develop new types of miniature, portable mass spectrometers will also be undertaken. Statistical analysis of firearm identification using IBIS will be interpreted using Bayesian networks to provide a solid basis for firearms evidence interpretation. From a social perspective and other issues rasied through the NAS report (2009), a determination of the efficacy of backlog reduction programs, assessment of the jurisdictional independence of forensic laboratories for quality assurance and cost effectiveness, and the process of attracting more women to STEM related occupations using forensic science as a model will also be undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant is jointly supported by NSF and the National Institute of Justice.</AbstractNarration>
