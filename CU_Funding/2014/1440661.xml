    <AbstractNarration>Saint Anselm College is a small, liberal arts college in Manchester, New Hampshire participating in targeted big science with partners across New Hampshire and the world. A significant challenge for small institutions is providing access to major data pathways necessary to transfer key scientific data and share major resources at the capacity demanded by today's scientific data sets. This project creates a new network instrument - a Science DMZ to enable scientific collaboration and data sharing. These campus networking activities provide other small colleges and universities a road map for connecting small institutions to larger institutions in the New England region, across the US, and around the world to support research, teaching and learning with students of all backgrounds. The project broadens opportunities for individual and interdisciplinary scientific research, as well as all research occurring at Saint Anselm College. This project is the key component in elevating research collaboration to the next level of connectivity and effectiveness for the Saint Anselm College scientific research enterprise. The implementation of a 10Gbps networking infrastructure connects Saint Anselm College with other established partner research universities in New Hampshire and around the world. The completion of a Science DMZ is expected to have an immediate and transformative impact on several representative science research areas actively in need of such support such as current research in the areas of: Lidar systems and analyses of hyperspectral data, chromosome evolution, variation in spicule network morphology in dorid nudibranchs, and chemical analyses to support archaeological field work.</AbstractNarration>
