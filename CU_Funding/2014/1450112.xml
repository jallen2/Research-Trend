    <AbstractNarration>CBET 1450112&lt;br/&gt;Martin Lopez de Bartodano&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a technical conference entitled Japan-US Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics, which will be held May 10-16, 2015 in West Lafayette, Indiana. The seminar has been held every four years since 1979 with the location alternating between Japan and the US. The seminar will bring together leading researchers to discuss their research in multiphase fluid dynamics. The seminar will consist of a series of plenary and keynote lectures and technical sessions. Participation by junior researchers, postdoctoral students, and graduate students will be encouraged and supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiphase systems consisting of gas and liquid phases or immiscible liquids pose special challenges to scientists and engineers who analyze them and design equipment to process them. Theory and simulation worked out for single phase fluids do not apply to multiphase fluid systems owing to the presence of moving, deformable interfaces between fluid phases in multiphase systems. Nevertheless, multiphase flows are important in many technological, biological, and environmental applications, including processes in the energy, chemical, and nuclear, petroleum and aerospace industries. The seminar will provide a forum for researchers to discuss theory, simulation, and experimental results that pertain specifically to two-phase systems.</AbstractNarration>
