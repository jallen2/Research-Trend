    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Felix N. Castellano for the investigation of both heterogeneous and homogeneous approaches to photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. The effort targets the photochemical preparation, characterization, and photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2) materials decorated with highly dispersed metallic platinum and palladium nanoparticles. Photocatalysis is evaluated in aqueous solutions using bandgap excitation in the presence of hole scavengers and in the analogous visible-light sensitized materials using select surface bound ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) complexes in the presence of appropriate sacrificial electron donors. Various cobalt compounds are tested for their hydrogen-producing ability in concert with "charged" TiO2 in aqueous solutions. Homogeneous photocatalysis schemes exploit reductive quenching pathways that have recently led to significant enhancements in catalytic turnovers. The use of alternative sacrificial electron donors in these homogeneous schemes has led to unprecedented catalytic turnovers while greatly expanding the inventory of potentially useful sensitizers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses interdisciplinary research that contributes to the fundamental knowledge base of converting solar light to an environmentally-friendly, non-carbon based, combustible chemical fuel. The photocatalytic systems considered in this research project offer better atom economies and the potential for much higher efficiencies than other systems. The project fosters the scientific and professional education of undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral associates and visiting scientists. Professor Castellano participates in various K-12 STEM education efforts including the Imagination Station of Toledo and the annual "High School Science Days" that take place on the Bowling Green campus.</AbstractNarration>
