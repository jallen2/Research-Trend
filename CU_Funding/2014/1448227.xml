    <AbstractNarration>A broad low intensity area in Earth's recent magnetic field spans the southern Atlantic Ocean, Africa and South America. This is commonly called the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The SAA allows a relatively close approach of Earth's radiation belts, affecting spacecraft operations. The low magnetic intensity decreases the efficiency of magnetic shielding in the region, which can influence atmospheric ozone. Many believe the SAA is linked to the dramatic decay of the dipole geomagnetic field intensity during the last 160 years, and the growth of an area of reversed magnetic field on Earth's core beneath South Africa. Some have even speculated Earth is heading toward a geomagnetic field reversal. But understanding these phenomena within the context of longer-term geomagnetic history has been limited by a lack of Southern Hemisphere archeomagnetic data (that is, data from archeological objects that were fired to high temperature and subsequently preserved a record of Earth's magnetic field as they cooled). Our research and education program is aimed at understanding the history of the geomagnetic field in the SAA region as recorded in southern Africa. The main focus of the work is the collection and subsequent analysis of archeomagnetic data from Iron Age burnt structures, and tests of models addressing how the nature of the boundary between Earth's core and mantle may be giving rise to recent changes seen in the geomagnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archeomagnetic data from Iron Age sites of southern Africa (ca. 1000-1650 AD) show a sharp intensity drop at 1300 AD, at a rate comparable to modern field changes in the present-day South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), but to lower values. The recurrence of low field values may reflect magnetic flux expulsion from the core promoted by the unusual core-mantle boundary composition and structure beneath southern Africa defined by seismology (specifically the African Large Low Velocity Seismic Province, or LLVSP). Because the African LLVSP is a longstanding structure, this region might be a steady site of flux expulsion, and perhaps the triggering site for geomagnetic reversals, on time scales of millions of years. If correct, this conceptual model is transformative because it suggests reversals do not initiate at random locations, but instead nucleate at core-mantle boundary sites that promote flux to leak upward. The model predicts modulation of the field on time scales of the lifetime of an eddy in the core flow, and will be tested by extending the archeomagnetic record of Iron Age southern Africa. The research program is integrated with undergraduate and graduate education and will be conducted with geologists and archeologists from South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. This project was co-funded by the GVF fund in the Office of International Science Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
