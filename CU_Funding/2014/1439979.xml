    <AbstractNarration>This project provides participant support for the ``Conference on mathematical and computational challenges of wave propagation and inverse problems'' that will be held in April 9-11, 2015 on the campus of Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI. The theme of the conference is "wave propagation in inverse problems". Wave propogation and inverse problems have tremendous applications in medical imaging and exploration of Earth natural resources. This conference brings together leading researchers in the world to discuss recent advances on such applications. The conference also provides ample opportunity for graduate students, post-docs, junior faculty, especially women, under-represented minorities and people with disabilities to present their work. By locating the conference central to the Michigan State University campus, participation of local, non-mathematical students and scientists will be maximized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference contributes significantly to the advancement of research and education in applied and computational mathematics. The conference focuses on three related topics. The first is the development of wave-related multi-scale, multi-physics modeling, analysis, and computation techniques. The second is the integration of inverse problem techniques with imaging analysis methods for important physical processes that arise in radar and sonar, geophysical exploration, non-destructive testing, and medical imaging. The third is the stochastic modeling and uncertainty quantification of the large scale wave propagation focusing on imaging and inversion in random media. The conference provides a forum to update recent progress on these research areas. By interspersing theoretical, applied, and computational talks in the conference program, this focused conference will encourage collaboration between scientists with various disciplinary backgrounds. By outlining the potential impact that theoretical tools can have on the most salient issues of our day, the conference will influence and invigorate the educational efforts at the institutions of the conference speakers.</AbstractNarration>
