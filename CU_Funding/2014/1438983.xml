    <AbstractNarration>The era of performance scaling by increasing the performance of&lt;br/&gt;individual processors is over, having been replaced by the era of&lt;br/&gt;massive parallelism via multiple cores. Amdahl's law tells us that&lt;br/&gt;our ability to parallelize computation is limited by the inherently&lt;br/&gt;sequential portion of a computation. This unfortunate combination&lt;br/&gt;of facts paints a bleak picture for the future of scalable software.&lt;br/&gt;This work explores a radical new approach to parallelism with the&lt;br/&gt;potential to bypass Amdahl's Law. The approach used involves making&lt;br/&gt;informed predictions about computation likely to happen in the&lt;br/&gt;future, proactively executing likely computations in parallel with&lt;br/&gt;the actual computation, and then "jumping forward in time" if the&lt;br/&gt;actual execution stumbles upon any of the predicted computations&lt;br/&gt;that have already been completed. This research touches many areas&lt;br/&gt;within Computer Science, i.e., architecture, compilers, machine learning,&lt;br/&gt;systems, and theory. Additionally, exploiting massively parallel&lt;br/&gt;computation will produce immediate returns in multiple scientific&lt;br/&gt;fields that rely on computation. The research here provides an&lt;br/&gt;approach to speedup on such real-world problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach used in this research views computational execution&lt;br/&gt;as moving a system through the enormously high dimensional space&lt;br/&gt;represented by its registers and memory of a conventional single-threaded&lt;br/&gt;processor. It uses machine learning algorithms to observe execution&lt;br/&gt;patterns to make predictions about likely future states of the&lt;br/&gt;computation. Based on these predictions, the system launches&lt;br/&gt;potentially large numbers of speculative threads to execute from&lt;br/&gt;these likely computations, while the actual computation proceeds&lt;br/&gt;serially. At strategically chosen points, the main computation&lt;br/&gt;queries the speculative executions to determine if any of the&lt;br/&gt;completed computation is useful; if it is, the main thread uses the&lt;br/&gt;speculative computation to immediately begin execution where the&lt;br/&gt;speculative computation left off, achieving a speed-up over the&lt;br/&gt;serial execution. This approach has the potential to be infinitely&lt;br/&gt;scalable: the more cores, memory, and communication bandwidth&lt;br/&gt;available, the greater the potential for performance improvement.&lt;br/&gt;The approach also scales across programs -- if the program running&lt;br/&gt;today happens upon a state encountered by a program running yesterday,&lt;br/&gt;the program can reuse yesterday's computation.</AbstractNarration>
