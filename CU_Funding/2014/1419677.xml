    <AbstractNarration>Strong storms can have devastating impacts on people living on the coasts, built infrastructure, and on marine fisheries and ecosystems that lie offshore. Super typhoon Haiyan, the largest storm ever recorded, hit the Philippines in the Fall of 2013 causing serious damage on land. Similarly, it had devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and biological communities, but the extent of these impacts because they are not readily visible due to their underwater locations are generally under documented and appreciated. This research is an NSF RAPID response to document and assess the sediment erosion and redistribution across the central Philippine Islands as a result of super storm Haiyan and its impact on sea life and marine ecosystems. Mapping of seafloor sediments and sample collection via piston coring will be undertaken to measure net changes in the accumulation and/or erosion of pre-existing carbonate and siliciclastic sediment cover from intertidal to deep water (500 meters below sea level) environments in the Central Philippine Islands. Results of the investigation will be used to examine differences in sedimentation and erosion processes between normal and extreme-event timeframes. Sediments will be collected using piston cores and photographic images will be recorded of the seafloor. Drone-enabled aerial photography of the study area will also be collected. These data will be compared with time-series data of the same locations that have been taken over the last three years by the principle investigator. Particular emphasis will be given to changes in sea grass beds, reefs, and biological communities that form the basis of Philippine fisheries and tourism. Broader impacts of the work include collaboration with Philippine and Australian scientists and hazard assessment of shallow and deep offshore marine ecosystems that can be used for economic assessment of damaging storms in Pacific Island nations.</AbstractNarration>
