    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Catherine Clewett from West Texas A&amp;M University and colleagues Gary Barbee, Erick Butler, Nick Flynn and Emery Shier (Amarillo College) will acquire a 400 MHz MHz NMR spectrometer with liquid and solid state capabilities. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at West Texas A&amp;M University and Amarillo College. An important goal is for WTAMU be the primary service region that will extend beyond the Texas borders into the neighboring states of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterizating natural organic carbon in produced water; (b) characterizing fouling and design of smart reverse osmosis membranes; (c) chemical characterization of CAFO lagoon water and electrocoagulation; (d) characterizating non-traditional lignocellulosic biomass dissolution in ionic liquids; (e) chemical characterization for agriculture and the environment, i.e., moisture, fat and protein in meat products as well as effects of manure, compost, and tillage on gaseous emissions as well as forage production and soil, water, and nutrient management; and (f) studying metabolism, toxicology, and medicine, i.e., measurement of glycine metabolism in yeast as well as environmental metabolomics and development of antiepileptogenic neuroprotective agents.</AbstractNarration>
