    <AbstractNarration>The Minority Affairs Committee (MAC) of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) will offer a workshop in 2014 to mentor early career scientists who are trained in areas supported by the NSF in the fields of biology, biophysics, biochemistry and molecular biology. The workshop will provide grant writing skills and other mentoring for ~30 new investigators and postdoctoral scholars who are under-represented minorities in STEM or work at minority-serving institution. The workshop will provide training and mentorship from successful scientists who are themselves minorities, work at minority serving institutions, or have an established record of broadening participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to broaden participation in STEM related NSF-funded high-quality, outcome-oriented research. Completion of the 2014 workshop will enable Assistant Professors and postdoctoral scientists, particularly those from populations that are underrepresented in the sciences to obtain critical feedback in the development of more competitive NSF proposals. Successfully securing extramural funding is critical to sustaining a career in academia. When coupled with the disparate number of underrepresented minority faculty who are extra-murally funded, this workshop will have a profound impact on fostering the diversification of the scientific workforce. Success will be assessed by tracking the submissions and funding outcomes of proposals to the NSF by the mentees. The assessment process will identify best practices to seed the development of a multi-year grant writing and mentoring workshop series. A web-based platform will enable dissemination of these best practices to the larger scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
