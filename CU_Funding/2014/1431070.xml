    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Geometry of Groups and Spaces" is a satellite conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians which will be held in Daejeon, Republic of Korea, from August 7-12, 2014. The conference aims to combine and develop ideas from algebra, geometry, and topology in new and interesting ways, and to search for new applications of these ideas. The connections between geometry and algebra through the study of symmetry groups of spaces are deep and venerable, going back to the seminal work of Felix Klein and Henri Poincare in the nineteenth century. The field remains active and relevant today, with dramatic advances, new techniques and broad connections to many fields of mathematics. This conference will bring together mathematicians in all career stages, with a primary goal of enabling young mathematicians to interact and collaborate with, and to learn from, senior researchers. Notes and recordings of lectures delivered will be made publicly available whenever possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is concerned with recent developments in the eponymous fields, especially within hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifold topology and geometry, Teichmueller and moduli space theory, and geometric group theory. All of these fields are intimately connected with each other and have experienced dramatic advances in recent years. Specific highlights to be discussed will include the geometry of symmetric spaces, the virtual Haken conjecture, projective structures, mapping class groups and automorphism groups of free groups, Artin groups, and hyperbolic groups.
