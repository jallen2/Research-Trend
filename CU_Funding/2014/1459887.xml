    <AbstractNarration>Copper Mountain Conference On Multigrid Methods, Copper Mountain, Colorado, March 22-27, 2015.This grant is to support participation in the 2015 Copper Mountain Conference on Multigrid Methods. The funding from this award is specifically for students, women, and scientists who are members of underrepresented groups. The Copper Mountain Conferences have graduate students forming a very large fraction of the attendees (typically 30%-40%), many of them full participants who co-author papers and give presentations. Women and minorities are growing fractions of the attendees, but further increases are desired, so this award also targets their participation. Support for the students, women, and minority scientists from this award is in the form of reduced registration fees and local and travel expenses. A hallmark of this conference is a "Student Paper Competition," which draws entries from a significant fraction of the student attendees and results in extraordinarily high-quality papers on scientific discovery from the students, working in tandem with and under the guidance of their faculty advisors. These results, like the conferences as a whole, span wide-ranging and important theoretical and applications areas, such as techniques of convergence analysis, implementation and development of mathematical software, and use of such ideas in novel settings, including advanced computer architectures and new applications such as uncertainty quantification. The aim here is to continue the increase in participation by members of these underrepresented groups so that the multigrid discipline and science in general are improved by the professional development of these talented researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Copper Mountain Conferences form arguably the premier conferences in two closely related mathematical fields: iterative and multigrid methods. These two fields provide computational support for numerical simulation of a very wide host of human endeavors, including environmental and energy research, medical and biological applications, and many other areas critical to the U.S. and international science and engineering community. This award supports the participation of students, women, and scientists who are members of underrepresented groups at the 2015 Conference. The Conferences traditionally work to ensure the future vitality of the fields of iterative and multigrid methods by facilitating development and nurturing of a community of capable graduate students and entry-level scientists. Through their egalitarian structure, with no invited speakers and all talks of equal length, the Conferences provide mechanisms for young people to meet each other and all participants in a relaxed yet scientifically rigorous setting; these mechanisms include topical tutorials, themed evening workshops, and access to the broad representation of participants from academia, national laboratories, and industry. The Conferences have a tradition of a very high level of student participation (typically 30-40% of attendees), and will cultivate this through supporting students' local and travel expenses. Emphasis is also placed on engendering diversity through support of women and minority scientists. These conferences bring together the world's leading practitioners in these critical fields and result in high-level publications, effective applications codes, and the establishment of long-term collaborative research partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
