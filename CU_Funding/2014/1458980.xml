    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) activity within the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the development of research capability at HBCUs that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. HBCU-RISE projects have a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department(s) and the institutional mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity as well as increasing the production of doctoral students in science and engineering. With support from the National Science Foundation, Delaware State University (DSU) will implement comprehensive strategies designed to expand DSU's research and educational capability in an effort to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the Applied Chemistry doctoral program and growing the diverse STEM workforce. The HBCU-RISE program at DSU will enhance the research infrastructure in Materials Chemistry, increase faculty recruitment and increase the number of Ph.D. courses offered. This project has the potential to be a model for increasing the number of minority students pursuing STEM degree programs and careers and addressing the lack of minority faculty members in the discipline of Materials Chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed project is to develop advanced nanomaterials for renewable energy applications while strengthening DSU's research and educational capability in the Department of Chemistry by: 1) focusing on catalytic nanomaterials synthesis and characterization toward energy applications; 2) providing faculty development to foster growth in material chemistry research areas; and 3) developing new courses in materials chemistry and a network of material scientists in Delaware. The HBCU-RISE program will leverage resources through partnership with other NSF-funded programs on campus, and serve as a model for successful partnership among HBCUs and thus contribute to the White House Materials Genome Initiative. The proposed project will contribute to the institutional transformation and is aligned with the institution's strategic plan and initiative of becoming a research-intensive university and increasing and sustaining excellence in research.</AbstractNarration>
