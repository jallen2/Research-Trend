    <AbstractNarration>Ghrelin and vasopressin are two critical hormones that control physiological balance, or homeostasis, in animals including humans. Ghrelin is secreted by the gut and provides a hunger signal to the brain during fasting. Vasopressin, a key regulator of fluid balance (the antidiuretic hormone), is secreted from the brain under conditions of dehydration. Feeding and drinking are tightly coordinated behaviors that are largely controlled, respectively, by circulating ghrelin and vasopressin hormone levels in the blood. Understanding how the two systems that control eating and drinking interact at the cellular level in the brain is critical for understanding how they are coupled and how the two basic behaviors are coordinated. This research will determine the brain cell mechanisms of ghrelin control of vasopressin secretion, and how ghrelin influences blood fluid levels and drinking behavior. These studies will reveal a novel interaction in the brain between the nutritional signal ghrelin and the vasopressin fluid balance system, providing a physiological basis for the coordination of feeding and drinking behaviors. The project will involve undergraduate students from a neighboring historically black university in intensive research experiences over two months during the summers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghrelin is a key regulator of energy balance and vasopressin provides the primary control of fluid balance. Ghrelin stimulates vasopressin secretion into the blood via a central excitatory effect on vasopressin neurons. The overarching hypothesis of this research effort is that ghrelin serves as a homeostatic regulatory signal in the brain that integrates energy balance with fluid balance. This study will investigate the cellular mechanisms responsible for the ghrelin stimulation of vasopressin neurons. Pilot studies suggest that, under fasting conditions, ghrelin activates a non-canonical excitatory GABAergic synaptic input to vasopressin neurons in the hypothalamus by stimulating a novel retrograde signaling cascade that recruits neighboring astrocytes via the dendritic release of vasopressin and gliotransmitter activation of presynaptic GABA neurons. The ghrelin-induced activation of astrocytes and presynaptic GABA neurons will be studied using in-vitro electrophysiological and imaging methods in brain slices from rats and wild-type and transgenic mouse models. These studies will reveal a novel interaction in the central nervous system between the nutritional signal ghrelin and the osmoregulatory control of vasopressin, and will provide a physiological substrate for the integration of energy and fluid homeostasis.</AbstractNarration>
