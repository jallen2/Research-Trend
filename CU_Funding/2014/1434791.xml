    <AbstractNarration>Sustainable infrastructure that is used and maintained by communities over time, and resilient networks that can support infrastructure construction and repair in times of crisis, are sorely needed. Unfortunately, conventional approaches in post-disaster reconstruction focus primarily on rapid and recognizable results (e.g., number of houses built), over long-term results, causing some infrastructure to deteriorate only a few years after a disaster. The inherently complex post-disaster environment places stress on this process, resulting in the rapid emergence of coordination networks and the application of vastly different reconstruction processes. If ineffective, these coordination networks and construction processes can result in deficient, unused infrastructure, an inefficient use of relief and recovery funds, and human development setbacks. Given the increasing number and impacts of disasters, this research will analyze and determine the post-disaster coordination network models and reconstruction process strategies that facilitate the development of sustainable infrastructure and resilient networks. These models and strategies will be disseminated broadly to organizations and agencies involved in these efforts. In addition, the database of results, operationalized constructs, and analysis of processes will also be disseminated widely for future expansion and validation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop a theory of post-disaster reconstruction process and coordination network pathways that enable resilient and sustainable infrastructure. Using a longitudinal, multi-method research approach that includes network and fuzzy-set qualitative analysis, the research will identify the processes that are employed and the networks formed to mobilize resources and coordinate work in various rebuilding phases, including planning, design, construction and operation and maintenance. Furthermore, it will analyze the evolution of post-disaster coordination networks, stakeholder participation and training processes over time. Finally, it will determine the necessity and sufficiency of individual processes and networks, as well as the combinations of reconstruction processes and coordination networks, that result in sustainable and resilient systems.</AbstractNarration>
