    <AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site offers research opportunities and a professional development program that includes communication skills and a new program on workplace skills to outstanding students from five Massachusetts community colleges. The students' research projects will focus on areas that are key to the competitive position of our nation: novel additive manufacturing technologies, nanomanufacturing processes, sustainable (green) materials for manufacturing, and easily-manufactured flexible electronics. This cross-disciplinary research encompasses the University's Nanomanufacturing Center's HEROES Initiative (a collaboration between the University and the Natick Soldier Research and Development Engineering Center), and the Raytheon-UMass Lowell Research Institute (a collaboration between the University and Raytheon Corporation). Through the REU Site program, the students will develop networks that allow them to: (1) obtain better research and cooperative learning positions, (2) further extend their professional networks, and (3) seriously consider graduate programs in science and engineering. These connections are critical for the advancement of lower income community college students who are less likely to have family and friends in professional positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site offers research opportunities in advanced materials and manufacturing to outstanding students from five Massachusetts community colleges. Over 10 weeks, these students will perform a research project in (1) novel additive manufacturing technologies, specifically the new materials, processes, and equipment required for improved performance and expanded applications of rapid manufacturing processes; (2) nanomanufacturing research, including roll-to-roll assembly, transfer, and imprinting (embossing) processes and applications of these and other multiscale manufacturing processes to applications such as omniphobic surfaces and metamaterials; (3) advanced materials, such as creation of sustainable (green) materials for new and existing manufacturing processes; and (4) materials, design, and manufacturing for flexible electronics. This cross-disciplinary research currently encompasses faculty from Chemical, Electrical, Mechanical, and Plastics Engineering as well as the University's Nanomanufacturing Center, HEROES Initiative, and the Raytheon-UMass Lowell Research Institute. In addition, the students will collaborate with trained graduate student mentors; participate in a professional development program that includes communication skills and a new program on workplace skills; and be provided with opportunities to present their research results at technical conferences and to access to other University and professional programs. The REU program will provide the community students with similar experiential learning and networking opportunities that are offered incoming freshmen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program is supported by the National Science Foundation's Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).</AbstractNarration>
