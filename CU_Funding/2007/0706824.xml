    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2007. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in US science. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "High-resolution analysis of cellular mechanisms mediating synapse formation in the zebrafish visual system." During nervous system development, the formation of synaptic connections between neurons is a highly dynamic process that results in the formation of neural circuits that transmit and process sensory information regarding the environment. The use of optically transparent zebrafish embryos allows direct visualization of this process in the dendrites of neurons in the optic tectum. This study combines live imaging of tectal neuron dendrites with array tomography, a novel, high-resolution immunofluorescence imaging technique to analyze subcellular protein redistributions associated with synapse stabilization in an intact nervous system. The sponsoring scientist is Stephen J. Smith at Stanford University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training goals are to use zebrafish as a model organism for studying neuronal development in an intact organism, which fully complements the Fellow's expertise in optical imaging techniques in cell culture.</AbstractNarration>
