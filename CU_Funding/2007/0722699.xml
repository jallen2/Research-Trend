    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This NSR-MRI proposal submitted jointly by Boise State University and Northwest Nazarene University in Idaho is to acquire a multi-user x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) unit for shared use by researchers and students at both universities. XPS is a highly sensitive tool that can identify different elements present in a sample and determine their concentrations. Some of the research projects that will significantly benefit from the availability of XPS include efforts to produce magnetic behavior in semiconductors such as silicon, development of new materials to solve biological and biomedical research problems, relative movement of atoms inside a material when subjected to high temperatures, toxic and flammable gas detection, corrosion of surfaces, coating toxic materials with benign molecules, and magnetic materials. The proposed research activities of more than 16 faculty members, 15 postdoctoral fellows/scientists, 32 graduate students, and 80 undergraduate students from physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, electrical engineering, and geosciences will directly benefit from the availability of the XPS system. Being a widely used characterization technique in industry, XPS training will prepare students for industry positions. Availability of the XPS system will support the research activities of the graduate students in the recently started PhD programs in geosciences and electrical engineering, as well as new PhD programs being developed in the areas of materials science and biomolecular sciences at Boise State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This NSR-MRI proposal submitted jointly by Boise State University and Northwest Nazarene University in Idaho is to acquire a multi-user x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) unit for shared use by researchers and students at both universities. XPS is a highly sensitive elemental analysis tool along with capabilities to determine the oxidation states of the elements, chemical bonding, and diffusion of atoms and ions. Some of the crucial research projects that would benefit from the availability of XPS include development of ferromagnetism in semiconductors for spintronics applications, interfacial reactions during oxidation and corrosion, novel magnetic gas sensing, studies of polymer-biomolecule interface, nanosensors, antibacterial agents and nanomedicinal applications using nanoparticles, biomolecular nanowire-based sensors, dye-sensitized solar cells and polymer-based chemical sensors.
