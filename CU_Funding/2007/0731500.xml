    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Nelson has demonstrated a commitment to linking research at a competitive national level with excellence in teaching and mentoring at all levels. She has had a major impact on the STEM careers of many underrepresented students through her direct mentoring and work with minority undergraduate research training programs such as NSF's Research Improvements in Minority Institutions and the NIH Minority Access to Research Careers Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She has also initiated and developed a solid, consistently funded research program in the area of sexual development and genomics of filamentous fungi. This research is conducted with the assistance of undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are underrepresented minority students. She is held in high esteem as one of the "pillars" of the fungal genetics community. She currently serves on the editorial boards of three journals and was the co-editor of Fungal Genomics from 2003-2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Nelson has worked with 40 undergraduate students in her laboratory since 1992, including large numbers of minority students. She has also mentored seven Ph.D. students. Of these, two are Hispanic women and one is an American Indian woman. Her current goal is to develop a multidisciplinary research careers speakers program, thus encouraging more students to enter STEM fields and to complete graduate programs. She seeks to develop a set of seminar activities that revolve around interdisciplinary topics and presentations by outside speakers, including underrepresented minority speakers. Participating students will be encouraged to apply for summer research internships and other opportunities. Dr. Nelson has published 31 peer reviewed papers, nine of which are co-authored with underrepresented students from her group.</AbstractNarration>
