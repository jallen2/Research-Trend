    <AbstractNarration>0735721&lt;br/&gt;Ekkad &lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for a delegation of US thermal scientists and engineers to participate in six research workshops planned around the biannual ASME/ISHMT Heat and Mass Transfer Conference, which will be held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, January 3-5, 2008. This conference is the premier venue for disseminating research findings for India's thermal sciences and engineering community. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers co-sponsors this event to enhance interactions between Indian and US thermal sciences researchers. The interactive workshops in six topical areas are designed promote discussion about the next-generation of thermal challenges and seed corresponding Indo-US research collaborations in those areas of mutual interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US delegation includes 13 senior scientists, 4 postdoctoral researchers, and 9 graduate students. The workshops, which target fundamental areas in heat and mass transfer, are expected to enhance US-India cooperation on future thermal technologies, share information and build institutional bridges, and promote educational and cross-cultural experiences for all participants. US delegates include women and members from under-represented groups who are early-career faculty, graduate students, or senior researchers. The report on the workshops and conference will be disseminated through a website so that heat transfer researchers worldwide will be able to access this information. In U.S., the results of the India conference and workshops will be reported to a larger audience at the next major Heat Transfer Conference held in the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;Funding for this workshop is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.</AbstractNarration>
