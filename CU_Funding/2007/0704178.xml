    <AbstractNarration>Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award will support neutron scattering studies of cobalt/cobalt oxide and iron/iron oxide nanoparticles. The nanoparticles will be synthesized using solution chemistry methods that allow for sensitive control of particle size, separation, and composition. After structural and magnetization characterization, the particles will be investigated using high resolution small angle neutron scattering, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering methods. The work will yield values for the length scales of interparticle interactions, will probe coupling interactions and spin structures, and will explore magnetic excitations. In these ways, the work will yield quantitative information on the structure and dynamics of nanoparticle systems, information that is difficult to obtain through other methods and that is critical for comparison to computational and analytical models. A broader impact of this research centers on its use of advanced neutron scattering techniques which will be of interest to others, particularly as a result of new and upgraded neutron scattering facility projects in this country. In addition, this award will support research at an undergraduate institution and as such, will lead to the training of undergraduate students in these important methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical:&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic nanoparticles are of great interest for computer data storage, biomedical sensors, and other devices. This individual investigator award will support the study of these materials using neutron scattering techniques. The nanoparticles will be synthesized using solution chemistry methods that allow for sensitive control of particle size, separation, and composition. After structural and magnetization characterization, the particles will be investigated using a variety of neutron scattering methods.
