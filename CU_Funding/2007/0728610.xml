    <AbstractNarration>This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures and programs. Women and students from underrepresented groups are being especially targeted for support. Students are being targeted for participation in the scholarship program that are enrolled in either an undergraduate marine engineering concentration or a graduate program in marine engineering. The need for professionals who have expertise in marine engineering is a key to US competitiveness in the maritime industry and few institutions in the nation offer training in this area. This project is meeting the national need for marine engineers through three related objectives including enhanced outreach to high schools, improved student retention, and opportunities for professional growth for students enrolled in the marine engineering programs such as industry internships or research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
