    <AbstractNarration>Bruno&lt;br/&gt;0707564&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator seeks development and analysis of accurate,&lt;br/&gt;rapidly convergent, high performance solvers for the types of&lt;br/&gt;challenging partial differential equations that arise in&lt;br/&gt;present-day materials science applications, as well as use of&lt;br/&gt;such solvers for design of concrete devices and prediction of&lt;br/&gt;properties of realistic systems. He creates algorithms to treat&lt;br/&gt;certain types of problems related to potential theory and wave&lt;br/&gt;propagation, composite materials and optical devices, elasticity,&lt;br/&gt;acoustics, and electromagnetism. Significant difficulties arise&lt;br/&gt;in these classical fields of numerical analysis and computational&lt;br/&gt;science in the context of the materials science problems&lt;br/&gt;considered, which require treatment of microstructures,&lt;br/&gt;non-coercive systems, geometric singularities, resonant&lt;br/&gt;structures, high frequencies, multiple scattering, etc. These&lt;br/&gt;are mathematical problems that, in spite of significant efforts&lt;br/&gt;and progress over the last century, remain elusive in a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of important instances. The combination of a number of&lt;br/&gt;such challenges often arises in the treatment of materials&lt;br/&gt;science configurations, which has made materials problems&lt;br/&gt;difficult to tackle. In particular, most algorithms available&lt;br/&gt;for the types of materials science applications considered in the&lt;br/&gt;project lack in either accuracy, computational efficiency, or&lt;br/&gt;both -- a circumstance that has hindered progress in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops effective, high-performance&lt;br/&gt;computational methods for solving partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;that model the properties and behaviors of various physical&lt;br/&gt;systems, emphasizing features important for materials. The&lt;br/&gt;project has consequences for several areas of societal interest,&lt;br/&gt;including the medical field (tomography, imaging), electrical&lt;br/&gt;engineering (optics, electronics), military and civilian remote&lt;br/&gt;sensing (radar, sonar, stealth), communications (antennas),&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric science, etc. The project also provides training for&lt;br/&gt;students at both graduate and undergraduate levels, as well as&lt;br/&gt;for postdoctoral associates.</AbstractNarration>
