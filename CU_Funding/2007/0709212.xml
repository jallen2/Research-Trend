    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on modeling synchronization and coherent behavior in realistic networks with complex structure. As an emerging field, the study of synchronization in complex networks has so far not seen sufficiently strong connections between theory and the actual behavior of real systems. The first objective of the proposed research is the empirical analysis of collective dynamics in complex systems in the technological, social, and biological domains. This will be achieved by developing methods for data analysis of the dynamics of three types of systems: power grids, human communities, and biochemical reaction systems. The second objective is to extend the current theoretical framework for analyzing the synchronized and coherent dynamics in such systems. The final objective is to combine the empirical observations and the theoretical development in the modeling of these complex systems as networks of simple dynamical units. This approach will be used to investigate how the collective dynamics is influenced by the underlying network structure and the properties of the individual dynamical units. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of synchronization in power grids is important to assess and reduce the influence of voltage phenomena in triggering large blackouts. The study of coherent dynamics in human communities is relevant to help build more efficient strategies for the allocation of services and resources and for the assessment and management of risks. The study of synchronization in biochemical reaction systems is important to advance our understanding of large biochemical networks in living organisms. The planned research activities are interdisciplinary and will involve the training of undergraduate students, including students from under-represented minorities, and one graduate student. Outreach activities are also planned in the form of individual research advising and public lectures at a local high school, allowing our research results to be presented to a large and diverse public.</AbstractNarration>
