    <AbstractNarration>This Materials World Network project builds up on already established successful interaction between the research laboratories of Prof. Pulickel M. Ajayan (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; RPI) and Prof. Mauricio Terrones (Instituto Potosino de Investigacin Cientfica y Tecnolgica; IPICyT, Mexico) and aims towards the fabrication of new materials and devices using nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (CNx) and other hybrid structures based on nanotubes. In addition to CNx material, the investigators explore the synthesis of novel nanotubes doped with other elements, for example, phosphorous. The research focuses on the fabrication of new products and prototypes such as sensors and polymer composites using CNx nanotubes and other doped nanotubes. During the previous three years of this project, the researchers demonstrated that the presence of nitrogen within CNx nanotubes plays an important role in the dispersion of CNx nanotubes, prior to mixing with polymers. In addition, results showed that the nitrogen containing surfaces are also easy to functionalize chemically. This research addresses the composite fabrication and additionally, will examine CNx nantubes as gas sensors. At IPICyT, there has been progress that allows production of bulk quantities of CNx nanotubes. At RPI the focus is on the fabrication and characterization of composite materials with CNx nanotubes. In addition, this work explores techniques to assemble CNx nanotubes and produce nanotube networks and junctions. Also, the work examines new structures of nanotubes with dopants such as phosphorous and explores the unique structural and electrical properties of these materials.&lt;br/&gt;During the next three years of continuation of this project, the researchers utilize the momentum generated by the successful earlier collaboration to increase student and personnel exchanges and the use of bilateral facilities in nanofabrication to achieve further results in carbon nanotube research. Students from the two countries have the opportunity to merge interdisciplinary expertise and participate in research at the cutting edge of materials science and nanotechnology. Mexican students and young scientists visit the US laboratory to engage in nanofabrication, development of sensors and polymer composites, and learn about the working environment in US laboratories in general. Similarly, undergraduates and graduate students from the US visit IPICyT and collaborate with Mexican scientists. The education efforts of the investigators include curriculum development activities in addition to lectures and seminars.</AbstractNarration>
