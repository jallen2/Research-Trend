    <AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Jeffrey H. Cohen, graduate student Lexine M. Trask will under take research on how single minority women on welfare perceive and negotiate institutional and social barriers as they strive to achieve economic self-sufficiency in the post-welfare reform era. Specifically, she will investigate the mechanisms by which previously identified barriers (such as., childcare, employment, welfare agencies) continue or do not continue to affect the economic self-reliance of low-income urban single-mothers and the specific micro-processes of everyday life by which this happens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will employ a mix-methods social science approach. She will undertake both fine-grained ethnographic participant observation and will carry out systematic unstructured and semi-structured interviews with a sample of women on welfare. She will elicit data on: household budgets, childcare obligations, educational and employment history, experience with welfare service providers, material hardship, and perceived obstacles and solutions to overcoming poverty. She also will interview personnel from NGOs and government agencies to acquire additional data on the availability of services in the community and how service providers themselves see the barriers that to low-income single-mothers' economic self-reliance. In addition, she will also employ cognitive techniques (free listing and spatial mappings).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important because it will contribute to social science scholarship on the hard-to-see processes that underlie the persistance of poverty in marginalzied populations. The research also will contribute to developing better public policy by increasing understanding of how low-income minority single-mothers perceive, experience, and cope with barriers to their economic self-reliance and how their perceptions do or do not correspond to the perceptions of those who work for agencies that are trying to help them. The research will provide a new, evidentiary basis for a renewed discourse on the effectiveness of welfare reform policies and programs in lifting disadvantaged and underserved populations out of poverty. Finally, the research will contribute to the education of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>
