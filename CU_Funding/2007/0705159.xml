    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0705159&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Nitya Kitchloo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal emphasizes three concrete projects. The aim in the&lt;br/&gt;first project is to give a topological interpretation to the&lt;br/&gt;class of highest weight representations of infinite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;Kac-Moody groups. The PI plans to construct a variant of equivariant&lt;br/&gt;K-theory on the category of spaces that admit a proper action of&lt;br/&gt;a Kac-Moody group. In particular, one hopes to relate the class of&lt;br/&gt;highest weight representations with elements in this&lt;br/&gt;K-theory. This project will generalize recent work of&lt;br/&gt;Freed-Hopkins-Teleman. The authors cited gave a topological&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of the positive energy representations of Loop&lt;br/&gt;groups. This is a special case of an affine Kac-Moody group. &lt;br/&gt;This research program will study more general Kac-Moody groups.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the next project is to understand the topology of the&lt;br/&gt;space of compatible complex structures on a symplectic&lt;br/&gt;4-manifold. This builds on an earlier joint project of mine where&lt;br/&gt;we showed that for rational ruled surfaces with arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;symplectic forms, the space of compatible complex structures is&lt;br/&gt;weakly contractible. In that project, we use a comparison&lt;br/&gt;technique that relates the space of complex structures with the&lt;br/&gt;space of almost complex structures, and decompose the latter&lt;br/&gt;using the theory of J-holomorphic curves. In the proposed&lt;br/&gt;project, we will attempt to apply our techniques to other&lt;br/&gt;4-dimensional symplectic manifolds. As a by product of our&lt;br/&gt;techniques, we hope to derive consequences about the group of&lt;br/&gt;symplectomorphisms of 4-dimensional manifolds. In the final&lt;br/&gt;project, we study a new cohomology theory called real&lt;br/&gt;Johnson-Wilson theory, and develop computational tools to make it&lt;br/&gt;accessible. Real Johnson-Wilson theory is constructed by taking&lt;br/&gt;fixed points with respect to an involution on standard&lt;br/&gt;Johnson-Wilson theory. These are 2-local theories indexed over&lt;br/&gt;the integers, with the first theory being 2-localized real&lt;br/&gt;K-theory. We plan to use our tools, along with techniques in&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic Topology, to settle various old questions regarding&lt;br/&gt;immersions of real projective spaces in euclidean&lt;br/&gt;space. Previously, the best know results used the theory TMF&lt;br/&gt;(Topological Modular forms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general focus of my projects is to explore the interaction&lt;br/&gt;between geometry and topology. The objects of study in geometry&lt;br/&gt;are fundamental physical objects (in possibly more than three&lt;br/&gt;dimensions), that are endowed with various structure. The&lt;br/&gt;structure one associates to these spaces could be as crude as the&lt;br/&gt;homotopy type (the information about the space that is preserved&lt;br/&gt;under all continuous deformations), or one may be interested in&lt;br/&gt;more subtle structure like the differential structure (the local&lt;br/&gt;information about the space that makes it smooth). One may refine&lt;br/&gt;the smooth structure even further and study symplectic, or&lt;br/&gt;complex structure. These questions are motivated by fundamental&lt;br/&gt;inquiries into our physical universe. Indeed, mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physics is a rich source of questions and ideas. Given a&lt;br/&gt;particular structure of interest, one may ask the question of how&lt;br/&gt;to enumerate them. In other words, one is interested in ways to&lt;br/&gt;parametrize all possible structures on a space. For example, John&lt;br/&gt;Milnor was the first person to really show that spheres admit&lt;br/&gt;multiple non-equivalent smooth structures, starting with the&lt;br/&gt;7-dimensional sphere which admits 28 such structures. One of my&lt;br/&gt;projects is to study the question that inquires into the number&lt;br/&gt;of complex structures in 4-dimensional smooth spaces. The&lt;br/&gt;techniques that one uses to understand the space of complex&lt;br/&gt;structures is to decompose it into pieces that have some&lt;br/&gt;significance in terms of their symmetry. Then one studies these&lt;br/&gt;pieces using the invariants of topology and then reassembles&lt;br/&gt;these pieces to get a coherent picture on the global level. The&lt;br/&gt;question of symmetry is also important in other projects that I&lt;br/&gt;propose. For example, the linear symmetries of a vector space&lt;br/&gt;(like euclidean space), which preserve some property, are known&lt;br/&gt;as representations. Another project aims to study a class of such&lt;br/&gt;representations that act on infinite dimensional vector&lt;br/&gt;spaces. We will try to encode these objects via a topological&lt;br/&gt;invariant known as equivariant K-theory. Such invariants are&lt;br/&gt;generally known as cohomology theories and form natural&lt;br/&gt;receptacles for algebraic information derived from geometry. In a&lt;br/&gt;third and final project, the PI plans to develop such a&lt;br/&gt;cohomology theory, called real Johnson-Wilson theory. We hope to&lt;br/&gt;justify its importance by showing that it helps to solve an old&lt;br/&gt;geometric question about the minimum dimension of euclidean space&lt;br/&gt;where a certain class of spaces, known as real projective spaces,&lt;br/&gt;may be realized.</AbstractNarration>
