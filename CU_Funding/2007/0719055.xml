    <AbstractNarration>Theory and Inference for Macroeconomic Policy&lt;br/&gt;NSF SES 0719055&lt;br/&gt;Christopher A. Sims, Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research advances knowledge in four areas related to the use of quantitative models to guide macroeconomic policy. One component is study of the foundations of statistical inference for models with large numbers of parameters. The models in use at central banks and other macroeconomic policy institutions often involve hundreds of parameters whose values have to be determined from the data, yet much of the existing literature on inference in models of economic time series focuses on methods that apply only when the number of parameters is small. Some statisticians have argued that when there are large numbers of parameters, the Bayesian inferential methods that underlie standard decision theory perform poorly. While this assertion has been rebutted in the context of some specific models, this project's research develops a more general treatment of the issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now for the first time becoming feasible to construct models of the scale needed in monetary policy analysis at central banks that are both statistically reliable and equipped with a detailed interpretation, in terms of economic behavior, of the equations that constitute the model. There remain several competing approaches, however, varying especially in the relative weight put on statistical reliability versus economic behavioral stories about the equations. The second component of this project advances a particular approach to this type of modeling. In attempting to tell behavioral stories, while at the same time preserving statistical reliability, much of the existing work in this area has ended up with behavioral models that include frictions and "costs of adjustments" that are necessary to match the data, but not fully convincing as behavioral stories. This project treats the behavioral model not as itself a description of the data, but instead as a source of approximate, probabilistic predictions about the behavior of a reliable statistical model, particularly in the long run. Specifically, the project develops methods to use a fully interpreted equilibrium model to generate a prior distribution for the parameters of a structural vector auto-regression (SVAR). The equilibrium model is a restricted version of the SVAR, and the restrictions are relaxed probabilistically, especially at high frequencies where we think the behavioral model does not allow for realistically complex frictions and inertias. This approach may make it unnecessary to rely on arbitrary-seeming adjustment costs in the behavioral model, with no sacrifice in statistical reliability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If we recognize that economic agents can process information at only a finite rate, many of the inertial and random aspects of behavior emerge as optimal, given information constraints. This project extends previous research, which has developed this insight formally only for simple, single-actor models, to more realistic models of market interaction. In a way this third part of the project complements the second, as it seeks to provide a more firmly micro-founded theory for the dynamics of behavioral models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fourth component of the project concerns the relation between government debt and deficits and control of inflation. So long as markets are confident that deficits will be cut if debt grows large and increased if it grows very small, the usual interest-rate-setting tools of monetary policy can control the price level without reference to fiscal variables. But in many countries markets realistically do not have this confidence, which results in complex interactions between monetary and fiscal policy. These interactions are studied empirically in this project. The results could be relevant to US policy as the fiscal pressures of from an aging population increase.</AbstractNarration>
