    <AbstractNarration>This international travel grant will support the attendance and participation of approximately six graduate students and four young scientists in the field of antarctic atmospheric science in the Second Antarctic Meteorological Observation, Modeling, and Forecasting (AMOMF) Workshop in Rome, Italy, June 26-28, 2007, and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) Meeting in Perugia, Italy, July 2-13, 2007. &lt;br/&gt;The First Antarctic Meteorological Observation, Modeling, and Forecasting Workshop was held in Boulder, Colorado, in 2006. That workshop represented the integration of prior joint meetings between the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) Users and the Antarctic Automatic Weather Station (AWS) annual meetings. &lt;br/&gt;The 2nd Antarctic Meteorological Observation, Modeling, and Forecasting Workshop is taking place in Europe to acknowledge the strong interest in, and contributions to AMPS and to antarctic meteorology by European scientists in general and Italian atmospheric scientists in particular. In addition, the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics meeting has scheduled a number of symposia of interest to Antarctic meteorologists, including High Latitude Modes of Climate Variability, Ice Cores and Climate, Consequences of Large Scale Circulation Variability on Snow and Ice Extent, and Variability of the Antarctic Circulation and Water Masses and Their Sensitivity to Climate Change.</AbstractNarration>
