    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project proposes to develop high capacity / high rate nanostructured electrodes and combine them with environmentally benign ionic liquid electrolytes to develop advanced lithium-ion nanobatteries. The proposed work will combine the unique properties of high capacity and high rate capability of nanostructured electrodes with the superior safety-related properties of ionic liquids electrolytes to meet the demands of high energy / power densities, inherently safe operation, and long cycle life for advanced lithium-ion batteries. This research will produce nanostructured electrodes and mate these electrodes with ionic liquid electrolytes to establish the synergism of combining these components to develop batteries with performance and safety exceeding those of the currently available lithium-ion batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lithium-ion batteries represent the current state-of-the-art for rechargeable batteries. However, performance (energy / power densities, safety, and cycle life) of the current lithium-ion batteries is limited by the properties of both electrodes and electrolytes. Improvements in these materials are needed to develop batteries to satisfy the rapidly increasing performance demands for a wide range of applications including consumer electronics, medical electronics, transportation technology, and military/defense. In&lt;br/&gt;addition to lithium-ion batteries, nanoelectrodes and safe electrolytes in the proposed project will also have a broad impact on the applications to other electronic and electrochemical devices.</AbstractNarration>
