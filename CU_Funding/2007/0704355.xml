    <AbstractNarration>For the three weeks, July 22, 2007 through August 10, 2007, The PIs Matusevich and Sottile together with Theobald of the Universitat Frankfurt will organize the 2007 Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) Participating Institutions Summer Graduate Program on the topic ``Applicable Algebraic Geometry''.&lt;br/&gt;The IMA will send up to two students from each of the&lt;br/&gt;37 IMA participating institutions to this Summer Graduate Program.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal in intended to allow greater participation in this Summer Graduate Program, which will enable more students to take advantage of this opportunity to.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will support the attendance of approximately 13 additional graduate students, mostly from institutions not affiliated with the IMA, but also some students from IMA affiliates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will be structured around a course in applicable algebraic geometry, treating foundational material and current applications.&lt;br/&gt;The foundations will include Grobner bases, toric varieties, and real algebraic geometry, while the applications will be drawn from optimization, non-linear computational geometry, algebraic statistics, and mathematical biology.&lt;br/&gt;We will emphasize computational aspects by including computer tutorials and laboratories on relevant software. We will also have guest lectures explaining current research topics.&lt;br/&gt;This multi-tiered menu, ranging form introductory material through current research, will ensure that every student gains something from their experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening the paraticipation in this Summer School will magnify its impact, and help to educate the next generation of US Scientists.&lt;br/&gt;It will influence the spread of techniques from algebraic geometry into the applied sciences.</AbstractNarration>
