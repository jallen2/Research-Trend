    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-0742121&lt;br/&gt;Richard Linke, IEEE LEOS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project seeks financial support for student participations in Photonics in Switching Conference (PS2007), to be held in San Francisco on August 19-22, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This conference covers innovative research in photonic switching technologies, systems, and networking including nanophotonics, slow-light, wavelength conversion, silicon photonics, photonic buffers, optical routers, optical cross-connects, rapidly reconfigurable networks, optical packet switching networks, optical network control and management, optical label switching networks, and high-performance data server and computing networks. In particular, we will emphasize integrated approaches, and hold a symposium on photonic buffers and next generation optical systems and networks to highlight key nanophotonic technologies and their potentials in future optical systems and networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: (1) A comprehensive approach covering photonic device, system, and networking technologies will provide rich opportunities for graduate students to learn leading edge issues in photonics in switching in a nurturing environment; (2) Cross fertilization of ideas from many scientists around the globe and from industry, academia, and government agencies providing a rich environment for students to learn and for the faculty to create forward-looking curricula in multidisciplinary graduate and undergraduate level programs; (3) strong participation from minority and under-represented groups will be promoted through the proposed support of the conference; (4) new ideas and framework can be developed into operational networks and systems; (5) advanced networking testbed discussions will allow students and researchers to help them 'feel' what Future Photonic Internet may look like; (6) this project will stimulate new standardization activities in the networking community; (8) Progress of this work will lead to finding many new research issues, resulting in better understanding and new opportunities to overcome the challenges of the Future Photonic Internet.</AbstractNarration>
