    <AbstractNarration>This Communicating Research to Public Audiences project is based on current NSF-funded research, BCS-0342661, a study that is modeling the demographic collapse that occurred in the Hohokam region of southern Arizona between A.D. 1300 and 1450. The Center for Desert Archaeology in Tucson, AZ is partnering with the Pueblo Grande Museum (PGM), operated by the City of Phoenix, and the Huhugam Heritage Center (HHC), operated by the Gila River Indian Community in Chandler, AZ. The primary deliverable of the 24-month project is the development of a 700 sq. ft. traveling exhibit that provides visitors with experiences related to how archaeologists research questions such as, how to date pre-historic populations, how to estimate the numbers of people in these populations, how to determine their migration patterns, and how to model the decline of their numbers and "coalescence." The exhibit is based CDA's research philosophy of practicing "preservation archaeology" that uses methods that avoid or limit the disturbance of exiting archaeological sites. The exhibit, being designed and fabricated by PGM staff, incorporates some of the latest innovations in computer animation and GIS that help scientists approach these questions. CDA will create a special section of its website devoted to the research and exhibit, along with an exhibit guide and a special issue of its Archaeology Southwest magazine. The project is positioned also as a vehicle for stimulating continued conversations between archaeologists and Native American peoples.</AbstractNarration>
