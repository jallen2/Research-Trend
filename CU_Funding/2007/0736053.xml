    <AbstractNarration>Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;Visualization and spatial thinking are fundamental skills across the STEM fields. Digital outcrop models (DOMs) created with emerging technologies such as ground-based lidar (light detection and ranging) laser scanning are the basis of a major new advance in the geosciences, but we currently lack a full understanding of how such resources can be used as learning aids to support visualization and spatial thinking. This project is addressing this knowledge gap by studying the effectiveness of advanced visual aids in earth science education. Three-dimensional, interactive DOMs are being used to create several learning modules. An existing DOM of the Eocene Green River Formation in Utah is being used for the initial phase of research, and is complemented by additional lidar scanning to take advantage of recent critical advances in this technology. The learning exercises are being implemented in introductory level geology classes, and their utility is being measured by tracking student progress in visualizing geologic relations and improved conceptual understanding. A model for interdisciplinary collaboration is being established. The learning modules, with supplementary documentation for faculty users, are available in a standard freeware format via the internet (e.g., the National Science Digital Library). Assessment results are being disseminated and shared within the STEM, visualization, and geoscience education communities through publications and a topical session at a major national meeting. It is predicted that successful integration of uniquely interactive, photo-realistic DOMs with more traditional field methods and teaching approaches can improve the learning experience for large and diverse student groups in a range of classroom settings.</AbstractNarration>
