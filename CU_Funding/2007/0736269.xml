    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0505059&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Sean T. Paul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to relate the stability of a complex&lt;br/&gt;projective variety to intrinsic geometric analysis on the&lt;br/&gt;variety. Often, the PI is concerned with the small time&lt;br/&gt;asymptotics of complicated rational energy integrals over the&lt;br/&gt;variety under study. This idea was initiated by the PI in his&lt;br/&gt;dissertation. The energies arise in connection with the problem&lt;br/&gt;of establishing the 0th order apriori estimate for solutions to&lt;br/&gt;the Monge Ampere equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, there are two ways to mathematically approach,&lt;br/&gt;or model, a given problem: continuously, or&lt;br/&gt;discretely. Traditionally, these are quite seperate&lt;br/&gt;approaches. Analysis (differential equations in particular) is&lt;br/&gt;the time honoured subject in the continuous domain, combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;(the study of enumerating a finite amount of data) is the&lt;br/&gt;hallmark of the discrete approach. In this proposal these two&lt;br/&gt;methods come together-the PI will explore the question of how the&lt;br/&gt;solution to an equation from analysis might be obtained by a&lt;br/&gt;purely finite (but large) collection of data. The equation&lt;br/&gt;appeared in Einsteins' theory of Gravitation, whereas the finite&lt;br/&gt;set of data arose in the mathematics of the 1800's, and is&lt;br/&gt;related to the theory of computer vision.</AbstractNarration>
