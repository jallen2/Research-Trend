    <AbstractNarration>Mitchener proposes to study stochastic processes and dynamical systems that model language learning and change, supported by statistical&lt;br/&gt;analysis of manuscript and corpus data. The proposed models are&lt;br/&gt;designed to account for variability in speech in ways that most&lt;br/&gt;existing models do not. Some of the proposed models are&lt;br/&gt;deterministic, and represent the distribution of speech patterns in a&lt;br/&gt;population as probability density functions governed by&lt;br/&gt;Banach-space-valued differential equations. Other proposed models are&lt;br/&gt;stochastic, based on discrete Markov chains and stochastic&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. The Markov chain models are the most&lt;br/&gt;detailed, including simulated learning algorithms based on Bayesian&lt;br/&gt;statistics. The PI plans to develop perfect sampling algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;determine the mixing behavior of these Markov chains, which should&lt;br/&gt;give some insight into linguistic questions of how typical the set of&lt;br/&gt;existing human languages is with respect to the set of all possible&lt;br/&gt;human languages. The stochastic differential equation models&lt;br/&gt;represent the simplification of the Markov chain simulations to an&lt;br/&gt;infinite population and continuous time. For all of these models, the&lt;br/&gt;PI plans to run computer simulations and prove theorems about their&lt;br/&gt;behavior using tools from dynamical systems theory, functional&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and probability. The research will first address the simple&lt;br/&gt;case of unstructured, well mixed populations, then add social&lt;br/&gt;structure, and then delay dynamics as a model of literacy. The PI&lt;br/&gt;plans to find hypotheses under which the delay dynamics give rise to&lt;br/&gt;well posed problems. The PI is collaborating with linguist Misha&lt;br/&gt;Becker at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop&lt;br/&gt;realistic models of human language learning and to test these models&lt;br/&gt;against linguistic data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mitchener proposes to study mathematical models of language learning&lt;br/&gt;and change. Most existing models assume an idealized form of speech.&lt;br/&gt;For example, each person might have just one way of stating a given&lt;br/&gt;meaning. In contrast, true speech is variable. The same person can&lt;br/&gt;convey the same meaning by using a variety of word orders, for&lt;br/&gt;example: John gave Fred a book. John gave a book to Fred. Fred was&lt;br/&gt;given a book by John. As an improvement upon models that assume&lt;br/&gt;idealized speech, the proposed models account for language variability&lt;br/&gt;in two ways. Some of them represent each speaker's utterances with a&lt;br/&gt;list of random choices among the alternatives. The others are not&lt;br/&gt;explicitly random, but instead keep track of how often a speaker&lt;br/&gt;prefers the possible options for expressing a meaning. In a model&lt;br/&gt;with idealized speech, learning takes place when a speaker chooses one&lt;br/&gt;alternative from a list. Under a variable speech model, learning is&lt;br/&gt;much more complicated because each speaker must learn which of many</AbstractNarration>
