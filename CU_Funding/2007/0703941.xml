    <AbstractNarration>The goals of this project are (1) to better understand secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation by investigating partitioning and heterogeneous chemistry in SOA, and (2) to develop a model for predicting SOA formation that includes gas phase kinetics, partitioning, and the effects of heterogeneous chemistry in acidic SOA. Experiments will be carried out in chambers and the gas phase species and products will be analyzed with a wide variety of chemical and physical techniques. Data will be obtained on SOA formation from various precursor gases, including effects of relative humidity, temperature, and aerosol seed composition. An initial model of heterogeneous SOA formation will be developed for medium and strongly acidic aerosols; it will then be extrapolated to weakly acidic or neutral conditions, which more realistically reflect the conditions of ambient air. &lt;br/&gt; This project will lead to insights into sources of global SOA that are not explained by conventional partitioning theory. Undergraduates and graduate students will participate in this project and learn about experimental techniques and modeling. This training will help them establish a strong foundation for successful careers in atmospheric environmental chemistry. The project will also support the research efforts of a team of scientists with diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
