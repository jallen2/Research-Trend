    <AbstractNarration>Canada College, a Hispanic Serving Institution in the San Mateo County Community College District, is implementing a comprehensive project designed to increase the recruitment, retention, and success of students in chemistry classes and encourage the pursuit of chemistry careers. Canada College is collaborating with Gene Connection: Chem Connection (GCC), a teacher professional development organization that provides training and in-class support for inquiry-based science education. Deliverables include the creation of a new Associate in Science Degree in Physical Science-Chemical Technology and a Chemistry Laboratory Technician Certificate Program, in addition to an enhanced chemistry curriculum that incorporates computer animation and molecular modeling units, laboratory experiences with analytical instrumentation, and professional development for high school and college faculty. College faculty and high school teachers work in teams to develop, test, and implement curricula on molecular modeling, computer animation, NMR Mosaic, and instrumentation concepts. The curriculum development teams are also responsible for providing professional development for college faculty in the San Mateo County Community College District as well as high school teachers and college faculty from neighboring counties. Local high school teachers may participate in a variety of summer and academic year workshops, while high school students are invited to enroll in community college courses for credit as well as a summer short course on spectroscopy. It is anticipated this project will reach 9,000 students in the San Francisco Bay area and increase the number of underrepresented students experiencing success in undergraduate and graduate chemistry education programs and related careers.</AbstractNarration>
