    <AbstractNarration>Digestive fermentation occurs at locations in the gut colonized by microbes, such as the cow's rumen (foregut fermenter) or the colon of horses (hindgut fermenter) and most other mammals, including humans. In these organs, indigenous microbes ferment carbohydrates and play a role in the animal's nutrition and immunity. Foregut fermentation has been considered to be exclusive to mammals, but it also occurs in the hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin), a South American leaf-eating bird that evolved microbial fermentation in the crop. The proposed research aims to examine how the hoatzin crop is colonized and how the bacterial community changes as the chicks develop into adults. In this novel system, we will test classic ecological theories of community succession, using molecular techniques such as DNA cloning and fingerprinting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the hoatzin's crop as a model of fermentative digestion, this research will contribute new knowledge on the functional significance of microbes in digestive organs, provide a reference for comparisons with other systems, and expand the world of known microbes with the expected discovery of new bacterial groups. Broader impacts include improving research and education in microbial ecology at the University of Puerto Rico, by training undergraduate students, disseminating scientific knowledge, and developing collaborative opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
