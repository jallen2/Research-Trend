    <AbstractNarration>0729727&lt;br/&gt;Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quadrupole Resonance (QR) is a radio frequency (RF) technique offering an unequivocal way of detecting the presence of quadrupolar nuclei, such as the nitrogen isotope 14N, prevalent in many forms of high explosives such as TNT and RDX. QR is similar to magnetic resonance imaging techniques used in medicine and offers a highly specific method of detecting and identifying explosives. Because QR does not use ionizing radiation or strong magnetic fields, it is safe and reliable to use and transport. For unshielded QR systems, however, radio frequency interference&lt;br/&gt;(RFI) suppression and system sensitivity improvement are critical. Unshielded QR systems are still immature and require further development to become truly practical and reliable for explosive detection. The University of Florida (UF), in collaboration with Karlstad University of Sweden, King's College London of UK, and GE Security, proposes a 3-year interdisciplinary research plan aimed at addressing the underlying sensor system technical issues associated with current limitations of unshielded QR systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research seeks to advance fundamental knowledge in new technologies for sensors and sensor networks, and in the use of sensor data in control and decision making, particularly in relation to the prediction and detection of explosives and related threats", while advancing engineering knowledge in multiple fields. We fully anticipate that the successful implementation of this project will significantly advance the capability of unshielded QR systems for explosive detection. The results of this study will provide new opportunities in a wide range of multidisciplinary studies ranging from QR sensors to robust adaptive array processing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of education plan is to prepare students for engineering in the 21st century through the incorporation of interdisciplinary design and problem-solving techniques into both the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. The industrial collaborations will facilitate the technology transfer from academia to industry. Central to both our graduate and undergraduate educational activities is recruitment and mentoring of female students and students from traditionally underrepresented groups as research assistants. Educational outreach to non-traditional and underprivileged non-UF students across the state of Florida will be achieved by offering the related signal processing courses state-wide via the UF Electronic Delivery of Graduate Engineering (EDGE).</AbstractNarration>
