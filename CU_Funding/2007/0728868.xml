    <AbstractNarration>This is a proposal for funding in support of the 2007 edition of the Clemson Mini-Conference on Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms (which would be its 22nd consecutive year). The 2007 edition will have a mini-focus on the Mathematical and Combinatorial Theory of Communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This day-and-a-half long conference is held every year at Clemson University, Clemson South Carolina, on a Thursday and Friday, usually during the first two weeks of October. The Mini-Conference invites about a dozen speakers to give 40-minute talks on their current research. The speakers are chosen between the fields of Discrete Mathematics (including combinatorics, graph theory, operations research, coding theory, cryptography and discrete optimization), and algorithmic Computer Science (including computation theory, computational complexity and algorithms). This year the conference is tentatively scheduled for October 11-12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit. The mini-Conference has hosted many of the major names in the field. Because of its relatively central location in the Southeast, it attracts students and faculty from several states, who would not otherwise be able to attend larger more costly conferences. Due to its established traditions, its low cost (in time and money) and its informality,&lt;br/&gt;the mini-Conference permits a greater degree of interaction with the speakers than at large conferences. In addition, the conference strives for a demographically diverse group of speakers. For example, at the 18th mini-Conference, three of the 11 speakers were women, one a person with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities. We also ensure that there is at least one ""young"" speaker, to provide exposure to new talent. For example, at the 19th mini-Conference we showcased a pair of REU students.</AbstractNarration>
