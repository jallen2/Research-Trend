    <AbstractNarration>Recently,considerable progress has been made in the study of string theories.&lt;br/&gt;It has been realized that superstring theory has a web of duality symmetries relating&lt;br/&gt;nonperturbative effects to perturbative ones. The picture emerging is that there exists a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental theory, M-theory, that perturbatively, looks like string theory, but&lt;br/&gt;nonperturbatively has a very rich structure which includes symmetries relating&lt;br/&gt;perturbative excitations to solitons. Another recent development&lt;br/&gt;has been Maldacena's conjectured equivalence between string theory on anti-de Sitter&lt;br/&gt;spaces and gauge field theories living on the boundary of these spaces. This ADS/CFT&lt;br/&gt;equivalence gave more importance to the study of gravitational anti-de Sitter&lt;br/&gt;configurations as they provide a tool to the study of quantum gauge field theories&lt;br/&gt;important for particle physics. The main focus of this proposal is: a) to find&lt;br/&gt;a complete classification of supersymmetric gravitational backgrounds in various&lt;br/&gt;spacetime dimensions and to understand better the ADS/CFT correspondence and the&lt;br/&gt;intricate relation between geometry and supersymmetry. b) to develop our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the nonperturbative theory underlying string theory, and incorporate&lt;br/&gt;the new developments in the study of the phenomenological implications of string theory&lt;br/&gt;to gravitational physics, particle physics and cosmology. The broader implications of&lt;br/&gt;this proposal are that it will lead to collaboration between string theorists and differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Also the work will take place at the Center for Advanced mathematical&lt;br/&gt;Science at the University of Beirut which will become a Major Center for collaborations&lt;br/&gt;among scientists in the Middle East.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Diary Note&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0703017 PI Name:Sabra, Wafic&lt;br/&gt;Printed from eJacket: 02/28/07 Page 1 of 1</AbstractNarration>
