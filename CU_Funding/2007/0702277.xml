    <AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prop ID: DMS-0505265 &lt;br/&gt;Prev Awd: 0104290 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Salter, Laura &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of New Mexico &lt;br/&gt;Title: Gene Tree-Species Tree Relationships Under the Coalescent Process &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, incongruence in gene trees and species trees is&lt;br/&gt;examined using data from multiple genes in the context of the&lt;br/&gt;coalescent process. First, the investigator will show&lt;br/&gt;that one currently advocated approach for the analysis of data&lt;br/&gt;from multiple genes, the concatenation approach, can be&lt;br/&gt;statistically inconsistent, even when a consistent method of&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic tree estimation is used. Second, an algorithm for&lt;br/&gt;maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of species trees from data on&lt;br/&gt;multiple genes under the coalescent model will be developed and&lt;br/&gt;implemented, and will be made freely available via the internet.&lt;br/&gt;The availability of a method for ML species tree estimation will&lt;br/&gt;allow for likelihood-based hypothesis testing of phylogeographic&lt;br/&gt;and population genetic hypotheses. Further, methods for assessing&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty in the species tree estimates will be developed by&lt;br/&gt;extending traditional bootstrapping methods in phylogenetics to&lt;br/&gt;the case in which data have been collected for multiple genes&lt;br/&gt;sampled randomly throughout the genome. Finally, tests for the&lt;br/&gt;adequacy of the coalescent model will be developed by examining&lt;br/&gt;whether the observed gene trees are consistent with a given&lt;br/&gt;species tree using several metrics to measure levels of&lt;br/&gt;incongruence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inference of the evolutionary history of a collection of organisms &lt;br/&gt;based on the information contained in their DNA sequences is a problem&lt;br/&gt;of fundamental importance in evolutionary biology. The abundance of DNA &lt;br/&gt;sequence data arising from genome sequencing projects has led to &lt;br/&gt;significant challenges in the inference of these phylogenetic &lt;br/&gt;relationships. Among these challenges is the inference of the evolutionary &lt;br/&gt;history of a collection of species based on DNA sequence information&lt;br/&gt;from several distinct genes sampled throughout the genome. This project &lt;br/&gt;studies the effect of the coalescent process on the inference of species &lt;br/&gt;phylogenies using data from multiple genes. This work will first &lt;br/&gt;demonstrate that failure to model the coalescent process can lead to &lt;br/&gt;incorrect inferences of species relationships. The investigator will then &lt;br/&gt;develop methods that can accurately estimate species phylogenies through &lt;br/&gt;explicitly modeling the coalescent process, and will apply these &lt;br/&gt;estimation procedures to construct techniques for hypothesis testing and &lt;br/&gt;for measuring uncertainty in estimated species phylogenies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--</AbstractNarration>
