    <AbstractNarration>In this project, Dr. Wolniac will study mechanisms that control spermatozoid (male gamete) maturation in the water fern, Marsilea vestita. Spermiogenesis in Marsilea is activated by placing dry spores into water, and involves a series of rapid cell division cycles in precise planes within the spore to produce 32 spermatids and 7 sterile cells. He is interested in how these two distinctly different kinds of cells can arise from the same progenitor cell. Within the spermatids, differentiation involves the formation of basal bodies in the absence of preexisting centrioles, and then, nuclear remodeling, cell reshaping, the formation of an elaborate cytoskeleton, and finally ciliogenesis, all to produce a multiciliated, spirally-shaped gamete. None of these events occurs in the sterile cells. The entire developmental process takes place in the absence of new transcription; instead, the gametes are formed with proteins that were already present in the spore, or translated from mRNAs that had been transcribed prior to spore desiccation Thus, this male gametophyte of Marsilea provides a unique opportunity to study multiple aspects of cellular differentiation in populations of synchronously developing cells, where the cells are permeable to the entry of macromolecules at the time the spores are placed into water.&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Wolniak's group has developed complementary protocols that enable the study the roles of specific proteins in basal body formation, nuclear remodeling and ciliogenesis. They found that the spores can be treated with double stranded RNAs, for the silencing of specific mRNAs in the gametophytes. This RNAi strategy was used to identify when specific components are utilized during gamete formation. Efforts in technique development have been extended beyond RNAi so that the transient translation of mRNAs introduced into the gametophyte can be induced, in experiments that mimic the overexpression of specific genes. The experimental portion of this project comprises three aims. Dr. Wolniak will continue to characterize the Marsilea cDNA library, and will use newly sequenced cDNAs in ongoing RNAi experiments to assess the involvement of specific mRNAs (and the proteins they encode) in gamete formation. Focus will be on how centrin and gamma-tubulin function in the process of de novo basal body formation. Finally, the studies on Mago nashi (Mv-mago), which is part of the exon junction complex, will be expanded to gain insights on how the exon junction complex affects the underlying patterns of cellular organization that permit basal body formation and nuclear remodeling to occur in the spermatids and not in the adjacent sterile jacket cells.&lt;br/&gt;- Broader Impacts of the Project -&lt;br/&gt;During the last 25 years, Dr. Wolniak's laboratory research group has consisted of various mixes of undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and visiting scholars, who have worked together on different, but overlapping problems that enable them to collaborate without feeling as though they are in direct competition with each other. Seven graduate students have received Ph.D. degrees from work done in the Wolniak lab. The Ph.D. students are encouraged to start out on problems that have been defined by Dr. Wolniak or by others, and then to chart out a new path with new questions for their own dissertations.</AbstractNarration>
