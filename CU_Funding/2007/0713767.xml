    <AbstractNarration>The PI, together with his collaborators and students, will develop new &lt;br/&gt;models and numerical algorithms for the solution of a number of &lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems in image processing and computer vision. The &lt;br/&gt;models will be based on the calculus of variations and partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations (PDE) that describe curve and surface &lt;br/&gt;evolutions. A main goal of the project will be to devise new models &lt;br/&gt;that incorporate prior shape information into existing variational &lt;br/&gt;image segmentation techniques such as the Mumford-Shah model and its &lt;br/&gt;variants. The new models will be designed to find in given images &lt;br/&gt;objects resembling a specified shape regardless of the objects' &lt;br/&gt;location and orientation in the image. In addition, they will have &lt;br/&gt;convenient numerical implementations using techniques that have already &lt;br/&gt;proven their utility in related vision applications, such as the level &lt;br/&gt;set method. A second area of research will be to develop novel, &lt;br/&gt;efficient numerical algorithms for the solution of PDE that arise in a &lt;br/&gt;number of computer vision models and in other fields such as material &lt;br/&gt;science. Specifically, the investigator will explore new computational &lt;br/&gt;techniques for the solution of high order PDE that describe geometric &lt;br/&gt;motion of interfaces, such as the Willmore flow and motion by surface &lt;br/&gt;diffusion. These evolutions are computationally very expensive using &lt;br/&gt;current techniques. The new approach will be to reduce the computation &lt;br/&gt;of these motions to alternating simple operations for which efficient &lt;br/&gt;algorithms are already available. Also in this vein, the project will &lt;br/&gt;develop new numerical algorithms inspired by models and techniques in &lt;br/&gt;image processing for the computation of energy driven dynamics of &lt;br/&gt;multiple phases and junctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Image segmentation is a fundamental procedure of computer vision. It is &lt;br/&gt;a necessary preliminary step whenever useful information is to be &lt;br/&gt;extracted from digital images automatically. Its goal is to identify &lt;br/&gt;parts of the image that belong to distinct objects, often without &lt;br/&gt;knowing what objects might be present in the image. In many practical &lt;br/&gt;applications, however, a specific object of known shape is sought in &lt;br/&gt;the images. For example, in aerial imagery, the object of interest &lt;br/&gt;might be a certain vehicle that has a distinctive outline. Or, in a &lt;br/&gt;medical application, it might be desired to identify automatically the &lt;br/&gt;individual vertebrae in x-ray images of the spine. It such settings, it &lt;br/&gt;would help the success rate of the segmentation procedure if the &lt;br/&gt;algorithms could be made aware of what is being sought. This project &lt;br/&gt;will develop models and numerical techniques that incorporate prior &lt;br/&gt;shape information about objects of interest into the segmentation &lt;br/&gt;process, thereby leading to better segmentation methods.</AbstractNarration>
