    <AbstractNarration>Engineering-Engineering Technology (58) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is establishing an instructional laboratory for visualization and manipulation of nanoscale components. Visualization and manipulation of nanoscale components in the field of nanotechnology has many applications including bottom-up nanomanufacturing and the manipulation of DNA and viruses, prototyping of single electron transistors, and characterization and monitoring of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and semiconductors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project includes the development of instructional materials for both two and four year engineering technology programs at both SUNYIT and MVCC. The lab facilitates instruction by providing tools to develop learning materials and hands-on experimental facilities for student and faculty use. The PIs are engaging in professional development to develop techniques for use in the facility. After the completion of the lab and development of initial instructional material, the PIs are training and assisting other faculty for further applications. The lab is providing hands-on experience in existing and newly introduced nanotechnology and semiconductor manufacturing technology courses at SUNYIT and MVCC, which both offer practice-oriented Technology Accreditation Commission Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (TAC/ABET) programs.</AbstractNarration>
