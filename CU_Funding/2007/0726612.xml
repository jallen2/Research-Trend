    <AbstractNarration>Researchers have documented the ubiquity of local ecological knowledge and its benefits in societies without access to modern agricultural technologies or medicine. Researchers have also documented the world-wide disappearance of local ecological knowledge. If local ecological knowledge provides so many benefits, why would it disappear? To answer the question we propose to conduct a study among the Soliga, a tribal group in southwest India. Soliga still depend on local ecological knowledge for their survival. We hypothesize that parents who through their live have benefited more from local ecological knowledge will invest more resources in teaching local ecological knowledge to their children, whereas parents who have benefited more from schooling, will invest less in local ecological knowledge and promote school attendance. The research will develop and test hypotheses about the transmission of culture using local ecological knowledge as a case study and conduct a quantitative analysis of the paths through which the Soliga transmit local knowledge. The research also will provide hands-on training and mentoring research experience for a Ph.D. student in cultural anthropology.</AbstractNarration>
