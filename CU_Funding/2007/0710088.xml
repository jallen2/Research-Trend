    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: CBET-0710088 &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Keblinsky, Pawel &lt;br/&gt;Affiliation: Engineering Conferences International &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Nanofluids: Fundamentals and Applications Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests support for the organization of an ECI conference titled Nanofluids: Fundamentals and Applications. The conference is expected to be attended by internationally known experts and decision makers from industry, government, and academia to discuss issues related to nanofluids. This topic overlaps the program interests between PMP (particulate and Multiphase Processes) and TTP (Thermal Transport Processes) and thus is recommended for joint funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ECI conference is on the timely topic of Nanofluids (colloid suspension of nanoscale particles and fibers). The aim of this conference is to bring together, for the first time, scientists and engineers from around the world, who have diverse disciplines (chemistry, physics, materials science &amp; engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, nuclear engineering, and others) and are working on nanofluids and related areas. The potential for increasing thermal conductivity of commercial fluids (water, oil) by tens of percent at very low particle volume fraction led to excitement and an exponential increase of publications on nanofluids over the past few years. Fluids with such improved thermal transport properties can have a major impact on applications involving management of very high heat fluxes, which are recognized as critical in future development of high-performance electronic devices. There are numerous contradictory reports, however, in nearly all aspects of nanofluids. This focused international conference is an ideal forum to disseminate recent findings, debate controversies and discuss collaborations. The conference will cover all aspects of nanofluids and will last four days. The first three days will consist of tutorial, keynote, and invited talks, followed by shorter presentations on current research topics germane to the session topic. The fourth day will be an industrial forum with keynote and invited talks as well as shorter presentations relating to applications and industrial perspectives. There will also be an evening poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The nanofluids conference will allow the researchers of various areas of nanofluids to disseminate their most recent findings, debate controversies, discuss collaborations, define the frontier of nanofluids research, raise the profile of the communities, and attract industrial involvement so that the technology can be taken up to the application level. Participants will submit manuscripts for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The financial support requested from the NSF is primarily targeted to support participation in the conference of young, US-based researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral researchers), thus enabling them to participate in this exciting meeting.</AbstractNarration>
