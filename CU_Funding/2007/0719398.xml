    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports Professor Martin Bakker and his research group at the University of Alabama to develop new monolithic conductive materials for electromodulated chromatography applications. The Bakker group will develop a number of methods that use surfactants and polymers as templates into which metals are electrodeposited to give high surface area meso- and micro-porous metal phases on macroporous metal scaffolds. One goal of this research is to understand the various chemical and mass transport factors that dictate the growth of deposited metal structures at a number of length scales (nanometer to micrometer); this understanding will facilitate the maximization of surface area as well as optimization of nano- and micro-scale topography for different applications. Characterization of these materials will be done at the University of Alabama, and also the micro-X-ray fluorescence facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The second goal of this research is to evaluate these porous metal materials as electrode/stationary phases in electromodulated liquid chromatography. In electromodulated chromatography, separation of solutes is strongly influenced by the voltage applied to the stationary phase. The materials prepared in this program will be incorporated into columns and evaluated for separations performance as well as chemical and physical stability. The potential for electromodulated size exclusion chromatography will also be explored, with particular focus on the interplay of solute analyte size and geometry, and the nano- and micro-structure of the porous metal stationary phase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The templating methods and porous electrodes that will be developed in this work will have applicability beyond separations science, in areas ranging from supercapacitors and advanced batteries to environmental remediation. The project will support both graduate and undergraduate students who will receive a well rounded research experience in chemistry and materials science.</AbstractNarration>
