    <AbstractNarration>Morphology patterns that appear in complex materials are&lt;br/&gt;intimately related to their physical properties. Examples include&lt;br/&gt;lamellar, cylindrical, and spherical patterns in block copolymers,&lt;br/&gt;neutral and charged Langmuir monolayers, and smectic liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystal films. The investigator and his collaborators analyze and&lt;br/&gt;predict morphology patterns based on mathematical models derived&lt;br/&gt;from first principles of statistical physics. They develop&lt;br/&gt;techniques to deal with nonlocal constitutive relations, singular&lt;br/&gt;perturbations, and critical eigenvalues. These mathematical&lt;br/&gt;phenomena are proved to be the reasons behind self-organization&lt;br/&gt;and pattern formation. The investigator finds effective reduction&lt;br/&gt;methods that accurately simplify the original infinite-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;problems to manageable finite-dimensional ones. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;also studies the dynamic phenomenon of pattern nucleation in&lt;br/&gt;materials by finding and characterizing some unstable solutions to&lt;br/&gt;the Euler-Lagrange equations of the free energy. The project&lt;br/&gt;expands our knowledge of singularly perturbed variational&lt;br/&gt;problems. It enhances classical theories such as Gamma&lt;br/&gt;convergence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Complex materials, such as block copolymers, are used&lt;br/&gt;everywhere. The polyurethane foams used in upholstery and bedding&lt;br/&gt;are composed of multi-block copolymers known as thermoplastic&lt;br/&gt;elastomers that combine high temperature resilience and low&lt;br/&gt;temperature flexibility. Common box tapes use triblock copolymers&lt;br/&gt;to achieve pressure-sensitive adhesion. Block copolymers are&lt;br/&gt;blended with asphalt in road construction to reduce pavement&lt;br/&gt;cracking and rutting at low and high temperature extremes. This&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to deepen our understanding of the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theories underlying these systems. It produces effective methods&lt;br/&gt;that characterize and predict the mechanical, optical, electrical,&lt;br/&gt;ionic, barrier, and other physical properties of these materials. &lt;br/&gt;They help today's synthetic chemistry technologies to produce&lt;br/&gt;exquisitely structured materials to meet an ever rising demand&lt;br/&gt;from civil infrastructure and manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
