    <AbstractNarration>Professor Edward P. Zovinka, Department of Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physical Science, Saint Francis University is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to study models for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) in Nitrosomonas europea (Ne), an autotrophic soil bacteria that oxidizes nitrogenous materials in order to make energy. HAO contains a unique tyrosine-porphyrin connection that has been speculated to play an important role in the enzyme''s activity. To better understand the chemistry of the active site, undergraduate researchers synthesize and study model compounds containing meso-(hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin ligands as analogs for the porphyrin-tyrosine moiety. The porphyrin ligands are coordinated to biologically significant iron and the reactivities of the compounds with hydroxylamine are studied. The group utilizes Green Chemistry principles in the synthesis of the ligands. This includes the use of microwave methods to improve reaction yields and decrease reaction times. Scientific ethics are stressed to all participating undergraduate researchers through literature discussions.</AbstractNarration>
