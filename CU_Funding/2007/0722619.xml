    <AbstractNarration>Abstract - MRI: Acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Etch System&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is the acquisition of a modern Inductively Coupled Plasma etching&lt;br/&gt;tool with submicron dimension control. Multiple research projects at the University of Cincinnati&lt;br/&gt;require a submicron etch capability, in areas ranging from photonic device and biosensor&lt;br/&gt;fabrication to etching for basic physics research. The approach is to combine the etch capability&lt;br/&gt;of the ICP etcher with the recently acquired and fully functioning Raith 150 e-beam lithography&lt;br/&gt;tool, to enable expanded research efforts in micro- and nanofluidics, sensors and devices.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. This equipment acquisition will contribute to meeting the University of&lt;br/&gt;Cincinnati's research and educational goals. Central goals of the University strategic plan are to&lt;br/&gt;grow our research excellence by developing research and discovery, and to place Students at the&lt;br/&gt;Center ?and thus enhance the university's ability to attract the highest-quality students. The&lt;br/&gt;requested etch system will expand the research capabilities for a wide range of faculty and&lt;br/&gt;literally scores of graduate students in their thesis and dissertation research, and would expose&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates and summer program students to state-of-the-art fabrication techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. Acquisition of the Inductively Coupled Plasma etcher will enhance&lt;br/&gt;educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. It will have a direct and&lt;br/&gt;strong impact on the development and training of our nation's future scientists and engineers in&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale science and engineering, a critical segment of the nation's workforce. Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students are exposed to the nanoscale science through a series of structured laboratory&lt;br/&gt;experiments integrated with an existing NSF Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education&lt;br/&gt;program. Significant collaborative efforts currently exist between the University of Cincinnati,&lt;br/&gt;Xavier University (an undergraduate institution), Miami University, and the University of&lt;br/&gt;Dayton.</AbstractNarration>
