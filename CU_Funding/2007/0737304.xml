    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) This project uses the case study teaching method traditionally used effectively in medicine, business and law into the relatively new information assurance (IA) area to enhance IA education. This approach improves student learning by integrating classroom experiences with real world applications; trains students to be IA professionals with key skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, communication and teamwork; prepares students to be life long learners; attracts students to IA career and increases student retention in IA studies. The primary goal of this project is developing new case study course materials and methods to support the wide adoption of the case study teaching approach in undergraduate IA education and to enhance IA education nationwide. The course materials and case teaching methods that are developed can be utilized in a variety of disciplines such as computer science, software engineering, information technology, and information management systems. Twelve case studies in four selected areas (network security, security management, web security, and application security) are developed. Different methods in which cases can be effectively used in the classroom are explored. These case studies are used in various courses and their impact on student learning is assessed. Two workshops are offered, which train faculty members to use these materials.</AbstractNarration>
