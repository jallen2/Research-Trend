    <AbstractNarration>OISE 0728242&lt;br/&gt;Allen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Swedish program for International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) links partners from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Florida State University with Swedish counterparts from Lulea University of Technology and the Institute of Composites, in Pitea (SICOMP). The U.S. team, led by Prof. David H. Allen, in Lincoln, and Prof. Namas Chandra, in Tallahassee, brings expertise in modeling and mechanical performance of composites to a three-year collaborative program with Swedish engineers who have complementing strengths in materials structural characterization and natural fiber composites. They are Prof. Janis Varna, in Lulea, and Dr. Anders Holmberg at SICOMP. All share the goal of contributing to the field of advanced composite materials engineering while providing graduate and undergraduate students with experience that will help them engage successfully in international research in academia or industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While in Sweden as IRES participants, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students will gain exposure to the full cycle in design, analysis, testing, manufacture, deployment and disposal of advanced composites. They will participate in mentored research that involves examination of advanced composites, reinforced polymer matrices, and nanofibers from natural materials. Overall, the collaborative efforts of the lead U.S. and Swedish partners and their students are expected to contribute to our understanding of processes associated with reinforced polymer matrices. If successful, research results may lead to improved mechanical performance in composite materials that are based on renewable resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary IRES in engineering and composite materials fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Broader impacts include early career introduction of U.S. graduate and undergraduate students to leading engineers in the international research community who are involved in the design of composites as well as innovative processing and manufacturing methods.</AbstractNarration>
