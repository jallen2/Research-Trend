    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) This collaborative project innovates and invigorates traditional embedded systems courses by creatively infusing modern concepts. This project improves embedded system competencies of students by: (1) defining a curriculum that reflects the state-of-the-art in embedded operating systems such as wireless devices and open source initiatives; (2) defining a set of hands-on experiments that engage students and relate to their everyday life; (3) illustrating the unique interplay of hardware and software on which embedded operating systems rely; (4) encouraging students to engage in life-long exploration and learning by discussing the history of sustained growth and the viability of embedded operating systems; and (5) providing strategies for educators to effectively adapt and incorporate learning materials generated by the proposed work and to share their knowledge through a community portal. These objectives are accomplished by building an all-inclusive package of learning materials, from curriculum to lab environment. The project revises and enhances educational materials and teaching strategies, based on prior experiences of the investigators. This unique collaboration culminates in the creation of learning materials that address the needs of diverse audiences. This solid curriculum supported by effective and engaging hands-on laboratory experiments for embedded systems prepares our workforce for a world full of embedded systems.</AbstractNarration>
