    <AbstractNarration>This SGER project aims at developing novel methodologies for designing information dissemination and discovery routing protocols to support transaction management in large heterogeneous mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), incorporating probabilistic reliability, performance and trust-aware guarantees into its formulation. While mobile ad-hoc networks promise to change the distributed systems communication paradigm and the ways people access and manipulate information, as well as develop applications, the design of such protocols remains a major challenge for MANETs. As their topology changes dynamically, the reliability of links is significantly lower than for fixed infrastructures, resource distribution is asymmetric, the organizational structure is adhoc, and hardware devices and software components are heterogeneous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this project is very high as the results will enable successful deployment of the next generation of MANETs and the design of highly scalable management systems. These systems will support a wide spectrum of applications ranging from homeland security, emergency and crisis management, disaster recovery, military battlefield coordination, transportation, as well as complex social applications, such as distributed gaming and the management of distributed learning services. This project funds Ph.D students to pursue research in the areas of distributed data management and MANETs. Publications, technical reports, software and experimental data from this research will be disseminated via the project web site (http://multimedia.ece.euic.edu/IDD/).</AbstractNarration>
