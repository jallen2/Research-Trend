    <AbstractNarration>CBET 0733389&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Intelligent Modeling to Improve Storm Water Management&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wayne C. Huber&lt;br/&gt;Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds to broaden the participation of scientists and engineers in a workshop/engineering conference on the storm-water modeling with an emphasis on urban environments. The workshop will be held at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California in July 2007, and it will include leading researchers from around the world in the field of storm-water modeling, as well as early career faculty and graduate students. Urban storm water is widely recognized as a principal cause of water-quality impairment in the United States. Many computer models have been developed and are in use to simulate the routing of storm water through urban drainage systems and to model its effects on the quality of receiving water bodies. However, many uncertainties exist concerning the limitations and advantages of the various models. Consequently, it is difficult for both researchers and water quality managers to make intelligent selections of appropriate models for specific applications. This workshop will (i) evaluate the current state of knowledge concerning these models; (ii) evaluate their advantages and disadvantages; and (iii) develop recommendations for research to develop improved models that take advantage of new capabilities in cyber-informatics. On-line publication of papers presented at the workshop is planned, and a summary of the workshop results will be published in a peer-evaluate journal.</AbstractNarration>
