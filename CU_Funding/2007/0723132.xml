    <AbstractNarration>This development project includes the design and construction of a unique receiver that will digitize radar signals coming from eight channels on the phased array antenna at the National Weather Radar Testbed (NWRT). At the current time, a single-channel digital receiver is operational to mimic current operational weather radar capability. The new multi-channel capability will foster a new generation of adaptive/fast scanning techniques and cross-beam wind estimates. This will improve weather warnings as well as contribute to improved numerical weather prediction. The phased array radar with this multichannel receiver will be suited for multi-mission capabilities, such as aircraft tracking, storm tracking, and precipitation monitoring, all done simultaneously with a high degree of fidelity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The multi-channel receiver suite will collect signals from the sum, azimuth-difference, elevation-difference, and six broad-beamed auxiliary channels. One of the major advantages of the NWRT is the capability to adaptively scan weather phenomena at higher temporal resolution than is possible by current mechanically-steered weather radars (1 min or less vs. 4 min, respectively) without compromising data accuracy. The multi-channel receiver will allow direct implementation of interferometry techniques to measure cross-beam wind, wind shear, and turbulence, within a radar resolution volume. Access to the auxiliary channels will enable clutter mitigation and advanced array processing for higher quality data. The differential signals will greatly add to the radar's ability to pinpoint aircraft locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Potential benefits include better understanding of storm dynamics and initiation, better detection of small-scale phenomena including tornados and microbursts, increased lead time for severe weather warnings, and improved numerical weather prediction. Losses of life and property due to severe weather will be reduced through warnings made further in advance. Researchers across the nation will have access to this digital data to study advanced signal processing techniques, new retrieval methods, and applications in improving weather forecasts. Assembly and test of the instrument will be accomplished in the new Radar Innovation Laboratory (RIL) at the University of Oklahoma (OU) prior to integration into the NWRT. The National Severe Storms Laboratory will take an active role in the design and integration of this instrument into the NWRT. A diverse group of students will be encouraged to share in the excitement of state-of-the-art hardware and scientific discovery. This will be accomplished by leveraging already successful programs at OU, such as a unique research and teaching-oriented program called SPARC (Signal Processing and Radar Computations). This initiative is devoted to minority and women students. The NWRT is a multi-member national partnership between the University of Oklahoma and NOAA/National Weather Service, FAA, Lockheed-Martin, Office of Naval Research, and BCI Inc. Through the NWRT, this community of engineers and scholars is dedicated towards advancing the science of a multi-mission radar system for the detection of severe weather and aircraft identification. They also share in the goal to decentralize the NWRT by making next-generation data available via the web and digital libraries.</AbstractNarration>
