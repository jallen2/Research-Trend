    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: MetFoam 2007 is the 5th International Conference on Porous Metals and Metallic Foams and will take place on September 2007 in Montreal (Canada). The focus of the meeting is to discuss latest developments in metallic foams. Topics include metfoam production, manufacturing, and fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships, with an eye towards applications. Topics such as synthesis of cellular metals, characterization, structure-property relationships, etc. will be discussed. The requested budget will be used entirely to provide partial financial support for university students attending or presenting their research at Metfoam 2007. Travel grants, up to about US $500, will be used to partially defray participation costs. NON-TECHNICAL: Organizers will give special considerations to women and minorities in giving support, with the goal of having half the recipient female or minority. Organizers expect to significantly boost, through these grants, student participation to this conference. Approximately 150 conference submissions are expected at the conference, with a total of 200-300 participants. An industrial exhibition will highlight their applications. In addition to the requested NSF support, conference sponsors include ten companies, Aluminum Research &amp; Development Centre of Quebec, The Canadian Metallurgical Society, Fraunhofer Institute, The Government of Quebec, and the City of Montreal. NSF fund availability will be announced to students by email.</AbstractNarration>
