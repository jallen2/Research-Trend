    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0706945&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kevin J. Costello&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces play a central role in many&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, including geometric&lt;br/&gt;and algebraic topology, symplectic topology, string theory, and&lt;br/&gt;number theory. This project explores another manifestation of&lt;br/&gt;the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, which is maybe not so&lt;br/&gt;widely known. This is their appearance in homological algebra,&lt;br/&gt;and more precisely in the study of cyclic A-infinity algebras (a&lt;br/&gt;kind of "Frobenius algebra up to homotopy"). The philosophy&lt;br/&gt;underlying much of this project is that everything one can say&lt;br/&gt;about the homotopy types of the various moduli spaces can be&lt;br/&gt;expressed in terms of the homotopy theory of cyclic A-infinity&lt;br/&gt;algebras. One precise manifestation of this philosophy (which&lt;br/&gt;will be proved in this project) is that the moduli space of&lt;br/&gt;surfaces arises as certain "homology operations" for cyclic&lt;br/&gt;A-infinity algebras. This theoretical result will be used to&lt;br/&gt;investigate some concrete higher-genus aspects of the mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry conjecture, which plays a prominent role in current work&lt;br/&gt;on algebraic and symplectic geometry. In particular, this&lt;br/&gt;project will attempt to compute the conjectural mirror partner of&lt;br/&gt;the higher-genus Gromov-Witten invariants in some examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The space of all possible two-dimensional shapes -- known as the&lt;br/&gt;moduli space of surfaces -- has long been a fundamental object of&lt;br/&gt;study in many areas of mathematics, from geometry to number&lt;br/&gt;theory. This space also plays an important role in string&lt;br/&gt;theory, the putative "theory of everything". This project is&lt;br/&gt;concerned with setting up a correspondence between&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional geometry (the moduli space of surfaces) and a&lt;br/&gt;kind of abstract algebra. This correspondence will be used to&lt;br/&gt;test certain mathematical conjectures coming from string theory.&lt;br/&gt;String theorists have predicted that two different simplified&lt;br/&gt;models of string theory-- known as the A model and the B model --&lt;br/&gt;are mathematically equivalent. This prediction has stimulated a&lt;br/&gt;great deal of mathematical work in the last 15 years. The PI&lt;br/&gt;will tackle some computations in the B model which have been&lt;br/&gt;heretofore out of reach. The results of these computations will&lt;br/&gt;then be compared with known computations in the A model,&lt;br/&gt;hopefully leading to further verification of the predictions of&lt;br/&gt;string theory.</AbstractNarration>
