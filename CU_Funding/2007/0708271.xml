    <AbstractNarration>Ponte Castaneda&lt;br/&gt;0708271&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) are multi-phase,&lt;br/&gt;multi-functional material systems consisting of magnetically&lt;br/&gt;"hard" or "soft" particles embedded in an elastomeric matrix&lt;br/&gt;phase. Because of the magnetic interactions between the&lt;br/&gt;particles, these materials are magnetostrictive and their&lt;br/&gt;mechanical response can be modified smoothly and reversibly in&lt;br/&gt;real time. Conversely, the presence of strain in these materials&lt;br/&gt;can be detected by induced changes in the overall magnetization. &lt;br/&gt;Although "macroscopic" (continuum mechanics) approaches for MREs&lt;br/&gt;have been in existence since the 1950s, more "microscopic"&lt;br/&gt;theories with truly predictive capabilities are much more recent&lt;br/&gt;and so far have been restricted to the linear (infinitesimal&lt;br/&gt;strain) regime. The investigator develops nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;homogenization techniques and applies them to generate&lt;br/&gt;constitutive models for magnetorheological elastomers that are&lt;br/&gt;valid in the finite-strain regime. This builds on earlier work by&lt;br/&gt;the investigator for reinforced elastomers and uses extensions of&lt;br/&gt;variational "linear comparison" homogenization techniques that&lt;br/&gt;have been developed previously. At the theoretical level, the&lt;br/&gt;models account for: (i) the strongly nonlinear response of the&lt;br/&gt;constituents, including nonlinear ferrolectric behavior for the&lt;br/&gt;particles, as well as nonlinear mechanical response for the&lt;br/&gt;elastomeric matrix, (ii) microstructural information, such as&lt;br/&gt;particle shape and orientation, as well as their spatial and&lt;br/&gt;orientational distribution, (iii) coupled magnetoelastic&lt;br/&gt;constitutive behavior, and (iv) finite deformations. At the&lt;br/&gt;applications level, the methodology is used to optimally select&lt;br/&gt;the constituent properties (e.g., magnetically hard vs. soft&lt;br/&gt;particles, magnetically isotropic vs. anisotropic particles) and&lt;br/&gt;the microstructural variables (e.g., particle shape and&lt;br/&gt;concentration, aligned distribution of orientations vs. random&lt;br/&gt;orientations, etc.) to enhance the magnetostrictive and sensing&lt;br/&gt;capabilities of these materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) are composite materials&lt;br/&gt;with "smart" or "intelligent" properties. As a consequence of&lt;br/&gt;these special properties, MREs hold great promise for use as&lt;br/&gt;sensors and actuators in many industrial applications, including&lt;br/&gt;the automotive, electronics, and robotic industries. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;they are lightweight, inexpensive and easily processed into a&lt;br/&gt;myriad of shapes. However, in order to achieve their full&lt;br/&gt;potential, a better mathematical understanding is necessary of&lt;br/&gt;their complex -- highly coupled and nonlinear -- macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;behavior, especially in the large-deformation regime. To aid in&lt;br/&gt;this process, the investigator develops a homogenization-based&lt;br/&gt;approach to accurately model the macroscopic behavior of MREs,&lt;br/&gt;incorporating the dependence on the magnetic properties of the&lt;br/&gt;particles, their initial distribution and orientation&lt;br/&gt;(microstructure), as well as the evolution of this microstructure&lt;br/&gt;under large deformation. Finally, because of their actuation&lt;br/&gt;properties MREs provide an artificial analogue of human muscle,&lt;br/&gt;and the project has implications for other types of smart&lt;br/&gt;materials, including electroactive polymers (EAPs), which could&lt;br/&gt;find applications in biotechnology and other areas of Federal&lt;br/&gt;strategic interest.</AbstractNarration>
