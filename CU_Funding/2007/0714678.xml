    <AbstractNarration>Ideas from Gromov-Witten theory in the 90's have led to new&lt;br/&gt;perspectives on classical questions of complex enumerative&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Many old problems have been elegantly solved. An&lt;br/&gt;example is the basic question of counting rational curves&lt;br/&gt;in the plane passing through given points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning about 10 year later, in the present decade, a renewal&lt;br/&gt;of interest in enumerative questions in real algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;has occurred with impetus from Gromov-Witten theory and&lt;br/&gt;tropical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop on "Real, topical, and complex&lt;br/&gt;enumerative geometry" will, for the first time, bring mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;in these various fields together for a common discussion&lt;br/&gt;of results, ideas, and future directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several lecture courses addressed to broad audiences will&lt;br/&gt;take place during the first week. C. Faber, A. Gathmann, R. Vakil&lt;br/&gt;and J.-Y. Welschinger have agreed to give lecture series.&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students interested in the field will greatly&lt;br/&gt;benefits from these courses. The second week will have several&lt;br/&gt;1 hour research talks on more advanced topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of the grant is to allow junior US&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians the opportunity of participating in the&lt;br/&gt;workshop.</AbstractNarration>
