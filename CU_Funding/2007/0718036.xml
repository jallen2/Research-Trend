    <AbstractNarration>This project will advance the use of mathematical methods to study the dynamics of a variety of cellular physiological processes. In particular, principles of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, stochastic processes, and numerical computation will be used and advanced by this work. The three biological themes of this work are the onset of cardiac arrhythmias, the construction and regulation of one-dimensional organelles, and the dynamics of biochemical networks in bacterial populations. Some specific, representative, problems to be studied are the cause of spontaneous calcium release events in cardiac cells leading to early afterdepolarizations, the effect of stretch activated receptors on cell depolarization in a region of hypoxia, the dynamics of the hypoxia response control system in cardiac cells, the mechanism of hook length regulation in Salmonella, the error prevention mechanism for chromosomal segregation during mitosis, and the structure and function of the quorum sensing biochemical network in vibrio fischeri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the biological problems to be studied are quite diverse, they are unified by their many common mathematical features. Thus, this work has the two-fold goal of using mathematical modeling approaches to understand several specific complex cellular processes, and to discover common principles and transferable concepts that are in operation in many different areas of biology. In this way, this work will contribute to the development of a fundamental and unified theory of how biological processes work, and in doing so, will contribute to our understanding of many issues relating to human health and medicine.</AbstractNarration>
