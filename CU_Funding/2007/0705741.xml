    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project is to conduct experimental and computational studies of optically active nanoscale structures, consisting of holes and particles, which are organized into arrays with hierarchical order of various scales. The research bridges materials, processing, fabrication, and characterization with a blend of theory and modeling, focusing on nanostructures including smooth thin films that are perforated with nanoholes and nanoscale materials of alternating metallic and dielectric hole arrays. These nanostructured materials can be used to focus and steer light and to tune light signals over wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. In addition, the appearance of magnetic dipole resonances and the consequences of Babinet's principle will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance, and is expected to provide new opportunities for manipulating light using organized nanoscale materials. It will provide unique training of graduate and undergraduate in an interdisciplinary field. The education/outreach activities of this project will concentrate primarily on the integration of research activities into the classroom and the development of content for grades 7-16 in the areas of nanoscale science and photonics. They include further development of scanning probe microscopy for undergraduate laboratories and dissemination of nanophotonics software for general chemistry courses. In addition, the PIs will continue contributing to the education and professional development of teachers in the NSF-Nanoscale Center for Learning and Teaching at Northwestern University.</AbstractNarration>
