    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for the acquisition of a Fourier Transform (FT) Raman spectrometer to assist the Scientific Laboratory of the Art Institute of Chicago in the analysis of materials of works of art. The spectrometer is coupled via fiber optics with a FT-Raman microscope installed on a custom-made articulated mount for enhanced probing of the molecular composition of complex composite materials (a) at the micro-scale level and (b) in situ, enabling analysis of entire objects, without removal of precious samples from unique artifacts. The instrument will provide new opportunities for advancing discoveries on the composition, surface science and degradation chemistry of Museum materials, while also playing a key role in addressing art historical and conservation questions on long-term preservation, technology of fabrication, trade routes in antiquity, provenance and dating.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically the instrument will be used by scientists at the Art Institute of Chicago, Northwestern University, and Chicago area Museums for cross-disciplinary projects addressing (1) the ultra-sensitive identification of natural organic dyes used as artists' pigments and colorants with FT-Raman and Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); (2) the study of the degradation chemistry of chromate pigments in paint films; (3) surface degradation phenomena on archaeological jades; (4) the fingerprinting of crystalline or glassy phases present in the body and glazes of 18th/19th century porcelains; (5) the study of 20th century plastics, polymers and biomaterials; and (6) the mapping of the composition of complex layered structures of historic and modern paintings. The projects will foster strong interdisciplinary collaboration between academic researchers, science and engineering students and Museum and art conservation experts and will be broadly disseminated through the Museum's exhibition, publications, conferences and tours of the laboratories. The program will offer (1) innovative research opportunities with a broad intellectual perspective, integrating research and education at all levels through joint internships for undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral students, and science teachers (as part of NU's RET program) and (2) will positively influence the education of students of the physical sciences by engaging them in scientific activities applied to real world problems of great impact to the society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for the acquisition of an advanced instrument ("Fourier Transform Raman") to assist the Art Institute of Chicago in the characterization of materials of works of art. This instrument is capable of rapidly and reliably identifying a wide array of compounds - such as pigments, dyes, precious stones, glasses, polymers and biopolymers incorporated in works of art- in situ, i.e. without having to remove sample from valuable works of art that are unique and irreplaceable. When a sample does need to be removed from an object, because it is too fragile to sustain extensive handling, the sample size is typically on the order of magnitude of one tenth of the diameter of an average human hair, thus nearly invisible to the naked eye. Our knowledge of artifact composition guides important decisions regarding conservation treatments and appropriate exhibit and storage conditions Furthermore, sensitive materials identification is often necessary for the proper attribution and dating of museum collections, and greatly contributes to the study of artists' techniques as well as ancient and historic technologies. &lt;br/&gt;The instrument will bring together a diverse group of users from Academia and Chicago area Museums with significant involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the physical sciences, encouraging collaborations across disciplines and enabling interdisciplinary learning, discovery and engagement in the positive impact of science on our ability to preserve and enhance the enjoyment of works of art for future generations. The insights gained into artists' material choices and how these materials change with age and exposure to the environment will be directly transferred to art historians, conservators and the general public through exhibitions, public displays, conferences, gallery talks, publications and tours of the conservation laboratories as part of the Art Institute of Chicago mission to educate the public on the scholarly and scientific research activities of the Museum.</AbstractNarration>
