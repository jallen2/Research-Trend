    <AbstractNarration>0747105&lt;br/&gt;Lu&lt;br/&gt;The broad and long-term goal of this project is to develop microfluidics-based transfected cell arrays using electroporation as the transfection method for large-scale gene screening based on both cell lines and primary cells. Electroporation occurs when a critical electrical field strength has been achieved and the cell membrane becomes effectively permeable to large biomolecules. As a physical method, electroporation does not have strong cell type dependency and has been shown effective in transfecting primary cells. In this project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will systematically study the transfection of cell lines and primary cells based on a novel microfluidic electroporation technique developed in the PI's laboratory and also demonstrate proof-of-concept transfected cell arrays for gene screening. In the educational plan, the PI will develop "electronic field trips" for middle/high school students to disseminate the knowledge about biological engineering and establish cyberinfrastructure for K-12 outreach. The PI will also develop a new course on emerging technologies in biological engineering and train undergraduate and graduate students in this highly interdisciplinary project.</AbstractNarration>
