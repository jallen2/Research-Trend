    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology will be organizing and hosting a major conference on Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics, May 14-16, 2007. This conference is the fourth in a series of conferences and for the first time it will include a significant component devoted to undergraduate student research (Undergraduate Research Day, May 14). The first two conferences (2004, 2005) brought together more than 400 applied mathematicians working at the frontiers of mathematical biology, fluid mechanics, nonlinear waves, high-performance scientific computing, and applied statistics. The third conference (2006) focused on mathematical fluid dynamics and its applications in engineering and biology, and brought together more than 100 mathematicians from around the world to interact and present the latest advances in their respective fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key theme of the 2007 Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics conference will be the mathematical modeling of difficult real-world problems in mathematical biology and the health sciences with a significant component comprising of the mathematics of fluids, linear and nonlinear waves, high-performance scientific computing, and applied statistics. Among the impacted technological areas are fiber-optic communication systems, ocean-wave dynamics, and fluid flow in pipes. The conference will bring together renowned mathematicians and scientists from the US and abroad to interact as they present their latest research results to a large audience that also contains significant numbers of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. The program of the conference will have 4 plenary speakers and 48 minisymposium speakers.</AbstractNarration>
