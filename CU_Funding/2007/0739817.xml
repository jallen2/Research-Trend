    <AbstractNarration>The Sixth Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks, HotNets-VI, will be held in Atlanta GA, on November 14-15, 2007. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in the networking systems community to engage in lively discussion of future trends in networking research and technology. The workshop will provide a venue for researchers to present and discuss ideas that have the potential to significantly impact the community in the long term; its goal is to promote community-wide discussions of those ideas. Work introduced at HotNets-VI, once fully thought through, completed, and written up in a finished form, will grow into papers accepted at SIGCOMM or other quality conferences, which in turn are expected to have impact on the field of networking. This proposal aims to fund twelve US-based graduate students to attend the HotNets-VI workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Participation in workshops like this is an extremely important experience for Ph.D. students, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and be exposed to leading-edge work in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of US-based students who would otherwise be unable to attend HotNets-VI, thus enhancing the educational experience of the next generation of network researchers.</AbstractNarration>
