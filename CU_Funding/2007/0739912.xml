    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will dramatically improve the economics of biodiesel production by efficiently converting the unrefined glycerol byproduct into a useful chemical, such as hydrogen. Biodiesel is a viable and rapidly growing addition to the nation's motor vehicle fuel supply. However, its production yields considerable amounts of a glycerol waste product. As the use of biodiesel continues to expand, the only currently available outlets for this product will be overwhelmed. The results from this project will provide significantly higher selectivity to hydrogen than currently available techniques and with a low energy input. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts (commercial potential) of this project (if successful) would be a reduction in the overall cost of production of biodiesel while also creating a source of carbon-neutral hydrogen for use in the production of other chemicals or clean fuels.</AbstractNarration>
