    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for travels of students, young faculty, and especially members of underrepresented groups from the US institutions, to attend the 5th Pathways, Networks and Systems International Conference in Porto Heli, Greece, 24-29 June 2007. The conference uniquely blends experimental studies of complex multilevel systems with rigorous computational, bioinformatics, statistical and analytical approaches. Emphasis is on mammalian systems, but breakthrough discoveries in other species are included where they lead to new strategies, paradigms, analytical methods, and phenotyping methods. Attendance is limited to less than 100 to promote direct and personal interactions. The conference is a balanced mix of formal and long (45 min) platform presentations with ample time for informal discussions. Feedback from previous conferences has been exceptional. Although there are other genomics, computational and systems biology conferences, none integrate computational and experimental approaches so seamlessly or effectively.</AbstractNarration>
