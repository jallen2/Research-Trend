    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0748129&lt;br/&gt;Wen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell replacement therapy represents one of the most promising treatments for many diseases and injuries. Recent discovery of the in vitro protocols necessary to derive dopaminergic (DA) neurons in large quantities from both human embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells has made it possible to ultimately cure Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the efficacy of stem-cell transplantation has been significantly compromised by poor cell survival and functionality in vivo, due primarily to the formation of an inhibitory extracellular matrix (ECM)-rich scar tissue at the transplantation site as a result of host tissue inflammatory response associated with the transplantation procedure. This project is to develop clinically applicable cell replacement therapy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this project, the Principal Investigator (PI) plans to achieve this goal by improving the survival and functionality of transplanted human adult stem cell-derived DA neurons in cell replacement therapy for PD based upon a novel space-creation concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will affect multiple scientific and technological communities, including tissue engineering, neuroscience, and developmental biology. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be trained, motivated, and prepared for life-long careers in biomedical research by gaining experimental skills, technical and academic competencies, and readiness. Active involvement of students from diverse backgrounds, women, and underrepresented minority groups; presentation of research results in coursework; and their dissemination into the community through outreach activities will promote campus diversity and benefit society.</AbstractNarration>
