    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USP), a non-PhD granting institution, will acquire an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) system to enhance interdisciplinary educational and research programs at the crossroads of physical and biological sciences. The instrumentation's ability to image molecular complexes and to measure (un-) binding forces will allow USP investigators from different disciplines to study various types of molecular interactions. The projects include (a) the influence of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions in dissecting viral and sub-viral replication complex assembly (b) steric interactions of polymer coated colloidal particles in transport and aggregation processes (c) interactions among the topoisomerases and helicases in Bacillus anthracis and the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes (d) interaction between epithelial cells and their underlying substratum. The AFM high resolution will allow studies of physical and chemical properties of micro- and nano- structures. These include (a) studies of electrical isolation and physical properties of patterned micro- and nano- scale areas in Silicon and AlGaAs/GaAs (b) visualization of successful MALDI spots to study of the influence of sample preparation on the detection of oligonucleotide complexes. The AFM instrumentation will create a unique opportunity for students to participate in interdisciplinary research and educational activities as well as to nurture the development of the new USP program in biophysics and materials science. With the robust involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in research at USP this instrumentation will help the University to attract more minority students through its outreach programs for K-12 Philadelphia schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lay Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The Atomic Force Microscope is an essential modern tool for imaging nanostructures' objects thousands of times smaller than the diameter of a hair and for measuring the delicate forces between molecules. These forces play an important role in fundamental processes occurring in physical and biological systems. The acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope by the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USP) will help its investigators unravel the mechanisms by which molecules of various types interact with each other. Ultimately these studies will lead to a better understanding of how the viruses responsible for diseases such as hepatitis C, influenza and polio replicate, or create copies of themselves. These studies will also help in the comprehension of how small particles, such as contaminants in groundwater systems, move and assemble themselves into aggregates. Another critical application is the study of the structures of microbial enzymes involved in antibiotic resistance. These findings will benefit the design and development of novel antibiotics against anthrax and other lethal infections. Important studies making use of the imaging capability of the instrumentation will investigate the physical properties of patterned nanostructures as a step toward developing the computer technology of tomorrow. In bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics and biology, the diverse uses of the instrumentation will help generate a strong interdisciplinary environment at USP. The exciting possibilities made possible by the acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope will undoubtedly benefit the students at USP, who will become better educated as future scientists and professionals.</AbstractNarration>
