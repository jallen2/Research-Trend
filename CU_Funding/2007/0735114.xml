    <AbstractNarration>ECCS- 0735114&lt;br/&gt;Deepa Kundur&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this SCER is to study the feasibility of secure lightweight ad hoc unidirectional networking in emerging free space optical sensor networks (FSOSNs) through analysis and algorithm development. In particular, the proposal investigates how optical beam directionality and diffraction affect secure ad hoc routing and communications in FSOSNs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to assess the use of unidirectional FSOSNs for secure transport of broadband data through a theoretical analysis of network connectivity as a function of system and device level optics characteristics; and the design of novel security mechanisms for routing in emerging unidirectional-link FSOSNs. This research is high risk and high pay-off because this is the first formal study of secure routing issues in unidirectional FSOSNs. This investigation pursues the substantial but largely unexplored area of circuit-based routing for unidirectional sensor networks; novel approaches to enhance security that leverage inherent network hierarchy, line-of-sight communications, and the mobility of the base station are assessed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of this research will facilitate the early deployment and long-term adoption of emerging broadband surveillance networks, revolutionizing the way information is used for society's benefit. The PI is actively involved in formally mentoring a diverse base of students and has a successful track record of attracting such individuals to graduate studies. She will recruit, through undergraduate research experiences and active mentorship, students to this field of national importance.</AbstractNarration>
