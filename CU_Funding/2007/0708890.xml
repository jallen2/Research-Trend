    <AbstractNarration>This research centers around the development of tools and techniques for the analysis of microlensing signals from extrasolar planets. Four specific activities will be undertaken to significantly improve the observational capabilities of microlensing planet searches currently underway. They include: 1) new software tools will be developed that will enable the microlensing planet search community to properly interpret follow-up observations of planetary host stars and to obtain complete solutions to the observed planetary microlensing events. 2) Automated real-time planetary signal identification will be incorporated into the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics survey data pipeline. This will allow planetary deviations in microlensing light curves to be detected early in their development for intensive follow-up by other groups. It is expected this capability will increase planet detection efficiency by at least a factor of two. 3) Binary and triple lens event curve modeling will be added to the Bennett and Rhie light curve modeling code. This is important for understanding multiple planet and possible circumbinary microlensing events which appear to comprise a significant fraction of all detectable planetary microlensing events. This code will first be shared with other members of the Probing Lensing Anomalies NETwork, and then distributed to the community at large. 4) The Bennett microlensing survey simulation routine will be modified to model future microlensing surveys. The result will be estimations of planet detection rates which can help determine if planned search programs would add significantly to our knowledge of extrasolar planetary systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notre Dame undergraduates and a graduate student will be involved in this effort, allowing them to participate in planet discovery. Moreover, the real-time discovery of planetary microlensing signals will immediately be broadcast to the public, allowing anyone with a telescope to participate in planet discovery. The Bennett-Rhie binary event modeling code will also be prepared for public distribution which will remove an important obstacle to the participation of a larger number of astronomers in the microlensing planet search field.</AbstractNarration>
