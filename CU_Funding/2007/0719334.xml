    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry program in the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Marcin Majda of the University of California at Berkeley. The research program of Prof. Majda focuses on DNA Hybridization and Antibody-Antigen Competitive Equilibria in Confined Spaces. The long term goal of his research is to develop a new generation of ultra-sensitive protein and DNA micro-sensors for use in biological research and medical diagnostics. If successful, these sensors will be less expensive, disposable and simple to use as they will not require any additional reagents. They will be capable to simultaneously determine a number of specific proteins and DNA fragments in very small volumes of samples such as physiological fluids. To realize this goal Prof. Majda and his students will test two fundamental ideas that will lead to and promote the sensor development. First, they will examine the effect of confining the space surrounding the reacting biological molecules on the nature of the equilibria governing biological reactions. Secondly, they will test a unique hypothesis that stipulates that it is possible to shift the position of the equilibrium of a biological reaction, and thus to alter its course, by applying small magnetic forces to weaken certain biological interactions such as those involved in antibody-antigen binding. Both of these ideas will be investigated by using micron-diameter, paramagnetic, polymer micro-spheres attached to a glass slide using DNA or antibody-antigen complexes. Thus the space between the micro-bead and the glass slide will serve to confine the bio-molecules. Using the magnetic field of a stack of permanent magnets positioned at a precisely controlled distance above the surface of a glass slide, it will be possible to apply precisely controlled forces to the micro-spheres and thus to the molecules forming the tethers. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to students in a highly multidisciplinary research area with potential to greatly impact the field of clinical diagnostics.</AbstractNarration>
