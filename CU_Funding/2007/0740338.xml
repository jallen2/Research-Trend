    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will evaluate the feasibility of utilizing Line Scan X-Ray Tomography to characterize the combustion process inside internal combustion engines. The two innovative parts of the proposed work are a high frequency Line Scan X-Ray tomography system and an advanced statistical deconvolution method. These two innovations will enable the determination of the structure of flames and high-pressure sprays inside internal combustion engines. The innovation enables property estimation inside engines without the need for optical or acoustic windows. The proposed work builds on the company's expertise in developing statistical deconvolution methods for industrial process tomography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There are two primary commercial applications for the proposed Line-Scan X-ray tomography system. The first is the estimation of flame structure within automotive engines. New federal regulations, scheduled to become effective in FY11, mandate much lower pollutant emissions from automotive engines than are currently permitted. The second is the determination of pattern factors inside turbines. Newer turbine engines used for power production run at high temperatures that can significantly degrade thermal barrier coatings if hot spots exist. The proposed system will provide previously unavailable information within automotive and turbine engines, leading to tighter control on pollution and engine performance.</AbstractNarration>
