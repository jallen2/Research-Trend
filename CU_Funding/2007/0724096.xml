    <AbstractNarration>This STTR Phase II research project is to develop a commercial board level optical interconnect using bus architecture. Conventional copper links on printed circuit boards fail to provide sufficient bandwidth for data transfer above 10 Gbit/sec. Optical interconnections are widely viewed as an alternative to higher throughput. However, existing photonics-related approaches suffer from issues of packaging, reliability and manufacturing cost. In this project, Omega Optics and the University of Texas at Austin seek to develop a fully embedded board level optical interconnect for enhanced bandwidth, while reducing the difficulties of optoelectronic packaging and device reliability. Phase I results demonstrated 150 GHz bandwidth with 51 cm interconnection distance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instead of utilizing surface mounted optical components this approach separates the fabrication of the optical layer with the electrical parts and laminates it inside printed circuit boards, between which the interconnection is setup through in-layer vias. This fully embedded technology seals all the optical components and provides a seamless interface with electrical layers, therefore it eliminates the concerns of external optoelectronic devices for end users. The revolutionary breakthrough over copper links sought through this research would benefit the entire computer industry and enable the continued progression of bandwidth and interconnect distance.</AbstractNarration>
