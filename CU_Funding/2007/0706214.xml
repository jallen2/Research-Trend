    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0706214&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Lizhen Ji&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for six days of meetings in&lt;br/&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts during late summer 2008 on geometric&lt;br/&gt;analysis and related fields. The conference aims to develop a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive overview of the present status and future&lt;br/&gt;directions of geometric analysis and its connections to many&lt;br/&gt;areas including algebraic geometry, analysis, topology,&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics, and string theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The occasion for this large conference on geometric analysis and&lt;br/&gt;related geometric subjects is the sixtieth birthday of Shing-Tung&lt;br/&gt;Yau, one of the leaders in the area. Geometric analysis is a&lt;br/&gt;marriage of geometric problems and ideas, which often concern&lt;br/&gt;properties of geometric spaces on large scales, with analytic&lt;br/&gt;techniques that begin with small-scale features of geometry and&lt;br/&gt;sometimes allow us to extrapolate those to large-scale&lt;br/&gt;statements. Two of the great successes of geometric analysis are&lt;br/&gt;the Calabi Conjecture, settled by Yau in the 1970s and later&lt;br/&gt;found to be a key to the development of string theory, and the&lt;br/&gt;Poincare Conjecture, a celebrated problem that was open for more&lt;br/&gt;than one hundred years before its resolution just a few years ago&lt;br/&gt;by G. Perelman, who brought to maturity a program launched in the&lt;br/&gt;1980s by R. Hamilton. Many of the results and techniques&lt;br/&gt;developed over the last thirty years in geometric analysis and&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry were essential to the proof of the Poincare&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, and the ideas contributed to the problem by Perelman&lt;br/&gt;have set off worldwide activity on new questions in geometric&lt;br/&gt;analysis.
