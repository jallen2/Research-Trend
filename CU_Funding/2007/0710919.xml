    <AbstractNarration>Of particular interest (and controversy) in geophysics and seismology are the mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;controlling brittle-like failure at depths of several hundred km or more where deep earthquakes&lt;br/&gt;occur. At these depths frictional sliding, the fundamental failure mechanism operating under the&lt;br/&gt;lower confinements present at shallower depths, is nominally suppressed. We propose new&lt;br/&gt;experiments and modeling aimed at elucidating the characteristics and the fundamental physical&lt;br/&gt;mechanism(s) that underlie localized brittle compressive failure under high confinement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain brittle-like failure under high&lt;br/&gt;confinement, dehydration embrittlement and transformational faulting are the two most often&lt;br/&gt;cited. They act to reduce confinement locally, in effect allowing low-confinement frictional&lt;br/&gt;faulting to continue into the high-confinement regime. However, changes in earthquake seismic&lt;br/&gt;character at greater depths are possibly consistent with a change in the physical mechanism of&lt;br/&gt;rupture for the deepest earthquakes. An alternative mechanism, and the one we propose to&lt;br/&gt;investigate, is plastic faulting. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the other two: it&lt;br/&gt;is a non-frictional shear instability aided by adiabatic heating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirited by past success in using ice as a model material for rock--Kirby's [1987] discovery&lt;br/&gt;of transformational faulting, and our own discovery [Renshaw and Schulson, 2001] of what&lt;br/&gt;appears to be a universal mechanism of low-confinement brittle failure--and encouraged by its&lt;br/&gt;mineralogical simplicity and by its marked similarity to the behavior of rocks and minerals, we&lt;br/&gt;propose a series of systematic compression experiments on granular ice to determine the effects,&lt;br/&gt;if any, of confinement, grain size and strain rate on both the terminal failure stress and the failure&lt;br/&gt;mode, with attention to microstructural detail. Preliminary experiments demonstrate a transition&lt;br/&gt;in brittle-like failure mode with increasing confinement and that the high confinement faults&lt;br/&gt;appear not to be friction controlled. Nor do they appear to be related to either mode II cracking,&lt;br/&gt;dehydration embrittlement, or phase transformations. Our working hypothesis is that plastic&lt;br/&gt;faulting is at play. In addition, we propose to develop quantitative models of high confinement&lt;br/&gt;compressive failure, using as inputs direct observations of the physical processes.</AbstractNarration>
