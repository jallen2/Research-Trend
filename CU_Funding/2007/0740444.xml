    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will involve the development of decontamination wipes for chemical warfare agents. The company proposes to develop a nano-adsorbent impregnated cellulosic fiber which will not only physically remove the offending gas/vapor, but also decompose it into relatively non-toxic products. Phase I will involve establishing the fabrication process for the fiber and proof of its decontamination ability towards stimulants of warfare agent. Preliminary studies will be performed to design a non-woven fabric using the coated cellulose, during which time, compatibility with various other binding fibers will be determined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decontamination is an important, unavoidable process in the protection against chemical warfare agents. The aim of decontamination is to rapidly and effectively render harmless or remove poisonous substances both on personnel and equipment. High decontamination capacity is one of the factors which may reduce the effect of an attack with chemical warfare agents. In addition in the event of a terrorist attack or an accident these types of fabrics can help first responders to be protected from exposure.</AbstractNarration>
