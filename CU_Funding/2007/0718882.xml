    <AbstractNarration>Plants have a sophisticated, two-branched innate immune system that induces resistance against nearly all would-be pathogens. The first branch is basal defense, which is induced in response to widely conserved pathogen-associated patterns. The second branch is plant cell-death associated resistance, which is induced by interactions between genes that are variably expressed in both plants and pathogens. Although these branches had long been considered distinct, studies on the RIN4 protein from the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, have demonstrated a mechanistic link. Specifically, RIN4 is a regulator of both branches of the plant immune system. This project includes study of how RIN4 modification by phosphorylation regulates its function and how RIN4-interacting proteins mediate activity of RIN4. These studies will significantly advance understanding of how each branch functions in Arabidopsis. More importantly, the relationship between the two branches will be elucidated, which will advance understanding of the evolution and function of the immune systems of all plants. By understanding how these two branches work together to resist nearly all infections, strategies for disease control can be developed in those cases where the plant immune system fails. Furthermore, because similar linkages are just being discovered to exist between branches of the innate immune system of animals, this work in plants will continue to lead advancement across the field of immunology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work will be presented at meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. The implications of this work to agriculture are obvious. The PI has a proven record of working with under-represented minorities, including undergraduate students, doctoral students, and post-docs. Also, the investigator is a leader in establishing the summer undergraduate research experience (SURE) program to provide internships for undergraduates considering careers in science.</AbstractNarration>
