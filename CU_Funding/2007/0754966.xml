    <AbstractNarration>Auburn University will provide 10 summer internships to undergraduates for participation in an REU Site Program sponsored by NSF in collaboration with the Department of Defense through the Awards to Stimulate and Support Undergraduate Research Experiences (ASSURE) program. This multi-disciplinary, multi-departmental REU program is open to all undergraduates enrolled in Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering. Students will conduct an independent research on the development of sensors and biosensors. The program will emphasize hands-on research experiences. Students will participate in weekly seminars to understand how sensors can be used in different areas of biology and engineering. The program will also provide preparation for graduate school, discussion on ethics in science, and social activities to foster the integration of students into the research environment. Upon completion of the projects, all students will communicate their results through poster presentations. Students will also be encouraged to publish their findings in different scientific research journals. A student database will be maintained to contact students and monitor their progress after they have completed the program. Women, underrepresented minorities and first generation college students from institutions serving minorities or from institutions with limited research opportunities are especially encouraged to apply. All stipends, room, board and travel expenses are provided.
