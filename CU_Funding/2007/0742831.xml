    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a two-day conference for undergraduate women in physics that focuses on the critical transition from undergraduate to graduate study. On January 19-20, 2008, the University of Michigan, the University of Southern California (USC) and Yale University will each host a Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWP). The unifying aim of the three conferences is to encourage young women to apply to graduate school by providing a stimulating and supportive venue for them to learn about the exciting possibilities presented by advanced careers in physics. Towards this goal, the conference objectives are that participants leave with:&lt;br/&gt;. Increased awareness of current research and career options in physics.&lt;br/&gt;. Greater familiarity with the graduate school experience.&lt;br/&gt;. Resources for applying to and being successful in graduate school as well as&lt;br/&gt;general resources for women in physics.&lt;br/&gt;. A network of women in physics.&lt;br/&gt;The two-day event will bring together female undergraduate students in physics from&lt;br/&gt;across the US to learn about current research and career opportunities in physics, the&lt;br/&gt;graduate school application process and experience, and resources for women in physics.&lt;br/&gt;Women attending the conferences will have the opportunity to present original research,&lt;br/&gt;discuss physics topics with other students, and meet other successful women with more advanced careers in physics.</AbstractNarration>
