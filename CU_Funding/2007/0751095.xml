    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0751069 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Bulent Yener &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0751095 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Aggelos Kiayias &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Connecticut &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: SGER: Collaborative Research: Secure and Auditable Privacy Contracts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major challenges imposed by the pervasiveness of &lt;br/&gt;cyberspace is to ensure ``trust'' and design trustworthy systems to &lt;br/&gt;support the critical infrastructure for official, commercial, and &lt;br/&gt;personal business. Millions of everyday users pass their personnel &lt;br/&gt;information over the Internet to their health-care providers, to &lt;br/&gt;their banks, to insurance companies and other service providers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once such personnel information is transferred, in many cases, it is &lt;br/&gt;outsourced to other parties (some of which may even reside in &lt;br/&gt;foreign countries) for storage and processing. It may be sold or &lt;br/&gt;resold for data mining. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collection, processing and resale of private data is a &lt;br/&gt;multi-million dollar industry that has serious security and privacy &lt;br/&gt;breaches including inadvertently revealing or loosing the &lt;br/&gt;personal information of thousands or millions of people. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is a clear need for knowledge discovery for commercial &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., marketing, insurance design), scientific and even security &lt;br/&gt;reasons (e.g., identifying public health problem outbreaks such as &lt;br/&gt;epidemics, biological warfare instances), at present, ``data &lt;br/&gt;producers'' (i.e., users like all of us) have no control of who, &lt;br/&gt;how, and what exactly is done with such private and sensitive data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal considers the above fundamental problem by introducing &lt;br/&gt;a novel mechanism called secure and auditable privacy &lt;br/&gt;contracting (SAP-Contracting). An SAP-Contract can be used to &lt;br/&gt;define a tradeoff between level of privacy and amount of data &lt;br/&gt;mining. Such a tradeoff can be negotiated and customized between &lt;br/&gt;data sources and data miners. An SAP-Contract defines precisely the &lt;br/&gt;functions and permitions that can be performed in personnel records. &lt;br/&gt;It aims to bridge the need for privacy with the need for data &lt;br/&gt;collection, transfer, marketing and processing; thus, enable &lt;br/&gt;sensitive private data to be treated as a commodity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAP-Contracting is different from the current state of art such as &lt;br/&gt;privacy preserving data mining approaches since it does not rely on &lt;br/&gt;server based data hiding. It complements and benefits from the &lt;br/&gt;research on cryptographic databases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to design, implement and test a prototype of this &lt;br/&gt;paradigm to establish a proof of a concept and show provable &lt;br/&gt;security properties of SAP-Contracts, including &lt;br/&gt;confidentiality, integrity, and auditability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful this project will provide provable and auditable &lt;br/&gt;privacy. It will marry privacy and data mining research with &lt;br/&gt;different economical models and venture into new research areas.</AbstractNarration>
