    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;Most people are more perceptive to geometric rather than symbolic representation of information and an increasing number of educators are concentrating on utilizing visualization to explain scientific and engineering knowledge to a broad audience. A medium that combines course materials with interactive visualization can be a powerful tool for education and enhanced learning. This project is developing the Gaming and Interactive 2D/3D Visualization for Education (GIVE) tools to explain abstract engineering concepts to undergraduate students. GIVE provides an interactive gaming environment for learning that is different from e-learning systems. While retaining the advantages of e-learning systems, such as distant and asynchronous education, the GIVE system further enhances learning by incorporating game characteristics such as a progressively balanced goal, feedback, multiple-goal structure, adaptive scoring, meaningful visual presentation, and emotional involvement into the educational tool. Software gaming modules are being created for selected courses in the aerospace, electrical, and mechanical engineering programs. Three separate gaming systems are being developed aimed at high school students, in-class student/instructor interactions, and out-of-classroom practice. The GIVE modules are being tested extensively with high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to ensure their broad appeal.</AbstractNarration>
