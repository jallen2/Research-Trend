    <AbstractNarration>NSF Proposal : CBET-0730556&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: TACKLING CFD MODELING OF FLAME SPREAD ON PRACTICAL SOLID COMBUSTIBLES&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Carlos Fernandez-Pello&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PUBLIC ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In 2005, the cost of property damage due to fire in the US was almost $11 billion, and the US has one of the highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. Clearly, there is a dire need of research that can be used to help design safer structures and to develop strategies for mitigating the effects of unwanted fire. Fires grow primarily through the process of flame spread, which refers to the continuous propagation of flames anchored to the surface of a condensed-phase combustible material. The ability to accurately model flame spread over practical combustible materials will result in improved understanding and prediction of fire growth. Of particular interest is the use of computer models to predict the fire behavior of real materials with data obtained from laboratory-scale tests. This is potentially useful for forensic fire reconstruction or estimating the heat release rate history of fuel packages that are not practical to burn at full scale due to cost or size. The most promising long-term prospect for modeling fire growth is the coupling of a ?first principles? condensed-phase fuel generation model (pyrolysis model) to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that simulates the gas-phase fluid mechanics, combustion, and heat transfer aspects of a fire.&lt;br/&gt; The present work involves development of a generalized pyrolysis model that can simulate the pyrolysis and burning of real-world materials encountered in fires, which have not yet been adequately addressed from a modeling perspective. One of the biggest challenges is obtaining the ?material properties? (thermal properties, kinetics coefficients, etc.) needed to characterize a material. For this reason, techniques involving automated optimization by genetic algorithms will be applied and further developed so that the required material properties can be extracted from existing laboratory-scale tests. The pyrolysis model will be coupled to an existing CFD code and used to calculate flame spread on real-world solid combustibles over a range of length scales. Where necessary, modifications will be made to the CFD code to improve its predictions of temperatures, velocities, and heat flux levels. All computer programs, source code, and supporting documentation will be made freely and widely available electronically, thereby allowing future workers in this area to proceed from a well-documented starting point and advance the state of the art without having to start from scratch.&lt;br/&gt; This research will benefit society by leading to an improved understanding of fire growth. It represents a step toward the development of computational tools that can be used to simulate fire development and how it is affected by the use of alternate materials or installation of suppression systems. This could aid in cost-effective fire safety design of the built environment, and reduce the loss of life and property by fire.</AbstractNarration>
