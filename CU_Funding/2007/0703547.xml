    <AbstractNarration>The PAlmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) is designed to exploit the large and &lt;br/&gt;increasing concentration of people working in number theory and number theoretic &lt;br/&gt;applications located in the Southeast. The primary goals include the fostering &lt;br/&gt;of collaboration and education rather than dissemination of new results. The &lt;br/&gt;meetings will provide graduate students exposure to recent research with a &lt;br/&gt;minimum of costs. The location of the meeting will rotate among Clemson &lt;br/&gt;University, University of South Carolina and the College of Charleston. &lt;br/&gt;The regular meetings will foster a strong regional culture of research in pure &lt;br/&gt;number theory as well as its applications. The creation of PANTS is especially &lt;br/&gt;timely as there is more and more interplay between pure number theory and &lt;br/&gt;applications. For instance, low-discrepancy sequences created from function &lt;br/&gt;fields are used by financial institutions; higher dimensional abelian varieties &lt;br/&gt;are being considered in cryptography to guarantee privacy of digital &lt;br/&gt;communications; and understanding modular towers is now very important &lt;br/&gt;in the construction of the best sequences of error-correcting codes. &lt;br/&gt;This mixture of very theoretical mathematics with applications is uniquely &lt;br/&gt;well-represented at the PANTS core institutions, and we intend to capitalize &lt;br/&gt;on this. The conferences will host many of the major names in the field. &lt;br/&gt;Because of its relatively central location in the Southeast, the series will &lt;br/&gt;attract students and faculty from several states, who would not otherwise be &lt;br/&gt;able to attend larger more costly conferences. In addition, the organizers will &lt;br/&gt;strive for a demographically diverse group of speakers and participants, &lt;br/&gt;including women and those from other underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
