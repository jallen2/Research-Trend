    <AbstractNarration>L'evy processes form a family of models that is the cornerstone of&lt;br/&gt;the modern probability. Research related to L'evy processes is broad&lt;br/&gt;and deep, and the results are used in further research in probability,&lt;br/&gt;in other areas of mathematics, and in numerous applications. This&lt;br/&gt;proposal is designed to make funds available to support researchers &lt;br/&gt;from the United States who are interested in participating in the 5th&lt;br/&gt;L'evy conference in Denmark in August 2007. This will serve to&lt;br/&gt;increase timely dissemination of ideas between the specialists &lt;br/&gt;working on L'evy processes, and stimulate the research by the younger&lt;br/&gt;people, particularly by the students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is at least a perception, and it is based on available evidence,&lt;br/&gt;some of which is provided in the proposal, that much of the research&lt;br/&gt;activity on L'evy processes is conducted outside of the US, mostly in&lt;br/&gt;Europe and Japan. This proposal aims to take a step towards improving&lt;br/&gt;the visibility of the research on L'evy processes done in the United&lt;br/&gt;States and also making it more obvious to graduate students and junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers that research in L'evy processes is an important and&lt;br/&gt;interesting area to pursue.</AbstractNarration>
