    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on the development of environmentally-friendly techniques for generating anhydrous fluoride reagents, the elucidation of fundamental solution properties of anhydrous ammonium fluoride salts, and the demonstration of the utility of these reagents in synthetic chemistry. A diverse collection of new anhydrous fluoride salts will be synthesized. Complementary computational, kinetic and synthetic studies of nucleophilic fluorination reactions featuring these new salts will be performed. This project should advance significantly the understanding of solution phase behavior of weak electrolytes and the design criteria to enhance the stability and nucleophilicity of these reagents. The project will provide new reagents and strategies for the rapid and selective late stage introduction of fluorine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Stephen G. DiMagno of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and Professor Andrew S. Koch of St. Mary's College of Maryland. This research program develops new methodology to prepare fluorinated organic compounds rapidly and efficiently. Fluorinated organic compounds are critical components of drug formulations, agrochemicals, PET imaging agents, and advanced materials. Selective fluorination methods are also highly prized in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries, where approximately one third of currently marketed products contain fluorinated organic compounds. The straightforward nature and safety of fluorinating reagents and methods developed under this award make it possible for undergraduate researchers to make direct and significant contributions to technologically relevant research.</AbstractNarration>
