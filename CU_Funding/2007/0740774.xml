    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to implement a new technology that allows anyone with information "individuals, small businesses, large corporations, or other organizations" to quickly, easily, and inexpensively distribute (and optionally bill for) their information via cell-phone text messaging (SMS). The Scientific Media system comprises hardware and software that route requests and responses between subscribers who access information and content providers who distribute information. The Scientific Media system incorporates the following significant features: (1) the system replicates the organizational structure of the internet by allocating keywords in the context of SMS, (2) the system provides for multiple authorship of content by establishing a structure that allows complex content by arbitrarily numerous authors and (3) the system integrates billing and advertising capabilities and can generate revenue by charging content providers, subscribers, or advertisers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Media believes that the system establishes the framework of an important new method of distributing information via SMS that can be applied in a variety of settings, including consumer, education, and research settings. If successful, there will be a significant market opportunity with ad-generated and other revenue.</AbstractNarration>
