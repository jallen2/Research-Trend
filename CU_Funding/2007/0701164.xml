    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators study Fourier bases of Hilbert spaces associated with affine iterated function systems (IFSs) on the real &lt;br/&gt;line and in higher dimensions. While much work in the last two decades has focused on the case in which the attractor of the &lt;br/&gt;IFS is a fractal with non-integral Hausdorff dimension, the investigators study IFSs with overlap. In the one-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;setting, the measures associated with these attractors are Erdos's self-similar convolution measures; in general the measures &lt;br/&gt;are invariant Hutchinson measures. Almost nothing is known about orthonormal bases associated with Hutchinson &lt;br/&gt;measures in the case of non-finite overlap, and in fact previous work of the investigators and P. Jorgensen has shown that &lt;br/&gt;the measures in the overlap cases have different properties from the non-overlap measures. The proposed work on IFSs is &lt;br/&gt;an exciting branch of harmonic analysis which connects to fractals, wavelets, and random walks; it also has applications to &lt;br/&gt;number theory, dynamics, and combinatorial geometry. The investigators draw on methods from all these fields in their &lt;br/&gt;work. The work in this proposal will involve further collaborations with P. Jorgensen at the University of Iowa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iterated function systems (IFSs) embody the common themes of recursion and self-similarity. The investigators will study &lt;br/&gt;properties of IFSs and their associated geometry. In fact, a central theme in this work is the interplay between geometry and &lt;br/&gt;spectral analysis on fractals. There is a natural tension between studying fractals from a geometric point of view and from a &lt;br/&gt;spectral point of view; traditional time-frequency methods used in spectral analysis are linear, and the systems the &lt;br/&gt;investigators study are non-linear. The need to understand non-linear phenomena is motivated by a host of real-life &lt;br/&gt;applications. IFSs occur repeatedly in signal processing and communications. For example, wavelets, the key behind the &lt;br/&gt;JPEG 2000 compression standard, are a particular example of an IFS. Applications of iterated function systems extend far &lt;br/&gt;beyond communications---IFSs are used in data compression, quantum computing, pattern recognition, DNA computations, &lt;br/&gt;and a vast array of other fields. Furthermore, due to its wide applicability, work in this proposal will draw undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;students into mathematical research. The investigators will conduct research with undergraduates at Grinnell College, and &lt;br/&gt;published work by P. Jorgensen and the investigators has already been incorporated into research projects for &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates at the University of Iowa, as part of the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP &lt;br/&gt;Alliance) and the Heartland Mathematics Partnership.</AbstractNarration>
