    <AbstractNarration>Recent research on wireless networks and mobile computing has led to increasing acceptance of ad-hoc and sensor networks for applications such as hospital, battlefield, and monitoring scenarios. An international meeting called MASS (Mobile Ad hoc and Sensor Systems) was initiated in the year 2004. After successful organization for last three years, the fourth meeting will be held in Pisa, Italy from October 8-11, 2007. Professor Marco Conti, IIT-CNR, Italy will be serving the General Chair while Professor Silvia Giordano, SUPSI, Switzerland and Ivan Stojmenovic, University of Ottawa, Canada are serving as Program Co-Chairs. Professor Dharma Agrawal is the Steering Committee Chair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all these years, researchers across the globe have participated and this meeting has become a premier international conference. One of the important aspects is to select the best papers for this meeting and a meeting is held just to facilitate creation of an outstanding program. We also encourage authors to attend this meeting by offering partial travel funds to a subset of authors. Funds are request to support travel for authors of accepted papers to the MASS 2007 conference as well as PC committee members to participate in Committee meeting.</AbstractNarration>
