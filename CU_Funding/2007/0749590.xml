    <AbstractNarration>This is a Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction project for the construction of a 236 foot research vessel to work in the waters off the coast of Alaska including the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. The University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) proposal is in response to the National Science Foundation Program Solicitation NSF 07-515 for the management, acquisition and operation of an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV). The construction of an ARRV was given the highest priority in the report ?National Academic Research Fleet ? a Long Range Plan for Renewal?. The proposed design was developed with input from the oceanographic science community and the academic fleet operators. The design was completed in December 2004 and is well suited for oceanographic and fisheries research in the harsh, ice-infested Alaska seas during all seasons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UAF proposes to assemble a management team for the acquisition of the ship that draws on extensive experience for public agency ship procurements. They propose to use experienced personnel and vessel acquisition procedures that have proven successful in Alaska Marine Highways (AMS) recent vessel acquisitions. UAF will be using the Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Execution Plan (PEP) systems used by AMS during these acquisitions. The University is contracting with two experience marine science technical engineers to insure the ship science capabilities are not compromised. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any large shipyard project there are several areas of risk; delays in delivery of critical materials and equipment, such as steel plate or the propulsion system; lack of change order control; untimely or delays in regulatory inspections; lack of fiscal responsibility and/or lack of a realistic contingency or de-scouping plan. To aid in controlling these risks NSF has developed a tight cooperative agreement with stringent reporting requirements. In addition, NSF required an oversight committee be established composed of an outside naval architect, two Marine Superintendents with shipyard construction experience, two marine technical engineers (not part of the UAF project team), three oceanographic scientist with experience in the Arctic and sub-Arctic, one fisheries oceanographer and one Alaskan Native. Monthly meetings with the oversight committee will be required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal was reviewed by 10 mail reviewers and 10 panelists. A major recommendation from the panel was a phased acquisition strategy to mitigate risk. A four phase approach is proposed with given milestones to be completed prior to funding of the next phase. The CA provides for the Phased approach and outlines milestones for each Phase. Phase I includes the completion of the PEP, design refresh and cost update, project execution plan, development of an oversight committee, draft shipyard contract and completing the formation of the project management team. Phase II milestones include completion of shipyard RFP and Technical specifications, Proposal evaluation, contract award and Baseline Review. Phase III is the construction of the vessel including regulatory and Classification certificates. Phase IV includes the science test cruises in open and ice-covered waters and the warranty period. The proposed in-service science date is 2011.</AbstractNarration>
