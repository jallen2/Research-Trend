    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will address the current energy density power, and manufacturing limitations of existing battery systems particularly as they are miniaturized. The goal of the project is to develop a new, easily assembled, solid-state electrochemical cell with very high energy density and few components based on a novel electrochemical couple. During Phase I the methods for making the active components will be developed and the cell will be demonstrated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cell will greatly simplify the manufacture and miniaturization of batteries with very high energy densities for a variety of applications. Such applications include powering remote sensors, consumer and military portable electronics and medical devices. The batteries will be ideal for medical devices requiring very long lifetimes and could potentially greatly extend the life of implantable devices, limiting the number of replacement operations and saving significant health care expenses.</AbstractNarration>
