    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to collaboratively determine successful strategies for promoting creativity in IT based on the experiences of a diverse group of leading practitioners. Creative activity leading to major innovation is a critical component of the American competitiveness initiative, not only for driving innovation in IT research and development, but also for advancing our pedagogical approaches to educating and preparing scientists for the future. There is a need to establish a formal collective basis for critically examining the role of creativity in IT research and education in order to support structured dialog, disseminate findings and broaden understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin this process, this workshop brings together leaders engaged in fostering creativity within a variety of disciplines to share their experiences and success stories. Topics addressed will include diverse perspectives on fostering creativity; integrating creative and scientific disciplines; formalizing and measuring success factors in encouraging creativity; and creativity through the exchange of ideas in electronic publication forums. The presentations and the surrounding conversations that will shape, extend and evolve common ideas will be collected into an edited electronic publication that will be part of the dynamic creativeIT wiki.</AbstractNarration>
