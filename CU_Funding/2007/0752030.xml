    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is gathering key stakeholders and leaders in computing and information related disciplines to examine the education needs in these areas. Such a gathering is timely given that these critical fields have emerged as essential for the economic and technological health of the United States. The workshop participants are producing a white paper that documents the informed consensus of the computing community on a focused set of priorities and plan of action. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the fact that the computing community is diverse, with roots in several different disciplines and close relationships with many more. Hence the challenges and opportunities for ensuring that the field meets its education needs are complex, both technically and in terms of the coordinated interaction of groups that represent different constituencies with a variety of agendas. The workshop's broader impacts are being felt through its stimulation of collaboration among the diverse academic and practitioner groups within the computing community. In addition, there is a strong emphasis on ensuring representation of communities currently under represented in the computing and information fields, specifically women, blacks, and Hispanics. Moreover, the workshop report is stimulating action to reverse the current decline in the number of students in the computing pipeline.</AbstractNarration>
