    <AbstractNarration>The 2007 ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Communications Architectures, Protocols and Applications will be held in Kyoto, Japan, from the 27th to the 31st of August of 2007. This conference is the premier technical meeting that examines the state-of-the-art in computer networks and communications. This award will assist approximately 16 United States-based (including Puerto Rico) graduate students as well as approximately 2 U.S.-based under-represented minority (including women) faculty members or faculty members of U.S. institutions that are primarily serving under represented minorities (including women) in attending this meeting. Participation in conferences such as SIGCOMM is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, as well as an important part of the teaching and research in data networking. It provides the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge research in the field. The award enables the participation of students and minority or minority serving faculty members who would otherwise be unable to attend ACM SIGCOMM 2007. For the portion for student support, the travel grant chairs are committed to encouraging the participation of women and under-represented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project proposes to provide travel support for graduate students, minority, or minority serving faculty members to attend SIGCOMM 2007. This will expose them to new ideas and allow for interaction with other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to the premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students and minority faculty members will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentation and interact with senior researchers in the field. The proposed student participation will have positive impact on students' interest and the quality of their research, on faculty member's teaching and the quality of their research. Woman and other minority students are encouraged to participate.</AbstractNarration>
