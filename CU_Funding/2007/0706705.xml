    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0706705&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Paul G. Goerss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chromatic picture of stable homotopy uses the algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry of formal groups to organize and direct investigations&lt;br/&gt;into the deeper structure of computations and theory. This&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to develop this point of view in two directions,&lt;br/&gt;one local and one global. The first, or local, direction is an&lt;br/&gt;investigation into K(n)-local homotopy theory in general and into&lt;br/&gt;the K(2)-local sphere in particular. The second, or more global,&lt;br/&gt;direction, would be to make systematic our knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;structured ring spectra using stacks and the moduli stack of&lt;br/&gt;formal groups as the basic parameterizing device. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;a main part of the project is to continue work on the problem of&lt;br/&gt;realizing families of commutative ring spectra over the moduli&lt;br/&gt;stack of formal groups. The spectrum of topological modular forms&lt;br/&gt;arises from taking the homotopy inverse limit of just such a&lt;br/&gt;family and recent work of Lurie, Behrens, and Lawson had given&lt;br/&gt;new examples. We can ask for systematic results along these&lt;br/&gt;lines, and we can ask for a thorough investigation into the&lt;br/&gt;examples we have. An intriguing and novel feature of these&lt;br/&gt;families is that they use the theory of Barsotti-Tate groups to&lt;br/&gt;combine information from formal groups of various heights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is in homotopy theory, which is a branch of&lt;br/&gt;topology, a rather modern field that grew naturally out of&lt;br/&gt;geometry by studying phenomena that remain invariant under&lt;br/&gt;continuous transformations, rather than rigid (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;angle-preserving) transformations. Of particular importance in&lt;br/&gt;topology are the continuous maps between large dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spheres; under a suitable equivalence relation, this is the ring&lt;br/&gt;of stable homotopy groups of spheres. This notorious difficult to&lt;br/&gt;calculate, or even to make conjectures about; therefore, in the&lt;br/&gt;past few decades we have focused on trying to understand&lt;br/&gt;large-scale qualitative phenomena. In summary, this is the main&lt;br/&gt;thrust of this project as well. It has been very fruitful to&lt;br/&gt;detect these phenomena using tools from other fields, especially&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. The transition from topology to geometry is&lt;br/&gt;done using homology theories, which is a way of linearizing&lt;br/&gt;behavior in topology. Simply sticking to one such theory is a&lt;br/&gt;radical process, however, and it loses too much data; therefore,&lt;br/&gt;we study families of such theories. Of particular importance is&lt;br/&gt;the family parametrized by the stack of one-parameter formal Lie&lt;br/&gt;groups. The theory of stacks is vital here, as this allows us to&lt;br/&gt;study symmetries across continuous families of geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;-- especially when the self-symmetries can vary non-continuously&lt;br/&gt;throughout the family, as is most certainly the case here.</AbstractNarration>
