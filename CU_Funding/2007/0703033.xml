    <AbstractNarration>Ivy Tech Community College is partnering with Indiana University, industry, and a high school to improve biotechnology education at the secondary and community college levels, and increase the number of technicians available for employment in south-central Indiana's growing life sciences industry. The project is expanding Ivy Tech's biotechnology program by (1) developing new certificate programs in life science-related biotechnology, (2) building a pilot plant that provides students with realistic biotechnology job training experiences, (3) creating a Life Science Academy at a local high school to address gaps in high school students' math, communications, and scientific thinking skills, and (4) providing teachers at the high school with professional development. Target populations include high school students, community college students, displaced workers, and college students living in a rural region of Indiana.</AbstractNarration>
