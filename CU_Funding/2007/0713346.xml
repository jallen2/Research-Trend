    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop an adaptable multi-functional end effector for a micro robotic manipulation system. The end effector will be able to sense a micro contact force at an unprecedented accuracy and dynamic range, and to on-line regulate the both micro contact force and position. This research will provide a solution for the long outstanding problem in micro force sensing, i.e. solving the conflict between the sensitivity and dynamic range. The approach is based on measuring the rate of the micro force instead of directly measuring the force itself, and obtaining the force information via real-time data processing. As a result, highly accurate force measurements can be obtained without imposing any limitation on the dynamic range of the sensor. This research will also provide the theoretical foundation and implementation scheme for the application of the infinite dimensional system theory to the hybrid force/position control in micromanipulation. The results of this project will lead to the development of an efficient and effective micro robotic manipulation system for the automation in the assembly of micro sensors, actuators and other devices, and micro injection and manipulation in biomedical research and applications.</AbstractNarration>
