    <AbstractNarration>Computing systems and applications are evolving towards more sophisticated modes of operation, higher levels of abstraction, and larger scales of execution. These trends challenge the state of technology for modeling realistic workloads on sufficiently detailed hardware or system simulators. Computer system designers traditionally rely on simulation experiments to evaluate properties (such as performance, energy consumption, and thermal characteristics) of proposed designs. Unfortunately, growing system complexity renders many traditional simulation-based approaches woefully inefficient or obsolete. The bottom line is that computer designs and workloads have grown sufficiently complex that modeling them fully in detail is utterly intractable.&lt;br/&gt;Researchers and practitioners lack the necessary tools to understand the many interactions of diverse hardware components and software requirements, and thus there is no assurance that coarse-scale modeling of large design spaces is sufficient to identify design points representing the most important tradeoffs for any given system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research attacks the problem of exponential design space and configuration space exploration via an automated approach that builds accurate, confident, and predictive models. Sample points in the design space are simulated, and the results are used to teach the models the function describing relationships among design/configuration parameters. The models produce highly accurate predicted results for other points in the space, can be queried to predict impacts of parameter changes, and are very fast compared to simulation, enabling efficient discovery of tradeoffs among parameters in different regions. The research agenda includes investigating ways to reduce the number of sample points required to develop accurate predictive models, applying the approach to new hardware design spaces, and using predictive modeling to jointly configure software workloads together with the hardware on which they run.</AbstractNarration>
