    <AbstractNarration>The Center for Research on Invasive Species and Small Populations (CRISSP) at the University of Idaho (UI) is hosting undergraduate students for a summer of research, learning, and exploration. CRISSP is a multidisciplinary center that focuses on two areas of pressing regional and global concern: 1) threats posed by invasive species to natural and agricultural resources; and 2) conservation challenges confronting small or declining populations of native species. During a 9-week summer internship, successful applicants will be immersed in the union of natural resources ecology and technology. Each REU student will work with a faculty mentor to design and conduct an independent component within the faculty research program. REU students will have access to modern research facilities including the Laboratory of Conservation and Ecological Genetics, the new Reveley Geospatial Education and Research Complex, the Idaho Stable Isotopes Laboratory, and the Diagnostic and Invasive Plant Mapping Laboratory. Other activities will include seminars and discussions on scientific methods, critical thinking, and preparation graduate for school and careers in the natural sciences. Students will participate in a weekend raft trip that will include exploration of environmental ethics as well as the cultural and natural resources of the Salmon River. Participants will receive a stipend and allowance for housing and subsistence. Motivated students, especially Native Americans and others from groups that are under-represented in the sciences, are encouraged to apply.
