    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0705284&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kefeng Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moduli spaces have played fundamental roles in many subjects of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics from geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, to number&lt;br/&gt;theory. String duality from string theory has motivated many deep&lt;br/&gt;mathematical results and theories. The principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;proposes to have an intensive study on applying localization method&lt;br/&gt;combined with other newly developed geometric techniques to solve&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems arisen from string duality about the geometry&lt;br/&gt;and topology of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and stable maps.&lt;br/&gt;There are several specific problems that we hope to solve under the&lt;br/&gt;support of the proposed research grant, these include the general&lt;br/&gt;recursion formulas for intersection numbers of general tautological&lt;br/&gt;classes which include the Faber conjecture &lt;br/&gt;as special case, the Virasoro conjecture for general projective manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;the understanding of topology, algebraic geometry of moduli spaces,&lt;br/&gt;and the computing of the holomorphic anomaly by using our geometric&lt;br/&gt;results about moduli spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interactions of mathematics and physics have motivated many &lt;br/&gt;fundamental advances in both disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;String Theory, as the most promising candidate for the grand&lt;br/&gt;unification of all fundamental forces in the nature, should include&lt;br/&gt;all previous theories like the Yang-Mills and the Chern-Simons&lt;br/&gt;theory. String duality which identifies different theories in string&lt;br/&gt;theory has produced many surprisingly beautiful mathematical&lt;br/&gt;formulas about the geometry and topology of moduli spaces of Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. The mathematical proofs of many of these conjectural&lt;br/&gt;formulas depend crucially on localization techniques. This program&lt;br/&gt;will not only help verify important physical theories, but also&lt;br/&gt;produce beautiful and fundamental mathematics. In carrying out the&lt;br/&gt;project we will also train several young students and post-doctors to conduct research in&lt;br/&gt;these subjects through collaboration and lectures.</AbstractNarration>
