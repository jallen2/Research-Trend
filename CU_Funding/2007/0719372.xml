    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports Professor Karen Goldberg at the University of Washington to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of fundamental organometallic reactions that have potential application in the selective catalytic transformations of hydrocarbons to functionalized organics. Through investigations of selected model reactions, the critical variables for these reactions steps will be identified. Information concerning specific coordination environments, metal and ancillary ligand options, substrate requirements and reaction conditions that favor particular reaction steps will be delineated. Proposed investigations of C-H bond activation by Pt(II)/Pd(II) complexes, of reductive elimination from Pt(IV) complexes, of reactions of Pt and Pd alkyls with molecular oxygen, of the reactivity of five-coordinate Pt(IV) complexes, of olefin insertion and -hydride elimination reactions at Pt(II), all have high intrinsic value in developing fundamental knowledge and establishing the foundations needed to pursue the rational development of effective organometallic catalysts for challenging organic transformations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of effective methodologies for the direct conversion of hydrocarbons to more versatile chemicals and the utilization of oxygen as an oxidant in such processes could fundamentally change practices in the chemical industry with the benefits of lower cost feedstocks and oxidant, lower energy consumption, lower capital costs with fewer reaction steps and product separations, and lower volume and less toxic waste production. In addition, the knowledge gained concerning the use of metals for the selective activation and conversion of C-H bonds into new C-C and C-X bonds and the use of molecular oxygen as an oxidant may provide organic chemists with novel options for application in the production of specialty chemicals and complex molecular syntheses of pharmaceuticals and organic materials. While working on this project, graduate students, postdoctoral associates and undergraduate students will study organometallic reactions and become highly skilled in advanced laboratory techniques and in the use of numerous analytical and spectroscopic methods.</AbstractNarration>
