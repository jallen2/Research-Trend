    <AbstractNarration>Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program funds a new advanced, spherical aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscope, which will be situated in the University of Michigan North Campus Electron Microbeam Analysis Laboratory. The instrument will have a resolution of 0.8 angstroms in the scanning transmission mode. It will enable researchers to determine chemistry, atomic structure, bonding characteristics, and three-dimensional imaging of materials at the true atomic level. Although it will be a critical instrument in the support of the wide range of nano-technology and energy research programs at the university, it will also operate as a resource for research institutions, both in industry and academia, in southeastern Michigan and the surrounding states. The instrument will have a 300 kV monochromated field emission gun and will have spherical aberration correction of the probe forming system. The imaging system will allow both scanning imaging and static beam imaging. In scanning imaging with a high angle annual dark field detector this microscope will allow atomic resolution imaging with atomic number contrast. Chemical analysis will be conducted by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, convergent beam electron diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program funds a new high resolution transmission electron microscope, an instrument that images extremely fine structure of material and is critical to successful nanotechnology and energy research in the University of Michigan and other research institutions in southeastern Michigan. In lieu of light, the transmission electron microscope uses a very high energy beam of electrons (300,000 volts) to probe the thin foils or particles of materials. The samples are so thin that 250 of them would be required to match the thickness of the average human hair. The imaging resolution of the new microscope will be higher than any previously located in Michigan. It will, for example, be able to image individual impurity atoms in the atomic lattices of silicon devices. The instrument will also be capable of performing chemical analyses of these samples, using what are known as spectroscopic techniques. Spectroscopy involves measuring the energy range of electrons or X-rays emitted by the sample when the high energy electron beam interacts with it. The instrument will allow researchers in the region to compete globally in research in nanotechnology, energy related materials and biological technologies. It will mean that research requiring materials characterization in Michigan will remain at the leading edge.</AbstractNarration>
