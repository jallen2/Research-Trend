    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this interdisciplinary research program is to provide student education through synthesis, characterization, and correlation studies of novel solids. The aim is to continue our efforts in combining traditional disciplines such as solid state chemistry, physics, and materials science, a goal set forth in the 2006 NSF Workshop Report on the Future Directions in Solid State Chemistry. The scope of this proposal covers emerging areas of solid state synthesis in exploring novel composite solids via recently developed salt-inclusion chemistry. The content of this proposed project covers a broad range of fundamental inorganic chemistry, including synthesis, structure, bonding, electronic structure, and materials chemistry. Compound characterizations will be directed toward revealing and understanding the bond strength, redox chemistry, band structures, and the formation of salt-inclusion frameworks exhibiting unusual structural and physical properties. This research is important for its potential to provide invaluable knowledge toward the ultimate synthesis of solid state materials for applications in the next generation devices such as battery and hydrogen storage. We anticipate significant participation from scientifically-skilled researchers in both domestic and international communities to make a timely impact on the advancement of materials research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research is designed to nurture and train students to meet the need of globally prepared researchers. The aim is to continue our efforts in combining traditional disciplines such as chemistry, physics, and materials science, a goal set forth in the 2006 NSF Workshop Report on the Future Directions in Solid State Chemistry. The scope of this proposal covers emerging areas of advanced materials research for applications in the next generation devices, particularly in energy-related areas such as battery and hydrogen storage. The PI will continue to establish partnerships in research and education with students and faculty from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions, Appalachian State and Miami (Ohio) Universities in this case, and those serving underrepresented groups. The proposed research program also includes collaborations at national and international facilities, which give research participants ample opportunities to work in different science and engineering labs. Young scientists trained at the interface of multidisciplinary areas would be a highly desirable outcome of such endeavors. This funded research will facilitate the needs for educating more scientists to pursue careers in areas allied to materials science and engineering, thus enhancing the skill base in areas of vital importance to the US economy.</AbstractNarration>
