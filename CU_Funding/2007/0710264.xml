    <AbstractNarration>Stream restoration efforts in the US have greatly increased in recent decades, but rigorous evaluations of their ecological impacts remain rare. One common stream restoration approach is reintroduction of large wood that has been systematically removed in association with forest logging. Large wood in streams creates habitat and retains food resources (i.e., organic matter) for stream food webs. To experimentally test if large wood addition increases organic matter retention following storms, organic matter inputs and outputs will be quantified in paired 100-meter reaches with and without added wood, in three restored streams. Whole-stream nutrient demand, which integrates the biological activity of stream microbes and algae, will be quantified as a response variable. Results will provide insight into long-term efficacy of wood addition as a stream restoration tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental disturbances (e.g. storms, fires, and droughts) play a significant role in structuring biological communities for time periods long after their occurrence. Therefore, as scientists and land managers implement ecosystem restoration strategies, it is critical that we understand how restoration will interact with environmental disturbance. Results from this study will assist private and public entities involved in stream restoration activities, in refining and improving their approaches, furthering the success of sustainable, long-lasting restoration strategies.</AbstractNarration>
