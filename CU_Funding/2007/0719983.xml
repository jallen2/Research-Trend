    <AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Veena Das, graduate student Joseph Andrew Bush will undertake a study of secularism and political critique in a Muslim society. His research will be carried on in the Kurdish city of Suleimani, Iraq. This is a suitable site for the research because the city has a long tradition of Kurdish poets who identify themselves as Muslims, but strive to become non-practicing Muslims by separating themselves from some Islamic traditions. They use poetry and prose articles in newspapers to ply their critique of social norms that others defend as Islamic traditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bush will use a combination of qualitative, ethnographic research methods. He will interview employees at three Kurdish media institutions; collect critical prose documents from archives; carry out intensive participant observations with a select group of Kurdish poets; attend and observe conferences; and do a content analysis of school textbooks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is important because it will be one of the first social science studies of how secularism is practiced and maintained in a Muslim society. It will contribute significantly to the education of a social scientist who also is learning two critical languages, Arabic and Kurdish, in order to carry out the research.</AbstractNarration>
