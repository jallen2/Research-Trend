    <AbstractNarration>In this grant supplement to encourage collaboration with Japanese researchers in cyber security, Professor Nirwan Ansari from New Jersey Institute of Technology and Professor Nei Kato from Tohoku University will study these topics that are important for securing next generation networks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Network attack detection technology for next generation networks,&lt;br/&gt;(2) Energy efficient secure sensor networks, and&lt;br/&gt;(3) New security technology combined with QoS control scheme&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next generation networks are defined in this project as consisting not only the traditional fixed networks but also cellular networks, ad-hoc networks, sensor networks, and even satellite networks. Eventually all communications, e.g., data and voice, will be conveyed on next generation networks; yet, these networks and their usage introduce considerable heterogeneity into networking, which makes difficult seamlessly and securely interconnecting these different networks. In particular, security issues encountered in one type of network are intertwined with those of other networks, thus creating many complicated and difficult issues. Conventional methods are not enough cope with these challenges in next generation networks; new approaches and new concepts are needed.</AbstractNarration>
