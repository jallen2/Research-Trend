    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for award DMS-0701029 of Matthias Flach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the project is to define and study a new Grothendieck&lt;br/&gt;topology (the "Weil-etale topology") in connection with special&lt;br/&gt;values of Hasse-Weil L-functions of varieties over number fields&lt;br/&gt;(the "Tamagawa Number conjecture"). The idea of such a topology, as&lt;br/&gt;well as a first definition, is due to Lichtenbaum who also shows the&lt;br/&gt;expected relationship to the L-function in the simplest case of a&lt;br/&gt;zero-dimensional variety. However, truncation of the complex&lt;br/&gt;computing Weil-etale cohomology is necessary because in even degrees&lt;br/&gt;greater than two the cohomology group is nonvanishing and of&lt;br/&gt;infinite rank. One goal of the project would be to redefine the Weil&lt;br/&gt;etale topos of the ring of integers of a number field so that it has&lt;br/&gt;bounded cohomology as well as a number of other properties such as a&lt;br/&gt;map to the etale topos and to the classifying topos of the real&lt;br/&gt;numbers. A second goal is to find a definition of the Weil etale&lt;br/&gt;topos for higher dimensional arithmetic schemes of characteristic&lt;br/&gt;zero (the case of finite characteristic is already well understood&lt;br/&gt;due to work of Lichtenbaum and Geisser). A third, more speculative&lt;br/&gt;goal would be to reprove the analytic class number formula using the&lt;br/&gt;Weil-etale topology with the aim of generalizing it to Artin&lt;br/&gt;L-functions. One interesting aspect of this project is the&lt;br/&gt;interaction of topos theory and logic with more classical and well&lt;br/&gt;established number theory, such as the analytic class number&lt;br/&gt;formula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diophantine equations and their solutions have occupied the&lt;br/&gt;imagination of mathematically interested people for centuries but&lt;br/&gt;they also have found real world applications in coding theory.&lt;br/&gt;Modern mathematics provides a bewildering array of techniques,&lt;br/&gt;ranging from the disarmingly simple to the highly abstract, to study&lt;br/&gt;diophantine equations. The geometric perspective, viewing the&lt;br/&gt;solution set as a "space", has been particularly useful. The project&lt;br/&gt;aims to contribute to this line of thought by defining and studying&lt;br/&gt;a new cohomology theory for diophantine equations.</AbstractNarration>
