    <AbstractNarration>Tissue engineering from bio-nanocomposites embodies the creation of a scaffold structure that has the appropriate physical, chemical, and mechanical properties to enable tissue formation in three dimensions. The objective of this project is to develop new bio-nanocomposite materials with anisotropic structure, biocompatibility and biodegradable pathways for advanced materials such as tissue scaffolds and artificial skins. The tissue engineered bio-nanocomposite materials that will be developed, are oriented hybrid composites incorporating chitosan-type biopolymer and the degradable synthetic clay Laponite. Polymer-clay hydrogels will be used as the scaffold material that is dried on one side producing a density gradient and a thin polymer clay film to the outside. To characterize such a material the outside polymer clay film zone, the concentration gradient zone and the inside hydrogel zone will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal addresses issues of synthesis, morphology, structure and properties relevant to the design of novel scaffold materials. Several techniques such as microscopy, scattering and rheology will effectively elucidate the structural features and physical properties of the bio-nanocomposite materials. The challenge of this proposal is to combine disciplines such as chemistry, materials science, and bio-engineering to provide new technology and fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of synergistic biopolymer-nanoclay interactions while controlling cellular behavior through the design of bio-nanocomposite scaffolds. This work may lead to general principles and predictions for future design of bio-nanocomposite materials. In spite of many efforts to create tissue from inorganic and organic components critical performance deficiencies remain when it comes to biodegradable soft scaffolds with anisotropic nano-structure that can be used as an artificial skin.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research and educational program is to train students in the interdisciplinary areas of polymers, bio-engineering and materials science while improving their laboratory and communications skills for a career of discovery in academia, entrepreneurship, national and international laboratories or industry. One aim of this project is to create a partnership between industry, governmental laboratories and Louisiana State University. The most fundamental part of the proposed research involves neutron scattering experiments that will mainly be performed at the NIST Center for Neutron Research, at HIFR, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and at the Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble, France. Plans are described to host graduate students at German and French laboratories. The goal is that the student will gain an appreciation for the resources available, and this experience will teach them how to collaborate with other scientists. Some of the discovery based experiments described in the educational plan will build on and extend resources that are already available at LSU and can be integrated into science education for disadvantaged youngsters and underrepresented minority students in local communities. For example, the video-based technology "scope on a rope" applied to materials science has proven to be an invaluable aid to undergraduate teaching and K-12 outreach. The typical application is to biological systems (pond water) but the same technology, with some improvements, can be used to elevate student awareness of and interest in bio-materials. Quite a few of the undergraduate science and non-science majors the PI will be teaching become K-12 teachers and can take with them the tools provided. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
