    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I proposal seeks to develop a fast tuning, MEMS optical filter based on whispering gallery mode micro-resonators. As internet traffic continues to grow and broadband applications become more widespread, the need for efficient dense optical networks becomes greater. The proposed filter technology offers the potential for rapid access to the numerous spectral channels employed in dense optical networks while minimizing the cross-talk between channels. This technology will aid in meeting the bandwidth needs as video communications and on-demand services continue their rapid growth. The Phase I research will model key characteristics of the tunable micro-resonator optical filter, addressing key concerns of bandwidth limitations, tuning rate, coupling efficiency, and signal integrity, while performing preliminary measurements using micro-fabricated devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid growth of broadband applications in recent years will soon strain the ability to efficiently and rapidly disseminate information, which can be remedied by the addition of more bandwidth. The proposed tunable optical filter technology employs a unique means for improving the ability to access channels in optical networks, thereby facilitating an ease in the nation's information bottleneck. The proposed core technology has numerous applications in commercial venues, and widespread implications for the nation's optical network backbone.</AbstractNarration>
