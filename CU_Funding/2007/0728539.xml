    <AbstractNarration>The Infinity Scholars project provides financial assistance, academic support, and career exploration to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students who are in STEM transfer or related career-focused degree programs. The goals of the project are to (a) improve educational opportunities for students interested in STEM careers; (b) increase student retention to degree achievement; (c) increase the impact of student support for students enrolled in STEM disciplines; and (d) ultimately increase the numbers of well educated and skilled employees in STEM fields. Creating a learning community and providing tools for success are accomplished through project activities. All participants complete a job shadow and/or internship experience during the freshman year and complete a capstone experience during the sophomore year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Research-based retention strategies and project activities provide participants with the academic and career exploration support necessary to successfully transfer to a university or transition to the workforce. The project team is partnering with the Institutional Research Office at the college to track similarities and disconnects between participants in the cohort group and a control group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is developing internship opportunities, job shadow experiences, and capstone activities. National employment demand for two-year degree STEM graduates drives this project, and local industry partners have opportunities for these students. Alignment of curricular competencies and strengthening articulations with neighboring transfer universities provide students pursuing a four-year degree with a seamless transition. Blending academic and support services though project strategies increase retention and serve as a replicable model for other colleges.</AbstractNarration>
