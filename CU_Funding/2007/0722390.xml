    <AbstractNarration>Cooperative motion is widely accepted as being important for dynamics of glass-forming&lt;br/&gt;liquids, yet the length scales over which cooperative motion occurs are poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt;Experiments are proposed and computer simulations to address cooperative motion in polymers.&lt;br/&gt;While cooperative motion is thought to be important for the dynamics of all liquids&lt;br/&gt;near their glass transition, polymers o.er some unique opportunities for probing cooperative&lt;br/&gt;motion. Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations will be utilized to directly measure&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of sizes and shapes of cooperatively relaxed regions, with an emphasis&lt;br/&gt;on determining measures that can be applied to real experiments. Dielectric experiments&lt;br/&gt;measuring the distribution of segmental relaxation times in miscible polymer blends will&lt;br/&gt;be used to estimate the temperature dependence of the cooperative size, for each blend&lt;br/&gt;component. Experiments that systematically vary polymer structure (chain length and side&lt;br/&gt;groups) will also provide less direct measures of the temperature dependence of cooperative&lt;br/&gt;size in single-component polymer melts. Rheology experiments and Molecular Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;simulations will explore the connection between segmental dynamics and chain dynamics, in&lt;br/&gt;parallel studies. This connection will allow our models for segmental dynamics in miscible&lt;br/&gt;blends to be extended to predict the terminal dynamics, including the blend viscosity, with&lt;br/&gt;no additional parameters. The intellectual merit of this research will be an improved understanding&lt;br/&gt;of dynamics in polymers and their miscible blends, with particular emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;the role of cooperative motion and the connection between segmental and chain dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research are threefold. On the one hand, the model&lt;br/&gt;of miscible blend rheology will find immediate pragmatic use in the plastics industry, where&lt;br/&gt;polymer blends are vital for plastics recycling and for metals replacement in the transportation&lt;br/&gt;industry. The latter enables weight to be reduced without sacrificing strength, thereby&lt;br/&gt;saving fuel. Simultaneously, understanding of cooperative motion will have far-reaching&lt;br/&gt;consequences in developing an understanding of liquid state dynamics that goes far beyond&lt;br/&gt;polymers. And finally the proposed research will create learning opportunities for graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate students. In addition to the involvement of both undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students in the experimental research, the PIs make extensive use of their growing&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of polymer physics in recruiting, advising and teaching at both the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>
