    <AbstractNarration>A broad-based, international conference entitled 'Extending a Continent: Architecture, Rheological Coupling and Heat Budget' is being held October 9-13, 2007 on the Island of Naxos in Greece. The urgency for this conference in this field is borne of two recent technological innovations that bear strongly on future research directions. These include (1) high precision geodetic studies of active extension, and (2) the development of computational speed that permits two and three-dimensional physical modeling of rift systems with fully coupled elastic, viscous and plastic rheologies. The goals of the conference are to: (1) review and synthesize current knowledge about continental extension processes; (2) examine the geologic and geophysical evidence relevant to resolving a quantitative understanding of the important tectonic processes, as deduced from seismic imaging, metamorphic and magmatic petrology, isotopic thermochronlogy, structural and kinematic analysis, synorogenic stratigraphy, geomorphology, and paleoelevation data; (3) examine relevant geodynamic models and their predictions for conditions that might trigger the onset of continental extension; and (4) reconcile new geodetic data and computational geodynamics inferences on rheological coupling within the lithosphere with genuine structural observation of these processes. The conference will foster international collaboration in research as well as support of students, early career scientists, and scientists from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
