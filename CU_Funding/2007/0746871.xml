    <AbstractNarration>0746871&lt;br/&gt;Yu&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop next generation signal processing algorithms and to produce manpower to realize the full potential of massive arrays for high-speed and high-field MRI. Specifically, novel RF pulse design methods and image reconstruction algorithms will be developed and integrated with an existing advanced array system and computing environment to enable ultrafast imaging at a high-field strength (4.7 Tesla). This project will be built upon the preliminary work by the PI in large-array parallel imaging at one of the world's leading laboratories in this field. In addition, multidisciplinary collaborations with academic, industrial, and clinical experts have been formed to provide resources to support this research. To maximize the productivity and benefits of the research and related discoveries, this project will educate undergraduate and graduate students for MRI research through an innovative "Peer Instruction" method and exchange program with collaborators' labs. Furthermore, it will promote MR engineering research among a diverse group of students through collaboration with an NIH/NSF-supported K-12 outreach program.</AbstractNarration>
