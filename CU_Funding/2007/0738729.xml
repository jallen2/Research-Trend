    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for the National Academy of Science (NAS) to conduct a study to investigate the role of underrepresented groups in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, and explore their contribution in keeping the US innovative and competitive in a global society. The work will be performed by an expert committee, under the oversight of the NAS' Policy and Global Affairs Division's Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP), charged with addressing and formulating recommendations that: 1) identify key and social institutional barriers that shape and influence the decisions of underrepresented students and those barriers that impede full participation, 2) analyze the rate of change and the challenges currently encountered in the development of a strong and diverse workforce; 3) identify best practices and those characteristics that make these practices sustainable and effective; and 4) develop a prioritized list of policy and funding action items with milestones that will lead to a science and engineering workforce that reflects the nation's diverse population. Results from the study should aid in the nation's quest to successfully tap into the wealth of the diverse STEM talent and resources available to the country, which will ensure a robust and competitive US economy for the future.</AbstractNarration>
