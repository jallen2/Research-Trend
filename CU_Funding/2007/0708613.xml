    <AbstractNarration>The principle goal of this proposal is to build a reconfigurable Optical Burst Switching (OBS) testbed that integrates the world's first commercial optical burst switch with a reconfigurable control plane. The insights and experiences obtained from the testbed will be of great value in developing the OBS network into a commercially viable solution for the next generation Internet. The key aspects of the proposed testbed are summarized as W4:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the proposed testbed ? An OBS testbed utilizing commercially available EtherBurst Optical switches and FPGA based reconfigurable control plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who can benefit from the proposed testbed ? The testbed will benefit the PI, as well as the OBS research community by allowing remote users to run real experiments using a remote laboratory interface. It also encourages students and industrial participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why an OBS testbed is in need ? Theoretical and simulation based analysis cannot fully capture the characteristics of real traffic, which has non-negligible impact on the performance of the OBS network. In addition, simulation will not address the practical implementation issues in building ultra high speed OBS routers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When can the proposed testbed be in operation ?The testbed can be in operation after initial configuration. Dynamically reconfigurable control plane is deployed incrementally over a working system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed testbed will enable research projects that are not feasible otherwise. In addition, the proposed testbed can be potentially made available to OBS research community worldwide through a Remote Laboratory Interface (RLI) developed through the NSF funded Open Network Laboratory (ONL) project.</AbstractNarration>
