    <AbstractNarration>Mobile ad-hoc communication is starting to find real-world applications beyond its military origins, in areas such as vehicular communications and delay tolerant networking. As the RF spectrum is getting saturated by recent advances in wireless communications, enabling optical spectrum in wireless communications is the needed revolution for ultra-high-speed mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) of the future. This project explores the potential for free-space-optics (FSO) in the context of very-high-speed mobile ad-hoc and opportunistic networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project introduces basic building blocks for MANETs using FSO and prototypes multi-hop high-capacity FSO building blocks and protocols operating under high mobility. 3-d spherical structures covered with inexpensive FSO transceivers (e.g., VCSEL and photo-detector pair) solve issues relevant to mobility and line-of-sight (LOS) management via availability of several transceivers per node. Such structures facilitate electronic LOS tracking (i.e., ?electronic steering?) methods instead of traditional mechanical steering techniques. The project also investigates reliability protocols as management of logical datastreams through multi-interface FSO structures pose a major challenge. By abstracting FSO directionality and LOS characteristics, the project explores issues relating to routing and localization, and develops layer 3 protocols and FSO-MANET demonstration in a lab setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Results of this research can revolutionize the MANET technologies by enabling optical spectrum. FSO has been used at high-altitude communications, and this project enables FSO communications at lower-altitudes and in ad-hoc settings. This research will provide a new application for solid-state lighting technology due to potential integration of illumination and communication functions. Other impact areas include: sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks leveraging directional overlay protocols, and military wireless applications such as UAV/aircraft airborne networks and inter-ship communications.</AbstractNarration>
