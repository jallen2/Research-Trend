    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education on strongly correlated electron materials and quantum criticality. Phases of quantum matter can have unique counterintuitive properties, such as superfluids which can flow without viscosity, and superconductors which exhibit electric conduction without dissipation. Quantum mechanics plays an essential role in such materials as high-temperature superconductors and many others that continue to be discovered.&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to study a variety of quantum phases that can exist in such materials. Quantum criticality is another focus of this resesarch; its effects can be felt at experimentally measurable temperatures. Through these studies the PI aims to contribute to understanding the unusual properties exhibited by many of these materials, some having potential technological applications. The research will also help to develop reliable theoretical tools for the study of other more diverse complex systems. These are based on the observation that a phase of matter extends over a phase domain where typically much of the domain contains only a small number of coupled degrees of freedom. Therefore, to understand phases of matter, it is not necessary to treat systems with infinite correlation length (technically a very difficult task), as at a critical point, but it is sufficient to treat systems with short correlation lengths, and there are powerful methods available for this purpose. The exact properties of such local regions or small clusters can be fond using computers, and then analytical tools can be used to understand how these local regions are coupled in a solid. Similarly, by judiciously choosing the effective Hamiltonian, one can make a relevant phase more accessible to analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work involve training graduate students to assume leadership roles in academic and industrial environments, not only by mentoring students at the home institution, but also by encouraging them to attend professional meetings, where they can present results of their research activities and exchange ideas with others in the field. During the past grant period one woman graduate student got her Ph.D. and an effort will be made to recruit more minorities. Plans are underway to incorporate research activities into a modern graduate textbook in condensed matter physics and to use the web for effective outreach for graduate level education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education that focuses on understanding the unusual properties and phenomena associated with classes of materials in which electrons interact strongly with each other. These materials include the high temperature superconductors. A partcular focus of this research is a phenomenon called quantum criticality which is related to the fundamental problem of how matter collectively organizes itself into distinct phases. A block of ice is as distinct as it can be from a cup of water, although the fundamental constituents, the water molecules, are identical. When water is cooled below the temperature 273.15 K or 0.C, a transformation occurs where water turns into ice. An even more spectacular phenomenon which has become cutting edge research in condensed matter physics is a transformation among phases that can take place at the absolute zero of temperature. In this case, a physical variable, like magnetic field strength, atomic separation, or degree of disorder, plays a role analogous to that of temperature in the example of water to ice. A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics provides the driving force of the transition. The PI will develop theoretical techniques to better understand quantum phase transformations and how they might lead to exciting new phenomena, like high temperature superconductivity, or unusual properties of complex materials. These contribute to the foundations of future device and materials technologies. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work involve training graduate students to assume leadership roles in academic and industrial environments, not only by mentoring students at the home institution, but also by encouraging them to attend professional meetings, where they can present results of their research activities and exchange ideas with others in the field.
