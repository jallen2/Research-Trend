    <AbstractNarration>Judit Hersko (0739888)&lt;br/&gt;Shifting Baselines: Antarctica&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Shifting Baselines Antarctica" is a multifaceted project conceived by artist, Judit Hersko that will bring the Antarctic experience to viewers both, nationally and internationally in gallery, museum, and classroom settings. The project will include multimedia installations, artist books and a web project. The proposed work builds on a previous collaboration between the artist and an biological oceanographer conducting Antarctic researh. "Shifting Baselines Antarctica" will follow the research of the biological oceanographer and other scientists at McMurdo station and at the same time investigate the perceptual and physiological effects of Antarctica on human beings. Specific themes identified by the artist include climate change, the Antarctic landscape and human perception, and nature and culture in Antarctica. The final project will culminate in a room-sized, multi-media installation designed to recreate phenomena such as whiteouts, Fata Morgana and ice caves. The installation will surround viewers with light and temperature conditions, sounds and air movements typical of the experiences; mimicking the Antarctic impact on the senses. The project will also examine the cultural landscape that humans create in order to turn unfamiliar space into a place of memory and home. Installations related to this will take the form of 17th century Cabinet of Curiosities. Ms. Hersko envisions that the duality of specific, measurable scientific detail and the majestic mysterious experiences of the landscape will embody her artistic installations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artist considers this project as part of a larger initiative aimed at increasing scientific literacy through art. Different facets of the project will have a range of outcomes as part of her larger art and science initiative, which has already gained momentum. Ms. Hersko actively collaborates with science faculty at California State San Marcos where she brings art and science together in the classroom. Her goal of devoting her artistic process more directly to the communication of scientific information through art allows her to reach audiences beyond that of the traditional art viewing public.</AbstractNarration>
