    <AbstractNarration>Promislow&lt;br/&gt;0708804&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator analyses the mathematical underpinnings of a&lt;br/&gt;novel Conductive Polymer Electrolyte (CPE) model for phase&lt;br/&gt;separation and ion transport in polymer electrolyte solutions. &lt;br/&gt;An exothermic acid-solvent reaction leads to an interfacial&lt;br/&gt;energy that decreases with increasing surface area but grows with&lt;br/&gt;the curvature of the interface. The family of gradient flows&lt;br/&gt;associated to the interfacial energy are compelling fourth and&lt;br/&gt;sixth order extensions of the familiar Allen-Cahn and&lt;br/&gt;Cahn-Hilliard operators with rich new structure. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator rigorously derives sharp interface limits for the&lt;br/&gt;gradient flows associated with pore formation. The exclusion&lt;br/&gt;potential that separates the protonic defects from the anions&lt;br/&gt;generates a novel equilibrium charge distribution within the&lt;br/&gt;phase separated membrane, modifying the classic Gouy-Chapmann&lt;br/&gt;diffusive double layer. A multiscale analysis of the elliptic&lt;br/&gt;equations governing the charge distribution quantifies the impact&lt;br/&gt;of the exclusion potential on the structure of the electrostatic&lt;br/&gt;double layer, and the impact of the electrostatic pressure upon&lt;br/&gt;the phase separation. The solvent pore network within the&lt;br/&gt;polymer electrolyte is a novel high-contrast conductive composite&lt;br/&gt;media. For local minimizers of the phase separation arising from&lt;br/&gt;interfacial and electrostatic energies, the investigator exploits&lt;br/&gt;the high contrast afforded by the permittivity and exclusion&lt;br/&gt;potential to derive the effective conductivity of polymer&lt;br/&gt;network. This entails asymptotic analysis of the saddle point&lt;br/&gt;structure of charge distribution at channel junctions and&lt;br/&gt;development of a variational characterization of the effective&lt;br/&gt;protonic conductivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer electrolytes are comprised of long hydrophobic polymers&lt;br/&gt;(essentially Teflon) with short acidic side-chains attached, like&lt;br/&gt;a single pole ladder. They form a rich structure that phase&lt;br/&gt;separates in the presence of water, forming intricate nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;geometries lined with pendant acid groups and filled with charged&lt;br/&gt;fluid. Such structures are the workhorses of ion transport,&lt;br/&gt;generating the selectivity of ion channels in cell membranes, the&lt;br/&gt;complex biochemical processes that occur within the pores of&lt;br/&gt;lipid membranes, and the motivation of this project: the&lt;br/&gt;transport of charge within polymer electrolyte membranes of fuel&lt;br/&gt;cells. This project analyzes the mathematical underpinnings of a&lt;br/&gt;novel Conductive Polymer Electrolyte (CPE) model for phase&lt;br/&gt;separation and ion transport in polymer electrolyte solutions. &lt;br/&gt;The fundamental understanding of pore formation and ion&lt;br/&gt;conduction in these materials is essential to the development of&lt;br/&gt;high-temperature membranes for fuel cell vehicles. High&lt;br/&gt;temperature membranes are a key step in the transition to a&lt;br/&gt;hydrogen economy, as higher fuel cell operating temperatures will&lt;br/&gt;greatly reduce costs associated with platinum catalyst loading&lt;br/&gt;and radiative cooling of the engine.</AbstractNarration>
