    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to the University of Maryland at College Park, Leigh Abts, Principal Investigator, for the support of two Pre-Advanced Placement in Engineering Planning Workshops held on March 19, 2007 at the National Academy of Engineering, Washington, D.C. and April 18, 2007 at the University of Maryland at College Park. Each of these workshops hosted approximately 50 collaborators and experts (engineering and education faculty, middle and high school teachers, engineering association members, engineering practitioners, program evaluators, and policy makers) to form a consensus proposal to develop the first ever, College Board authorized Pre-Advanced Placement (Pre-AP) course of study in Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
