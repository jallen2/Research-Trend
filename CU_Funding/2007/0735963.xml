    <AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0354540/0354620&lt;br/&gt;Title: FRG-Collaborative Research: Heat equations and geometric&lt;br/&gt;flows in Riemannian and Kaehler geometry&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Bennett Chow, Lei Ni (U.C.S.D.)/ Gang Tian (M.I.T.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We propose to further developments related to Perelman's work on the&lt;br/&gt; Geometrization Conjecture, using Ricci flow through the space-time&lt;br/&gt; formulation, new gradient estimates and monotone quantities and their&lt;br/&gt; geometric applications, and to apply new techniques and applications&lt;br/&gt; based on the ideas of these methods and estimates with the aim of&lt;br/&gt; furthering the understanding of the following interconnected topics:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Uniformization of compact and noncompact Kaehler manifolds,&lt;br/&gt; combining Kaehler-Ricci flow and the study of holomorphic &lt;br/&gt;functions/sections.&lt;br/&gt; 2. Analysis of singularities, formulation of weak solutions, and flow past&lt;br/&gt; singularities for geometric evolution equations and the duality between&lt;br/&gt; the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow.&lt;br/&gt; 3. Study of harmonic/holomorphic functions, function theory, spectrum&lt;br/&gt; and the geometry of complete Riemannian/Kaehler manifolds.&lt;br/&gt; 4. Existence of Einstein and other canonical Riemannian metrics on &lt;br/&gt;manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Geometric evolution equations are powerful and central tools in the study&lt;br/&gt; of the global geometry and topology of manifolds. Recent work of Perelman&lt;br/&gt; on Hamilton's program for Ricci flow and its applications towards a &lt;br/&gt;possible&lt;br/&gt; solution to the Poincare and geometrization conjectures provides a timely&lt;br/&gt; and promising opportunity for a group effort on significant advancements&lt;br/&gt; in geometric analysis and related areas. The results from the project &lt;br/&gt;should&lt;br/&gt; lead to new advances in and connections between string/duality theory and&lt;br/&gt; renormalization group flow, Ricci flow, mean curvature flow and other&lt;br/&gt; geometric evolution equations, and may enhance the understanding of the&lt;br/&gt; homogeneity of the universe at large scales, as well as other areas in &lt;br/&gt;science.&lt;br/&gt; The project will enhance the understanding of geometric analysis, &lt;br/&gt;linear and&lt;br/&gt; nonlinear partial differential equations, algebraic geometry and &lt;br/&gt;mathematical&lt;br/&gt; physics.</AbstractNarration>
