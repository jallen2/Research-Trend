    <AbstractNarration>Plant and animal species exhibit an incredible diversity of form. Much of this morphological diversity is generated by genetic variation; however, the specific genetic modifications required to produce morphological variation are unknown in most cases. A comprehensive understanding of how diversity is produced requires determination of how differences in gene sequence alter trait form and function, as well as how natural selection acts upon the resulting variation. The fruit flies Drosophila mauritiana and Drosophila simulans have eyes that differ dramatically in size and shape. Through a combination of laboratory and field studies of these closely related species, the researchers propose (1) to identify genetic changes responsible for interspecific variation in eye size and shape, (2) to characterize the functional importance of variation in eye size and shape, and (3) to study the selective forces acting upon eye size and shape. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will improve understanding of how complex morphological traits evolve and why such traits differ between species. In addition, recent findings suggest that broad generalizations can be made from conclusions drawn from studies on model organisms such as Drosophila. Thus, findings from this study have the potential to be relevant for understanding the evolution of complex traits in other animal species and humans. This project will also allow the establishment of collaborations with two research labs in the UK; this association will allow the development of new research techniques such as the adaptation of software for analysis of complex traits in animals. Finally, an undergraduate student will be trained in research development and lab techniques and will have the opportunity to conduct independent research.</AbstractNarration>
