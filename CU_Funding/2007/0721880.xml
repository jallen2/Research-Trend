    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the PIs will focus on the emerging Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). Cross-layer design is strongly needed for such a network due to its two special features; dynamic spectrum availability and spectrum heterogeneity. Quite different from other well-studied wireless networks, such as mobile ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks, the major concerns of WMNs are throughput, fairness, and QoS support, instead of mobility support and power efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to conduct a comprehensive study on cross-layer optimization in DSA WMNs, and design protocols under the guidance of this cross-layer optimization. They will concentrate on the bottom four layers of the network stack and seek joint congestion control, routing, spectrum sharing, and power control solutions with the objective of maximizing throughput, achieving certain fairness, and providing QoS support. Furthermore, the research will be conducted under various network models including different interference models, different traffic models, and different fairness models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The INTELLECTUAL MERIT of the project includes (1) a unified mathematical model which precisely characterizes all important features and the formal formulations of the cross-layer optimization problems under different network models, (2) centralized and distributed algorithms for solving the optimization problems, and (3) a spectrum-aware routing protocol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BROADER IMPACT of the project includes (1) novel cross-layer schemes for emerging DSA WMNs, with impact on the advancement of information technology, (2) high quality publications and training of highly skilled students, and (3) possible impact on the standardization in IETF and IEEE for DSA wireless networks in the future.</AbstractNarration>
