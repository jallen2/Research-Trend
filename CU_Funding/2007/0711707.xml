    <AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative, integrated biochemical/genetic study of chitin metabolism in a pest species (red flour beetle) that is economically important, has a completely sequenced genome, and has a well-developed genetic toolkit for functional genomic follow-through. Chitin, a structural carbohydrate polymer, is an essential component of the insect cuticle (the equivalent of the skin) and also found in the lining of the midgut. Since chitin is not present in higher animals or plants, chitin metabolism represents an insect-selective target that can be exploited for specific control of pest insects without harm to those that are deemed beneficial. The recent completion of the sequencing of the beetle genome funded by NSF-NHGRI has enabled the identification of most if not all of the genes from this insect, which are important for chitin synthesis, modification and turnover. The functions of each of these genes will be analyzed by the technique of RNA interference (RNAi), which results in specific down-regulation of the products of selected genes. The morphological, physiological and developmental effects of RNAi experiments targeted towards individual genes of chitin metabolism will be determined and compared with the effects of selected "chitin inhibitors," which are commercially utilized for insect control. The proteins encoded by these target genes will also be purified and the effects of chitin inhibitors on their activities will be confirmed. The knowledge obtained from these studies will help identify novel target physiological processes for insect pest control purposes. This project will also help train post-graduate, graduate and undergraduate students in the field of insect functional genomics at an EPSCOR institution. Undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities and women will be encouraged to participate in our research both during the academic year and summer months. In particular, attempts will be made to recruit students from minority institutions utilizing the ongoing SUROP, McNair and NSF-REU programs.</AbstractNarration>
