    <AbstractNarration>The research of the investigator is on the timely study of the&lt;br/&gt;fluid dynamics of non-Newtonian fluid flows. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;will examine systematically the design and development of an efficient&lt;br/&gt;computational modelling package that can handle various&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic models of complex fluids and also a wide spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;physical parameters that have been elusive for conventional&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods. In addition to general algorithmic developments&lt;br/&gt;including the fast solution method like the multigrid methods, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator aims to study and understand proper mathematical&lt;br/&gt;models for a great variety of new physical phenomena arising in&lt;br/&gt;the area of experimental rheology. In particular, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;will tackle an important challenge of modelling a continual&lt;br/&gt;oscillation of falling sphere in worm-like micellar fluid flows.&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to the Newtonian fluid or the polymeric fluids, the&lt;br/&gt;falling sphere in a worm-like micellar fluid undergoes a continual&lt;br/&gt;and sustained oscillation as it falls. This part of the project&lt;br/&gt;will involve testing various macroscopic models that are relevant for&lt;br/&gt;the worm-like micellar fluids and will lead to identification of the right&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for a falling sphere experiment. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator will also address a mathematical foundation for&lt;br/&gt;the so-called high Weissenberg number problem. Despite recent&lt;br/&gt;significant progress, the successful computations are still&lt;br/&gt;confined to very restrictive size of the Weissenberg number for a&lt;br/&gt;large class of non-Newtonian fluid models including the well-known&lt;br/&gt;Oldroyd-B model. The investigator will implement the new numerical&lt;br/&gt;methods for the computer simulations of highly elastic fluid&lt;br/&gt;flows, namely, models with high Weissenberg number to simulate and&lt;br/&gt;understand another newly observed intriguing physical phenomenon,&lt;br/&gt;the elastic turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluids comprised of large macromolecules, known as non-Newtonian&lt;br/&gt;fluids or complex fluids, can generate many new physical&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon. Examples of non-Newtonian fluids can be found&lt;br/&gt;throughout our daily lives, including molten plastics,&lt;br/&gt;engine oils with polymeric additives, paints, and many biological&lt;br/&gt;fluids such as egg white and blood. The design, implementation,&lt;br/&gt;and the use of numerical methods for the computer simulation of&lt;br/&gt;such physical phenomena requires full grasp of non-Newtonian&lt;br/&gt;fluids and the results of the investigator's research are&lt;br/&gt;expected to have significant applications, for example in industry.&lt;br/&gt;Namely, a polymer engineer could perform elaborate&lt;br/&gt;Computer Aided Design (CAD) studies in which the link between the&lt;br/&gt;molecular architecture of the raw material and the final&lt;br/&gt;properties of the product would be established, at least&lt;br/&gt;qualitatively. Production problems would be predicted and&lt;br/&gt;partially overcome through improved design. One could also think&lt;br/&gt;of using an on-line computational rheology model in concert with&lt;br/&gt;appropriate control algorithms to provide for intelligent,&lt;br/&gt;physics-based process control techniques. There are many more&lt;br/&gt;opportunities that the investigator's research results&lt;br/&gt;could generate.</AbstractNarration>
