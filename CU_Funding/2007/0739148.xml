    <AbstractNarration>0739148&lt;br/&gt;Wolf&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) is to advance the application of engineering sciences and technology to medicine and biology, promote the profession, and provide global leadership for the benefit of its members and humanity by disseminating knowledge, setting standards, fostering professional development, and recognizing excellence. To support its mission, EMBS has been organizing annual conferences of the engineering in medicine and biology society for the past 28 years. Each year, this annual conference, which is the largest meeting of biomedical engineers in the world, attracts more than 2000 people including about 700 students presenting more than 1800 papers from all over the world. The student activities include a widely publicized and well-respected Student Paper Competition and meetings with pioneers and leaders in biomedical engineering, special symposiums and mentoring programs. In 2007, the 29th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC 2007) will be held at the Convention Center in Lyon, France in conjunction with the Biennial Conference of the French Society of Biological and Medical Engineering from August 23 through August 26, 2007. Approximately 100-150 papers are expected to be submitted to its Student Paper Competition. From these papers, fifteen finalists will be selected, through the use of an on-line review and judging system, to make final oral presentations during the conference. The EMBC Student Competition provides a forum where top-notch students are able to compete with other superlative students in a wide array of bioengineering disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Competition promotes not only education within bioengineering disciplines, but fosters the next generation of bioengineers by providing a unique opportunity to students to meet and network with the leading biomedical professionals and scientists in the world. In addition, the Competition plays a crucial role in recognizing the talents of women and minorities in the field of bioengineering.</AbstractNarration>
