    <AbstractNarration>Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) will serve as the host for the annual NSF Wireless Networking Principle Investigator (PI) meeting for 2007. Specifically, IIT and in particular the Wireless Network and Communications Research Center (WiNCom) will assist the National Science Foundation in the organization and successful operation of this PI Meeting involving the leading technologists and researchers contributing to the NSF wireless networking programs from across the nation. Special guest speakers from industry, government and the regulatory community will serve to enhance the dialog at the session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's meeting promises to be rich in new, exciting results in several areas of the wireless networks field. Significant contributions are anticipated from the projects directed to both better understand our spectrum limited world and to enhance the efficiency in its utilization. In the past few years the wireless research community, the regulatory agencies (FCC and NTIA), the defense community (and in particular DARPA) and the various industry players (service providers and equipment providers) have become acutely aware of the spectrum limitations that have bounded communication system to a specific frequency band with a pre-selected modulation scheme and associated communications stack. Significant progress in emerging technologies like Software Definable Radios (SDRs), and Cognitive Radios (CRs), will be reported by the PIs. Continuing progress and hopefully a few true breakthroughs are anticipated in other areas such as cross-layer communication protocols, smart antennas, and ad hoc and mesh architectures.</AbstractNarration>
