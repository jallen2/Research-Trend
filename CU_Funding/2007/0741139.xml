    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the feasibility of micro-fluidic zone melting, and the derivative concepts of both micro- and macro-scale continuous-flow zone refining. Zone refining is an established materials purification technique used in certain specialty applications, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing, but broader use is limited by cost and complexity. In microfluidic systems, the absence of turbulent and convective mixing, combined with the potential for rapid and precise temperature changes, presents an interesting new opportunity to expand the utility of zone melting techniques. In particular, zone refining can potentially provide new tools for sample concentration and purification, while zone leveling can provide a new tool for fluid mixing. Preliminary work has shown that these techniques can be extended to developing zone refining methods applicable for microfluidic systems, including a prototype flow-through zone refining system. The design of this system does not depend on fundamental phenomena particular to microfluidic systems, and it appears possible to scale it up to provide a simplified continuous-flow zone refining capability for industrial-scale applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts (commercial potential) of this technology would result in the development of a new tool set that would greatly extend the capability of microfluidic devices. The ultimate goal of this project is to incorporate a complete biological procedure on a practical, low-cost self-contained device that is small enough to be easily portable, yet still contain the reagents and functions needed to accommodate complex applications such as those for molecular diagnostics. The increasing complexity of molecular diagnostic tests and the pressure to provide cost effective point-of-care assays will continue to increase the demand for such systems. The societal impact of this technology will be substantial cost reduction, more accurate and consistent results, and improved health care resulting from more rapid and specific treatment. In addition, successful development of a macroscopic continuous-flow zone refining capability will lead to improved efficiency in fields as diverse as pharmaceutical production and food processing.</AbstractNarration>
