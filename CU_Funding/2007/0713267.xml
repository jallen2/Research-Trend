    <AbstractNarration>Declarative, database-style models for programming distributed applications &lt;br/&gt;are becoming widely adopted, in a variety of realms ranging from sensors &lt;br/&gt;to publish-subscribe to network state management. They free the developer&lt;br/&gt;to define high-level queries for the specific data of interest,&lt;br/&gt;without regard to details about data sources, communications protocols,&lt;br/&gt;or synchronization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this approach to programming gains momentum, there is increasing need&lt;br/&gt;to abstract low-level stream data source variations away under a uniform&lt;br/&gt; representation, i.e., a view; and to integrate, i.e., conjoin, different &lt;br/&gt;types of stream data from large numbers of sources. Such tasks involve&lt;br/&gt;much more distributed communication and coordination than in traditional&lt;br/&gt;distributed databases or even data stream management systems. &lt;br/&gt;It becomes essential to do in-network computation of the query, &lt;br/&gt;and to optimize the processing of each stream (or few streams) separately, &lt;br/&gt;in a way that considers the topology of the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops the technologies to support integration of data streams, &lt;br/&gt;including languages for stream schema mappings, focusing on issues relating&lt;br/&gt;to combining distributed messages and maintaining timing information;&lt;br/&gt;techniques for rapidly establishing query computation paths through a network,&lt;br/&gt;for sets of data stream elements that need to be joined and aggregated together; &lt;br/&gt;offline and adaptive, network-aware query optimization techniques for&lt;br/&gt;distributed computation in the network. These techniques will scale&lt;br/&gt;across widely heterogeneous (sensor, wireless, and&lt;br/&gt;conventional) networks, and will be evaluated in environmental monitoring&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the development of new techniques for performing&lt;br/&gt;queries across large, highly distributed networks of stream-producing sources;&lt;br/&gt;this increases understanding of the adaptive query processing space when access&lt;br/&gt;costs to data items are non-uniform and query processing requires distributed&lt;br/&gt;communication, and the trade-offs with respect to offline versus adaptive&lt;br/&gt;optimization and relative to optimization granularity. The broader impact&lt;br/&gt;includes the development of distributed stream integration capabilities that&lt;br/&gt;can directly address a number of emerging and well-known challenges in the &lt;br/&gt;network and environmental monitoring domains. The educational component &lt;br/&gt;includes the training of two PhD students, and the teaching of stream data &lt;br/&gt;integration in graduate and advanced undergraduate courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project URL: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~zives/stream-integration/</AbstractNarration>
