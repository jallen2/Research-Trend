    <AbstractNarration>The Science of Small Things is a youth based ITEST project that exposes 100+ low-income, urban, middle-school youth to nanotechnology and ensures that they develop the information technology skills and interests required to participate successfully in the emerging regional nanotechnology workforce. The Center for Family, Work and Community and the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for High-Rate Nanomanufacturing (CHN) at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell are collaborating with local Citizen Schools Programs at Wang and Robinson Middle Schools, Tsongas Industrial History Center, the American Textile Museum and industry partners Ratheon and Nypro, to introduce youth to the techniques that will enable commercialization of nanotechnology products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project combines a set of year-round content-based, hands-on activities and computer simulations exploring the math and science of nanotechnology, career field trips and interactions with professional scientists from the CHN and industry partners, and exhibit and webpage development projects that result in presentations at local museums, robotics events and family events. The program evaluation measures change in science interest, skill level in using technology in the design process, and career awareness of the youth participants, and parental support of participants in STEM experiences. Changes in links between organizations and individuals are also measured as the university, business and community agencies work together to design and implement the program.</AbstractNarration>
