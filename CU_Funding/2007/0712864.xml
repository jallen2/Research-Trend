    <AbstractNarration>This SGER funds a seismic and geodetic experiment to capture the&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of an anticipated slow earthquake (SE) predicted to occur on the flanks of&lt;br/&gt;Kilauea volcano on March 17, 2007. The experiment would temporarily densify the seismic and geodetic networks at Kilauea in order to clarify the relationship between SE deformation and triggered seismicity during the next Kilauea SE. In the past decade, Kilauea&lt;br/&gt;volcano's south flank has been the site of at least 7 slow (or 'silent') earthquakes (SEs)&lt;br/&gt;identified with continuous GPS (CGPS) data. The SEs can be divided into 'Western' and 'Eastern' families defined by similar&lt;br/&gt;patterns of horizontal motions and, of these, the&lt;br/&gt;Western family are periodic and separated by 774 +/-7 day periods (Brooks et al., 2006). A&lt;br/&gt;distinct swarm of micoearthquakes is triggered in the same place by the periodic SEs. There is currently some disagreement about whether&lt;br/&gt;microearthquakes occur on the regional decollement or&lt;br/&gt;potentially at shallower structural levels. Resolving the discrepancy is&lt;br/&gt;important because the location of the microseismicity could be used to help constrain the&lt;br/&gt;location and further our mechanistic understanding of the SEs themselves.The physical processes giving rise to the slow slip and associated tremor are the subject of&lt;br/&gt;intensive ongoing research by the community of earthquake scientists. The observations and&lt;br/&gt;search for theoretical explanations have stimulated some provocative and potentially&lt;br/&gt;important hypotheses. This work would add vital data that may help to distinguish between mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>
