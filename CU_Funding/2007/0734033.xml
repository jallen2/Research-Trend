    <AbstractNarration>The PIs have requested a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to evaluate optical fiber Distributed Temperature Sensors (DTS) as a tool to constrain heat and mass transport between sediments and the overlying water column. DTS systems using optical fibers represent a new technology with great promise for providing measurements of temperature on and beneath the seafloor that are dense in both space and time. The PIs request funds to build, calibrate and test this technology in an environment that is similar to, but much more accessible than, the seafloor. The PIs propose to piggy-back on an onshore experiment, funded by the NSF hydrology program, which will use a variety of tools, including HOBO temperature probes, to study the heat budget of hyporheic (subsurface) flow in the Willamette River. The fundamental objective of the hydrology project - to constrain models of heat and mass transfer between the sediment and overlying water - has parallels to studies of fluid flow associated with submarine cold seeps. The PIs plan to capitalize on the experience of co-PI Selker, who has recently returned from a sabbatical focused on exploring use of DTS in hydrology. Because densely-spaced temperature time-series are needed to achieve a number of the science objectives of the Regional Cabled Observatory and the Coastal Observatory, this is an excellent opportunity to test and calibrate a very promising technology for OOI at a fraction of the cost for a marine test. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project represents a first step towards adaptation of a new and promising technology to the marine environment. It will also result in training of a graduate student and several undergraduates and faculty, several of whom represent minorities underrepresented in science, in these new techniques.</AbstractNarration>
