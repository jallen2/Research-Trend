    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research is to develop feedback control theoretic methods for learning and adaptation in&lt;br/&gt;multiagent systems and to investigate their potential as analysis and design tools for distributed adaptive&lt;br/&gt;systems. The proposed work stems from recent innovations at UCLA on the role of feedback control in the&lt;br/&gt;game theoretic framework of distributed learning. This recent work has overcome long standing perceived&lt;br/&gt;obstacles in game theoretic learning and opens new opportunities for distributed system design.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will emphasize underlying mathematical models of multiagent learning. The&lt;br/&gt;research directions to be explored are:&lt;br/&gt;Advanced analysis of feedback control based learning in games: The introduction of feedback control&lt;br/&gt;methods in learning in games is very recent, and there are many important unresolved issues. Proposed&lt;br/&gt;topics of interest include strategic advantage of feedback control based methods, analysis of systems with&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous learning algorithms, dynamic network interconnections, and supervised switching for learning.&lt;br/&gt;Continuum action spaces: The learning in games framework currently applies to learning among a finite&lt;br/&gt;set of choices. This direction involves learning with decisions over a continuum, such as dynamic resource&lt;br/&gt;allocation problems. Issues include new feedback control based approaches to distributed optimization,&lt;br/&gt;severely limited information structures, and complementary sharing of information structures.&lt;br/&gt;Multiagent games with state evolution: The learning in games framework uses a static game setup.&lt;br/&gt;The state variable is the state of learning, but not inherent states of subsystems or the environment. This&lt;br/&gt;direction considers learning for games with internal states, also known as Markov or stochastic games. Issues&lt;br/&gt;include changes of time-scale for expert selection, feedback control based Q-learning, and integrator action.&lt;br/&gt;Application to Evolvable Hardware: Evolvable hardware is an emerging area that uses notions inspired&lt;br/&gt;by biological evolution for the design of reconfigurable, self-organizing hardware. The proposed concepts on&lt;br/&gt;multiagent may be viewed as an engineered evolution with its blending of feedback control and multiagent&lt;br/&gt;learning. This project will use the evolvable hardware paradigm to illustrate and motivate the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: There is an extensive body of research in the area of multiple player games. In the case&lt;br/&gt;of non-zero-sum games, the concept of mixed strategy (i.e, randomized) Nash equilibrium, despite its central&lt;br/&gt;role, has received considerable scrutiny as to how players, through repeated interactions, would ever converge&lt;br/&gt;to a Nash equilibrium. Indeed there are long standing examples to the contrary. The innovative basis of&lt;br/&gt;the proposed research establishes that simple notions from feedback control can enable such convergence.&lt;br/&gt;Consequentially, this research opens many new possibilities into how to design distributed adaptive systems&lt;br/&gt;from a game theoretic viewpoint.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research will have a broader impact on societal applications and undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;student eduction.&lt;br/&gt;Societal: The distributed systems concept is relevant in a multitude of domains, both engineered and&lt;br/&gt;social. These include data networks, distributed robotics, traffic networks, distributed design, power grid&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, and distributed computation, as well as economic exchange, social exchange, and political&lt;br/&gt;coalition dynamics. The proposed work addresses a fundamental component of the mathematical models of&lt;br/&gt;such systems and has potential implications in a variety of areas.&lt;br/&gt;Educational: Key activities to be undertaken are 1) Introducing 1-unit freshman courses on the concept&lt;br/&gt;of distributed systems and feedback control and their applications. This is through UCLA's Fiat Lux&lt;br/&gt;freshman seminar series, and 2) Developing an research test-bed based on evolvable hardware as a venue to&lt;br/&gt;incorporate undergraduate research-level participation through directed study electives. Of course, these activities&lt;br/&gt;are in addition to the usual education and training of graduate student researchers and dissemination&lt;br/&gt;of results to the research community.</AbstractNarration>
