    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) and her collaborator will study the global internal magnetic fields of the Sun using sophisticated, 2D solar seismology models to identify selected oscillation modes. They will then determine which magnetic fields give rise to the changes in frequency and splitting of global solar modes that are observed over the solar cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators note that inverting helioseismic data to determine the magnetic fields inside the Sun is extremely difficult, that prior results have been ambiguous, and that, as a result, there have been very few helioseismic studies of solar internal magnetic fields to date. They expect their methodology to identify the magnetic fields inside the Sun that are strong enough to produce changes in helioseismic data, and to provide a quantitative estimate of the errors introduced by current assumptions made during standard helioseismic analysis. The PI also asserts that the results of this effort will provide a deeper theoretical understanding of the consequences of varying magnetic fields inside the Sun. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigating how the Sun behaves under the influence of magnetic fields will provide important clues concerning the behavior of other stars. Studying solar magnetic variability and its causes may also be relevant to the Earth's climate, since solar irradiance can affect climate and varies with the solar magnetic cycle. This project will provide training through the career development of the Co-PI and through forming the basis of a graduate student's thesis.</AbstractNarration>
