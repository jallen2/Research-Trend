    <AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this project is to use analysis and computational mathematics to gain a better understanding of the effects of the complex fluid dynamics, frequently exhibited by renal tubular flows, on renal transport of water and solutes. Using the immersed boundary approach, mathematical models will be built to represent the fluid dynamics around the proximal tubule brush border microvilli, and to represent the tubular flow in a papillary collecting duct undergoing peristaltic contractions. The resulting models will be used to study the effects of the two-way fluid-structure interactions on solute and water transport along the proximal tubule and along the collecting duct. Additionally, nonlinear optimization techniques will be used to further the physiological investigation of cellular homeostasis, by assessing the effectiveness of various regulatory mechanisms in homeostatic recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one is stranded in the ocean for days, should one drink the sea water to quench one's thirst? The answer depends on whether the subject is a person (don't!) or a rat (no problem, drink away!). The reason is that the osmolality (i.e., total solute concentration) of sea water is higher than the maximum urine osmolality that can be produced by a human. In contrast, a little rat can produce a urine twice as concentrated as sea water. It may be hard to believe, but the mechanism by which some mammals produce highly concentrated urine is not well understood. This project will use mathematical analysis and computational techniques to answer a number of basic and important questions in renal physiology: How do the peristaltic contractions of the renal papilla impact the concentrating mechanism of the kidney? How do the brush border microvilli, which are found along portions of the nephrons (little tubules in the kidney), affect solute transport in the kidney? What are the most effective ways for kidney cells to change aspects of its transport properties in order to survive in its ever-changing surroundings? The answers to those questions are crucial in an overall understanding of renal physiology, renal pathophysiology, and other autoregulatory mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>
