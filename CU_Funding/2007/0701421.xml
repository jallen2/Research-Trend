    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this research emphasize on the physics and optimization of novel III-Nitride based nanostructures active regions for achieving high performance light emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers emitting in the blue and green regimes. Nanostructure engineering of the novel nitride-based nanostructures allow polarization band engineering for enhancing the radiative recombination rate and optical gain, and engineering the electronic density of states of the nanostructures. In this program, the PI will emphasize on the investigation of the following nanostructures: 1) staggered type-I InGaN QW, 2) type-II nitride-based QWs, and 3) InGaN-based QDs active regions. The proposed research works include physics of nanostructures, device physics, epitaxy, material characterization, device fabrication, and optimization of LEDs and laser diodes emitting in the visible regimes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits &lt;br/&gt; The research program will advance the fundamental physics, device physics, and MOCVD epitaxy of improved novel nitride-based active regions via nanostructure engineering. Successful research on the nanostructure engineering of III-Nitride active region with significantly improved spontaneous recombination rate allows the realization of high efficiency LEDs operating in the blue and green regimes, applicable for solid state lightings. The proposed nanostructures also leads to nitride-based active regions with improved optical gain in the blue and green regimes, thus enabling the realization of high performance laser diodes emitting in blue and green regimes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt; The research programs have strong technological impacts in the fields of solid state lightings, energy, and biomedical lasers. Low-cost and high-efficiency visible solid state emitters lead to efficient use of energy, which will provide a significant saving in energy consumption for the society. This research program allows graduate and undergraduate students to be trained in multidisciplinary research areas, encompassing the physics of optoelectronics devices and nanostructures, MOCVD epitaxy, and device design / fabrications. In addition, research participation from high school students is also encouraged during summer semesters, under guidance of graduate students. Outreach program focusing on K-12 (grade 5th till 9th and junior) female and underrepresented minority students will also be conducted to raise their interest in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
