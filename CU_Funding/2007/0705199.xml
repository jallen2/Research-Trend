    <AbstractNarration>Machine-readable lexical resources are essential to Natural Language&lt;br/&gt;Processing applications such as information extraction and machine translation. &lt;br/&gt;The largest lexicon is WordNet, with &lt;br/&gt;semantic information about more than 150,000, or lexical units (LUs). &lt;br/&gt;A smaller, independently developed resource is FrameNet, &lt;br/&gt;which provides detailed information about the syntactic patterns for LUs. &lt;br/&gt;The project investigates the ways in which these complementary resources &lt;br/&gt;can be combined using the semantic-syntactic information from&lt;br/&gt;FrameNet (FN) where available and falling back on less detailed&lt;br/&gt;entries from WordNet (WN) in other cases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WN and FN exhibit fundamentally different design principles. &lt;br/&gt;WN groups (near) synonymous LUs into &lt;br/&gt;"synsets," which are interconnected via conceptual and lexical relations &lt;br/&gt;to form a semantic network. FN groups LUs according to the&lt;br/&gt;"semantic frame" they evoke, which is a type of event, relation or&lt;br/&gt;state along with the participants involved in the event. Thus,&lt;br/&gt;while antonyms such as _praise_ and _blame_ may be in the same FN frame &lt;br/&gt;they are in different, though interlinked, WN synsets. Moreover, FN frames &lt;br/&gt;cover semantically related nouns, verbs and adjectives; WN synsets&lt;br/&gt;do not mix part of speech. Crucially for NLP applications, the resources &lt;br/&gt;differ with respect to sense distinctions.&lt;br/&gt;Alignment will be investigated for the following differences: &lt;br/&gt;lexical coverage, sense distinctions, taxonomic and&lt;br/&gt;other semantic relations, and scalar frames for adjectives.&lt;br/&gt;Some 1,000 word senses are examined in detail so as to provide an idea of&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of each of these phenomena over the entire lexicon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This theoretical work lays the foundation for constructing a unique, &lt;br/&gt;invaluable resource for the NLP community.</AbstractNarration>
