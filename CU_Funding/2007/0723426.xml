    <AbstractNarration>This is a Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction project for the construction of a 236 foot research vessel to work in the waters off the coast of Alaska including the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. The University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) proposal is in response to the National Science Foundation Program Solicitation NSF 07-515 for the management, acquisition and operation of an Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV). The construction of an ARRV was given the highest priority in the report ?National Academic Research Fleet ? a Long Range Plan for Renewal?. The proposed design was developed with input from the oceanographic science community and the academic fleet operators. The design was completed in December 2004 and is well suited for oceanographic and fisheries research in the harsh, ice-infested Alaska seas during all seasons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UAF proposes to assemble a management team for the acquisition of the ship that draws on extensive experience for public agency ship procurements. They propose to use experienced personnel and vessel acquisition procedures that have proven successful in Alaska Marine Highways (AMS) recent vessel acquisitions. UAF will be using the Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Execution Plan (PEP) systems used by AMS during these acquisitions. The University is contracting with two experience marine science technical engineers to insure the ship science capabilities are not compromised. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal was reviewed by 10 mail reviewers and 10 panelists. A major recommendation from the panel was a phased acquisition strategy to mitigate risk. A four phase approach is proposed with given milestones to be completed prior to funding of the next phase. This CSA provides the funds for Phase I and completion of related milestones including the design refresh and cost update, project execution plan, development of an oversight committee, draft shipyard contract and completing the formation of the project management team.</AbstractNarration>
