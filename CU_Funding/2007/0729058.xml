    <AbstractNarration>0729058&lt;br/&gt;Lipson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for a U.S. - Brazil workshop on nanophotonics to be held in Guaruja, Brazil November 12-17, 2007. This workshop will bring together researchers in the area of integrated optics and plasmonics to discuss new advances and applications in this multidisiplinary area of research. The workshop will be organized by Michal Lipson of Cornell University, Hugo E Hernandez-Figueroa of the State University of Campinas, Brazil and John Weiner from the University of Toulouse, France. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in the area of photonics can result in the rapid development of new applied technologies. This US-Brazil workshop will expose US researchers to needs and applications of photonics in areas that are not often explored, such as photonics for applications in agribusiness including environmental sensing and energy efficient lighting for remote and isolated geographical areas. The workshop will also expose undergraduate and graduate students in both Brazil and the US to cutting edge photonic research.</AbstractNarration>
