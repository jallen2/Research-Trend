    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the investigation, development, and integration of multi-modal and mobilitybased&lt;br/&gt;sensor networking technologies. In particular, future sensor networking technologies will include&lt;br/&gt;(i) multi-modal sensing that mixes complex data types such as audio, images or video and (ii) mobilitybased&lt;br/&gt;sensing, where parts of the sensor network may be dynamic. The objectives of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;include the study of the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;Logical Association and Organization Framework: It has been observed that network connectivity via ad&lt;br/&gt;hoc routing algorithms does not reflect the physical placement of sensors within the environment. The&lt;br/&gt;inclusion of multi-modal sensing and mobility into sensor networking systems requires logical&lt;br/&gt;organization ability. This project will focus on develping a multi-layer organization and routing&lt;br/&gt;mechanism that supports logical associations, allowing for efficient organization of sensor networks in&lt;br/&gt;application meaningful ways.&lt;br/&gt;Mobility-based Localization, Organization, and Calibration: Besides actuation capability, mobility opens&lt;br/&gt;up new ways of effectively coordinating and organizing the sensor network. This subtask explores the&lt;br/&gt;design and implementation of algorithms that exploit user, coordinated and autonomous mobility for&lt;br/&gt;robust, mobility-assisted calibration, logical association, and localization.&lt;br/&gt;This project will be performed in the context of a flexible and extensible sensor networking framework&lt;br/&gt;called Cascades. Cascades is a Python-based framework combining highly optimized applicationspecific&lt;br/&gt;code segments, such as video processing or video compression, into a script-based architecture&lt;br/&gt;that is readily deployable into a sensor network.</AbstractNarration>
