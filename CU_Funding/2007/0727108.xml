    <AbstractNarration>SES-0727108&lt;br/&gt;Michael Lovaglia&lt;br/&gt;Bret Bradley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increased use of teams to do important work in organizations brings both positive and negative effects. One such issue is the so called "bad apple" effect where a highly disagreeable team member, for example, negatively impacts the team and its performance. This study aims to better understand (1) the process through which the negative impact occurs and (2) what factors might minimize the negative impact. According to affective events theory, work on social stressors, and other theoretical frameworks the investigator hypothesizes that a bad apple impacts the affective reactions of team members leading them to respond with defensive behaviors. These behaviors then combine and damage team processes like communication and cohesion which ultimately lead to poorer team performance. In addition, the level of interdependence among team members will moderate the impact of a bad apple on team affective reactions. The PIs have designed a lab study to test these hypotheses which will be conducted at the University of Iowa. The study provides numerous educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through designing and carrying out the study. In addition, this research has implications for the development of techniques to improve worker satisfaction and productivity and how to integrate people with personality disorders into the workforce. Results will be presented at scientific conferences and published broadly in high quality social psychology and business journals.</AbstractNarration>
