    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Skidaway Institute of Oceanography under the direction of Dr. Jackson Blanton to provide support for the to replacement of the aging 25-ft R/V Gannett that has provided an instrumented research-quality system for access to estuaries, tidal channels, and nearby coastal waters for some 12 years. This system has provided spatially and temporally detailed field descriptions of currents, dissolved and suspended loads, bathymetry and seabed character. The new boat will consist of a 27-ft aluminum boat specially designed for rapid surveys of shallow water environments; sensors for navigation, currents, dissolved chemical species and bottom characterization; and a data acquisition system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SkIO has substantial national and international research impacts due to the prolific activities of its resident scientists and the many visiting scientists and students. The collaborative efforts with Savannah State, a HBCU institution, increase participation in scientific activities by underrepresented minorities. There is substantial interaction with K-12 education in the local area as well. Although primarily a research institution, there is a strong teaching component that will help train the next generation of scientists. Educational efforts include not only student opportunities but also field-based experiences for teachers and mentors. The facility provides numerous opportunities for informal education by hosting speaker events and open-houses. The requested equipment will improve the facility's ability to meet the needs of researchers, educators, students and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
