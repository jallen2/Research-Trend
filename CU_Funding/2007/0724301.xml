    <AbstractNarration>Diffusion of Emerging Energy Technologies within a State Context &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cross-disciplinary research examines the interconnected, state-level, socio-political influences on diffusion and deployment of emerging energy technologies with potential to contribute to an energy system transformation for climate change mitigation and energy security. Using a case study approach this research focuses on two very different emerging energy technologies, wind power and carbon capture and storage (CCS); both have large potential to change the energy technology landscape and to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions. The project uses a retrospective analysis of the diffusion history of wind power technology to ground identification and analysis of the interplay of factors that will influence future diffusion of wind and CCS. By examining these two technologies in six geographically and politically diverse states (MA, MN, TX, MT, NM, and NY), the project will identify and evaluate relationships between the socio-political dimension of state energy technology systems and stakeholder perceptions of risks and benefits of the technologies. The analysis will characterize the interplay of socio-political factors influencing technology diffusion to provide diverse and valuable insights about potential state-level barriers and opportunities for these and other emerging energy technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research are to: 1) identify the dominant socio-political influences on energy technology decisions at the state-level; (2) learn from the state-specific diffusion history of wind technology to identify variables important for development and future deployment of large-scale wind and CCS in different states; (3) compare and contrast the relative importance and the interactions of socio-political factors across different states; (4) characterize the complex interactions among the many socio-political variables that have potential to influence energy technology deployment; (5) contribute to transition management theory by integrating relevant concepts drawn from literature in technology diffusion, state-difference, and risk perception; (6) contribute to the policy discourse related to energy technology deployment and how policy can facilitate a societal response to climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project strategically integrates several traditionally separate areas of research: technology diffusion and deployment; analysis of energy and environmental policy; comparative analysis of states and identification of state difference; and public perceptions of risks (and benefits). This integration will contribute to theoretical development of the emerging literature on transition management for sustainability, as well as to theory development in each of these areas by providing empirical evidence to support new theory about state-level socio-political influences on shifting to more sustainable technologies. The project''s comparative analysis of six geographically and politically diverse states is particularly valuable and unique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide insights that may accelerate the transition of our energy technology infrastructure. Such acceleration could both reduce the threats of climate change and increase future energy security. In addition to increasing understanding of state-level influence on technology diffusion, our results will enable energy professionals, state planners, policy analysts, non-profits, and businesses to develop more effective strategies for involving the public in energy policy formation and implementation related to deployment of wind energy and CCS technologies, as well as other emerging energy technologies. The unique and strategic integration of traditionally separate areas of research will enhance and encourage future opportunities for cross-disciplinary research. This research also has an important educational impact among undergraduate and graduate students at the three universities where the three PIs teach and advise student research.</AbstractNarration>
