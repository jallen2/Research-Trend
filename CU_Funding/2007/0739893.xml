    <AbstractNarration>Richard Panek (0739893)&lt;br/&gt;"Seeing" Dark Energy from the South Pole&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Book author, Richard Panek will travel to the South Pole Station in Antarctica to visit the South Pole Telescope (SPT) site and interview scientists as they work on project. The South Pole Telescope is an integral component to a book that he is writing called, "Let There Be Dark: At the Dawn of the Next Universe"; a comprehensive account of dark matter, dark energy, and the revolution in our understanding of the universe. The book will offer readers a vivid illustration of how state-of-the-art dark energy research works and why it matters. The South Pole Telescope is an important component of the book because it is in the forefront of research into the nature of dark energy. Mr. Panek points out that observers are trying not to detect dark energy but to define it not to discover what it is but what it is like. Specifically his book will discuss dark energy research performed by the SPT, the general nature of dark energy research, and the unique advantage and opportunities that the South Pole affords astronomical and astrophysical research from the point of view of the scientists. The author states that he will "use his own novice sense of gradual understanding to convey the point of view of scientists as they go about their work."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Panek's quest to capture the majesty and mystery of research in the realms of dark energy and dark matter is significant, though, more so his ability to explain the science in a way that can inspire and enlighten non-scientific readers. The book, a work in progress, already has a contract from a noteworthy publisher, which is evidence of future success. The writer will require little time in Antarctica to gain the information and insight needed to write about SPT. The investment in resources is relatively small as compared to the likely success met by the publication and the subsequent knowledge and wonder imparted to readers about the ongoing research at the South Pole.</AbstractNarration>
