    <AbstractNarration>The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the Workshop on cucurbit[n]uril containers organized by Professors Lyle D. Isaacs of the University of Maryland- College Park and Angel E. Kaifer of the University of Miami.. It is timely and it will bring together an excellent mix of younger and senior scientists as well as both domestic and international scientists doing research on cucurbit[n]urils. It has been strategically planned to come just prior to the international calixarene meeting, both at the University of Maryland, so that scientists doing cucurbit[n]uril chemistry who probably would not have attended the calixarene meeting will now come to that meeting since they are attending the cucurbit[n]uril meeting and will present their research. This will then expose chemists doing calixarene chemistry to the world of cucurbit[n]urils chemistry. It is also anticipated that, by coming together to talk about this class of molecular containers, new collaborations, particularly ones with international partners, will be established. For the broader impacts of the workshop it is estimated that 15-20 participants (both young and established) will come from both the U.S. and abroad, giving them an opportunity to be invigorated by new perspectives in this exciting and growing area of research. The PIs evidently have the appropriate stature in the field to provide effective leadership of this workshop.</AbstractNarration>
