    <AbstractNarration>Leoni&lt;br/&gt;0708039&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The central theme of this project is the application of&lt;br/&gt;modern Calculus of Variations to materials science and&lt;br/&gt;hydrodynamics. The investigator undertakes the following&lt;br/&gt;specific projects:&lt;br/&gt; -Heteroepitaxial thin films. The investigator studies from the&lt;br/&gt;variational point of view a mathematical model for the epitaxial&lt;br/&gt;deposition of a film onto a relatively thick substrate in the&lt;br/&gt;case of a mismatch between the lattice parameters of the two&lt;br/&gt;crystalline solids. &lt;br/&gt; -Strain gradient plasticity. The investigator derives, in a&lt;br/&gt;mathematically rigorous way, a strain gradient theory of&lt;br/&gt;plasticity starting from a variational formulation of the&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium problem for a finite number of dislocations in a&lt;br/&gt;plane domain. &lt;br/&gt; -Water waves. An alternative approach for the existence of&lt;br/&gt;regular water waves and of Stokes wave of greatest height is&lt;br/&gt;undertaken. &lt;br/&gt;Other projects include image segmentation problems and&lt;br/&gt;micromagnetics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The central theme of this project is the application of&lt;br/&gt;modern techniques in mathematics to various problems in materials&lt;br/&gt;science, mechanics, and hydrodynamics. When a thin film of a&lt;br/&gt;crystalline solid is deposited on a substrate, a common&lt;br/&gt;industrial process, difficulties can arise if the crystal lattice&lt;br/&gt;structures of the film and the substrate do not match. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator studies this problem. A fundamental question in&lt;br/&gt;materials is the effect of dislocations in the material&lt;br/&gt;microstructure on larger-scale behavior. Classical plasticity&lt;br/&gt;theory does not address this issue well. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;develops a theory of strain gradient plasticity that incorporates&lt;br/&gt;dislocations and their interactions. He also considers problems&lt;br/&gt;in water waves, image processing, and micromagnetics. The&lt;br/&gt;results and methods developed in the project will be incorporated&lt;br/&gt;in new graduate courses, and some will be included in a series of&lt;br/&gt;books that the investigator is writing in collaboration with I.&lt;br/&gt;Fonseca,</AbstractNarration>
