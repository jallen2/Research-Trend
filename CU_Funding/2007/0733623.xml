    <AbstractNarration>This Workshop, supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of &lt;br/&gt;Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, is&lt;br/&gt;focused on providing broad guidance on future directions in polymer science, &lt;br/&gt;engineering, and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Given the major developments in scientific research in&lt;br/&gt;polymers and the simultaneous evolution of the polymer industry in the 10 years&lt;br/&gt;following the last NSF Workshop on Interdisciplinary Macromolecular Science and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering, it is essential and timely that a new workshop be held now to identify and &lt;br/&gt;update specific science and engineering research opportunities and strategies. At the same &lt;br/&gt;time, reflecting the increasing globalization of science and technology, it is essential to&lt;br/&gt;examine the polymer field under this light and to identify opportunities and challenges in &lt;br/&gt;terms of education and international competitiveness. For this purpose, a two-day&lt;br/&gt;workshop will be held at NSF headquarters with the participation of leading scientists,&lt;br/&gt;engineers, and educators from academia, industry, and national laboratories. This&lt;br/&gt;workshop is to tbe organized by a committee of six individuals representing very broad&lt;br/&gt;academic and industiral perspectives and having expertise across the polymer field and its&lt;br/&gt;interfaces with areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, and&lt;br/&gt;exngineering. The following six topics have been identified for study and discussion&lt;br/&gt;among the workshop participants: (1) Polymer synthesis and new polymeric materials,&lt;br/&gt;(2) Design and manipulation of complex polymer systems, (3) Computational modeling&lt;br/&gt;and theory, (4) Processing and assembly, (5) Characterizatin and properties, and (6)&lt;br/&gt;Polymer technology in the service of society. Education and competitiveness will be&lt;br/&gt;woven into each of these themes and throughout the workshop. In addition to the six&lt;br/&gt;subgroups fo 6 to 10 particpants to discuss each of the above topics, the workshop will&lt;br/&gt;begin with seven plenary speakers on issues of major importance and timeliness. These&lt;br/&gt;will include hiearchical functional materials, polumers in biology and medicine, energy&lt;br/&gt;production and storage, environmental and sustainability, cyberscience and polymers, and &lt;br/&gt;global security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: Emphasis on educaton and international competitiveness will&lt;br/&gt;be given throughout the workshop and will also be the subject of a panel discussion on &lt;br/&gt;the first day. The workshop will create a web site that will be used as a tool to solicit&lt;br/&gt;input and suggestions on these topics from the polymer community and to provide&lt;br/&gt;information about workshop organization, schedule, and (evenutally) conclusions.&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the workshop will reflect a wide diversity and include leading senior and &lt;br/&gt;junior academic researchers, polyer educators, members of industry and government&lt;br/&gt;laboraties to ensure that the conclustions of this workshop are broadly applicable across&lt;br/&gt;polymer research and education. A few selected graduate students (to be included as&lt;br/&gt;assistants) will also benefit from this unique experience. Following the workshop, the &lt;br/&gt;organizing committee will report to NSF on the recommendations fo the entire group, and&lt;br/&gt;will subsequently publish a final report. The report will address key new research and&lt;br/&gt;education directions, as well as the changing industrial needs and global context of&lt;br/&gt;polymer research. The resulting report will be broadly disseminated through publication&lt;br/&gt;in print and on the Internet and is expected to influence the global polymer science and &lt;br/&gt;engineering community. Major interest for this workshop has been expressed by many&lt;br/&gt;other Federal Agencies, which are expected to participate and co-sponsor it.</AbstractNarration>
