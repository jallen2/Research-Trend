    <AbstractNarration>The logic group at Notre Dame is well established. Our graduate&lt;br/&gt;training program produces doctorates who have experienced the many&lt;br/&gt;dimensions of research, teaching, and mathematical communication. At&lt;br/&gt;Notre Dame, the students develop a solid independent research record.&lt;br/&gt;They make themselves known to the international mathematical community&lt;br/&gt;by participating in conferences and workshops and giving talks, in&lt;br/&gt;addition to writing papers. They have the opportunity to discuss&lt;br/&gt;research with specialists from around the world, and to participate in&lt;br/&gt;collaborative research. By the time they graduate, they are full&lt;br/&gt;members of the international community of mathematicians. Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;offers graduate students opportunities to teach and training to help&lt;br/&gt;them be successful. Our students have experienced a greater variety&lt;br/&gt;of teaching experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our logic postdoctoral associates have been allowed significant time&lt;br/&gt;to develop a research program of their own. They have taught students&lt;br/&gt;of all levels, from first-year liberal arts undergraduates to advanced&lt;br/&gt;graduate students. They have been involved in mentoring graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, in leading small group learning activities, and other more&lt;br/&gt;advanced aspects of faculty life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support for all of the US nationals&lt;br/&gt;studying Mathematical Logic at Notre Dame, and support for the first&lt;br/&gt;of a two year postdoctoral associate in logic. In addition, it will&lt;br/&gt;provide some travel money for the students and postdoctoral associate,&lt;br/&gt;and some money for books for the students. Finally, the grant will&lt;br/&gt;provide some travel money for outside visitors to come to Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;to interact with the faculty, students, and postdoctoral associate.</AbstractNarration>
