    <AbstractNarration>Timely delivery of data streams is important to time-critical&lt;br/&gt;applications relying on streams of dynamic data. Drastic reduction&lt;br/&gt;on the sending rates of data streams typically has negative impact on&lt;br/&gt;the operations of such applications. Effective rate adaptation is&lt;br/&gt;needed to make data streams adapt to network congestion through slowly&lt;br/&gt;varying their sending rate. This research project is motivated by&lt;br/&gt;the need of streaming dynamic radar data at the required rates from&lt;br/&gt;radars to a control center in the surveillance application using ganged&lt;br/&gt;ground-based radars. This application is crucial to the operation&lt;br/&gt;of the unmanned aerial vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research project, an adaptive data pulling framework is&lt;br/&gt;studied to support stable data streaming. This framework consists&lt;br/&gt;of a transport-layer congestion control scheme and an&lt;br/&gt;application-layer data pulling control mechanism. The&lt;br/&gt;application-layer data pulling control mechanism allows the&lt;br/&gt;application actively fetch data from sources. The transport-layer&lt;br/&gt;congestion control scheme adopts a new rate control method which&lt;br/&gt;provides weighted fairness to data streams. Weighted fairness&lt;br/&gt;among data streams is the desired feature for controlling the sending&lt;br/&gt;rates of streams carrying layered encodings. Weighted fairness&lt;br/&gt;means that the throughput of a stream is degraded reversely&lt;br/&gt;proportional to its priority when the network becomes congested.&lt;br/&gt;Weighted fairness brings new vision on rate control for data&lt;br/&gt;streaming. Stability and responsiveness to congestion indications&lt;br/&gt;are the two key research questions of the new rate control scheme.</AbstractNarration>
