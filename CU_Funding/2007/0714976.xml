    <AbstractNarration>Harris-Stowe State University (HSSU) will undertake a STEM program self-analysis to determine ways to improve student retention and student success at HSSU. In this Planning Project, HSSU has two objectives: 1) analyze the data that is currently on file and collected on a regular basis, and 2) collect new data that will show a more complete picture of the current students and putative future students. The methods to be employed consist of analysis of data that HSSU has been collecting on the student population over the past several years and collecting new data during the course of this project. This data will be used to help understand what factors can be identified from the existing data that bear on student success. The current data does not give a complete picture of student retention and student success in STEM courses and in the university overall. More data will be collected with survey instruments designed and conducted by project faculty, interviews with current and former STEM students and both surveys and interviews of secondary STEM teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is in the use of data to understand of the factors that result in student success and retention at HSSU. This insight will allow the faculty and administration to design a project to improve the STEM Programs, thereby improving the scientific and mathematical literacy and abilities of HSSU students. This improvement will result in greater student classroom success and retention in the university. Although this project will have no direct impact on facilities and instrumentation, it will allow identification of ways to improve these areas via an Implementation project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most HSSU students are from underrepresented groups African-American, female, first generation, and low income therefore the broader impact of this project is that it will increase participation of these groups in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
