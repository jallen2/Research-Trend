    <AbstractNarration>IIS 0705359, IIS 0705215&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;III-COR: Collaborative Research: Mining Biomedical &lt;br/&gt;and Network Data Using Tensors Christos Faloutsos (christos@cs.cmu.edu) CMU &lt;br/&gt;Vasileios Megalooikonomou (vasilis@cis.temple.edu) Temple Univ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given a large collection of functional Magnetic Resonance (fMR) images over time,&lt;br/&gt;how can one find patterns and correlations? Similarly, given a never-ending stream &lt;br/&gt;of network traffic information, how can one monitor for anomalies, intrusions, &lt;br/&gt;and potential failures? The main idea behind this proposal is to treat both &lt;br/&gt;problems using the theory of tensors. Despite the seemingly wide differences in &lt;br/&gt;the two settings, they both boil down to finding patterns in multidimensional &lt;br/&gt;arrays, sparse or dense. Tensors are exactly generalizations of matrices, &lt;br/&gt;and correspond roughly to ``DataCubes'' of data mining. Matrix analysis &lt;br/&gt;and decompositions are part of the standard toolbox for data mining, &lt;br/&gt;providing methods for dimensionality reduction, pattern discovery and&lt;br/&gt;``hidden variable'' discovery. Extending these tools to higher dimensionalities &lt;br/&gt;is valuable and tensors provide the tools to do this generalization. &lt;br/&gt;However, these tools have not yet been put to use in large volume data mining. &lt;br/&gt;This is the main contribution of this proposal. The investigators propose &lt;br/&gt;(a) to design tensor decomposition algorithms that scale for large datasets,&lt;br/&gt;with special attention to sparse datasets, and to never-ending streams of data &lt;br/&gt;and (b) to apply them on two driving applications, fMRI data analysis and network&lt;br/&gt;data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose to analyze large volumes of fMRI data performing&lt;br/&gt;the following sub-tasks: cluster voxels with similar behavior over time for&lt;br/&gt;a given subject and/or task or across subjects and/or tasks, &lt;br/&gt;classify patterns of brain activity, and detect lag correlations&lt;br/&gt;and spatio-temporal patterns among fMRI time sequences. &lt;br/&gt;The investigators also propose to perform the following inter-related &lt;br/&gt;tasks on multiple GigaBytes of network flow data: anomaly detection, &lt;br/&gt;pattern discovery, and compression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both of these applications are important for medicine, health management,&lt;br/&gt;and for computer and national security. Analysis of fMRI data can help understanding&lt;br/&gt;how the brain functions, which parts of the brain collaborate with what other parts, &lt;br/&gt;and whether there are variations across subjects and across task-related activities. &lt;br/&gt;For the network traffic monitoring setting, fast detection of anomalies is important,&lt;br/&gt;to spot malware, port-scanning attempts, and just plain non-malicious failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational goals include incorporating the research findings in &lt;br/&gt;advanced graduate courses at CMU (15-826) and at Temple (9664, 9665)&lt;br/&gt;and proposing tutorials in leading conferences in databases, &lt;br/&gt;data mining and bio-informatics audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the web page: &lt;br/&gt;http://knight.cis.temple.edu/~vasilis/research/tensors.html</AbstractNarration>
