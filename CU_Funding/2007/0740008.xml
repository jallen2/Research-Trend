    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project demonstrates the feasibility of a device for rapidly determining the susceptibility of infectious bacteria to antibiotic treatments. Whereas standard susceptibility tests take between 24-96 hours, this device promises to provide assessments in less than two hours without the use of specialized reaction surfaces. To demonstrate feasibility, the real-time activity of bacteria will be monitored during growth in nutrient broths before and after exposure to dosages of simulated antibiotics. Signatures of two distinct bacteria will be followed, minimum measurable concentrations determined, integrative concepts and partnerships for this instrumentation established, and design of a prototype completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are improved speed and accuracy for diagnosing and treating patients having bacterial infections, decreased costs for patient care at hospitals, emergency departments, physician offices/satellite facilities and point-of-care providers, and heightened automation and ease of operation for a front-line approach that improves health givers' abilities to treat infectious disease and save lives. Furthermore, successful implementation would point to other potential applications in medical, biopharmaceutical and clinical settings.</AbstractNarration>
