    <AbstractNarration>This is a conference dedicated to the premise that organization studies can be revitalized by renewed engagement with the classics of sociology, key texts that have stood the test of time. A set of distinguished scholars has agreed to serve as conference speakers. Each will prepare a paper on a set of ideas from the classics of organizational sociology, addressing in each case (a) the ideas in their historical and intellectual context, (b) the impact of these ideas on the field of organization studies so far, and (c) the possibilities for future research inspired by these ideas. The papers are not to be mere surveys but, rather, creative assessments offering sharply defined points of view. The resulting set of papers will be made available in draft form on the web and, in final form, in a published volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will consist mainly of discussion of the draft papers in a format that will enable critique and contribution by an interdisciplinary audience of organization scientists. In addition to the speakers and some invited discussants, the conference will be open to other interested faculty and graduate students. It will be held in the days just after the National Academy of Management meetings and just before the American Sociology Association meetings on the east coast, so as to encourage participation by both these key research communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that graduate students will particularly benefit from participation in these discussions and from interaction with the senior scholars who attend. NSF's funding will enable ten graduate students to travel to participate. In addition, the papers will be of value for doctoral education as they will synthesize and integrate perspectives on organizations as well as because they will suggest promising pathways for future research.</AbstractNarration>
