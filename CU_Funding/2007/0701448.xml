    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-0701448&lt;br/&gt;A.Weiner, Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Novel design and implementation techniques based on hybrid photonic-RF systems that will revolutionize the ultra wideband (UWB) communication technology are the major focus of this work. The backbone of the proposed UWB architecture includes relatively few sophisticated photonically-enabled access nodes that are capable of synthesizing, receiving and correcting arbitrary UWB waveforms in dispersive and multipath environments. The clients of this network will include a large number of inexpensive RF UWB nodes with integrated on-chip photonic circuits. The arbitrary photonically-generated UWB waveforms in conjunction with the diversity of RF and photonic circuits will enable complex coding schemes that effectively address many challenging issues including multipath, antenna dispersion and photonics volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The broader impacts of this research will be evident in three different areas: 1) Technology/Economic: The pioneering work of the principal investigator in femtosecond pulse shaping will lead for the first time to unique economically-feasible concepts such as chirped UWB radars and chip-level arbitrary waveform generators. 2) Undergraduate student research opportunities and diversity promotion: At least one US undergraduate student-researcher will be supervised each summer, either in connection with the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program for Purdue undergraduates or in connection with appropriately established programs in Indiana for recruiting student-researchers from underrepresented groups. The investigators already have a record in attracting and retaining minority students including through the Midwest Alliances for Graduate Education in the Professoriate.</AbstractNarration>
