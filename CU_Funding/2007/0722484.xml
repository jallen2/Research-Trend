    <AbstractNarration>IIS-0722484&lt;br/&gt;Katherine J. Stewart&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland, College Park&lt;br/&gt;$20,325 - 12 mos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WORKSHOP: Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) Doctoral Research Consortium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 12-month standard award to support a Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) Doctoral Colloquium program at the Academy of Management Conference to be held in Philadelphia, PA (August 3-8, 2007). This will bring together approximately 25 dissertation-stage doctoral students in the field of information systems for one and a half days of talks and interaction with 6 distinguished senior faculty mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will come from the USA and from abroad. In the past, the doctoral consortium has been a successful venue for socialization of young OCIS researchers. Many of today's leading OCIS scholars have participated in past OCIS consortia. This project provides support for the travel and lodging of students as well as other expenses of putting on the doctoral consortium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;A major focus of the doctoral consortium is discussion of the students' dissertation projects. These represent cutting edge research in the field of organizational communication and information systems. The consortium provides both an opportunity for these projects to be shaped through intellectual exchange as well as communicating the work to a key group of young professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The OCIS doctoral consortium brings together highly talented students and several senior researchers, facilitating the development of a social network that will play a major role in the career success of new researchers. Since both faculty and students are diverse on several dimensions (research topics, methodological approaches, national and cultural background), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.</AbstractNarration>
