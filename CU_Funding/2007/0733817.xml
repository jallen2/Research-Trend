    <AbstractNarration>The University of Rochester Noyce Scholarship Program is attracting and preparing 30 highly qualified STEM majors and STEM professionals to become effective teachers in high-need school districts. Each Noyce Scholar receives a stipend of $18,000 which, in combination with a tuition waiver from the University, covers all tuition costs for the graduate teacher preparation program. Scholars can fulfill their two-year service requirement in any high-need school district in the country, although they are encouraged to serve in the Rochester City School District. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noyce Scholars are mostly recruited among STEM undergraduate majors at the University of Rochester and other local institutions, as well as local retired or recently laid-off STEM professionals. Undergraduates are being contacted through recruiting strategies including direct mailing of specially designed marketing materials, presentations in events involving all majors in a specific STEM field, and presentations to ''key influencers'' such as STEM faculty and academic advisors. STEM professionals are being recruited through collaborations with Human Resources departments of local technology companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noyce Scholars are participating in high quality, innovative graduate teacher preparation programs leading to teaching certification in mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics or earth science. These programs are designed to give future teachers solid theoretical grounding and concrete experiences to develop inquiry-based teaching practices specific to mathematics or science. In the case of mathematics, a key role is played by ''experiencing as learners'' mathematical inquiries and innovative uses of technology, and by becoming familiar with NSF-funded reform curricula such as Connected Mathematics and CORE Plus. In the case of science, scholars are engaging in a scaffolded series of inquiry experiences as learners and teachers that involves both out-of-school and traditional school settings, as well as reflective activities including blogging. After graduation, they are supported through monthly seminars and electronic communications through list-servs or blogs.</AbstractNarration>
