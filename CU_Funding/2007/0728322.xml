    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0728322&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Boris Tsygan, Dmitry Tamarkin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for a conference at the end&lt;br/&gt;of the emphasis year on noncommutative geometry at Northwestern&lt;br/&gt;University. Its aim was to explore the interaction between&lt;br/&gt;several directions in noncommutative geometry: index theorems,&lt;br/&gt;noncommutative calculus and operads, relations to mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physics, to number theory, and to the geometric Langlands&lt;br/&gt;program. An important objective was to highlight the subjects&lt;br/&gt;that are strong in the Chicago area (algebraic geometry, motives,&lt;br/&gt;microlocal analysis, representation theory, geometric Langlands&lt;br/&gt;program, mirror symmetry) and investigate their links to the&lt;br/&gt;works in what is more traditionally considered noncommutative&lt;br/&gt;geometry, and vice versa. For example, an algebraic approach to&lt;br/&gt;loop spaces that is used in the geometric Langlands program and&lt;br/&gt;in representation theory of real groups was compared to the&lt;br/&gt;topological string theory which is related to algebraic topology&lt;br/&gt;and mathematical physics, as well as to an approach to the&lt;br/&gt;representation theory of p-adic groups. A relation was&lt;br/&gt;established between these subjects, in particular string&lt;br/&gt;topology, and current research on motives. Several approaches to&lt;br/&gt;a conjectural relationship between noncommutative geometry and&lt;br/&gt;mirror symmetry were presented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noncommutative geometry is an extension of the classical geometry&lt;br/&gt;to "spaces" in which coordinates x, y, etc. no longer commute,&lt;br/&gt;i.e. where the identity xy=yx is not necessarily true. Such&lt;br/&gt;"spaces" abound in mathematics and physics. For example,&lt;br/&gt;noncommutativity is the mathematical manifestation of the&lt;br/&gt;Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics: if x&lt;br/&gt;stands for a position of a particle and y for its momentum, you&lt;br/&gt;cannot know precise values of both x and y. In a more&lt;br/&gt;mathematical context, noncommutativity is an expression of the&lt;br/&gt;fact that, if you apply two transformations to an object, the&lt;br/&gt;result depends on the order in which you do it. Mathematical&lt;br/&gt;situations where noncommutativity occurs have been known for a&lt;br/&gt;long time but the idea to treat them as "noncommutative spaces"&lt;br/&gt;and to study them by geometric methods is relatively recent. One&lt;br/&gt;of the successes of this approach is a radical simplification of&lt;br/&gt;the standard model in quantum field theory by means of allowing&lt;br/&gt;the space to be noncommutative. The aim of the conference was to&lt;br/&gt;compare several approaches to noncommutative geometry, as well as&lt;br/&gt;its links to other areas of mathematics and physics.
