    <AbstractNarration>Energy-management is essential for wireless sensor networks to prolong network lifetime and to increase the amount of useful information conveyed. There is potential to substantially improve the energy efficiency of sensor networks by exploiting cross-layer interactions among various networking layers and functionalities. However, such a cross-layer solution could also become impractically complex and difficult to implement. To address this challenge, this collaborative NSF-funded project at The Ohio State University and Purdue University aims to develop a suite of high-performance cross-layer mechanisms for sensor networks that are simple, modular, distributed, and provably energy-efficient. The key distinguishing feature of the project is that the mechanisms developed are based on a solid theoretical foundation that rigorously manages both performance and complexity with the goal of practical implementation. The PIs will investigate four major functionalities that are crucial to the efficient operation of energy-constrained wireless sensor networks, including joint medium-access and routing, sleep/wake scheduling, in-network aggregation/computation, and reliable broadcast. The theoretical solutions developed in this project will be implemented and evaluated on two testbeds: the existing Kansei testbed at OSU, and a prototype deployment (SENSE@OSU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The collaborative research will have a significant impact on wireless industry sectors, and will lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of the fundamental limits for developing energy-efficient distributed solutions for sensor networks. The PIs will also continue their current efforts to recruit and train women and under-represented minority groups both at the undergraduate and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>
