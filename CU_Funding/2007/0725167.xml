    <AbstractNarration>Aaron Strickland of Cornell University is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 academic years. The research is targeted at understanding how bacterial surface-layer (S-layer) proteins self-assemble into two-dimensional, nanoscale arrays. Strickland will exploit this natural process by patterning saccharide monolayers on gold in order to direct S-layer reassembly. The kinetics of the binding between the proteins and the saccharides will be studied using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, and the three-dimensional image of the S-layer protein structures will be determined by atomic force microscopy. This research project will be used as a case study for presenting the complexity of the scientific process to the general public. In collaboration with the "Concord Consortium," Dr. Strickland will create open-source software, based on the "Molecular Workbench," which will simulate the molecular events relevant to the S-layer protein research project. This software will be tied into a web-based podcast hosted by collaborators at "Earth &amp; Sky," which also will feature a series of video interviews that chronicle the evolution of the research from the formation of hypotheses, to the evaluation of experiments, to the dissemination of the conclusions. This podcast will be distributed as a pilot for the Chronicles of a Science Experiment, a web-based outlet that will enable the public to follow the progress of scientific research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Informal Science Education (ISE) program of the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings (EHR/DRL). The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program seeks new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.</AbstractNarration>
