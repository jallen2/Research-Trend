    <AbstractNarration>0730450&lt;br/&gt;Patwardhan&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to use a novel feedback-based pacing control approach to study anomalous beat-by-beat alterations in the shape of the ECG T-wave. This research has a total of four aims: (1) To determine contribution of restitution dependent effects in amplitude of period doubling bifurcation; (2) To determine if enhanced residual memory in restitution increases stability of activation; (3) To develop portable feedback based pacing control approach that can be implemented with ease in diverse electrophysiology laboratories; and (4). To use mathematical modeling to further explore causes of period doubling bifurcation and the role of restitution and memory. This study challenges an existing accepted model and could potentially make an important contribution to the field. The project is a combination of experimental and computational modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of greatest importance is the potential to make a profound contribution to the understanding of electrical activity within the heart, and down the road to improve electrical stimulation therapies such as pacemakers and other implantable or emergency use devices required after cardiac arrhythmias. The project will include students of all ages to perform the research, particularly for Aim 3 in which the Labview code will be developed. This effort, particularly for high school students and undergraduate seniors, provide important research opportunities for young students from Kentucky.</AbstractNarration>
