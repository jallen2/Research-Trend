    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-0722493&lt;br/&gt;The Real Time Digital Simulator is a unique integration of hardware and software for performing simulation of power systems with external hardware in the simulation loop. Intellectual Merit: The research activities to be conducted with the Simulator will advance science and technology and enable our students to grasp the physics behind power system dynamic phenomenon. For example, real time modeling and simulation can help identify the root causes of fast voltage collapse and design effective countermeasures for improving power system reliability. Additionally, the Simulator provides rapid prototyping capability for developing new control algorithms for renewable and distributed energy systems. This instrument will be used as a platform for integrated hands-on research training/education for undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of power system modeling and simulation, protective relaying, power electronics and controls, etc. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Simulator will complement on-going research and education activities for power and energy systems at Tennessee Technological University. The Simulator will positively impact our research and educational outcomes and benefit several other local organizations. Many faculty members, students and underrepresented groups including women will have access to the high-tech state-of-the-art instrument. Further, the Simulator will foster a good collaboration with faculty and students at Tennessee State University, a member of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Effective plans such as free training workshops are devised to facilitate broader accessibility of the Simulator. On a broader sense, the proposed research and training activities will contribute to the power system security and benefit our national agenda of power grid modernization in the wake of several recent major blackouts.</AbstractNarration>
