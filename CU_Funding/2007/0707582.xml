    <AbstractNarration>Grabovsky&lt;br/&gt;0707582&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator focuses on the understanding and systematic&lt;br/&gt;study of instabilities that can be explained by variational&lt;br/&gt;principles of minimum energy. One such instability is buckling. &lt;br/&gt;Buckling is ubiquitous and very important in engineering and&lt;br/&gt;mechanics. Modern engineering models of buckling, though very&lt;br/&gt;successful, are not related to 3D hyperelasticity, which is&lt;br/&gt;supposed to contain a description of all elastic phenomena,&lt;br/&gt;including buckling. The project initiates a systematic study of&lt;br/&gt;all elastic instabilities, putting buckling in its proper setting&lt;br/&gt;within a general theory. Another interesting and important&lt;br/&gt;instability studied by the project is nucleation of a new phase&lt;br/&gt;in martensitic phase transitions. This study is also related to&lt;br/&gt;rate-independent hysteresis -- an unexpected phenomenon of&lt;br/&gt;history dependence, that does not yet have a universally&lt;br/&gt;agreed-upon explanation. The energy-based model of martensitic&lt;br/&gt;phase transformations was very successful at predicting many&lt;br/&gt;aspects of behavior of shape memory alloys. Hysteresis, however,&lt;br/&gt;could be explained by this model only if one assumes that the&lt;br/&gt;material "gets stuck" in metastable states, modeled as local&lt;br/&gt;energy minima. The project provides a hitherto missing general&lt;br/&gt;tool for identifying metastable states, allowing one to construct&lt;br/&gt;and analyze continuum mechanical models with hysteresis&lt;br/&gt;quantitatively on the basis of the energy-minimization principle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project aims to advance our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearly elastic materials, such as polymers and rubbers and&lt;br/&gt;materials with shape memory effect. When loads are applied to&lt;br/&gt;these materials, they deform in such a way as to minimize the&lt;br/&gt;total energy stored in the deformed system. When the loads&lt;br/&gt;increase, the nonlinear nature of these materials often manifests&lt;br/&gt;itself in the appearance of new ways to decrease the energy. &lt;br/&gt;When this happens, physicists talk of instabilities. One of the&lt;br/&gt;most common instabilities is buckling, which occurs when the load&lt;br/&gt;on a slender column exceeds a certain critical value. Recent&lt;br/&gt;work of the investigator with Lev Truskinovsky produced a new&lt;br/&gt;understanding of buckling that is used in this project to explore&lt;br/&gt;new methods of computing buckling loads for structures with&lt;br/&gt;complex geometries, such as elastic shells and composite&lt;br/&gt;materials. The systematic study of elastic instabilities that is&lt;br/&gt;performed in this project also sheds some light on&lt;br/&gt;rate-independent hysteresis -- a still poorly understood&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon, whereby a shape memory alloy follows different&lt;br/&gt;deformation paths upon loading and unloading. The project's&lt;br/&gt;contribution towards better understanding of instabilities&lt;br/&gt;permits a quantitative analysis of one of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;explanations for hysteresis, that the material "gets stuck" in&lt;br/&gt;local minima. The project also presents educational and training&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. Parts of&lt;br/&gt;this project form the cores of doctoral dissertations of the&lt;br/&gt;investigator's graduate students, while other parts inform the&lt;br/&gt;content of advanced undergraduate classes and independent&lt;br/&gt;studies.</AbstractNarration>
