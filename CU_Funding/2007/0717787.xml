    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taylor University is promoting and disseminating high-quality STEM education using a novel and proven High-Altitude Research Platform (HARP) to develop faculty expertise, implement educational innovations, and assess learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students and faculty are engaged in state-of-the-art stratospheric balloon launch capability into the ""unknown"" with real-time data and command interaction. Students are gaining new awareness of the environment, atmosphere, space, and heavens by direct probing and remote sensing from ""New Heights"" (over 98% of atmosphere at 33 km altitude). This program is providing students access to near space and engaging them in creative problem solving, fun, and multidisciplinary hands-on team work in a relatively unexplored region of our atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology is being disseminated through four faculty workshops, compiling teaching materials, developing and maintaining a website network, assisting university HARP start-ups, and publishing initial workshop and student assessments. At least 20 universities will implement a HARP program into their curricula, and to achieve that goal we are establishing workshops which include DePauw University, University of Illinois, Cedarville University, Purdue, Stanford, Valparaiso, U.</AbstractNarration>
