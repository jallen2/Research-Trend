    <AbstractNarration>As part of International Polar Year (IPY) activities, the proposed SGER project would create a pan global partner network of organizations within countries currently engaged in Arctic social science research to develop policies and procedures for creating an International Directory Scientists (IDASS). The proposed project has significant intellectual merit because the development of a global, open source directory could increase cooperation among Arctic social scientists by providing a tool to create research teams that are multi-disciplinary and international. The IDASS could have significant broader impacts by including indigenous organizations and students conducting Arctic social science research, which have been underrepresented in previous directory efforts. The eventual international directory of Arctic social scientists would leave a legacy of data and electronic infrastructure to facilitate future polar research, it would expand international partnerships and cooperation, and it would result in a comprehensive source of social scientists and organizations conducting Arctic research. The anticipated outcome of the SGER project will be to obtain agreements by partners to establish a management tool that provides the parameters for creating the data base structure and access portal and begin soliciting participation in the directory by organizations and individuals.</AbstractNarration>
