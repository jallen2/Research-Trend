    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0705233, 0705381&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Matthew Ando, Eric R. Sharpe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ando and Sharpe will investigate several questions in elliptic&lt;br/&gt;cohomology suggested by the physics of open string theory. In&lt;br/&gt;physics, elliptic genera arise in closed string theory, but the&lt;br/&gt;recent work of Stolz and Teichner and of Borisov and Libgover and&lt;br/&gt;Ganter strongly suggests that open string theory plays an&lt;br/&gt;important role in elliptic cohomology. Ando and Sharpe propose to&lt;br/&gt;introduce recent developments in open string theory, particularly&lt;br/&gt;ideas about D-branes and K-theory, to the study of elliptic&lt;br/&gt;cohomology. For example they hope to use open string theory to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the relationship between elliptic cohomology and the&lt;br/&gt;K-theory of K-theory, as studied by Baas, Dundas, Richter, and&lt;br/&gt;Rognes. They also hope to give a unified account of the McKay&lt;br/&gt;correspondence for elliptic genera, due to Borisov and Libgober,&lt;br/&gt;and for sheaves, due to Bridgeland, King, and Reid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elliptic cohomology arises from topology, and it signals a&lt;br/&gt;profound relationship between physics, particularly the physics&lt;br/&gt;of string theory, and at least two branches of mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;topology and number theory. Precisely how these things are&lt;br/&gt;related through elliptic cohomology remains mysterious: the&lt;br/&gt;physicist Edward Witten called elliptic cohomology "a piece of&lt;br/&gt;21st century mathematics that happened to fall into the 20th&lt;br/&gt;century." Until very recently, the study of the physics of&lt;br/&gt;elliptic cohomology has focused mainly on "closed" string theory,&lt;br/&gt;in which particles are replaced by loops of string. There is now&lt;br/&gt;a rich theory of "open" strings, in which particles may also be&lt;br/&gt;unlooped strands of string. Ando and Sharpe suggest that the&lt;br/&gt;physics of open string theory has deep implications in elliptic&lt;br/&gt;cohomology. They propose to investigate several of these&lt;br/&gt;implications, which they hope will shed light on some of the&lt;br/&gt;important mysteries in the subject.</AbstractNarration>
