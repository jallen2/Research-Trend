    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-0725552&lt;br/&gt;Christi Madsen&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to enable a novel device on a platform with the capability to integrate various optical functions while simultaneously maintaining low-loss and high-speed modulation and programmability. The outcomes of this project have wide-ranging potential to transform applications that require high-speed and flexible signal processing. We propose a novel device that makes possible filtering on an electro-optic substrate, thus enabling high-speed programmability with low loss and low power consumption, and the integration of modulation and filtering functionalities. Low loss and high index contrast waveguides are key to enabling greater optical circuit integration densities. The long-standing integrated-optics platform for high-speed modulation is lithium niobate; however, only low-index contrast waveguides can be fabricated in this material, which severely limits the achievable integration density and prohibits integration of small ring resonators for realizing resonant-enhanced filters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include providing hands-on fabrication experience, where the design tradeoffs are ultimately revealed, and broadening the educational scope of undergraduate and graduate electrical engineering students, including underrepresented groups. By studying and applying concepts from across the fields of materials science, electrical engineering, and optics, students will be better prepared for the interdisciplinary nature of the workforce. The PI is actively involved in recruiting and mentoring a diverse base of students through her advisor's role with the Society of Women Engineer's student chapter and undergraduate research programs. Society benefits through the advancements in this signal processing research which impacts technology utilized in medical imaging, communications, sensing for homeland security, and biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
