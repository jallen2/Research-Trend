    <AbstractNarration>Through this project, the college is building on its commitment to student success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs. This project combines NSF scholarships with the New York State-Funded Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) to improve student enrollment and success. CSTEP provides extensive recruiting and academic support services for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students in mathematics, science, and technology fields. Forming a distinct cohort, CSTEP students participate in many academic support, experiential learning and career exploration services together. Despite support structures available through CSTEP, student success is compromised by job and family responsibilities. Most CSTEP students have significant financial need remaining after financial aid, and must take loans and work part-time to make ends meet. Program objectives are to increase awareness about STEM programs and CSTEP, increase enrollment of economically disadvantaged and under-represented students in STEM disciplines and in CSTEP, and improve retention and graduation rates of CSTEP students in STEM programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The Collegiate Science and Technology Program has demonstrated success in supporting students in STEM programs through advising, career exploration, and academic program enhancements. This activity advances understanding of effective recruiting and support initiatives for STEM programs by combining two support programs, CSTEP and NSF S-STEM, to strengthen the success and impact of each. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This activity helps define the degree to which financial assistance improves STEM program enrollment and student performance among financially needy students and helps the college develop long-term strategies to improve overall enrollment and performance in STEM disciplines. Results are being disseminated to other institutions with CSTEPs, to community colleges, and to partner four-year institutions with similar support programs.</AbstractNarration>
