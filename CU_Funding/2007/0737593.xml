    <AbstractNarration>The Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program (DAPCEP) project is a continuation of the current Youth-based Program. It has been revised to include a rigorous STEM curriculum by incorporating advanced information technology concepts in the context of automotive, energy and science engineering, ensuring quality instruction using IT experts and faculty from several universities, a strong parent involvement component, and college/awareness training. The program consists of teaching pre-college engineering courses integrated with advanced information technology concepts to middle and high school students. It continues to target 7th and 9th grade students in the Detroit Metropolitan Area. One hundred and twenty (120) students will participate. Two cohort groups of 7th graders and two cohort groups of 9th graders will be formed. Each of the four groups will include a minimum of 30 students allowing for a total of 120 students to be served. The project design includes a technology-programming component with a curriculum to expose students to a diverse range of experiences with engineering problems and appropriate information technology applications to solve. The program has an infrastructure of educational, community, business and parental support that will foster student motivation and interest to pursue postsecondary options or careers in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
