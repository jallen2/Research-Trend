    <AbstractNarration>Abstract (Technical)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymeric nanocomposites are of interest to several high technology sectors. While the applications are diverse, the range of loadings that a structure made up of nanocomposites will be subjected to is quite complex. Researchers at Tuskegee University's Center for Advanced Materials (T-CAM) have successfully utilized nanotechnology and are able to produce new types of structural composites through the support from NSF-CREST, -IEGRT, PREM, EPSCoR, ARO, AFRL, and ONR. Most of the work done to date is in the characterization of materials under uni-axial loading at room temperature under static conditions. The existing facilities at T-CAM are inadequate to carry out testing under multi-axial loading conditions. No data is currently available on the characterization of nanocomposite materials under combined torsion-axial loading conditions and also when exposed to different environmental conditions. Such data will be extremely useful to the designers in designing structural components and also in developing accurate life prediction models. The thrust of this proposal is, therefore, primarily directed towards acquiring a new biaxial material testing system (MTS) with an environmental chamber to enhance the current research capability and facilitate the execution of on-going research activities in the area of nanocomposites. Acquisition of the system will benefit a large number of African American students from undergraduate to Ph.D. level in science and engineering disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract (Non-Technical)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Advanced Materials (T-CAM) at Tuskegee University is conducting research involving nanotechnology in which nanomaterials which have at least one dimension of the order of thousandth of a human hair size are utilized to enhance the properties of fiber reinforced composite materials through grants founded by National Science Foundation, Federal Labs and industry. These materials when used in airplanes, rockets, cars, and tennis racquets make them stronger at the same time much lighter. However, before they can be utilized with confidence in these applications, they need to be tested under different loading conditions like combined twisting, bending or stretching. Further, these kinds of tests needs to carried out at very low to high temperatures. Through this proposal, we are seeking to purchase a new state of the art material test system that would facilitate these tests. A large number of African-American students from undergraduate to Ph. D level in science and engineering are currently involved with nanotechnology research at T-CAM. Acquisition of this facility will enable these students to have a hand-on experience in the emerging areas of nanotechnology, thereby creating much needed technical work force for the nation that is highly skilled and technically competent.</AbstractNarration>
