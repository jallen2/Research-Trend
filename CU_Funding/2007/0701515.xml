    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0505610&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Bruce A. Kleiner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project concerns two geometric evolution equations:&lt;br/&gt;mean curvature flow and Hamilton's Ricci flow. The main objective&lt;br/&gt;is to understand the structure of the singular set and the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;the solutions near the singular set.&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the research program is motivated by geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory and rigidity questions, specifically the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;structure of negatively curved (or Gromov hyperbolic) spaces.&lt;br/&gt;This leads to an investigation&lt;br/&gt;of spaces which have a self-similar character using analytic&lt;br/&gt;tools that have been developed in the last few years. Here&lt;br/&gt;the goal is to quasisymmetrically deform&lt;br/&gt; the space into an optimal form, if possible,&lt;br/&gt;in order to reveal hidden symmetries; show that&lt;br/&gt;no hidden symmetries exist; or show that the original space&lt;br/&gt;was really a deformation of something familiar. This is directly&lt;br/&gt;related to group theoretic rigidity problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to study two nonlinear analogs of the heat equation: the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of surfaces by their mean curvature, and Hamilton's&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow. Mean curvature flow is a standard (idealized) model for&lt;br/&gt;many physical process which involve an evolving surface, or interface,&lt;br/&gt;between two regions in space. The Ricci flow -- an equation&lt;br/&gt;governing a curved space geometry which evolves with time --&lt;br/&gt; has made headlines lately due to its&lt;br/&gt;prominent role in the spectacular work of Perelman on the 100 year old Poincare&lt;br/&gt;conjecture. Much is known about the solutions of these two equations,&lt;br/&gt;but many basic open questions remain, especially those tied with the&lt;br/&gt;formation of singularities, which play a central role in Perelman's work.&lt;br/&gt;The project will address some of these questions.&lt;br/&gt;Another component of the research program is an investigation&lt;br/&gt;of spaces which have a self-similar, or fractal character, using analytic&lt;br/&gt;tools that have been developed in the last few years. Here&lt;br/&gt;the goal is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible,&lt;br/&gt;in order to reveal hidden symmetries, show that&lt;br/&gt;no hidden symmetries exist, or show that the original space&lt;br/&gt;was really a deformation of something familiar. This is very useful&lt;br/&gt;for understanding the asymptotic shape of infinite groups of symmetries.</AbstractNarration>
