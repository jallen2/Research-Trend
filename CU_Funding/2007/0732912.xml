    <AbstractNarration>The Southwestern Research Station (SWRS), under the direction of the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation (CBC) of the American Museum of Natural History in New Yorkis located in a unique complex of about 27 mountain ranges, the Madrean Archipelago/Sky Islands of the southwestern U.S., and is surrounded by the Coronado National Forest. Both the uniqueness and high biodiversity of fauna and flora in the surrounding areas and the relatively undisturbed biotic communities coupled with the SWRS research facilities continue to attract outstanding scientists and students. The SWRS has hosted the work of over 1,000 scientists, including some long-term studies that are seminal contributions to the scientific understanding of biodiversity. The SWRS is a leader in mentoring students from around the world. The visiting student program provides high school graduates and college students with an opportunity to participate in research projects, and this experience aids them in making life-long career decisions. In order to meet the needs of a steadily growing number of researcher and educational users, the SWRS has recently developed a master plan takes into account the increased use of the SWRS and the growing needs of scientists and students that use the SWRS. The plan includes "green" building practices in all new and renovated constructions. This award based on the strategic plan will renovate the Osborn Memorial Laboratories to increase their capacity, improve their safety, and to provide for increased energy efficiency. The lab renovation will include window replacement, re-wiring, and new lab furniture, and major equipment acquisition includes drying ovens, ultra-low temperature freezers, and a liquid nitrogen tank.</AbstractNarration>
