    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project addresses the development of accurate models for near-ground electromagnetic propagation in the 10 MHz to 3 GHz frequency range. The model proposed will be an improvement over existing models because it will 1) provide the result over a wide frequency band; 2) provide a result that is more accurate for near-ground propagation; and 3) be applicable to scenarios with multiple radiation sources and destinations. The primary phenomena it simulates are reflection, diffraction and scattering. The model, based on a combination of several well-known outdoor and indoor propagation models and techniques, relies on information contained in terrain elevation, ground cover and other databases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of this research activity is that it will provide new insights into reduced-order modeling for large scale simulation. These insights will lead to a reduction in simulation redundancy and be applicable to electromagnetics and many other fields. There is a significant market for this technology in the SIGINT, COMINT, and ELINT sectors as well as the commercial sector.</AbstractNarration>
