    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I research project will demonstrate the feasibility of designing a solid state fan with performance characteristics that are superior to the conventional, rotating blade fans or centrifugal blowers that are typically used in conjunction with heat sinks. The goal is to develop an ion-drag type fan that is lower in cost, noiseless, an order of magnitude smaller in size and weight, more energy efficient and more reliable as compared to the standard axial fan or centrifugal blowers. A unique ion generation mechanism called self seeding electrodes will be evaluated. This will be done by modeling the mechanism and verifying the model with experiments. The fluid flow, heat transfer and dust tolerance capabilities of the new mechanism will also be evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The waste heat load produced by personal computers and consumer electronics continues to increase with a simultaneous decrease in overall product dimensions. This trend is straining the capabilities of conventional, air cooled heat sinking products. The impact of this new heat transfer technology will be in the area of mobile computing. The solid-state fan will enable laptop computers to further shrink in size while maintaining their performance. It will enable ultra-slim and even ultra-mobile computers (palm sized computers) to run full featured versions of operating systems and other PC software and perform at a similar level to their larger counterparts.</AbstractNarration>
