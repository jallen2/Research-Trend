    <AbstractNarration>Webspinners (order Embioptera) are a curious group of insects found&lt;br/&gt;mainly in tropical forests. Their biology is among the most poorly studied&lt;br/&gt;of any insect group even though webspinners are known to exhibit a range of&lt;br/&gt;unique biological phenomena. They are the only insects that spin silk from&lt;br/&gt;glands in their front legs, and they do so as both immatures and adults.&lt;br/&gt;They exhibit maternal care and often live in groups where they use silk to&lt;br/&gt;construct large and sometimes intricate galleries in which they live and&lt;br/&gt;rear their young. The types of galleries and behaviors associated with silk&lt;br/&gt;spinning vary considerably throughout the group, and nothing is known about&lt;br/&gt;the composition of silk proteins and the genetic basis for silk production.&lt;br/&gt;Although there are only about 400 species of webspinners known, estimates&lt;br/&gt;suggest there may be more than 1500 new species already in collections but&lt;br/&gt;not formally described and many more in Nature awaiting discovery.&lt;br/&gt;Webspinner classification is in a poor state never having been updated using&lt;br/&gt;a modern, phylogenetic basis. A collaborative research and training project&lt;br/&gt;between laboratories at three universities will assemble a group of&lt;br/&gt;researchers with the expertise to investigate the phylogeny, behavioral&lt;br/&gt;ecology and classification of the Embioptera. At Brigham Young University,&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic analyses will be conducted using molecular and morphological&lt;br/&gt;data and will form the basis of an improved natural classification of the&lt;br/&gt;group. At Santa Clara University, biological aspects of the insects such as&lt;br/&gt;colony construction, maternal care and habitat requirements will be examined&lt;br/&gt;within a phylogenetic context by tracing these features through the&lt;br/&gt;phylogeny. Finally, at the University of California, Riverside, the genetic&lt;br/&gt;basis for silk production will be examined by discovering the DNA sequences&lt;br/&gt;that code for silk in several species, and the variation in these silk genes&lt;br/&gt;will be investigated within the context of webspinner phylogeny. Results&lt;br/&gt;will be disseminated in scientific journals and through applications of&lt;br/&gt;modern, digital technology including digital image galleries, digital&lt;br/&gt;reproductions of literature, digital matrix-based identification keys, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Museum holdings of webspinners will be enhanced by curation and new material&lt;br/&gt;from fieldwork.&lt;br/&gt; This collaborative project represents the first comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;investigation of the phylogeny and biology of webspinners ever done. Since&lt;br/&gt;embiids occur in often fragile ecosystems, better knowledge of the group&lt;br/&gt;will likely have important relevance to conservation of these habitats.&lt;br/&gt;Also, this work will foster multidisciplinary collaboration between&lt;br/&gt;biologists in disparate fields and facilitate the training of postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;fellows and students in multidisciplinary research. The research will&lt;br/&gt;involve undergraduates extensively to give them a firm background in&lt;br/&gt;science, including proper research methods and ethics. When the project&lt;br/&gt;objectives are met, a historically little-known insect group will be more&lt;br/&gt;accessible to everyone through the published results, and a positive&lt;br/&gt;long-term impact on the scientific community will occur because of the broad&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary training of researchers at several academic levels.</AbstractNarration>
