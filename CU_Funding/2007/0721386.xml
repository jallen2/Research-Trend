    <AbstractNarration>This project will acquire a 0.6-meter research telescope for Swarthmore College which will be used with a separately-funded camera and spectrograph for faculty and student research. This research will include monitoring of accretion in young stars, a study of the winds of OB stars, and a study of Be stellar disks. These areas of research are best studied with a dedicated facility and large amounts of telescope time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This facility will enable research training of undergraduate astronomy majors, roughly half of whom are women, and a significant fraction of whom become professional scientists. The training includes experience in planning and carrying out observations using a research-grade instrument, and reducing, analyzing, and publishing the resulting data. The observatory will also be available to the larger astronomical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the MPS office of Multidisciplinary Activities</AbstractNarration>
