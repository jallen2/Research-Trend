    <AbstractNarration>Due to its inherent multidisciplinary nature, and its reliance on&lt;br/&gt;modern observational and experimental techniques, theory, and&lt;br/&gt;computation, the field of geophysical turbulence is difficult for&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to master. Advancement&lt;br/&gt;in the field, by-and-large, requires a collaborative effort involving&lt;br/&gt;scientists with diverse backgrounds having an understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;methodologies utilized and an appreciation of all the component parts.&lt;br/&gt;Young researchers are thus often required to be proficient in&lt;br/&gt;observing, applied mathematics, advanced scientific computing, and&lt;br/&gt;data analysis. In recognition of this fact, the University of Colorado&lt;br/&gt;and the Institute for Mathematics Applied to the Geosciences at the&lt;br/&gt;National Center for Atmospheric Research will host a three week summer&lt;br/&gt;school on Geophysical Turbulent Phenomena. The school will attract&lt;br/&gt;25-30 of the most competitive students in three important synergistic&lt;br/&gt;focus areas associated with Geophysical Turbulent phenomena:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(a) Observation and Experimentation;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(b) Theoretical Methodology for and Modeling of Geophysical Phenomena;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(c) Computation Methods, Scientific Computing and Visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will come from a wide array of disciplines including&lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics, computational science, atmospheric and oceanic&lt;br/&gt;science, and applied and fundamental physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geophysical turbulent phenomena are the foundation for a broad range&lt;br/&gt;of poorly understood processes that are critical to the climate&lt;br/&gt;system. Advances in these areas require collaborative research between&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, computational scientists, and geoscientists. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed three-week summer school will devote one week to each of&lt;br/&gt;three crucial areas of the field: 1) observations and experimentation,&lt;br/&gt;2) theoretical and modeling issues, and 3) computational methods,&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing and visualization. Students will attend lectures&lt;br/&gt;by principal lecturers and research lecturers in each of the three&lt;br/&gt;areas. In addition, significant time will be devoted to practical&lt;br/&gt;exercises in geophysical turbulence, were the students will work in&lt;br/&gt;small multidisciplinary collaborative groups. The skills and&lt;br/&gt;experiences students gain in the school will have a direct and&lt;br/&gt;significant impact on their current and future research, enhancing&lt;br/&gt;their ability to achieve important results in their thesis research.&lt;br/&gt;The school will be co-sponsored by the National Center for Atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;Research, which will share half the costs. By providing young&lt;br/&gt;scientists with a solid foundation in this fundamental area of&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric, oceanic, and climate science, the school will serve to&lt;br/&gt;contribute to future excellence in the field. A diverse group of&lt;br/&gt;students and lecturers will be recruited, broadening diversity in the&lt;br/&gt;scientific community. Students will receive interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;training, and practice working in an interdisciplinary collaborative&lt;br/&gt;setting. Students will be trained in important areas of active&lt;br/&gt;research. The cross-disciplinary relationships built in this school&lt;br/&gt;will enhance the students' careers and improve their ability to become&lt;br/&gt;successful researchers.</AbstractNarration>
