    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0707014&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: James E. McClure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to work in four quite different&lt;br/&gt;areas where homotopy-theoretic methods can be applied. The first&lt;br/&gt;area is string topology. This part of the project is joint with&lt;br/&gt;Ralph Kaufmann; Kaufmann and McClure will combine their previous&lt;br/&gt;work on string topology in order to obtain a lifting of string&lt;br/&gt;topology to the chain level for arbitrary genus. The second area&lt;br/&gt;is surgery spectra. This is joint with Gerd Laures; Laures and&lt;br/&gt;McClure will complete their proof that certain symmetric&lt;br/&gt;L-spectra have E-infinity ring structures and that the symmetric&lt;br/&gt;signature is an E-infinity ring map. They will also extend their&lt;br/&gt;work in order to show that a certain map from algebraic K-theory&lt;br/&gt;to symmetric L-theory defined by Weiss and Williams is an&lt;br/&gt;E-infinity ring map. The third area is intersection homology.&lt;br/&gt;This is joint with Greg Friedman and Scott Wilson; Friedman,&lt;br/&gt;McClure and Wilson will work to develop homotopy theoretic&lt;br/&gt;structure on intersection chains which should (for example) lead&lt;br/&gt;to the development of a rational homotopy theory of stratified&lt;br/&gt;spaces. The fourth area is C* algebras. This is joint with&lt;br/&gt;Marius Dadarlat; Dadarlat and McClure will work to show that the&lt;br/&gt;classical work of Dixmier and Douady on bundles whose fibre is&lt;br/&gt;the algebra of compact operators can be extended to bundles whose&lt;br/&gt;fibre is a Kirchberg algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original goal of homotopy theory was to develop methods which&lt;br/&gt;could be applied to geometric problems (including problems in&lt;br/&gt;dimensions higher than three). Since its origin in the early&lt;br/&gt;twentieth century, homotopy theory has developed into an&lt;br/&gt;autonomous discipline, but the connection with geometry has&lt;br/&gt;always been a central concern. Since about 1960, it has become&lt;br/&gt;apparent that homotopy theory has applications to other things&lt;br/&gt;besides geometry, for example to analysis, algebra, and more&lt;br/&gt;recently to physics. The work of the principal investigator and&lt;br/&gt;his coauthors is intended to take the latest developments in&lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory (for example, the theory of symmetric spectra)&lt;br/&gt;and apply them to other areas, including geometric problems (the&lt;br/&gt;classification of higher-dimensional shapes), and problems in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics (string topology is part of the program&lt;br/&gt;being carried on by many people to develop a clearer mathematical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of ideas from string theory).</AbstractNarration>
