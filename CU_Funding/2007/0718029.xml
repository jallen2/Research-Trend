    <AbstractNarration>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) constitute two major classes of small regulatory RNAs that play crucial roles in development, metabolism, and genome organization in plants, fungi and animals. In a previous NSF funded project, the PI's group uncovered a new step in plant miRNA biogenesis methylation of the 2' OH of the 3' terminal nucleotides. The 2'-O-methyl group protects miRNAs from a uridylation activity and an exonuclease activity. In this project, the PI's and co-PI's groups will employ biochemical approaches to probe the functions of methylation and uridylation and to use genetic approaches to identify the genes encoding the uridylation enzyme and/or the exonuclease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small RNAs have a profound impact on an organism's development and physiology. Understanding how small RNAs are generated, modified and degraded provides the intellectual foundation to probe various biological processes involving small RNA regulation. Although how small RNAs are processed from their precursors is well understood, little is known about how they are modified or degraded. By uncovering mechanisms in small RNA modification and degradation, this research will have profound impacts on the small RNA field and will ultimately contribute to a deeper understanding of small RNA biology and to the development of small RNA-based technologies to improve agriculture. The project will also provide research opportunities for a number of undergraduate students, including ones from underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
