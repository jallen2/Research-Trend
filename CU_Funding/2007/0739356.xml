    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Eric Hegg at the Michigan State University to model the active site of acetyl-CoA synthase. This unusual enzyme allows certain organisms to use carbon dioxide as their sole carbon source. Model complexes will be prepared that will lead to a better understanding of the active site and the reaction mechanism of acetyl-CoA synthase. Ultimately this work will provide important information concerning acetyl-CoA biosynthesis and enzymatic C1/C2 chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrated within this research is an educational component designed to improve undergraduate biochemistry courses. A major thrust of this plan is to develop and utilize computer-based laboratory modules that will allow students to apply the concepts learned in class, demonstrate real-world applications of the information covered in the course, and expose them to the many new technologies required in modern biochemical research.</AbstractNarration>
