    <AbstractNarration>Orthologous genes, or orthologs, are genes in different species&lt;br/&gt;that have evolved directly from a common ancestral gene.&lt;br/&gt;Genome-scale assignment of orthologs is a fundamental and&lt;br/&gt;challenging problem in computational biology, and has a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of applications in comparative genomics and functional genomics.&lt;br/&gt;This project continues the development of the parsimony approach&lt;br/&gt;for assigning orthologs between closely related genomes &lt;br/&gt;which essentially attempts to transform &lt;br/&gt;one genome into another by the smallest number of genome rearrangement&lt;br/&gt;events including reversal, translocation, fusion, and fission, as well as&lt;br/&gt;gene duplication events. The project addresses three key algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;problems including (i) signed reversal distance with&lt;br/&gt;duplicates, (ii) signed transposition distance with duplicates,&lt;br/&gt;and (iii) minimum common string partition. Efficient solutions to each of&lt;br/&gt;these problems are combined and incorporated into a software system for &lt;br/&gt;ortholog assignment, called MSOAR. The project encompasses &lt;br/&gt;genome-wide analysis of orthologous (and paralogous) relationships on &lt;br/&gt;the human and mouse genomes to valdiate the approach, and more importantly,&lt;br/&gt;to address several important evolutionary biological questions including &lt;br/&gt;the characterization of gains and losses of duplicated genes in the &lt;br/&gt;two genomes, the elucidation of gene movements in one genome with respect &lt;br/&gt;to the other genome, and the quantification of different mechanisms of &lt;br/&gt;gene duplication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The parsimony approach presents a novel method for performing genome-wide&lt;br/&gt;ortholog assignment that takes into account both gene sequences and locations.&lt;br/&gt;The above algorithmic problems are new in the literature and their solutions&lt;br/&gt;likely require the introduction of novel algorithm design and analysis&lt;br/&gt;techniques. The questions regarding gene duplication and quantification of &lt;br/&gt;the duplication mechanisms in model species are of fundamental importance &lt;br/&gt;in evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As ortholog assignment is a fundamental problem in comparative genomics and&lt;br/&gt;has become a routine practice in almost all areas of genomics, MSOAR&lt;br/&gt;will find itself a wide range of applications in biology and genomics.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the research will provide the training opportunity for two computer &lt;br/&gt;science graduate students in the interdisciplinary field of computational biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information concerning this NSF project will be provided at the website:&lt;br/&gt;http://msoar.cs.ucr.edu/</AbstractNarration>
