    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this work is to investigate a new paradigm wherein electricity customers install utility-compatible generation sources in their homes or facilities, each acting as an autonomous agent with economic, technical and social responses. In this microgrid, the utility acts as a facilitator, allowing customers to form ad hoc networks in emergencies. The approach is to develop a framework using multi-agent systems theory, and demonstrate it through high-fidelity modeling using a real-time digital simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in extensive development, testing and demonstration of a new paradigm for a novel, completely autonomous, microgrid. Techniques that allow arbitrary installation of generation to cooperate as autonomous systems islands during emergencies have not been heretofore investigated extensively. This research will develop requisite theory, and demonstrate concepts that support autonomous operation of islands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact includes a potential breakthrough in an emerging solution to reliable, secure and sustainable electric power systems; controller characterization through high-fidelity simulations to uncover hidden issues for sharing with manufacturing community to develop robust controllers; and preparing the next generation workforce for tomorrow's technologically advanced systems. Autonomous microgrids with high penetration of distributed resources are expected to constitute a significant part of the reliable and secure energy delivery infrastructure of tomorrow. Widespread microgrids mitigate the stress on power grids, and provide security against disruption caused by inadvertent events such as storms, or malicious intent. The development of such microgrids requires fundamental R&amp;D such as this project, and progress in energy technologies, public policy and utility business models.</AbstractNarration>
