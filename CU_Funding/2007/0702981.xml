    <AbstractNarration>The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University continues to collect, via a web survey, the data needed to assess the impact and effectiveness of the Advanced Technological Education program for another two years. The survey addresses four basic questions: a) to what extent is the ATE program achieving its goals; b) to what extent it is making an impact on the individuals and groups intended; c) how effective it is when it reaches its constituents; and d) how the program can be improved. In addition, the project provides information to guide and assist projects, centers, and educators in their efforts to collect, report, and effectively use evaluative information to serve their needs. The project works with stakeholders to revise and shorten the survey to focus on collection of the most relevant information. A shortened survey is being pilot tested and revised to assure propriety and feasibility of the procedures and assure accuracy and utility of the evaluation findings. The project administers the survey, processes and analyzes the data, and prepares and disseminates reports to serve the community's information and evaluation needs.</AbstractNarration>
