    <AbstractNarration>Duke University is awarded a grant to improve facilities at the Las Cruces Biological Station, Costa Rica by 1) constructing four new cabins for researchers to ease congestion, especially during peak periods; 2) increasing student residential space to simultaneously accommodate two courses by remodeling former offices in the Wilson house; 4) upgrading cyberinfrastructure - and in particular increase bandwidth and wireless coverage, and install IP telephones; and 5) replacing outdated equipment in the laboratory and the newly re-inaugurated herbarium. These changes will ease accommodation problems, improve the versatility of the station, and bring the facilities at LCBS up to date with student and researcher needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Duke University is a member of the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), a consortium of 62 universities and research institutions from the United States, Latin America, South Africa, and Australia. Founded in 1963 with a mission to provide leadership in education, research and the responsible use of natural resources in the tropics, OTS owns and operates three biological field stations in Costa Rica: Las Cruces (tropical premontane rainforest); Palo Verde (seasonally dry lowland forest); and La Selva (wet lowland rainforest). The Las Cruces Biological Station (LCBS) was purchased by OTS in 1973 and over the years has established itself as a key mid-elevational tropical research station.</AbstractNarration>
