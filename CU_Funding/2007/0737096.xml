    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing laboratory and classroom activities for analytical chemistry and biochemistry that combine both project-based laboratory experiments and Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). Concurrent laboratory and classroom courses are introducing students to two chromatography instruments while integrating chromatographic and mass spectral data into classroom activities. This project is extending the use of guided inquiry learning into analytical chemistry as well as developing complementary laboratory and classroom activities that encompass two dimensions of professional education - cognitive understanding and skill development. These activities, with their emphasis on developing initial questions and drawing conclusions from data sets, are also providing additional resources that can be used to prepare students for participation in undergraduate research. The project is assessing progress by several means - communal primary trait analysis, laboratory skills assessment, knowledge surveys, focus groups, and feedback from an external evaluator. The laboratory and classroom activities are being disseminated via the internet, conferences, and publications.</AbstractNarration>
