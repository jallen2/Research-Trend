    <AbstractNarration>AWARD NO: AST-0732444&lt;br/&gt;PI: Frederic Rasio&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Conference on ""Extreme Solar Systems"", Santorini, Greece&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for partial travel support to attendees from US institutions to attend the conference Extreme Solar Systems to be held in Santorini, Greece, 25-29 June 2007. The meeting is expected to bring together about 150 researchers from the US, Europe, and Asia, and will focus on the ""extreme"" aspects of current research on extrasolar planets, such as developments toward the detection and characterization of terrestrial-mass planets, planets and ""hot Jupiters"" around evolved stars, including giants, white dwarfs and neutron stars, and on a number of other currently debated important topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the short history of planet detection around other stars, this is the first meeting that has been devised to address a broad range of topics with specific emphasis on the extreme character of extrasolar planets. The topics covered by this conference address key problems in a frontier research field of highly interdisciplinary character. Most of the presentations by leaders in the field will be related to issues at or beyond the current limits of our knowledge of the extrasolar planetary systems. The meeting will provide common grounds for a large number of experts to exchange ideas and advance understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems around other stars. This knowledge is necessary to obtain a consistent integrated picture of the physics of planetary systems and to better constrain our understanding of the origins of life on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable more students, junior researchers, scientists and smaller institutions, and members of underrepresented groups to participate.</AbstractNarration>
