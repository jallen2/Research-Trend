    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to investigate link and routing protocols for&lt;br/&gt;multi-hop wireless sensor networks that use a type of cooperative&lt;br/&gt;transmission called opportunistic large arrays (OLAs). An OLA is a large&lt;br/&gt;group of simple, inexpensive relays or forwarding nodes that behave&lt;br/&gt;without coordination between each other, but they naturally fire together&lt;br/&gt;in response to energy received from a single source or another OLA. Each&lt;br/&gt;node has just one antenna, however because the nodes are separated in&lt;br/&gt;space, they collectively provide diversity protection from multipath&lt;br/&gt;fading and they can reap the spectrum efficiency of a&lt;br/&gt;multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system. It has been shown that under&lt;br/&gt;sufficient conditions during broadcast, OLAs form concentric rings that&lt;br/&gt;cover the whole network. Even when flooding the whole network, OLA&lt;br/&gt;networks have been shown theoretically to have significant advantages over&lt;br/&gt;conventional multi-hop networks in terms of reduced transmit energy, lower&lt;br/&gt;node complexity, better connectivity, and shorter end-to-end delay.&lt;br/&gt;Reduced energy consumption means sensor batteries last longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will further reduce the energy consumption of OLA networks by&lt;br/&gt;limiting the flood to be more like a river, many nodes wide, exploiting&lt;br/&gt;the ring structure to guide a message up to the sink. Developed protocols&lt;br/&gt;will exploit the trade-off between diversity and spatial multiplexing&lt;br/&gt;within OLAs to achieve connectivity while maximizing throughput. OLA link&lt;br/&gt;layer protocols will enable the river to flow around obstacles such as&lt;br/&gt;blockages or clusters of destroyed nodes, and resolve the situation when&lt;br/&gt;rivers collide.</AbstractNarration>
