    <AbstractNarration>We will bring together top researchers, as well as graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and young mathematicians from the U.S., in both algebraic geometry and complex analysis for a five-day Workshop from April 30 to May 4, 2007, at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques in Montreal. The workshop will focus on a key aspect of the structure&lt;br/&gt;and classification of complex algebraic varieties: the conjectures of Lang and others on the existence and properties of algebraic and holomorphic curves in complex varieties. Both analytic and algebraic techniques have recently played a role in making inroads into these conjectures, which are related to Mori's program on the algebraic side and which refine Nevanlinna's Second Main Theorem on the analytic side. The workshop will bring the experts in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry and complex analysis together to foster further interaction and collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex algebraic varieties, which are the solution sets of polynomial equations, provide models for describing physical problems in science and engineering. The understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;structure and classification of these varieties is a central theme in both algebraic geometry and complex analysis. The workshop will introduce recent developments in this area to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty members, as well as to senior mathematicians. Approximately 50 mathematicians, at all stages in their research careers, are expected to participate; eight of the invited speakers are postdoctoral researchers or junior faculty members. In addition to the scheduled talks, we&lt;br/&gt;shall provide ample time for open discussions during the afternoons in order to encourage active participation by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Most of the funding will go towards paying travel expenses of graduate students, young mathematicians and members of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
