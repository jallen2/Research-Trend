    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0704404&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Jeff Cheeger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first main goal (joint with G. Tian) is to describe the how&lt;br/&gt;Einstein metrics can degenerate. In our previous work we gave a&lt;br/&gt;good local description of collapse of Einstein metrics in&lt;br/&gt;dimension 4, showing that away from a definite number of points&lt;br/&gt;collapse occurs with bounded curvature and in the limit, gives&lt;br/&gt;rise to Einstein metrics with continous symmetries. We want to&lt;br/&gt;globalize this local description and, in so far as possible,&lt;br/&gt;extend it to higher dimensions. A second main goal of the&lt;br/&gt;project, joint with B. Kleiner, is to study first order calculus&lt;br/&gt;on metric measure spaces for (Lipschitz) functions with values in&lt;br/&gt;infinite dimensional Banach spaces. In this context,&lt;br/&gt;differentiation theorems can give rise to bi-Lipschitz&lt;br/&gt;nonembedding theorems. For applications arising in computer&lt;br/&gt;science, the most interesting target is the space "Ell-One". In&lt;br/&gt;this case, a Lipschitz function need not be differentiable&lt;br/&gt;(anywhere) unless (as Kleiner and I discovered) differentiability&lt;br/&gt;is understood in a suitable extended sense. This sense was still&lt;br/&gt;strong enough to enable us give a counter example to the&lt;br/&gt;Goemans-Linial conjecture. An important aspect of the present&lt;br/&gt;project (joint with Kleiner and A. Naor) is to make this&lt;br/&gt;nonembedding theorem quantitative (which is what computer&lt;br/&gt;scientists really want). Our approach requires the developement&lt;br/&gt;of new techniques in geometric measure theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of certain special (higher dimensional) smoothly curved&lt;br/&gt;objects called Einstein manifolds is important in mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;in modern physics e.g. in connection with the theory of&lt;br/&gt;relativity and in string theory. In particular, we want a theory&lt;br/&gt;which tells us what can be the "most distorted" examples of such&lt;br/&gt;objects. Our project is concerned with this issue. A second&lt;br/&gt;main focus has to do with "metric spaces". By a metric space,&lt;br/&gt;one can understand any collection of objects where there is a&lt;br/&gt;notion of distance between any two of them. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;objects might be finger prints and a suitable notion of distance&lt;br/&gt;would enable a computer to detect which finger prints closely&lt;br/&gt;matcheda given one. A key issue in both the pure and applied&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the subject, is to be able to decide whether a&lt;br/&gt;"complicated" metric space which one wants to understand, can be&lt;br/&gt;realized (perhaps in a non-obvious way) as a subset of a&lt;br/&gt;"simpler" metrric space which one already understands. In our&lt;br/&gt;project, sophistocated tools from pure mathematics are developed&lt;br/&gt;which can be used in various cases (of pure and applied interest)&lt;br/&gt;to decide the feasibility of such an approach.</AbstractNarration>
