    <AbstractNarration>The projected experiments will lead to new advances in understanding of DNA replication and in technology development. DNA replication starts at "origins of replication" of which there are many in all the chromosomes in a cell. There are exquisite controls to ensure that each origin of replication is not activated more than once per cell cycle. When cells override these regulatory controls, regions can become re-replicated leading to gene amplification that is a hallmark of many cancers. To understand such overrides, it is important to have fundamental knowledge about the origins of replication themselves. Although several methods exist to map replication origins, their results are not in full agreement with one another. The focus of this project is to refine a new nanopore sequencing technology using the MinION sequencing device. One future application of the projected refinement is to provide a new method to map origins of replication genome-wide. There are also many other important applications as summarized below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to advance the nascent technology of nanopore DNA sequencing to obtain ultra-long reads, using the MinION sequencing device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The projected experiments include: (i) improved preparation of ultra-long DNA; (ii) characterizing the signal space of the nanopore device; (iii) testing hybrid assembly methods using the MinION coupled to other methods; (iv) direct nanopore sequencing of non-amplified, single-molecule, ultra-long DNA with modified nucleotides as a platform for future experiments in DNA replication and other areas. The impact of sequencing ultra-long DNA molecules and being able to identify modified, labeled, or damaged bases is enormous and will be transformative to many scientific subfields. Development of methodology to obtain ultra-long MinION reads (up to megabase lengths) will dramatically enhance the contiguity of hybrid and non-hybrid genome assemblies, and will allow the exploration of numerous biological questions with a single molecule perspective. Ultra-long MinION reads as well as signal space operations will also allow researchers to discover the covariation of single nucleotide polymorphism (snp), chromosomal rearrangements, and base modification co variations on single molecules. There will be broad educational impact of the research, both in classroom teaching and as laboratory training for undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project. STEM education will be advanced by lectures in genomics and a Genomics Club organized by the graduate student funded by the grant. The PI will continue her track record to broaden participation by women and underrepresented minorities, and education of the public on biological research.</AbstractNarration>
