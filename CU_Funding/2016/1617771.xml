    <AbstractNarration>This project develops a logical framework that is well-adapted&lt;br/&gt;to the tasks of formulating and proving meta-theoretic properties of&lt;br/&gt;programming languages and the correctness of translators and&lt;br/&gt;compilers; these tasks arise naturally in the context of ensuring the&lt;br/&gt;safety and security of software. The framework being investigated is &lt;br/&gt;specialized to reasoning about relational specifications concerning &lt;br/&gt;formal objects that embody a binding structure. Such specifications &lt;br/&gt;simplify the encoding of formal systems that often treat syntactically &lt;br/&gt;complex constructs and that also manifest non-deterministic and &lt;br/&gt;non-terminating behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underlying the framework is an expressive first-order logic that allows&lt;br/&gt;predicates to be interpreted through fixed-point definitions and that&lt;br/&gt;also includes inductive and co-inductive principles for reasoning&lt;br/&gt;about such definitions. One project goal is to enrich the form of&lt;br/&gt;definitions permitted in this logic and to add the ability to quantify&lt;br/&gt;over properties or predicates to it. Another goal is to develop a methodology &lt;br/&gt;for using the enhanced logic in actual verification tasks such as proving &lt;br/&gt;the correctness of compilers for functional languages. The project will &lt;br/&gt;make available to the research community an enhanced software system that &lt;br/&gt;supports formalization and verification tasks of the kind outlined. At a&lt;br/&gt;foundational level, the research leads to a better understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the interaction between inductive definitions and higher-order&lt;br/&gt;quantification, an issue that is important to many modern&lt;br/&gt;theorem-proving systems.</AbstractNarration>
