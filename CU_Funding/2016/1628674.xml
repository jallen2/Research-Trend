    <AbstractNarration>The Southern Ocean (SO), meaning the global ocean of the high latitude Southern Hemisphere, has a well-deserved reputation as the stormiest place on earth. The remoteness of the SO and its unforgiving conditions have severely limited observations of atmospheric processes occurring above it, including cloud processes in the cyclones traveling along the South Polar front. Yet these processes are of interest for a variety of reasons, including the fact that SO clouds are relatively free from the effects of continental and anthropogenic aerosols, and the region is thus a natural laboratory for the study of cloud behavior under pristine conditions. SO clouds also play a significant cooling role in the energy balance of the planet by reflecting incoming sunlight back to space. There is evidence to suggest that this cooling has a long-range effect on the distribution of the low-latitude rainfall associated with the intertropical convergence zone, and that changes in SO cloudiness due to global climate change will affect the location and strength of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream. One indicator of our lack of understanding of SO cloud processes is the inadequate SO cloud cover found in climate model simulations, accompanied by excessive solar absorbtion by the ocean surface which may in turn cause errors in estimates of climate sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds planning and organizational activity for a field campaign titled Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). The campaign itself is not yet funded, nor does NSF commit to funding it by making this award. By making the award NSF encourages the PIs to submit a set of proposals requesting support for each of the various campaign activities, which are reviewed collectively at a later date. This second round of reviews determines whether the campaign goes to the field and what elements of the campaign are supported by NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The campaign consists of a deployment of the Gulfstream V (GV), a research aircraft maintained by the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, based either in Hobart, Australia or Christchurch, New Zealand. The GV would fly south across the polar front, reaching the colder waters beyond 55 degrees South, to obtain observations of atmospheric boundary layer structure and vertical distributions of clouds and aerosols, including cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleating particles (INPs). A key issue to be addressed in the campaign is the relative abundance of supercooled liquid water (SLW) droplets and ice particles in SO clouds, as SLW is more prevalent in SO clouds than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. The PIs hypothesize that the extent to which SLW freezes at a given temperature is more strongly modulated by cloud updraft velocities than by availability of INPs. The PIs also seek to determine the relative influence of overlying free tropospheric aerosol concentrations versus local surface and boundary layer controls, including precipitation and wind speed, in determining the concentration of SLW droplets in boundary layer clouds. The GV is equipped with radar and lidar for characterizing cloud properties as well as instruments which use inlets on the aircraft to collect and analyze the chemical and physical properties of aerosols and cloud droplets and ice particles. The SOCRATES campaign is complementary to SO activities planned internationally and by other US agencies, including surface observations taken on ships and on MacQuarie Island, a small uninhabited island at 54 degrees South.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As noted above, the work has broader impacts due to the potentially significant role of SO clouds in determining the response of global climate to increases in greenhouse concentrations, and the inadequacy of SO clouds in climate models used for future climate projections. In addition, a number of education and outreach activities are planned for the campaign. Graduate students are expected to participate in the campaign through the awards given to PIs for fieldwork, and other opportunities for graduate student fieldwork will also be proposed. Summer internships for post-campaign data analysis will also be considered as part of the review process conducted for the campaign. In addition, outreach to K-12 students and the general public is planned through regular newsletters and blogs, and an interactive "Ask SOCRATES" website through which campaign PIs answer questions on clouds and their role in the climate system.</AbstractNarration>
