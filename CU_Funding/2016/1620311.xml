    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Louise Dolan in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in theoretical particle physics have shown how the fundamental constituents of matter are described by novel constructions that provide a deeper understanding of space and time. In particular, new methods of calculating how these fundamental constituents of matter scatter off each other have recently been developed which transcend the previous, well-established techniques. These new methods facilitate calculations of the kinds of scattering that are measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In her research, Professor Dolan will pursue these methods in order to acquire knowledge of the underlying theoretical structure responsible for understanding the fundamental forces of nature. This work thus serves the national interest by contributing to progress in our understanding of fundamental physics. The grant will also partially support a postdoctoral researcher, and will enable Professor Dolan to continue her outreach to female high-school science students in which she discusses with them certain exciting aspects of her research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Dolan will seek to understand massless field theory tree amplitudes in arbitrary space-time dimensions in terms of an algebraic expression associated with the polynomial form of the scattering equations. Precise results at tree level are likely to extend to loop level via polynomials of elliptic functions. Pursuit of a robust understanding of Yangian invariance in planar gauge theories and aspects of quantum gravity in flat space and anti-de-Sitter space will strengthen our knowledge of these structures.</AbstractNarration>
