    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research concerning the next generation of high strength materials is envisaged to extend the state-of-art of processing of high strength-high ductility alloys with superior formability. The unlocking of fracture mechanisms underlying high strength-high ductility combination will be a major breakthrough in guiding the development of strong and ductile metallic materials. The ultimate objective is to determine guidelines to pioneer a new frontier of high strength-high ductility materials for light and efficient solutions involving energy absorption and formability. Furthermore, new techniques will be developed to understand material behavior that will be applicable to other metallic systems. The high strength-high ductility combination of nanograined materials will allow for thinner sections or components, which will lead to fuel economy in the transportation sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of the award is to determine the fundamental criteria in obtaining high strength - high ductility combination in metals with grain size in the nanometer range. The criteria will be elucidated by conducting controlled mechanical deformation experiments in conjunction with the study of deformed region via microscopy tools. Experiments will involve increasing the stability of the principal constituent with decrease in grain size. The criteria will define if the stability of the principal constituent of the metallic material is responsible in governing the ductility and delayed fracture of high strength metallic materials. The changes in deformation behavior will be studied as a function of grain size from nanograin regime to conventional micrometer regime. Physical models with predictive capabilities for a wide range of material systems based on the inter-relationship between grain size, deformation process and fracture mechanisms will be developed.</AbstractNarration>
