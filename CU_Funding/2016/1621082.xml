    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to support rapidly growing wireless data usage with fixed available bandwidth through the provision of more robust synchronization. Modern high-speed communication is heavily dependent on precise synchronization between transmitters and receivers to enable efficient data throughput. This project pioneers an entirely novel technique based on ?Spiral Polynomial Division Multiplexing? (SPDM) to enable precise and efficient synchronization. It offers a new set of approaches for improving synchronization, with possible applications to any communication systems that face extreme spectral efficiency demands, or which are challenged by particularly difficult synchronization problems such as communication with high-speed vehicles such as trains. This project could lead to commercialization across a wide range of communication sectors including but not limited to wireless, mobile internet, unmanned vehicles, automotive, aviation, and Internet of Things. It has major potential applications in both civilian and defense applications. SPDM shows promise in providing more robust communications that are resistant to interference and jamming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of achieving very precise synchronization between a transmitter and receiver, while expending minimal power and bandwidth to do so. The research objective is to show that a new type of synchronization, based on SPDM, enables superior synchronization performance than is possible with previous methods. SPDM introduces a new way of combining, or multiplexing, signals based on orthogonality in the polynomial coefficient space. This results in a very large waveform design space, which can be bandlimited using polynomial convolution with a ?shaping polynomial?. Synchronization can be achieved within SPDM by checking for the time alignment which produces a ?reasonable result? when the shaping polynomial is deconvolved in the receiver, which can be a very sensitive test due to the special properties of SPDM polynomials. The research will involve systematically testing SPDM synchronization under a variety of conditions, examining performance data, and comparing against standard synchronization methods. It is anticipated that this research will show significant benefits for SPDM synchronization in at least some practically important situations, forming the basis for further research leading to deployment of SPDM-based systems.</AbstractNarration>
