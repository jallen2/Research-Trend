    <AbstractNarration>Explosive volcanic eruptions are serious hazards in many places on Earth, in particular in those areas associated with subduction zones such as those along the northwest coast of the US, the southern coast of Alaska, along the western coasts of South and Central America, and the western Pacific portion of the "Ring of Fire". The processes involved and mechanisms by which these eruptions take place are not well understood; and this workshop, a Chapman Conference, which is affiliated with the American Geophysical Union professional society of geoscientists, focuses on bringing together international experts and early career researchers to disseminate information, discuss challenges, and brainstorm possible creative new ways of improving our understanding of both subaerial and submarine volcanism, with an emphasis on explosive volcanic systems. The funds from this award will be spent to support the travel and participation of US early career scientists and augment funds from a variety of US and international sources, including those from Australia and from three international professional societies. The workshop, a four-day highly interactive Chapman Conference, will be held at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Tasmania and is being organized by an international committee that includes US, New Zealand, and Australian scientists, all leaders in the field of submarine or terrestrial volcanism. Broader impacts of the workshop include disseminating scientific information and expertise and planning projects to help better understand submarine and terrestrial volcanism, the results of which can be used by volcano observatories and volcano monitoring systems situated near population centers to provide information for hazard planning. Additional impacts include international collaboration and the production of a report and a monograph or themed scientific journal issue to disseminate the information presented and related to the workshop more broadly to the scientific community and public. Support of early career US researchers in the field of submarine volcanism will also help build US capacity in this area of science.</AbstractNarration>
