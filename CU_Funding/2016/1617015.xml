    <AbstractNarration>Astronomers have recently discovered "Manx" comets, or comets that have orbits that go farther out in the Solar System, but do not send out gas and dust when they get closest to the Sun in their orbits. New models suggest that they could be objects that formed in the inner Solar System and were forced into the outer part of the Solar System when the Solar System was forming. Spectral signatures of some Manx comets are like those of the most common asteroids in the inner Solar System. This leads astronomers to think that the Manx comets are fresh material from the inner Solar System. The investigators will study the Manx comets through using telescopes to image and take spectra of the comets to look at composition and any dust or gas that could be present around the objects. These observations can help astronomers learn how the early Solar System formed. This research serves the national interest by increasing our knowledge about how our Solar System formed and what materials formed at different distances from the Sun. The investigators participate in many educational outreach efforts, including innovative data visualization with the Hawaii Innovation initiative, and including interns from the K - 12 Assets School in Honolulu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to place firm constraints on models of the Solar System, the investigators will study the newly-discovered "Manx" comets, or comets that have long-period orbits but have little or no activity at perihelion. These observations suggest that these might be objects that were ejected into the Oort Cloud in the outer Solar System during early planet migration. Photometry of one object suggests that it is similar to the S-complex asteroids that dominate the inner Solar System, but it is also outgassing, suggesting that the Manx comets might represent fresh inner Solar System material. These studies include photometry and spectroscopy of the Manx objects to determine their surface compositions from reflectance spectroscopy, deep images of Manx comets that are sufficiently bright to determine any amount of coma that might be present, a search of old archived data for past detections of Manx comets, and modeling to determine ice sublimation. Observations of many Manx comets could distinguish between Solar System dynamical models. If there are active objects with S-type spectra, the Manx comets could represent primitive material that formed near the Solar System water-ice line. The investigators participate in efforts to train the next generation of scientists in STEM fields through one-on-one mentoring, development of new courses, integration of research and hands-on science into courses, and exploring innovative data visualization with the Hawaii Innovation initiative. The team is currently partnering with the K - 12 Assets School in Honolulu in their intern program, and will incorporate the Manx comet work into this program.</AbstractNarration>
