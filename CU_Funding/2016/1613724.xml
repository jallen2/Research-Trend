    <AbstractNarration>Organic semiconductors based on a single molecular building block have been extensively used in recent years for optoelectronic applications. However, systems made of two or more different molecules provide additional possibilities to tune the optical and electrical properties, increasing as result the range of applications of organic materials. This project will focus on synthesis of novel multicomponent materials with the abovementioned properties. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Christian Leo Kloc, known for his achievements in the area of crystal growth of organic semiconductors and the technology of organic devices, at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. This project will make a large positive impact to the current knowledge of obtaining the most efficient semiconducting materials that will be used in future in organic semiconductors industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is dedicated to the crystal growth, structural and computational studies of the binary charge transfer (CT) organic co-crystals, made of two or more different molecules which act as electron donor and acceptor. Such compounds will become better, more efficient and more tunable organic semiconductors with a broad range of applications in organic electronics. The main goal of this project is to obtain several chemically different co-crystals of good quality. The researcher plans to study the following two-component materials with 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) as acceptors, and aromatic hydrocarbons like anthracene, tetracene, pentacene, perylene as donors. During proposed research a deep understanding of the complex CT mechanisms will be obtained. This will provide a basis for development of a broad range of compounds for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The rapid growth of the field of organic electronics assures that these findings will prove valuable to the community of scientists engaged in the development of practical organic semiconductors devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>
