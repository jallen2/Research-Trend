    <AbstractNarration>The cloud is becoming increasingly integral to our daily lives, the business ecosystem, and society at large. Recently, cutting-edge cryptosystems have been developed that provide the first-ever theoretical solutions to many cloud-related tasks. Such tasks include fine-grained access control to encrypted data, broadcasting to a set of recipients with minimal communication overhead, hiding secrets in public code, and much more. Unfortunately, these recent systems are far from being ready for deployment, due both to significant computational inefficiencies and to new and thus little-understood underlying computational assumptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is bringing cutting-edge cryptographic applications closer to practice by improving the efficiency and security of said applications. A particular focus is program obfuscation, a powerful new tool at the heart of many of the recent theoretical advances in cryptography. This project develops new constructions and security analyses for obfuscation and other related cryptographic tools, yielding more efficient protocols and increasing our confidence in their security. In addition, education is integral to this project, as the PI develops new cryptography courses and advises undergraduates and graduate students alike in order to cultivate the next generation of scholars and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
