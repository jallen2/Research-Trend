    <AbstractNarration>Discoveries from this project could lead to new applications of biosensors in marine and environmental science and potentially to new insights into the environmental cycling of trace chemicals. Mercury is one of the most toxic contaminants in the environment and is of global concern. Developing methods for measuring the distribution mercury in the field is needed to better understand the source and fate of mercury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop ultrasensitive and specific graphene-based immunosensors for in-situ detection of trace Hg2+ concentrations in aquatic ecosystems. Developing ultrasensitive, specific, and robust methods for quantifying the distribution and speciation of ultra-low level mercury, especially for in-situ measurements in the field, is a fundamental requirement to better understand the source, fate, transformation and bioaccumulation of Mercury, as well as for assessing environmental pollution and possible remediation. The proposed technique is potentially transformative, and will promote further design and optimization of novel sensors, instrumentation, and analytical schemes for trace targets important in practical biological, chemical and environmental monitoring. This project will be incorporated as undergraduate and graduate educational and research tools, and provide opportunities for students at all levels, diverse ethnic backgrounds and nationalities, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>
