    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of accessible clean water is a global problem affecting human health, agriculture, energy production, and the environment at large. Providing adequate sanitation, safe drinking water, and food are among society's grand challenges. The development of low-energy, materials-based technologies that facilitate water treatment and reuse is central to overcoming those challenges. Improvements in water purification technologies, for which materials science and chemistry will play a vital role, are needed to provide clean water around the world. This SusChEM research project is centered on the design, discovery, and development of new polymeric materials for advanced separation applications. Specifically, the project aims include the synthesis, morphology, and structure-property fundamental understanding of new, nanostructured polymeric materials for high-efficiency water purification. The principal technologies that will be impacted by this fundamental polymer-materials research are water ultrafiltration and desalination; however other membrane-based technologies will benefit from the insights gained. Partnerships with industry will be actively pursued, and broad training of a diverse cohort of graduate, undergraduate and postdoctoral researchers will also be an important product of the efforts. Moreover, the continued development of an outreach program aimed at enthusing school age kids about science and engineering will be emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strides in the synthesis, self-assembly, and implementation of block polymer-based materials in membrane applications have been accomplished. In this research project, significant and innovative new synthetic approaches to block polymer materials for membranes will be pursued, the complete and detailed characterization of the resultant materials will be undertaken using a bevy of modern techniques, and the implementation and testing of new membranes derived from these materials will be accomplished. The target materials for two separate but interrelated projects have tremendous potential to impact a broad swath of technologies. One of the main efforts will be on tailored approaches to functional block polymers via polymerization-induced phase separation as precursors to robust nanostructured materials for ultrafiltration, water remediation, and metal sequestration. The other main effort is focused on the design, synthesis, development, and application of new high-performance charge mosaic membranes for piezodialysis from block polymer precursors containing independent anionic and cationic nanodomains separated by a mechanically robust block. Both of these efforts will result in fundamental and basic knowledge associated with block polymer synthesis and self-assembly and build a foundation for the development of polymers for advanced water purification technologies.</AbstractNarration>
