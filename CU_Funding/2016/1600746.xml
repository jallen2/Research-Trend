    <AbstractNarration>The "Carolina Dynamics Symposium" is a continued two day weekend conference, which will take place in April 2016 at Furman University Greenville, SC and in April 2017 at Agnes Scott College, Atlanta, GA. In April 2018 it will be hosted either by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the University of Charleston, or by Wake Forest University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Carolina Dynamics Symposium is a two day conference that has been taking place for thirteen years at different colleges and universities in the Carolinas and Georgia. In addition to the traditional lively interaction among mathematicians from the Southeast there have been hour talks by invited leaders in the field from outside the region. The Carolina Dynamics Symposia feature one plenary speaker who will deliver a public lecture on the Friday before the conference begins, as well as about three hour-long plenary speakers during the conference weekend. All meetings will also have twenty to thirty minute contributed talks and invited talks from Southeastern participants. Typically a significant number of talks are given by (graduate) students and young researchers. The conferences have led to successful research projects and publications in the past. We are continuing a very successful model with participants of diverse levels and backgrounds, among those a particularly large number of female participants, speakers and organizers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information on the Symposium, we maintain a webpage: http://www.devio.us/~ppunosevac/cdynsys/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Announcements.</AbstractNarration>
