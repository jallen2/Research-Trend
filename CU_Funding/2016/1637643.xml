    <AbstractNarration>This project supports the Doctoral Student Workshop at the Fourth Annual Conference in Cognitive Systems to be held at Northwestern University in June 2016. Cognitive Systems is an international and interdisciplinary conference series covering all aspects of research on cognitive computing. It is distinguished by a focus on high-level cognition and decision-making, reliance on rich, structured representations, a systems-level perspective, and the incorporation of insights about human thinking. The goal of the doctoral student symposium is to encourage, expand, and guide the participation of young researchers starting research in cognitive computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive computing has recently had major successes, represented by well- known systems like IBM's Watson, Microsoft's Cortana, Google's Now, and Apple's Siri, among many others. The Advances in Cognitive Systems conference fosters research carried out in the original spirit of AI, which aimed to design and implement computer programs that exhibited the breadth, generality, and flexibility often observed in human intelligence. We expect the Fourth Annual Conference on Cognitive Systems to significantly increase our understanding of cognitive computing, and add momentum to the development of new theories, techniques and tools for cognitive computing. The conference sessions and workshops will help develop human research capital by enabling interactions between senior and junior researchers and catalyzing new collaborations. The doctoral student workshop will increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas, and train them by providing early input and feedback in the field in an interactive and constructive environment.</AbstractNarration>
