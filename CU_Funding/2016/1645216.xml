    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is focused on the emerging area of complex active and adaptive material systems and is being supported by the Biomaterials and Polymers Programs of the NSF Division of Materials Research. It will serve an important role in pinpointing critical research areas in this broad, interdisciplinary topic and helping guide new scientific efforts. Areas to be explored include adaptive materials that are capable of sensing, actuation, energy harvesting, locomotion, self-repair, and self-organization. The need to manipulate the dynamic behavior of energy-consuming elements related to biomimetic systems will necessitate new advances in both modeling and synthetic efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of this GRC would involve a whole-systems approach to creating materials/devices that perform useful functions by consuming or transducing energy. The meeting could help formulate design rules for the next generation of energy-efficient devices that operate in a self-sustained manner. It will also bring together a broadly diverse group that includes young researchers at the beginning of their careers as well as more experienced and senior participants. Interactions among these groups could have a lasting influence on the careers of new scientists. Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will be encouraged to present posters to promote extensive discussions and scientific interactions.</AbstractNarration>
