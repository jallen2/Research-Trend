    <AbstractNarration>Pressure gain combustion (PGC, commonly called detonation) is a highly efficient process for power generation because the process burns fuels over 30 times faster than conventional, constant pressure combustion which is currently present in all commercial internal combustion engines. In addition to higher efficiency, a PGC power generator is inexpensive to build and to maintain, and it can use a wide variety of fuels, including sustainable biogas. A large, potential market exists for the PGC power generator, either operating as a standalone unit or as part of a grid. The use of sustainable biogas addresses the important issue of greenhouse gas emissions. This PGC generator fits into the solution strategies of advanced countries striving to meet environmental targets, by producing power with lower emissions through efficient combustion. Additionally, the PGC generator can increase availability of low-cost energy with the potential of improving human welfare in large areas of the globe. Further technological spinoffs of the PGC process include developing efficient heat sources, as well as other novel industrial processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to observing fundamental combustion physics, various enabling technologies have been demonstrated by the team over the past two decades. The PGC technology is protected by six patents with further disclosures in the pipeline. The PGC generator is simple to manufacture and operate, thereby accruing a cost advantage over existing generators in the 10-100 kW range. The technology is scalable and the proposed team has competitive designs ranging from 1 kW to 2 MW, targeting various niche markets that are not necessarily well served at present. The goal of this project is to bring PGC technology to the marketplace. The scope of the project is to explore the power generation and industrial applications market through discovering the customer base and to develop a prototype PGC generator. This team will engage with potential partners and investors through online and telephone contacts, and tradeshows, as well as visiting promising parties. The team will continue to develop a prototype PGC generator to exhibit to potential partners and investors.</AbstractNarration>
