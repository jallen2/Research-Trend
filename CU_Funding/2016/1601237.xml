    <AbstractNarration>Odor is the most frequent and chemically diverse carrier of biological information. Volatile compounds released by plants serve multiple functions, including cell to cell signaling, plant-plant communication, attraction of beneficial organisms such as pollinators, and defense against pathogens. In the human perception, plant volatile compounds are the odors, aromas or flavors of flowers, fruits or spices, the ingredients of perfumes and aromatizing products, or the active components of essential oils and other plant-based applications in traditional and alternative medicine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of intensive research efforts over the last three decades, many central questions in the young research field of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) remain to be answered. The Gordon Research Conference 'Plant Volatiles' (GRC-PV) (Jan 31 to Feb 5, 2016, Ventura, CA) has been designed to initiate a transformation of plant VOC science by boosting the exchange of knowledge and research philosophies among multiple disciplines with the goal to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the incredible diversity of VOC-mediated interactions of plants with their environment and to enhance our awareness of the potential of plant VOCs in an array of applications. The conference will focus on four major areas of knowledge:&lt;br/&gt; -VOC biosynthetic diversity, molecular regulation, and mechanisms of emission at the single cell and plant systems level&lt;br/&gt; -The diverse roles of plant VOCs in intra- and interspecific interactions&lt;br/&gt; -Molecular mechanisms of the organismal perception of VOCs &lt;br/&gt; -Technologies and concepts for applying VOCs as bio-based products and biocontrol agents in sustainable agriculture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2016 GRC-PV will host speakers from 16 countries ranging from postdocs to senior scientists in 9 sessions. Both the GRC-PV and the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for junior scientists will foster the participation of students and early career scientists and enhance the proportion of underrepresented groups among the attendees. GRS participants will have the opportunity throughout the conference for informal discussions with mentors from academia, science publishing, and industry about future directions in plant volatile science and career developments. This initiative will engage and retain the next generation of talented junior scientists in the multidisciplinary field of plant volatile research. The conference aims at enhancing the presence of representatives of the industry to facilitate the search for putative applications of VOCs. Social media and press releases will promote the awareness among future scientists and the general public of the importance of the 'silent language of plants'.</AbstractNarration>
