    <AbstractNarration>This I-Corps project seeks to identify the commercial potential of an automated composite manufacturing technology. The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it enables new design options for composites -- impacting a wide range of industries. This team's technology is an automated method of forming composites that seeks to improve capabilities in the area of composite manufacturing. The technology allows designers to create new structures that are not currently synthesized or manufactured. Aircraft and automobile industries are typical sectors where composites are used to reduce weight. Through this project's technology, composite designers will be able to realize greater weight savings than they have using traditionally designed and manufactured composites. These weight savings will allow designers to meet fuel efficiency standards, increase payload capacity, and extend the range of vehicles or airplanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composites formed using traditional automated processes are constrained to 2D laminate structures using unidirectional tapes (narrow, woven fabric materials). Composites formed this way are vulnerable to impact damage and severely limit the options available to the designer. This project's technology permits the local manipulation of fabric geometry in a composite, which allows designers to optimize the strength and stiffness of the composite structure. Additionally, this technology allows interlacing of adjacent layers in the composite, which enhances the impact resistance of the composite. Participation in I-Corps will allow the proposed technology to be evaluated for commercial merit and enable the development of a commercialization strategy.</AbstractNarration>
