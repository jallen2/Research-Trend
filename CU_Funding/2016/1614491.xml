    <AbstractNarration>It has been estimated that the entire world-wide demand for energy will double in the next&lt;br/&gt;two decades, therefore it is critical to investigate revolutionary energy technologies&lt;br/&gt;to meet this demand. A potential hydrogen economy is a key player in this market&lt;br/&gt;space. However, hydrogen as a fuel requires efficient storage materials that retain and release&lt;br/&gt;a great deal of hydrogen as desired. This proposal aims to use large scale and accurate quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanical calculations on an important class of porous hydrogen storage materials: metal-organic&lt;br/&gt;frameworks (MOFs). The research team will study the properties of hydrogen inside of MOFs&lt;br/&gt;and seek to understand their physical properties and how one can design improved MOFs that&lt;br/&gt;should deliver improved storage of hydrogen per unit weight under reasonable and real-world&lt;br/&gt;operating conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand and improve MOFs for hydrogen storage applications, it is key to study the microscopic&lt;br/&gt;physical properties of MOFs that govern hydrogen uptake, release, and diffusion&lt;br/&gt;inside the MOFs. This requires simulation of hydrogen inside of MOFs at the atomistic scale.&lt;br/&gt;The project propose to perform highly accurate quantum mechanical simulations of hydrogen dynamics&lt;br/&gt;inside of MOFs using first principles density functional theory to describe the electronic&lt;br/&gt;state of the system coupled to molecular dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom including&lt;br/&gt;quantum nuclear effects (via the path integral formalism). The effect due to the quantum&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations of the nuclear degrees of freedom are critical for understanding the binding&lt;br/&gt;and dynamics of light elements such as hydrogen. The project will use this advanced and accurate theoretical&lt;br/&gt;framework to address three questions of key importance to this field: (1) How do quantum&lt;br/&gt;nuclear effects alter hydrogen dynamics inside of MOFs? (2) How do the transition metal atoms&lt;br/&gt;incorporated into the MOF structure change the hydrogen binding and dynamics properties and&lt;br/&gt;which metals are best for real-world applications? (3) How does the flexibility and temperature-dependent&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations of the MOF framework affect hydrogen storage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific outcomes of this research will be of interest and importance to researchers&lt;br/&gt;studying MOFs and hydrogen storage. The aim is to provide useful understanding and information&lt;br/&gt;that may lead to the creation of materials that will help create a hydrogen economy. The&lt;br/&gt;results of the work will be published in high quality journals, presented widely at international&lt;br/&gt;conferences, and form the basis for outreach events to the broader public in order to elevate&lt;br/&gt;general interest in science and technology as well as how simulations and computations can&lt;br/&gt;address important real-world problems. Junior researchers carrying out the research work&lt;br/&gt;will be trained in the use of advanced computational methods, attendant software infrastructures,&lt;br/&gt;and materials design approaches that are all highly useful skills in the twenty-first century.</AbstractNarration>
