    <AbstractNarration>This project will design and study systems for eliciting and aggregating information and expertise when it is distributed across many heterogeneous agents. This addresses a central challenge in the field of crowdsourcing, and these solutions can be directly applied to typical crowdsourcing problems including peer grading, and labeling spam or other non-compliant material. Additionally, these systems should prove useful in gathering and aggregating information in basic scientific research, reputation systems, and many decision-making contexts including purchasing, product development, pricing, etc. Because privacy is an instance of a participant cost, the ideas developed in this research will readily import back to the field of privacy as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the field of information elicitation promises many rich applications, challenges in the area of mechanism design must be overcome to fulfill its promise. The current state of the art is sufficient to run mechanisms in simple settings, but very little effort has gone into studying the difficulty of having heterogeneous agents with various levels and/or areas of expertise. Particularly problematic are what we term divisive problems where naïve agents err in a systematic and non-random way that can be predicted by more expert agents. In such a setting, the expert agent may answer incorrectly, in anticipation of being scored against naïve agents. Such occurrences are extremely problematic because they render the above mechanisms incapable of soliciting information from experts, exactly those whom are most important to reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop the theory necessary to reason about information elicitation mechanisms with heterogeneous agents, tackle key challenges, and devise innovative solutions to overcome these challenges. This project will break through the most daunting barriers by creating new mechanisms and accompanying theoretical analysis and empirical tests to show that they achieve the stated goals. The PI will build upon the rich and emerging literature in information elicitation without verification using cutting-edge tools and insights from various fields including privacy, mechanism design, game theory, proper scoring rules, information theory, probability, and learning theory. If successful, this proposal will transform the field of information elicitation by creating robust mechanisms having provable guarantees that work with heterogeneous agents.</AbstractNarration>
