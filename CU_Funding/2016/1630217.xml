    <AbstractNarration>This conference and workshop award is jointly funded by the International office, OISE, at NSF and the Algebra and Number Theory program in DMS. The goal of the Building Bridges Summer School and Workshop at University of Sarajevo, July 11-22, 2016, is to provide a means by which mathematicians, primarily early career researchers, can seek to expand their investigations into areas of research beyond that of their previous studies. The main area of emphasis is current topics in Number Theory. The first meeting in this program was held in Aachen, Germany in 2012, and the second was held in Bristol, England in 2014. In both instances, the bridges being built were across sub-disciplines of mathematics. For 2016, the organizers selected Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina as the venue, thus expanding the program into Eastern Europe. Sarajevo is a fascinating city of unparalleled historical significance, which the organizers believe will further enhance the appeal and impact of the "building bridges" philosophy. Conference website: http://bb3.efsa.unsa.ba/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school will consist of three distinct yet related programs:Galois Representations and Diophantine Problems; Explicit L-functions, automorphic forms and Galois representations; and Single and multiple variable Dirichlet series and special values. Lectures will be given by accomplished mathematicians who will present both introductory material as well as workable problems to motivate the students. The workshop will consist of lectures on a range of mathematical results which fall under the broad description of number theory and automorphic forms. As with previous "Building Bridges" events, the organizers will encourage the interaction and collaboration of participants with the prospect of seeing future research teams form and undertake mathematical collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
