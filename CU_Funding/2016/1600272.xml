    <AbstractNarration>For the last quarter of a century or so, the theory of Optimal Transport (whose initiator, Gaspard Monge, had a very particular application in mind, far more limited in scope than what was to be discovered Optimal Transport could achieve) has been one of the most dynamical areas of Mathematical Analysis, and the main reason for that is its versatility in the analysis of certain large classes of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The PI employs Optimal Transport to study the Semi-Geostrophic System (and another, related model) arising from Atmospheric Science, and which is now recognized as a powerful prediction tool in Meteorology. Mathematical rigor is important for understanding predictability of weather systems and informs decisions made in operational modeling. Also at the center of this project is the analysis of the non-conventional (infinite-dimensional) Hamilton-Jacobi equations arising from Mean Field Games; this has applications to Economics and models interactions between large numbers of players/agents whose individual effect on the system is negligible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will focus on some systems of PDE from Fluid Dynamics and Plasma Physics, and on Hamilton- Jacobi equations in metric spaces of probability measures. The PI has done significant work on problems arising from a need to further validate and analyze these mathematical models, and the present proposal will outline plans to further investigate such issues. Herein is a brief description of the proposed research. The Semi-Geostrophic (SG) and SG-Shallow-Water equations are difficult to analyze, with the basic question of existence of solutions in physical space still open. A physical change of variables has transferred the problem to the so-called dual space, yet pulling the solutions back to physical space has only very recently been achieved and only in special cases (first Lagrangian, then Eulerian in an even more restrictive setting, with little hope to extend the approach to the general case). Instead, a weaker solution (relaxed Lagrangian solution) has recently been obtained in full generality by the PI and a collaborator. Building on this previous work, the PI lays out a plan to prove existence and weak stability of weak Lagrangian solutions in full generality. Dimensional blow-up limits of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in finite-dimensional spaces, or the limits of large systems of such equations (as appearing in Mean Field Games) lead to Hamilton-Jacobi equations in metric spaces of probability measures. Various notions of differentiability in the Wasserstein space have been circulated, and it is unclear how the corresponding notions of viscosity solutions are related. This issue may come from a loose interpretation of what viscosity solution means in this infinite-dimensional context. The PI will introduce the notion of consistent Hamiltonian and argue, backed by examples from applications, its ability to provide both uniqueness and a solid meaning for viscosity as related to vanishing viscosity. The embedding of finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces into the space of Borel probability measures used successfully by the PI in earlier collaborative work has provided important insight into the asymptotics of various PDE systems of nonstandard Hamiltonian type.</AbstractNarration>
