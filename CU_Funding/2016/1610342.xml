    <AbstractNarration>Imaging is an essential technology enabled by numerous devices that have shaped our modern world. In the terahertz range of the electromagnetic spectrum, imaging is highly desired due to its potential for non-destructive evaluation, bio and chemical hazard detection, and personnel screening. Although significant efforts continually strive to achieve arrays of terahertz detectors, from which to fashion cameras, imaging within the terahertz range is extremely difficult and ultimately restricted due to low source powers and detector sensitivity. However a different type of imaging system may be constructed using metamaterial spatial light modulators (SLMs), where only a single pixel is used to form the image, and may remove critical impediments toward making terahertz imaging a reality. Novel computational imaging techniques will be developed and applied to enable multidimensional images to be captured including hyperspectral, polarimetric and three-dimensional information. Beyond facilitating technological breakthroughs and exploring novel imaging techniques, the proposed project will establish a research training and teaching laboratory in the area of structured materials. The proposed research project is interdisciplinary and will permit members of the laboratory to actively contribute to the burgeoning field of metasurfaces for terahertz sensing and communications and advanced imaging techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed research program is the development of spatial light modulators and computational imaging techniques to realize multidimensional imaging in the terahertz frequency regime. The project utilizes recent developments in metasurfaces engineered sub-wavelength metallic structures capable of achieving exotic electromagnetic response. The effort has been organized into three thrusts focused on providing significant gains in: (i) parallel coded aperture imaging, (ii) sub-Nyquist sampling, and (iii) advanced modulation schemes for multidimensional acquisition. All three efforts are synergistic and cross-cutting and the techniques and algorithms developed will be combined into a single system to enhance overall performance and/or functionality. The general technical approach for each of the research thrusts begins with conceptual and computation design and analysis. In step two the PI and his students will engage in various fabrication approaches to realize desired designs. Next they will characterize the fabricated materials and setup the various imaging systems proposed. Finally, the PI and his students will analyze the results of measurements for subsequent iteration and optimization of project goals.</AbstractNarration>
