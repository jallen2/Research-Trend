    <AbstractNarration>The violent star explosions, known as supernovae, are responsible for&lt;br/&gt;many features of our Universe. They produce and distribute many of&lt;br/&gt;the heavy elements that make up stars, new planets, and also people.&lt;br/&gt;The energy supernovae release into the interstellar gas heats and stirs it,&lt;br/&gt;and some of that energy goes to accelerating a few subatomic particles&lt;br/&gt;to extreme energies -- the enigmatic cosmic rays that fill our Galaxy&lt;br/&gt;and constantly rain down on the Earth. In the last few thousand years,&lt;br/&gt;several Galactic supernovae were visible at Earth and carefully&lt;br/&gt;recorded by naked-eye observers. The remnants of those supernovae,&lt;br/&gt;expanding gas clouds emitting radio waves, X-rays, and visible light,&lt;br/&gt;can now be studied in detail, along with hundreds of older remnants&lt;br/&gt;from supernovae too distant to be seen on Earth with the naked&lt;br/&gt;eye. This proposal will model the effects of supernovae that occur in &lt;br/&gt;systems with two stars gravitationally bound to each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent evidence suggests that many supernovae originate in binary systems, &lt;br/&gt;pairs of stars orbiting one another. The more massive stars shed material as they &lt;br/&gt;age, particularly in the stages just prior to explosion, so the explosions &lt;br/&gt;take place in a complicated environment of gas. These investigators will compute&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art simulations of pre-supernova environments, and then model&lt;br/&gt;the explosion, to see what effects it has on the appearance of the supernovae &lt;br/&gt;at the time of the event, and on the remnants of the events, which are still&lt;br/&gt;thousands of years later. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators hope to identify particular features that such supernovae&lt;br/&gt;and remnants might show that would be clues to the environments that&lt;br/&gt;gave rise to them. In addition, a few particular objects, such as&lt;br/&gt;historical remnants from supernovae seen at Earth in the last few&lt;br/&gt;hundred years, will be studied, to try to identify the types of stars that &lt;br/&gt;created the explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will use high-performance computing systems at national &lt;br/&gt;facilities, and will train students in the most up-to-date applications of &lt;br/&gt;computing to complex problems. Improving our understanding of supernovae adds an&lt;br/&gt;essential piece to the grand narrative of the nature of our Universe&lt;br/&gt;and the place of humanity in it.</AbstractNarration>
