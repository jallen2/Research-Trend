    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project strives to reduce aircraft wire weight in order to improve aircraft range and reduce operating costs. Commercial and military aerospace companies are heavily concerned with fuel costs associated with aircraft operation, as this expense contributes significantly to the total costs of the company. Substantial reductions in aircraft weight could save millions of dollars per plane over its operating lifetime. For example, eliminating a single pound from a military fighter aircraft can save up to $3,000 over its lifetime, as well as increase its operating range, capacity to carry a larger payload and extend its time-on-station capabilities. These cost savings will benefit commercial aviation companies from decreased expense, resulting in a higher net income. Enhanced financial performance promotes company growth and the creation of more jobs throughout all levels of the organization. Increased income and job growth in this sector with stimulate continued national economic growth, providing benefit to the government via tax collections and increased commercial sector performance. National defense and aerospace sectors would also benefit from fuel cost reductions reducing costs and greenhouse gas emissions. This project directly aligns with the NSF mission to progress science, advance national prosperity and secure the national defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides innovative contribution to wire development and manufacturing through the use of a carbon nanotube deposition process in order to produce shielding for wires. This process is versatile and can be used to produce cables with a commercial metal inner conductor or a carbon nanotube fiber bundle as inner conductor and a specific conductivity similar to tin. It combines high strength, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity with low density, which makes them ideal for applications where weight reduction is a priority, specifically in aerospace applications. Until now, only minor reductions in wire weight have been achieved, through advances in composite connectors, thermoplastic cable clamps, downsizing connectors and using thinner wall insulation. The use of carbon nanotubes would remove the need for component removal due to decreased weight. The goal of this project is to prove out a continuous roll-to-roll wire coating process to produce carbon nanotube electromagnetic interference shields suitable for a large volume manufacturing operation. This will be accomplished through the use of foundationary methods of carbon nanotube deposition developed prior to this Phase I project. This project will produce the methods required for developing roll-to-roll continuous carbon nanotube wire coating.</AbstractNarration>
