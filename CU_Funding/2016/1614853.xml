    <AbstractNarration>The Hubble Deep/Ultra Deep fields are iconic, and almost certainly the&lt;br/&gt;most studied space telescope observations. Upcoming observations from an enormous range of&lt;br/&gt;current and planned instruments, from the successor to Hubble, The James Webb Telescope, to&lt;br/&gt;the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), to the WFIRST Satellite will also have the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to reach galaxies and black holes at the same extreme magnitudes or deeper, but&lt;br/&gt;over unprecedentedly wide fields. This will open up the study of the highest redshift galaxies&lt;br/&gt;and quasars to the type of statistical studies that have made modern cosmology a precision&lt;br/&gt;science. This project aims to compute theoretical predictions to make contact with current&lt;br/&gt;and upcoming observations of the high-redshift universe using the Blue Waters supercomputer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will extend the BlueTides simulation, with an unprecedented&lt;br/&gt;volume and resolution, to cover the evolution of the first billion years of cosmic history.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to significantly increase the scientific impact of this calculation to the community.&lt;br/&gt;Importantly, the project will attempt to make contact&lt;br/&gt;with observations of quasars, which have not been discovered at redshift greater than 7 (while&lt;br/&gt;the simulation now has run to redshift equal 8). In addition the project will be using BlueTides as&lt;br/&gt;a path-finder for developing methods/calculations for future cosmological hydrodynamical simulations&lt;br/&gt;of galaxy formation with volumes and resolutions suitable for creating mocks for next generation&lt;br/&gt;surveys. The impact of the proposed work will extend way beyond BlueTides. Large hydrodynamical simulations&lt;br/&gt;will be more and more useful in all stages of major observational projects in astrophysics&lt;br/&gt;and cosmology. For example, a simulation that covers a significant fraction of the entire&lt;br/&gt;observable universe with BlueTides resolution and runs to the present day (an epoch which&lt;br/&gt;is fully dominated by the hydrodynamic computations) will be needed for LSST.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish a theoretical framework for understanding the role of galaxies&lt;br/&gt;in the evolution of the universe at high redshifts. Different communities&lt;br/&gt;of scientists are interested in the behavior history of quasars and galaxy assembly, including&lt;br/&gt;cosmologists, the galaxy evolution community and high energy astrophysicists, so the results&lt;br/&gt;would have a wide impact across many different scientific communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the image and catalog generation, and&lt;br/&gt;database techniques developed by the project will&lt;br/&gt;strengthen the project already on-going synergistic activities with computer science, machine learning&lt;br/&gt;and statistics. Furthermore, the project will have a strong education component by involving undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate students in this research. Finally, the project propose to perform outreach using&lt;br/&gt;the visualization and interactive Gigapan software.</AbstractNarration>
