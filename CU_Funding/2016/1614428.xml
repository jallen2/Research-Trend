    <AbstractNarration>This project supports research in a collaboration with Prof. Ying-Chih Lin, a world-renowned expert on high-field NMR and instrumentation, in the department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University (NTU) in Taiwan to develop innovative methodology in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This new development could significantly enhance the spectral sensitivity in NMR and image contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for heteronuclei such as of Carbon-13. Over the 8-week funding period, we will focus on MRI contrast enhancement. Current MRI technique suffers from the poor contrast and sensitivity and the presence of huge background signals in our body. Heteronuclear molecular imaging (e.g. Carbon-13) can resolve the problem of background signal, but again suffers from poor sensitivity. The current collaborative project is to develop innovative approaches to enhance the sensitivity and/or contrast using Carbon-13 MR spectroscopy and micro imaging based on the nonlinear spin dynamics. The broader impact includes the very early detection (stage I or II) of tiny malignant tumor, which can save about 30% of those who die of cancers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will encompass a balanced approach to develop a rigorous theoretical understanding of nonlinear spin dynamics at UCLA on one hand and sound methodology and instrumentation to demonstrate significant sensitivity enhancement in biomolecular NMR during the EAPSI research at NTU. This will utilize two major findings i) active feedback mechanism and ii) indirect detection of Carbon-13 through dipolar interaction to alleviate the fundamental limitation in NMR sensitivity. The intellectual merits of the proposed research lie in channeling progress in spin physics (Active-Feedback Magnetic Resonance) into significant improvements in heteronuclear MRI with valuable biomedical applications (molecular imaging and early tumor detection). Its broader impacts lie in accelerating future developments of MR-based physical oncology and nano medicine, thereby transforming magnetic resonance and fundamental imaging research into life-saving applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>
