    <AbstractNarration>The Third International Conference on Mathematical Neuroscience will be held in Boulder, Colorado from May 30 to June 2, 2017. The brain is one of the most complex biological structures, and we are still far from understanding how it functions. Understanding the computations performed by the brain will require significant contributions from multiple disciplines. Mathematical techniques have served an integral role in advancing neuroscience research for many decades. The International Conference on Mathematical Neuroscience will provide a forum for researchers to discuss current mathematical innovations emerging in neuroscience. The lectures will discuss new tools and methods for analyzing complex data sets and building rigorous mathematical models of brain function. A major aim of the conference is to attract and train young researchers on current methods in mathematical neuroscience. To fulfill this goal, there will be a tutorial component held the day before the main meeting. For broader impact, a collection of tutorial chapters will be solicited from presenters and published as a collection of lectures, and presentations will be made available on the conference website. The conference is in line with the present national BRAIN initiative, aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying neural computation. The topics discussed during the tutorial sessions and main meeting are relevant to scientific disciplines beyond neuroscience: including systems biology, economics, and ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting provides an opportunity for mathematicians to gain exposure to current research in neuroscience and communicate with neuroscientists. At the same time, it enables experimental neuroscientists to discuss current progress on understanding the dynamics and function of neural systems with mathematicians who develop new tools and methods to address present challenges. The meeting will begin with a tutorial day (May 30) featuring topics from three major areas in mathematical neuroscience: stochastic and nonlinear dynamics, information theory, and probability and statistics. The tutorials will introduce junior researchers to fundamental techniques used in contemporary mathematical neuroscience through lectures given by leaders in the field. The main conference (May 31 - June 2) will feature a broader set of topics in mathematical neuroscience, with a focus on the use of experimental data in modeling studies as well as using theory and models to explore hypotheses and design better experiments. A new challenge in modern neuroscience is to extract understandable patterns and features from high-dimensional data sets including neuronal activity, functional connectivity, and anatomy. To understand how the human brain functions and performs complex computations, improved methods for handling data are needed, together with rigorous mathematical models of neural systems. This conference will bring together leaders in applied mathematics and neuroscience that are developing new mathematical techniques for understanding high-dimensional data sets, building models to capture activity patterns and emergent computation, and working closely with experimentalists to address more targeted questions about brain function. Synergistic interactions between these topics will also be identified, to understand the full complexity of the nervous system.
