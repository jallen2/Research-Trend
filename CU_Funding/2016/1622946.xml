    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is that it will benefit healthcare by improving patient outcome and procedural efficiency. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to guide interventions, this is challenged by the limited access to the patient inside the scanners. Current practices - either removing the patient and manually inserting the tools or moving the patient to another modality - lengthen the procedures, reduce accuracy, and increase possible trauma. The proposed novel robotic and MRI technologies will address those limitations, enabling performing procedures with the patient inside the MRI scanner. Thus continuous MRI images can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions offering more accurate lesion targeting, shorter procedure times, reduced patient trauma, faster recovery, lower cost, and improved patient outcome. This would transform interventional medicine by improving diagnostic and therapeutic interventions with high impact to patients, their families, and society. With faster patient recovery, this technology will reduce the overall cost of healthcare and enable faster return of patients to the workforce. The novel robotic technologies will generate new positions in R&amp;D and production in medical industries, as well as economic benefits from employing highly skilled personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop novel technologies at the intersection of robotics and imaging. The solid-media transmission (SMT) mechanism offers the flexibility of fluidic lines but in a system that is leak-free and less complex and has a more compact power take-off arrangement. The SMT mechanism enables the development of an MRI-compatible manipulator that is adaptable and scalable for use in a wide range of medical interventions, carrying and maneuvering virtually any tool. The proposed research will elucidate the effect of geometric and material parameters on the operation of the SMT mechanism. A prototype SMT-actuated manipulator will be used to demonstrate the functionality of this technology in real-time MRI-guided procedures in-situ and disseminate it with on-site and hands-on demonstrations to clinical venues. Beyond the merit in medical applications, this research enhances scientific and technological understanding by demonstrating an alternative mechanism of remote actuation or local distribution of actuation within a manipulator, which creates the potential to generate novel mechatronic assemblies with applications in automation, oil/gas industries, and aerospace.</AbstractNarration>
