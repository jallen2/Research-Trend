    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of US-based researchers in the conference "Taking the measure of one-dimensional dynamics" held at the Lorenz Center, University of Leiden in the Netherlands, from April 11 to 15, 2016. The conference focuses on one-dimensional dynamical systems, which describe the simplest chaotic processes but nevertheless exhibit a very rich set of behaviors. Although the theory explaining one-dimensional dynamical systems is the most complete and refined among dynamics in general, these systems are not yet fully understood. Open questions include many shared by higher dimensional systems. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together some of the main players responsible for the development of one-dimensional dynamics with new researchers in this field, to discuss old problems, new methods, and future directions. The award funds will support eight US participants, including three graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will address many crucial themes in one-dimensional dynamics. Topics include statistical behavior, parameter dependence, renormalization, and rigidity. One-dimensional dynamics is a source of highly sophisticated techniques that can be applied to the study of higher dimensional systems, such as those used in studying Henon maps and related dynamical systems. The conference will bring together senior researchers and those newer to the field to catalyze future research progress in the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found on the conference webpage: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2016/765/info.php3?wsid=765&amp;venue=Oort</AbstractNarration>
