    <AbstractNarration>This project supports the attendance of students, postdoctoral researchers and early career faculty at the Symposium on Biomathematics and Ecology: Education and Research to be held in Charleston, South Carolina on October 14-16, 2016. The symposium will highlight recent scientific and educational developments in mathematical biology, biology, ecology, and biostatistics. This meeting will bring together researchers and educators from both the biological and the mathematical sciences to disseminate their current work and to network with others, whose combined expertise covers many areas in mathematical biology. Moreover, a panel discussion session focusing on projects aiming to benefit the mathematical biology community as a whole will provide an awareness of creating new collaboration venues for junior and senior researchers and educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is hosted by the College of Charleston. The technical program is organized by researchers in biology and mathematics, from several universities across the country and has the goal of sharing progress over a diverse field biomathematics research while sharing opportunities for student involvement on related projects. The research focus of the conference allows opportunities for collaborations that may have impact in advances in biomathematics research, while the educational focus of the conference supports innovations in biomathematics education, with the hope that its long-term impact will be the addition of new and better-prepared students to the future STEM workforce. The conference programming also directly addresses student participation and development. Results from the conference will address environmental and public health problems and questions. In addition, results from this conference will help in the establishment of a biomathematics curriculum that is current and relevant to society.
