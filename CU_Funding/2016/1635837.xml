    <AbstractNarration>Coastal Louisiana is currently experiencing net sea level rise at rates higher than most of the world's coastlines and within the global range predicted to occur in the next 65 - 85 years, making Louisiana an ideal site to study potential future impacts of rising sea level on coastal systems. This project will use field collection and controlled tank experiments to study the changing organic carbon cycle resulting from erosion of marsh soils along with its impact on associated biogeochemical processes. The hypothesis tested in this study is that the majority of eroded soil organic carbon is converted to carbon dioxide (CO2) and released to the atmosphere, representing an addition to the anthropogenic input of CO2. This process has not been quantified and could be an important missing component in predictive models of atmospheric CO2 changes. While this process may be of only regional importance today in comparison to other sources of CO2, this study of the Louisiana coast will greatly enhance our full understanding of the potential impacts on the global carbon cycle that may result from coastal erosion as global sea level continues to rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research involving marine and wetland biogeochemistry, microbiology, and ecological modeling. It will also fund development of an interactive, educational display on the loss of coastal wetlands for the Louisiana Sea Grant's annual Ocean Commotion educational event attended by area middle and high school students, teachers, and parents. Results from this study may also inform community planners both regionally and worldwide as they prepare for sea level rise in coastal communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eustatic sea level rise and regional subsidence have created a much greater rate of coastline loss in Louisiana than is being experienced in most of the world's coastal regions, reaching global rates that are predicted to occur worldwide in 65 - 85 years. This provides a unique potential to extrapolate data from Louisiana's changing coastal carbon cycle to both regional and global models of the future impact of sea level rise and coastal erosion. By quantifying and modeling the importance of CO2 emissions resulting directly from mineralized soil organic matter from eroding coastlines, a missing element can be added to climate change models. The PIs here plan to investigate the fate of the coastal wetland carbon pool as it erodes using field sampling, laboratory analysis, mesocosm manipulations, and the creation of a coupled physical-biogeochemical model for the basin being studied. Beyond quantifying increased CO2 emission, the PIs will also address the potential for increased eutrophication due to input of nutrients from eroded soils, as well as the potential for future contribution to existing hypoxic zones in the northern Gulf of Mexico that result from excessive nutrient input from the Mississippi River watershed.</AbstractNarration>
