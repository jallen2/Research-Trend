    <AbstractNarration>The significance of the proposed project is that it will bring together computer science education and education researchers who have completed successful projects of various kinds, and synthesize the knowledge they have gathered in terms of published guidelines for educational research, i.e., "Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development" as published jointly by the US Department of Education and NSF in 2013. While this document is detailed in general information it lacks guidelines specific to a particular discipline. These workshops will focus on providing the computer science education community detailed examples of computer science education projects which incorporate Education Research. These examples will serve as guidelines to the computer science education community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project, to understand, synthesize, and propagate the essence of successful education efforts, will be achieved through two focused workshops associated with major CS education conferences. The first workshop in 2016 will be more formative in nature and help develop ideas, projects, and panels for discussion at the second workshop. The second workshop in 2017 will focus on engagement with potential proposers of computing education research and will promote their adherence to the guidelines and their development of well identified educational research questions and evaluation mechanisms appropriate for the type of proposed research.</AbstractNarration>
