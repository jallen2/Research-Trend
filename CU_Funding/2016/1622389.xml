    <AbstractNarration>1622389&lt;br/&gt;Gentner, Drew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses an important aspect of the chemistry of air pollutants. The research will develop novel tools and methods that overcome present analytical barriers. The principal investigator (PI) will develop new technologies to address future problems related to the environment or other challenges relevant to society. This proposal has clear broad impacts on society and well-being via addressing the environmental health risk of air pollution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the efficacy of "switchable" polarity materials for the collection and/or chromatographic separation of the most elusive components of the atmosphere that have high polarity and hydrophilicity due to their highly oxidized state. The PI will explore and evaluate methods that use switchable surfaces to alter the polarity of sample collection media and/or sample analysis with changes in the stationary phase of gas or liquid chromatography systems. The polarity of switchable materials is increased via reversible reactions with added carbon dioxide (CO2). Subsequent purging with an inert gas or solvent removes the CO2 and returns the material to its low-polarity precursor. This provides a novel and potentially transformative way to selectively collect/separate polar chemical species that are thermally-degraded or lost in other analytical instrumentation. The techniques proposed would seed a new generation of chromatography methods (with Liquid and Gas Chromatography) where the polarity of the stationary phase can be changed rather than the mobile phase, opening new avenues of analysis and potentially reducing solvent needs. There are many applications to gas- and aerosol-phase compounds relevant to the atmosphere, but also to other laboratory methods where polar analytes require collection/separation from a fluid or chromatographic separation without solvents. This includes novel air sampling inlets of minimal size with coupled collection and separation of polar compounds on the same device. There is also the potential for sampling systems that are directly applicable to the study of water-soluble compounds and their aqueous chemistry in the atmosphere. The results of these methods will seed a new understanding of atmospheric oxidation chemistry that will improve models and enable comprehensive air quality management plans. The anticipated results will aid in sustainability science by providing new usable knowledge to model future air quality, formulate policy, and inform the public. The proposal also contributes to training and career development for a postdoctoral scholar. The results will be quickly disseminated to the public via a potential high-impact journal publication and publically available papers and information on the group website.</AbstractNarration>
