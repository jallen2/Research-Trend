    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Lane College seeks to improve the first-year experience for Biology and Chemistry majors. The project aims to improve student retention, engagement, and academic progress in STEM by infusing research and peer-led team learning in General Biology and General Chemistry foundational courses. Lane College freshmen are mainly from underserved minority populations, and many are first generation college students who would not otherwise receive the benefit of higher education. In addition, very few students engage in undergraduate research opportunities and most are underprepared for a career in STEM. This project will engage a large number of underserved minority students in scientific research, improve student foundational laboratory skills, and provide students with qualifications for graduate and professional school. It will significantly increase the number of Lane College students completing the Biology and Chemistry programs. These benefits will result in an increase in the number of minority students entering STEM fields, thereby leading to a more diverse workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the project is to improve STEM retention through student-focused approaches that enhance student learning and core competencies within foundational courses: General Biology and General Chemistry. This goal will be accomplished through the following specific objectives: 1) Adopt and implement an evidence-based Peer Tutoring approach in foundational courses for Biology and Chemistry to increase student retention and academic performance; and 2) Develop core competencies necessary for success in a career in science early through inquiry-based experiences in General Biology and General Chemistry Laboratory courses. The benefits of achieving the objectives of this project include: 1) increased student learning of fundamental concepts in Biology and Chemistry; and 2) improved STEM education and research at Lane College while honing students' interest in STEM fields as a major and as a career. This project is a collaborative effort between the Biology and Chemistry departments within the Division of Natural and Physical Sciences and Mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
