    <AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support to enable selected students in the field of optimization to attend the 2016 Mixed Integer Programming Workshop (MIP 2016), to be held in Coral Gables, Florida, 23-26 May 2016. The MIP workshop is held annually in North America and is designed to encourage participation of junior researchers in integer programming and related areas. A primary focus of this workshop is to showcase young researchers, and to increase the visibility for accomplished students at an early stage in their career, which is especially helpful given the very long refereeing and publication process in mathematical programming. The workshop consists of a single track of 23 invited talks, with about one half of the speakers being junior faculty/postdoctoral fellows, as well as a well-attended student poster session. The workshop also provides an opportunity for graduate students to network with the world's top researchers. A goal of the MIP workshop is to keep the cost of attending as low as possible to encourage participation of underrepresented and minority students, and junior researchers. This award will help accomplish that goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will encourage broader student attendance at MIP 2016. There will be approximately 25 student posters presented at the workshop. The requested funding would provide $500 in travel funding for 10 of these presenters. These travel grants will be awarded through a competitive process and thus receipt of these travel support will be considered an honor by the recipients. Applications will be evaluated by the program committee. Selected students will have the opportunity to attend the conference and present their poster at the MIP workshop's student poster session. The MIP workshop's student poster session is a great way for students to showcase their work to established researchers in integer programming. These sessions are traditionally well attended and serve as a spring board for networking. The interaction between the student poster presenters and established professionals (from both industry and academia) will benefit students' careers. The MIP workshop's poster session encourages students to engage in high quality research methods and to develop effective writing and communication skills. In addition, there is also an award for the best poster presented by a student.</AbstractNarration>
