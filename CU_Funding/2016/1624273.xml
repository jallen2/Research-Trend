    <AbstractNarration>The past decade has witnessed tremendous technological advances in the miniaturization, low-cost, and high-performance sensors, actuators, computing and communication modules. These advances have been the primary accelerator for the fields of robotics and Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), which have gained much progress since its initiation a little more than a decade ago. To date, MAVs have shown increasing applications in a variety of scientific and commercial applications in defense, civil, industrial, and agricultural areas. Compared to fixed or rotary wing MAVs, flapping wing MAVs are unique in its hovering capability, maneuverability, and stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work include the creation and development of the first hardware prototype of autonomous flapping wing MAV capable of hovering, and a foundational framework and methodology for system dynamic models and flight control of flapping wing MAVs. Over the past few years, this I-Corps team has developed several prototypes of flapping wing MAVs inspired by insects and hummingbirds. These working prototypes feature low power, high frequency flapping wing motion, long fatigue life with minimal moving parts (without four bar mechanisms), and the potential of autonomous flight. During the course of the proposed I-Corps project, the team will investigate the market feasibility of the flapping wing MAVs to be applied in various industrial, civil, military, and commercial areas.</AbstractNarration>
