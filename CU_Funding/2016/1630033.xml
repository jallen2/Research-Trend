    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Differential Geometry in the Large" will take place July 11 to 15, 2016 in Florence, Italy. The grant covers travel expenses and hotel expenses for graduate students, postdocs, and senior mathematicians without other federal funding. Further local expenses are covered by Italian grants and funds from the University of Florenz. Participation by women and under represented minorities is actively sought and encouraged. The meeting will encourage interaction between recent Ph.D.'s based in the US and their Italian counterparts. Closer relationships will be formed between graduate students that could well lead to mathematical collaborations in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will provide an environment for American graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s in which they can learn about new developments in global Riemannian geometry, through research talks by international experts. The 4 topics selected, manifolds with lower curvature bounds, geometric flows, special geometries and min-max theory have been particularly productive over the last few years. The participants will also be given an opportunity to present their results through talks and poster sessions, enabling especially younger participants to initiate conversations with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional details can be found in the website: http://www.dma.unifi.it/~verdiani/dgl2016/</AbstractNarration>
