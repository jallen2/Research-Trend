    <AbstractNarration>Large-memory applications, including data analytics, in-memory object&lt;br/&gt;caches, and in-memory databases, are a major consumer of data center&lt;br/&gt;resources. Moreover, these applications can effectively use more&lt;br/&gt;memory than a single computer can provide. Traditional approaches to&lt;br/&gt;scaling these applications involve parallelism across multiple&lt;br/&gt;computers. However, that may not use resources cost-effectively, as&lt;br/&gt;the ratio of processing, networking, and memory is determined by the&lt;br/&gt;configuration of the underlying computers, not the application. This&lt;br/&gt;project explores disaggregated servers, or "rack-scale computers".&lt;br/&gt;These servers consist of pools of processors, memory, and I/O devices&lt;br/&gt;within a rack that can be flexibly allocated to virtual machines based&lt;br/&gt;on the needs of their resident applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on one aspect of disaggregated servers: managing&lt;br/&gt;a large pool of memory within the rack. Specifically, using this pool&lt;br/&gt;to dynamically add memory to and remove memory from virtual machines.&lt;br/&gt;This will enable applications to handle bursty load without the need&lt;br/&gt;to spin up/down entire virtual machines. In order to effectively&lt;br/&gt;manage memory across virtual machines, the hypervisor will need a&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of how memory is being used, by both the guest&lt;br/&gt;operating systems and applications. Therefore, we are exploring the&lt;br/&gt;interfaces, mechanisms, and policies within and between the&lt;br/&gt;hypervisor, guest operating system, and application that will enable&lt;br/&gt;the use of large disaggregated memories. This research is one step &lt;br/&gt;towards rethinking what a computer is and how to construct one that &lt;br/&gt;better serves data science and analytics applications that can benefit &lt;br/&gt;from large amounts of memory.</AbstractNarration>
