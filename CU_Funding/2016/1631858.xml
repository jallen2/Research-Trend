    <AbstractNarration>PI: Ranville, Kames&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 1631858&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology holds great promise to benefit society by creating materials with novel properties and functions. The technological developments in the application of nanotechnology must be accompanied by careful examination of possible unwanted environmental consequences. This conference provides a venue for presentation of the latest research on nanotechnology and its potential impact on the environment. Feedback and discussion at this conference will provide ideas for refinement of experiments and future work on nanotechnology in natural systems. This will help advance this field to better manage potential environmental risks associated with nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that 250 participants from industry, government, academia, and non-governmental organizations will participate. The participants will include a large percentage of junior scholars (Ph.D. students and postdocs), with all students receiving partial travel support to encourage their participation. Invited speakers have largely been selected from amongst young researchers who are less than 10-years post-graduation. The conference will thus provide networking opportunities for scientists at different career stages. It is expected that collaborations across networks (SUN, LCnano, CEINT, etc) will result from discussions at this conference. A preconference workshop will train a small group of participants in novel characterization tools for nanoparticles. Overall this gathering will stimulate interactions that will push nanoscience research forward in the critical area of environmental health and safety (EHS).&lt;br/&gt;The conference will attract the leading scientists and engineers whose focus is on the EHS aspects of nanomaterials. A public outreach program is planned for Wednesday afternoon of the meeting and will allow for interactions between research scientists and middle school science teachers and students. We expect to produce educational materials that will then be used in future local K-12 programs. The proposed three and half day schedule will include a number of open discussions that will foster interactions between young investigators and more established researchers. Participants of the ICEENN will come from not only the U.S. but around the globe, ensuring a diverse and international expert group to facilitate productive discussions.</AbstractNarration>
