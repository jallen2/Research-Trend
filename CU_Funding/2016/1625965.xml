    <AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to acquire a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and necessary accessories for use in a wide array of research projects and educational activities. Scientific advances in micro and nanometer regimes in last few decades have heavily relied on critical visualization and miniaturization tools in the respective areas. Due to its ultrahigh surface and cross-sectional imaging resolutions, A TEM is essential in many fundamental research areas. Researchers at multiple departments at Oakland University have keen needs of a TEM in their researches in microelectronics, materials, physics, chemistry and other multidisciplinary areas. Acquisition of this proposed TEM will have immediate significant impact in advancing our understanding of many fundamental phenomena at the bottom of physics and chemistry in a number of application areas. The requested instrument will be shared by involved research groups across the Oakland campus and made accessible to other institutes and local industrial companies. It will make measurable contributions to the diversification of economy in the Metro Detroit area and Southeastern Michigan. Additionally, the use of the TEM in multiple existing and enabled new graduate and undergraduate courses will greatly enhance our science and engineering curricula at Oakland. It will also have direct impacts on other educational and outreach programs the PIs have been actively participating in. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested TEM from JEOL USA is a multiple imaging and analytical tool capable of transmission and diffraction electron beam imaging and x-ray energy spectroscopy with sub-nanometer morphological and cross-sectional resolutions. The easy adjustable electron energy levels of the TEM allow for imaging and analysis of a broad range of materials including biological, organics and inorganics materials such as metals, semiconductors, and ceramics, etc. Critical sample preparation tools for a variety of specimens are also included in the request. With its particular ultrahigh resolution and compositional analyses capability, the system has immediate impacts on multiple federal and state funded research programs investigating fundamental phenomena in microelectronics, new multiferroic magneto-electric nanocomposite materials and structures, nano-tribology, bio-chemical interface and sensors, new energy storage materials, etc. It also benefits multiple NSF funded educational projects across campus. The instrument will be housed in the 1400-sqft Advanced Analytical Instrumentation Center in the state-of-the-art Engineering Center (EC) that was recently completed in 2014. It will be made accessible by involved PIs and users from other institutes on a usage fee basis.</AbstractNarration>
