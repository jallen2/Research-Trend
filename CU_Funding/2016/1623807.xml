    <AbstractNarration>1623807&lt;br/&gt;Petronis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports acquisition of a superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) equipped with an in-line alternating field demagnetizer and automated sample handling system for the Department of Natural Sciences at New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU). The SRM will complement extant paleo and rock magnetic analytical equipment at NMHU and will serve as a state and regional facility for investigation for the magnetic properties of natural materials. The facility will support multiple national and international collaborative science projects. This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of training underrepresented students in methods of analysis and scientific research. NMHU is a primarily undergraduate and Hispanic Serving Institution and the investigator has a strong track record of engaging undergraduates student in laboratory and field research. Many of the students at NMHU are first-generation college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new SRM will support a wide range of research and research training applications requiring the ability to determine the magnetic remanence of often weakly magnetized materials , including studies of crustal deformation processes based on paleomagnetic and rock magnetic fabric analysis, studies of past climate conditions based on paleomagnetic proxies, paleomagnetic investigations of shallow crustal magma emplacement processes, investigation of the timing of deposition of important continental aquifers, and the timing and extent of Neoproterozoic cap carbonates indicative of past global glaciation events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
