    <AbstractNarration>At high speeds, fluid flow past an object or through a tube results in turbulence, a chaotic state of flow characterized by unpredictable motion of the vortices or eddies of the flow. Turbulence is ubiquitous, commonly experienced in aircraft or watercraft, observed in rushing rivers, and may be present in blood flow. Yet despite centuries of research on turbulence, this state of fluid flow is one of the least understood phenomena in physics. Discovering its physical origins, and fully characterizing its dynamics and the transition between smooth and turbulent flows, remain significant challenges in physics. Overcoming some of these problems is essential for reaching a deeper understanding of how numerous aspects of our universe evolve. This NSF-funded project experimentally tackles aspects of fluid flows related to turbulence in a special type of fluid for which theoretical and analytical approaches have been developed. In these fluids, called Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), microscopic droplets of gases cooled to temperatures of a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero, laser light can precisely generate, manipulate, and observe turbulence and the dynamics of the vortices that comprise turbulence. By testing theoretical predictions, this project pushes the boundaries of our understanding of these features of fluid dynamics as they appear in BECs, advancing an understanding of turbulence built up from the most fundamental framework that physicists use to describe the universe, its structure, and its dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary scientific aim of this project is the development of a complete understanding of quantized vortex dynamics in BECs, superfluids for which quantum mechanics governs the dynamics of fluid flow. To achieve this aim, a multi-faceted approach is pursued. First, the project builds on previous work to construct a state-of-the-art microscope designed for and dedicated to observing and measuring vortices and their dynamics directly in BECs. Second, the transition to turbulence in a two-dimensional BEC is studied by examining vortex generation as BECs are stirred by laser light. Results test key theoretical results, and help establish links between quantum and classical fluids. Third, the construction of a toolkit for on-demand creation and manipulation of vortices in a BEC is continued, building on previous successful methods that use moving laser beams to generate and manipulate vortices so that specific arrangements of vortices or types of fluid flow can be created and used on-demand in quantum fluid dynamics experiments. Finally, newly observed methods of vortex nucleation are examined in order to more fully round out an understanding of how vortices and turbulent fluid flows can be generated in BECs. By exploring the dynamics of BEC vortices, this work advances a broader understanding of quantum many-body phenomena in systems with vastly different microscopic properties, such as superfluids, superconductors, and the cores of neutron stars. The project relies on and promotes the scientific education and technical training of students, keys to maintaining national scientific strength and societal breadth and creativity.</AbstractNarration>
