    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program funds conferences that seek to broaden the participation of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields from groups underrepresented in those disciplines. To this end, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will hold the Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The conference will primarily include undergraduate and graduate students from the following programs at the National Science Foundation (NSF): Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology, Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, Tribal Colleges and Universities Program and Research Experiences for Undergraduates. However, any student wishing to participate in the conference, is encouraged to apply. Estimated annual conference participation is 1,000, including 650 students and 350 faculty and administrators. This conference, unlike those of most other professional societies, allows for presentations in all NSF supported disciplines, as well as presentations in interdisciplinary and crossdisciplinary areas of study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-day conference will include undergraduate and graduate student posters and oral presentations; plenary sessions that feature STEM professionals discussing their educational and career pathways and lessons learned about navigating a career in the STEM workforce; workshops focused on strategies for applying for and succeeding in graduate programs and finding funding for graduate school; and career preparation workshops focused on employment searches, use of computing and data in science, and other topics. Other conference features include exhibitors from government, academia, and business who will showcase graduate programs, fellowships, summer undergraduate research programs, employment opportunities, and international research and education opportunities. AAAS will provide pre-and post conference tools and resources for the students. The project is guided by formative and summative evaluation; as well by an advisory board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is co-funded by the following programs: Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, and Tribal Colleges and Universities Programs.</AbstractNarration>
