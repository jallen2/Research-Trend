    <AbstractNarration>Terahertz waves are very attractive for medical imaging applications since they do not pose an ionization hazard for human tissue, due to their very low energy compared to shorter wavelength waves often used in medical imaging systems. Moreover, terahertz waves experience less scattering from biological tissue compared to optical waves due to their longer wavelengths making it possible to see deeper into different biological tissue types. Additionally, several absorption lines of water lie in the terahertz frequency spectrum, making terahertz waves very powerful means for distinguishing between tissues with different hydration levels that is often useful for diagnostics purposes. The combination of these attractive attributes of terahertz waves has created a great deal of interest in terahertz imaging systems and has been utilized for various medical imaging and diagnostics applications. In spite of a significant advancement in terahertz imaging systems over recent years, existing terahertz imaging systems have constraints in their size, image acquisition time, image resolution, and detectable depth, which has limited the scope of their potential use for various medical imaging and diagnostics applications. The research component of this program will address some of the physical limitations of existing terahertz imaging systems by developing a high-performance pulsed terahertz imaging system with potential application in in-vivo imaging and diagnostics applications. Additionally, this program will integrate research with education and outreach activities by developing new courses, recruitment and involvement of undergraduate students, and organizing high-school seminars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a new generation of non-contact terahertz imaging systems that offer significantly larger detectable depths and faster image acquisition rates compared to existing terahertz imaging technologies. For this purpose, a novel pulsed terahertz imaging system based on a two-dimensional array of large area plasmonic photoconductive terahertz sources and detectors compatible with a commercial endoscope will be implemented and experimentally demonstrated. The use of large area plasmonic photoconductive sources and detectors will enhance the output power of terahertz sources, detection sensitivity of terahertz detectors, and signal-to-noise ratio, thus enabling significantly larger detectable depths for the imaging system. The proposed work presents a new perspective on the potential use of terahertz technology for various medical diagnostics applications that are not currently possible due to the shallow detectable depth and bulky nature of existing terahertz imaging systems. The proposed theoretical investigation will provide a detailed understanding of the fundamental physical limitations of plasmonic terahertz source/detector operations, while the experimental effort will develop appropriate device fabrication and packaging processes compatible with endoscopy systems.</AbstractNarration>
