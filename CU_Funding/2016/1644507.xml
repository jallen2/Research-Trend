    <AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program, (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to achieve more widespread use of an educational platform to improve the developmental trajectory of young children growing up in impoverished conditions. The Working for Kids: Building SkillsTM program consists of unique training materials that allow complex neuroscience-based principles to be understood and acted upon by parents and care givers and used to improve cognitive and related development of children. Working For Kids: Building SkillsTM includes a direct educational program, educational materials, and a train-the-trainer program to allow for broad dissemination of the Working for Kids: Building SkillsTM program. Through I-Corps L, the Working For Kids: Building SkillsTM program will determine approaches to better meet needs of potential users including parents, state child development programs, pediatricians and healthcare professionals, law enforcement, and foster care programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Working For Kids: Building SkillsTM program aims to impact several critical areas of young children growing up in impoverished conditions. Working For Kids will increase participating community members' knowledge of brain development and growth in children. The program expects to improve the development of cognitive skills and social-emotional skills of young children (3-5 years of age) of the adults that complete the Working For Kids: Building SkillsTM program. Children of participants are expected to achieve improvements in the biological aspects of healthy brain development including quality of sleep and the production of stress chemicals in the body. Full development, testing, and broader use of the Working For Kids: Building SkillsTM program will advance knowledge of how to effectively educate the general public about brain development so this information can be used and applied to improve life trajectory of children.</AbstractNarration>
