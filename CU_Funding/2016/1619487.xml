    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Materials science will play a pivotal role in solving many of the key challenges facing our society by providing a sustainable supply of energy, water, products, services, transportation, buildings, and public infrastructure. The development of materials for these applications will require new approaches and researchers who have technical expertise and who understand the complex interrelationships between materials science and other disciplines. As the premier professional society for materials researchers, the Materials Research Society (MRS) is well positioned to help its members address these challenges, and with support from the Division of Materials research, special MRS programming and activities focused on sustainable development will be held at the 2016 MRS Spring Meeting &amp; Exhibit in Phoenix, Arizona (March 28-April 1, 2016). In the near term, this effort will seed future activities and events at MRS Meetings as well as publications that put the materials and sustainability nexus in the spotlight, so as to promote expansion of meaningful research and development efforts. In the long term, the project will encourage students and young researchers, and their faculty, to view sustainability as an important challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Division of Materials Research, the 2016 MRS Spring Meeting &amp; Exhibit in Phoenix, Arizona (March 28-April 1, 2016) will feature "Focus on Sustainability" programming and activities including: (1) a two-day symposium and poster session entitled "Materials for Sustainable Development-Integrated Approaches" that will provide a medium for technically based, interdisciplinary discussions of core materials technologies and their connection with societal, ecological, and economic drivers for sustainable development, and which includes a special half-day session focused on sustainability in industry; (2) a half-day tutorial on how to teach the role of materials in sustainable development; (3) a 90-minute professional development seminar on how to integrate interdisciplinary sustainability principles into materials research; (4) a special University Chapter student poster competition on "Sustainability in My Community;" and (5) public outreach and meeting attendee engagement. The "Focus on Sustainability" program represents an investment towards building a robust community of practice around materials and sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
