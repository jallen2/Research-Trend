    <AbstractNarration>The President's Materials Genome initiative has amply recognized&lt;br/&gt;the potential of simulation for helping to design new materials "twice as fast and at a fraction&lt;br/&gt;of the cost." In the quest for novel and breakthrough properties, nanoscale science and technology&lt;br/&gt;is particularly promising, because at the nanoscale the quantum properties of matter manifest&lt;br/&gt;themselves in unexpected ways, leading to non-linear, novel behavior that cannot be predicted&lt;br/&gt;by simple extrapolation from either the molecular or the bulk limits. Furthermore, experiments&lt;br/&gt;are very difficult at these scales, since they require atomic or nearly-atomic resolution,&lt;br/&gt;yet must also account for the emergent properties that involve thousands of atoms. Advanced&lt;br/&gt;simulations can supplant much of the tedious experimentation, allowing researchers to step through&lt;br/&gt;different options in the experimental design space. More importantly, the atomic-scale design principles&lt;br/&gt;leading to the desired materials or device characteristics can be uncovered through in-depth&lt;br/&gt;analysis of computational results, leading to accelerated progress and optimal design for&lt;br/&gt;a given application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to investigate fundamental properties of nano and nano-bio structures&lt;br/&gt;with potential applications in biomolecular sensors and nano-scale electronics for beyond-Moore's-law&lt;br/&gt;era. Specifically, the project will investigate (i) carbon nanotube-based nanocircuits that can monitor&lt;br/&gt;DNA replication and potentially enable high-throughput electrical sequencing of DNA, and (ii)&lt;br/&gt;carbon-nanoribbon-based devices for nanoscale electronics and spintronics. The proposed simulations are ambitious&lt;br/&gt;and potentially transformative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to apply highly optimized quantum simulation codes to Blue Waters and to&lt;br/&gt;use them in two projects of high current interest: electrical detection of DNA sequence and&lt;br/&gt;nanoribbon-based electronics for beyond-Moore's-law era. &lt;br/&gt;In DNA sequencing, the proposed methodology based on electrical readout of the DNA sequence would constitute a major breakthrough&lt;br/&gt;and result in much faster and cheaper sequencing. It would allow for sequencing of a large&lt;br/&gt;fraction of population, enable truly personalized medicine and lead to thorough mapping and&lt;br/&gt;understanding of genetic diseases. Additionally, graphene and graphene nanoribbons are major candidates&lt;br/&gt;for future nanoscale devices for beyond-Moore's-law era. By systematically investigating the&lt;br/&gt;transport properties of nanoribbon-based electronic devices, the project will allow us to understand&lt;br/&gt;device performance at a quantum level and help to design the new generation of transistors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to cheap and broadly available DNA sequencing would revolutionize health-care and treatment.&lt;br/&gt;The computational design and discovery of appropriate nucleotides to enable electrical DNA&lt;br/&gt;sequencing would lead to new technologies and new manufacturing. Furthermore, the beyond&lt;br/&gt;Moore's law era is of great interest to computer and computational scientists, engineers and&lt;br/&gt;the general public. Finally, the project will have significant educational impact to the project's local institution&lt;br/&gt;by involving undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows,&lt;br/&gt;in leading-edge computational research, with special effort being made to ensure participation&lt;br/&gt;of members of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
