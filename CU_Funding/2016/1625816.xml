    <AbstractNarration>1625816 - Xue&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award will be used for the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for interdisciplinary research, education, and training at Rowan University, a nearby institution, Rutgers University-Camden, and other academic and industrial users in the southern New Jersey region. Rowan University, a primarily undergraduate institution serving 15,000 students, was re-designated as a "comprehensive research university" by the State of New Jersey in 2013. This new expanded role substantially broadens the mission to include cutting-edge research and to serve as an economic driving force for the region. This state-of-the-art SEM will have broad and significant impact on researchers from different backgrounds with diverse research interests. It will enhance current research projects in the areas of energy, nanotechnology, biomedical devices, and several other areas of materials research. An important secondary impact is that the SEM will facilitate inter- and intra-institutional research collaborations, allowing projects that would not have been practical otherwise. This award will enable the integration of materials science and health care through the development of biomedical monitors, bactericidal coatings, and therapies based on nanotechnology. In addition, the SEM will help grow graduate programs by allowing more comprehensive projects for graduate students to develop the expertise needed for the nation's technical workforce. Undergraduate students will have access to the system through research projects and related courses, thereby preparing them for the workforce or graduate programs, not only at Rowan, but at institutions across the country. It is anticipated that the SEM will be used by many researchers including those from groups typically underrepresented in STEM areas. These researchers will mentor underrepresented students recruited through established university and college programs. All these young researchers will have the opportunities to participate in advanced research in the exciting growth and innovation directions to which the university has committed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested SEM will bring nanoscale imaging, nanofabrication, material analysis, and biological imaging capabilities to the southern New Jersey region. As a universal tool widely used in engineering, sciences, and medicine, the SEM will have significant impact on a broad range of research areas including nanofluidics and nanoelectronics, tissue engineering, energy materials, biomedical materials and devices, and neurodegenerative disease research. This award will enable the integration of nanomaterials with novel device designs for sensors and electronics with enhanced performance. New organic and inorganic coatings will be created and studied for biomedical, electronic, and energy-related applications. Polymeric and natural biomaterials with unique micro/nano scale structures will be fabricated for tissue engineering and medical research. Furthermore, this award will help establish core research facilities supporting high-level materials and biomedical research, which have been identified as focused areas of growth by Rowan University. It will also help advance the statewide biomedical initiatives in New Jersey. In addition, this MRI project will allow Rowan researchers to establish high-performance imaging, fabrication, and analysis capabilities as a central feature for new research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
