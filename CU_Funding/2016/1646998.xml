    <AbstractNarration>This award supports student travel to the 2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlabalSIP). The conference takes place near Washington, DC, in December 2016, and consists of symposia spanning big data, deep learning, 5G communications, medical imaging, secure communications, and distributed optimization, among other emerging areas. The conference provides an unparalleled opportunity for students to take in the latest topics of current research interest. Student participation thus contributes to NSF's mission to promote the next generation of scientists and engineers, working in fields quite relevant to the Engineering Directorate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts includes broadening participation of women and underrepresented minorities, thereby fostering a diverse pool of next generation researchers in these emerging area. The social program is designed to foster interaction between participants of all symposia, thus offering students opportunities to expose themselves to emerging trends that might not be readily accessible in their home laboratories, alongside interaction with other researchers working in related fields, aiming to promote cross-fertilization of ideas. The conference will also bestow a Best Student Paper award, to be determined based on judges' notes of all papers and posters presented by students.</AbstractNarration>
