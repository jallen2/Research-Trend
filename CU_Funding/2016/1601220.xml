    <AbstractNarration>A new industrial revolution driven by design, innovation, and digital technology is currently underway in the U.S. The manufacturing industry now requires sophisticated computing and thinking skills that are challenging the U.S. workforce, and as a result educators face a major responsibility to prepare students with the 21st century skills needed to innovate and thrive in this new manufacturing environment. The CT Pathways to Innovation Advanced Manufacturing Technologies &amp; Entrepreneurship (CPI-AMTE) project uses a research validated challenge-based learning model to transform instruction in Connecticut High School Manufacturing Technology programs to strengthen college and career readiness. The CPI-AMTE instructional approach inspires and prepares students to become innovators and entrepreneurs who are ready to thrive in 21st century advanced manufacturing careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CPI-AMTE is a novel instructional model designed to engage predominantly underrepresented students from both technical and comprehensive high schools in challenge-based Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) projects that align with an advanced manufacturing initiative underway in the CT State Colleges and University system. The curricula engages students in innovative project design, research, refinement, and launching, to advance 21st century AMT core competencies, workforce readiness, and entrepreneurial skills. This multifaceted project responds to four ATE activity categories, including: 1) program development and improvement, 2) curriculum and educational materials development, 3) professional development for educators, and 4) business and entrepreneurial skills development for students. The project advances replicable instructional models that develop students' entrepreneurship, 21st century skills, and STEM technical education and career interests. Research results and tested curricula will be made publically available under an Open Educational Resources license.</AbstractNarration>
