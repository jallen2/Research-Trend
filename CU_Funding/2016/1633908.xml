    <AbstractNarration>Mercury is a global contaminant whose presence in the biosphere has been increased by human activity. The ocean plays an important role in the global cycling of mercury. Understanding the biogeochemistry of mercury, and its methylated forms, particularly methylmercury, is important for understanding the role of climate change and human activities on the accumulation of methylmercury in seafood. Elevated levels of methylmercury in aquatic organisms are a major concern as there are substantial human health and wildlife effects associated with consuming contaminated fish and shellfish. To promote a forum for exchange of information and synthesis, scientists in 1990 held the first international mercury conference, which has since become a regular conference every 2-3 years. Now known as the International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant (ICMGP), the thirteenth ICMGP is planned for Providence, RI in July 2017. This will be the third time the meeting has been held in the U.S. This award, with contributions from four different divisions of the National Science Foundation, provides support related to U.S. coordination of this conference, primarily in the form of travel support for and mentoring of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planned mentoring activities at the meeting will provide students an excellent opportunity to interact with established and young scientists and to gain insights into publishing their research, writing resumes, networking and finding employment, and writing grants to obtain funding for research. The meeting is the primary forum for the dissemination of new results of mercury research, and promotes international collaboration in research and synthesis. Finally, as methylmercury levels in seafood, freshwater fish and other foods are an important driver for concerns about human and environmental health, the proposed activities at the conference will enhance understanding and lead to better management of the potential health impacts of this element, in all its forms, especially in light of the added impacts, which are not well understood, of climate change. Activities at the meeting will also endeavor to build links with tribal and other groups, and medical practitioners not directly related to the meeting, and to enhance interaction between journalists and scientists to communicate the results of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
