    <AbstractNarration>The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program is a cooperative international science and science education program jointly supported by NASA and NSF, with additional in-kind support from NOAA, Department of State, and USAID. Using inquiry-based, place-based, and problem-based pedagogies, GLOBE directly supports national efforts to engage a new generation of diverse students in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines and encourage them to consider careers in STEM. GLOBE annual meetings bring together GLOBE Country Coordinators and U.S. Partnership Coordinators, members of the scientific community that support GLOBE, and representatives of the sponsoring agencies. Annual meetings provide a venue for both sharing of best practices for GLOBE implementation that have been developed through the creative efforts of the community, as well as additional training in the use of GLOBE program resources and technology. This will be the 20th annual meeting for GLOBE, offering an opportunity for the community to both reflect on and celebrate their many accomplishments and focus on effective implementation of emerging opportunities for the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the 2016 GLOBE Annual Meeting, which is being held July 17-22 at the Estes Park Conference Center, Colorado. Over 150 adult members and 50 student members of the worldwide GLOBE community are expected to attend. The University Consortium for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and the GLOBE Implementation Office (GIO) are leading the planning effort for this meeting, with contributions from other members of the GLOBE community. This year's annual meeting is focusing on three main themes that reflect emerging priorities within the GLOBE program: (1) student research and science fairs; (2) STEM equity and inclusion; and, (3) citizen science. The annual meeting is also being used to convene strategic planning meetings for the four GLOBE Working Groups related to education, technology, science, and evaluation. The ~50 pre-college students attending the annual meeting will also participate in a concurrent 2-day hands-on research experience based on the GLOBE protocols that is being organized by the Estes Institute.</AbstractNarration>
