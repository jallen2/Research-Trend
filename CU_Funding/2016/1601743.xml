    <AbstractNarration>Emerging applications of photonics, photonics-enabled technologies, and precision optics impact both economic development and national security in the United States. To help meet the expanding need for photonics and precision optics technicians, this project at Montana State University Gallatin College will develop a two-year photonics and laser technician program designed to advance the knowledge and skill-sets of students entering the photonics workforce, prepare students for rewarding jobs with photonics employers, and provide employed technicians additional education and training to support technical innovation. The project will enhance the photonics infrastructure in the Gallatin Valley, which supports the goal of the Montana Photonics Industry Alliance to make the Gallatin Valley one of the premier photonics region in the nation. The project will advance rural technician education and broaden the diversity of the technician workforce while it increases the number of photonics trained technicians to support critical industries in the national economy. It will expand productivity and efficiency of local companies by providing highly skilled technicians for employment. It will improve industry connections to academia through the participation of industry on an industry advisory board and in curriculum review, an internship program, job placement, resource sharing, and program feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the framework developed by the ATE National Center for Optics and Photonics Education (OP-TEC) (DUE 1303732) and advice from industry partners, this program will educate students; teachers, and the community about photonics technology. To meet this goal the project will (a) implement an Associate of Applied Science Photonics and Laser Technology (AAS PLT) program, (b) adapt and further develop photonics curriculum and coursework; (c) equip an optics/photonics laboratory for education and training; (d) provide professional development for faculty to prepare them to teach photonics courses in the AAS PLT program using the Fundamentals of Light and Lasers curriculum of OP-TEC; (e) conduct outreach activities to promote the new program in eight area high schools, offering career pathways and dual enrollment; and (f) implement an internship program to assure that students have exposure to local photonics companies. High school students and teachers will be taught about the importance of photonics technology in the 21st century and thus increase the knowledge of photonics by high school instructors, students, and the community through direct recruiting, career fairs, dual enrollment, professional development activities, and marketing strategies. All of the results of this project will be fed back to OP-TEC and the broader photonics community to advance their knowledge and help refine their framework for enhancing Optics and Photonics education. A comprehensive evaluation will be conducted to determine the success of the project and its deliverables.</AbstractNarration>
