    <AbstractNarration>SES-1602541&lt;br/&gt;Stephen Benard&lt;br/&gt;Trenton D. Mize&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite an increase in some legal rights and acceptance of same-sex relationships, gay men and lesbian women continue to face disadvantages in the labor market. Gay men earn less than comparable heterosexual men, and studies have shown that both gay men and lesbian women face hiring discrimination. Despite these initial studies establishing labor market inequalities for gay men and lesbian women, there remains little evidence to explain why the disadvantages exist. Multiple competing explanations exist, including: (a) disadvantaging stereotypes that link sexual orientation with assumptions of competence and ability, (b) stereotypes of gay men and lesbian women as less masculine/feminine than heterosexual men and women, and (c) a society and labor market that have preferences for traditional masculine behavior in high status occupations and leadership positions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will complete two laboratory studies, two survey experiments, and a test with nationally representative survey data to examine hiring discrimination and the mechanisms underlying unequal treatment. Study 1 tests for hiring discrimination in entry-level jobs using both a controlled laboratory experiment and a survey experiment in a diverse sample. Study 2 examines hiring discrimination for positions of senior leadership using a controlled laboratory study and a survey experiment in a diverse sample. Study 3 uses nationally representative survey data to examine the existing patterns of labor market inequalities. The experimental studies provide key causal evidence of discrimination and the ability to test for underlying mechanisms, while the survey data provides generalizable and representative evidence. The project will provide key evidence to help address existing inequalities and will also serve as a training site for student research assistants who will learn experimental research techniques and methodology while working on the project.</AbstractNarration>
