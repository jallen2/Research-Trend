    <AbstractNarration>1. Astronomers are currently building the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) in northern Chile. It will provide a flood of astronomical data when it goes into operation in 2019. This will greatly increase demand for spectroscopic studies of many interesting targets. Spacecraft observations will contribute tremendous numbers of additional targets. To meet these demands, the Investigators will construct a novel spectrograph for the SOAR telescope in the southern hemisphere. This instrument will use many tiny mirrors to steer light from small patches of the sky into either the spectrograph or an imaging channel. The Intellectual Merit of the project comes from its ability to provide rapid follow-up observations of LSST discoveries. It will also enable studies in very crowded regions of the sky, such as the central bulge of our own Milky Way Galaxy. This project serves the national interest by advancing the quality and type of science we can acquire about the Milky Way galaxy and other discoveries made with the LSST. The Broader Impacts of the project include the involvement of graduate students in all phases of the project. This will contribute strongly to STEM education in the important area of instrument development. The Investigators will also explain their research results to the public through press releases and the internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. When the LSST comes into operation in 2019, there will be enormous pressure on 4-meter-class telescopes to carry out immediate follow-up observations as well as long-term monitoring of LSST discoveries. In addition, there will be a need for spectroscopic observations in crowded fields such as globular clusters, the Galactic Bulge, and the Magellanic Clouds. To help meet these demands, the Investigators will construct a novel spectrograph for the SOAR 4.1-meter telescope in the southern hemisphere. The SOAR Adaptive Module Optical Spectrograph (SAMOS) will employ a digital micromirror device as a slit-selection mechanism. Each randomly addressable mirror can be tilted to redirect light either to the primary spectrograph channel or to a parallel imaging channel. The Intellectual Merit of the project is that, as an adaptive-optics instrument, SAMOS will be able to respond to demand for observations in very rich fields - such as are needed, for example, for HST or JWST follow-up investigations - as well as for studying LSST targtes. A Broader Impact highlighted by the proposers is that opportunities for remote observations with SAMOS will make the instrument available to faculty, staff, and students at institutions with limited budgets. In addition, graduate students at all three participating institutions will be involved in all phases of the project, and research results will be made available to the general public through press releases and the internet.</AbstractNarration>
