    <AbstractNarration>This grant is to provide partial support for U.S.-based graduate and undergraduate students to attend the Ninth Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS-2016), a scientific conference to be held at Tarrytown, NY from July 6-8, 2016. Combinatorial search is an area of artificial intelligence that deals with systematic trial-and-error exploration of a very large number of alternative solutions to a problem. NSF funding is crucial to support students who would otherwise not be able to attend the symposium. Attending such meetings and presenting their research is an important part of the professional development of students, addressing a critical shortage of highly-skilled computer scientists in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOCS brings together researchers in heuristic search and combinatorial optimization from all areas of artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, operations research, and bioinformatics. The intellectual merit of this activity stems from bringing together in one place at one time researchers from otherwise diverse areas of computer science that both advance the state of the art in heuristic search and/or combinatorial optimization, and also use these tools in their research. The broader impacts come from cross-fertilization of different fields that advance and/or use these tools, by promoting research in this area by providing a small intimate meeting on these topics, a forum for presenting such work, and archival proceedings for publishing work in this area. These latter goals are instrumental to training new researchers in this area.</AbstractNarration>
