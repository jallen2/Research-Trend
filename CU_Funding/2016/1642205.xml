    <AbstractNarration>Broadening participation in all of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields as well as in computing, which is critical to all of the STEM fields, is a national challenge. Achieving gender equity in computing is one of the more pressing challenges in the broadening participation effort because of the precipitous decline in the proportion of women earning degrees in computing over the last 20 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together thought leaders to share experiences in an effort to understand the issues faced by black women in computing. Black women, as a group, face acute underrepresentation in computing. Their challenges rest at the intersection of race and gender in the larger broadening participation effort. The goals of this workshop are to: 1) explore the intersectional experiences (race and gender) of black women in CS; and 2) formulate strategies and a plan of action to address the lack of awareness and action around this intersectionality. The workshop addresses these goals by featuring break-out sessions that will enable the collection of rich, qualitative information about the experiences of black women in computing, as well as capture best practices for supporting this population. The data and report from the workshop will inform the STEM+C research community on the specific factors associated with women of color in computing.</AbstractNarration>
