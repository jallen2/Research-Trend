    <AbstractNarration>Atoms and molecules in the gas phase are currently used in many applications: the world's most accurate clocks, sensors, and prototype quantum computers. Many of these applications would greatly benefit from higher numbers and densities of the atoms and molecules used. This can be achieved by implanting the atoms or molecules of interest within a solid. Unfortunately, most solids alter the properties of implanted atoms or molecules to such an extent that they are no longer experimentally useful. One promising exception to this rule is solid parahydrogen: a cryogenic crystal of hydrogen molecules prepared in a purified nuclear spin state. This "quantum solid" preserves many of the important properties of implanted atoms and molecules. This project will investigate the properties of parahydrogen relevant for atomic physics applications, and combine the powerful tools of atomic and molecular physics with the high numbers and densities that can only be achieved in the solid phase. This has the potential to advance applications such as magnetometry, molecular structure imaging, and fundamental physics tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experimental physics research program will measure the optical pumping properties of atoms implanted in solid parahydrogen, and measure spin relaxation and coherence times. These are crucial parameters for magnetometry applications. A survey of atomic dopants and crystal parameters will be conducted to find favorable conditions and help to understand the underlying physics. The behavior of implanted polar molecules, specifically the ability to use external fields to orient the molecules, will be studied. This is not only of interest for understanding the interaction of molecules with their parahydrogen host, but also a crucial first step for proposals to search for an electric dipole moment using heavy polar molecules in the solid phase.</AbstractNarration>
