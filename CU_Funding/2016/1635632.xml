    <AbstractNarration>Until recently, organic matter decomposition (respiration) was thought to occur primarily in oxygenated seawater; however, evidence has surfaced that respiration can occur under low oxygen conditions (anaerobic) similar to those found within microenvironments of suspended particles. As such, the possibility exists that these anaerobic reactions are more widespread than previously thought and could play a significant role in the cycling of sulfur, nitrogen, and some trace metals. Researchers from the University of California-Los Angeles and the University of Washington plan to study these reactions by developing a particle-redox model to simulate the biogeochemistry of anaerobic microenvironments and make predictions which can be tested against available ocean data (GEOTRACES program). The study is intended to understand the conditions needed to cycle nitrogen and sulfur in these particle microenvironments, the scavenging of trace metals during sulfide precipitations, and develop a tracer for particle bound denitrification (removal of nitrogen by microbes). This project will be the first funding support for two tenure-track faculty who are dedicated to education and public outreach to help broaden involvement in ocean sciences. One of the investigators will be involved as a youth educator in the "Students on Ice" program which conducts workshops that allows youth to gain experience at sea learning about oceanography, whereas the other would organize a series of workshops to engage students from the Rochester City School District in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to investigate the evidence that has been coming out in recent years that anaerobic microenvironments within organic particles are widespread throughout the ocean and are a significant contributor to denitrification and sulfur reduction rates in otherwise oxygenated waters. To do so, the researchers plan to develop a new modeling framework to simulate the biogeochemistry of anaerobic microenvironments and make predictions which can be tested against available observations such as those from the GEOTRACES program. Overall the objectives of this research are to (1) understand the water column conditions and particle properties that lead to these anaerobic microenvironments, (2) test whether sulfate reduction rates are consistent with the metal precipitation signatures known for low oxygen water, and (3) predict the geochemical signature of particle bound denitrification and determine its rate from the large-scale distribution of nitrogen tracers. Understanding the anaerobic processes taking place within anaerobic microenvironments of organic particles in the water column is likely to update the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen, sulfur, and trace metals.</AbstractNarration>
