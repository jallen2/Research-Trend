    <AbstractNarration>This project will explore how chemical and physical phenomena can be visualized using low-cost infrared (IR) cameras. Many chemistry concepts are difficult to comprehend because they cannot be seen directly. IR camera imaging uses false color on the screen of portable electronic devices to indicate thermal differences, and is readily accessible in the undergraduate chemistry laboratory. By observing the heat absorbed, released, or distributed in a chemical process, rich information about the process can be rendered visible. This project will develop seven curriculum units based on the use of IR imaging to support, accelerate, and expand inquiry-based learning for a range of chemistry concepts, such as heat transfer, chemical reactions, phase changes, colligative properties, enzyme kinetics, and light-matter interaction. New evidence regarding the impact of direct visualization of invisible processes on student learning and concept development will be generated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bowling Green State University (BGSU) and Concord Consortium will develop new curriculum units that explore visualization of thermal processes using low-cost IR cameras, and conduct research on student learning associated with visualization. The units will employ the predict-observe-explain (POE) cycle to scaffold inquiry in the activities developed. To demonstrate the versatility and generality of this approach, the units will cover a range of topics in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Educational research will investigate robust evidence of learning and identifying the underlying cognitive mechanisms that lead to improved student learning. This information will lead to effective strategies for using IR imaging in the chemistry classroom. This study will be conducted using a diverse student population at many collaborating institutions: BGSU, Boston College, Bradley University, Owens Community College, Parkland College, Saint John Fisher College, and State University of New York at Geneseo.</AbstractNarration>
