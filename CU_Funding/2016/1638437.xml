    <AbstractNarration>PI: Elder, Alison&lt;br/&gt;#1638437&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 8th International Nanotoxicology Congress is focused broadly on the human and environmental health effects of engineered nanoscale materials. There will be presentations about both the benefits and health risks associated with nanotechnology. Professionals from many different disciplines will come together with the goal of determining how nanomaterials can be used in a way that does not create harm for the environment or for the humans who make and use them.&lt;br/&gt;The conference has three objectives to: 1) bring together scientists from academia, industry, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations to present new research findings and analyses to better understand exposures to engineered nanomaterials and their potential impact on human and environmental health; 2) critically evaluate the progress of the preceding decade of nanotoxicology research and to develop new strategies and research priorities to facilitate decision-making regarding the safe implementation of nanotechnology; and 3) support the participation of junior investigators and scientists from underrepresented groups and underdeveloped countries. The objectives will be met via a scientifically-rigorous program that includes high-level and focused lectures, interactive workshops and poster sessions, and a commitment to inclusiveness across disciplines, seniority, sex, nationality, and status. Participants are coming from academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations to share their respective expertise.&lt;br/&gt;In successfully meeting the conference objectives, there will be significant benefits for both scientists and the US public. Specifically, the integrated conference program will maximize interactions amongst scientists to support the prioritization of future research and the establishment of fruitful collaborations. For the public, a successful conference will contribute to both the market viability of nanotechnology and its implementation in a way that does not put human or environmental health at risk.</AbstractNarration>
