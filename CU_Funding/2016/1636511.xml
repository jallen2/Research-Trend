    <AbstractNarration>Current measures of coaching and assessing student writing, while time consuming and well intentioned, fail to provide students with the feedback they need to improve as writers and peer reviewers. Improving feedback and assessment of students' writing is critical to U.S. efforts to compete globally. Currently, U.S. rankings for literacy have been declining over the past decade: in 2012, the Programme for International Student Assessment concluded that the U.S. literacy rate fell from 10th to 20th in the latest study on global rankings. In 2013, the College Board reported 57% of SAT takers did not qualify as college ready. The ACT found 31% of high school graduates failed to meet ACT College Readiness Benchmarks, and the most recent NAEP Writing Report determined 73% of 12th graders received scores of Below Basic or Basic as opposed to Proficient or Advanced in 2011. Few educators or students dispute the importance of quality feedback on students? writing. However, over the past 100 years, researchers have repeatedly found that teachers' grades lack validity and reliability; that teachers' comments on papers often lack helpful, critical commentary; and that students do not know how to critique other students' writing even though they are frequently assigned peer-reviews. While teachers? shared use of rubrics has led to improved inter-rater agreement scores?especially in testing situations where teachers can practice scoring to reach stronger levels of consensus?comparisons of teachers' scores across sections of the same course in authentic learning contexts has found great variance in teachers' scores and comments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to help expedite document markup, peer-review, team-project, eportfolio, and writing-assessment processes; empower instructors and students to provide more helpful, timely feedback; better prepare students for peer reviews and team projects; and enable high schools, colleges, and universities to more accurately assess learning, improve retention, and prepare accreditation reports. Ultimately, this research aspires to conceptualize digital tools that will enable the U.S. to complete on global measures of cognitive, interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies. During the I-Corps program, the team will interview academic stakeholders (writing program administrators, faculty, and university administrators who are concerned with retention and business stakeholders (technical writing firms, competitors, and NLP researchers)?to evaluate mockups for writing analytics, student-retention alerts, data visualizations, and intelligent tutoring systems. For example, the team will ask writing program administrators if they would be likely to adopt and use tools that provide inter-rater agreement reports on instructors? scores in relation to students' peer-review scores or lexical analysis of the instructors? and students? written commentaries. Additionally, the team will hold focus groups with instructors and students to ascertain the helpfulness of NLP-based reports that vet peer reviews. Ultimately, this research will explore the efficacy of second-generation digital tools?i.e., tools that provide writing analytics that give information back to users based on their use of a tool, such as lexical analysis of comments, reports of inter-rater agreement among reviewers, reports that analyze the length and quality of feedback, or badges that incentivize quality reviews. By the end of the I-Corps program, the team will prioritize a development plan and a business plan that will allow for commercialization of the technology, My Reviewers http://myreviewers.com.</AbstractNarration>
