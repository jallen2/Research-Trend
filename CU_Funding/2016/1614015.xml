    <AbstractNarration>This research investigates an interesting evolutionary trade-off in coreid insects. Autotomy, the dropping of a limb, can be an effective trait to avoid predation and entrapment. However, sometimes it comes at a high cost - not being able to reproduce. The research adopts a multidimensional approach to investigate the causes and consequences of the autotomy response in the Coreidae clade (Insecta: Hemiptera), examining species that need the hind legs for reproductive success and those where the legs play no role in successful mating. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Daiqin Li of the National University of Singapore. Dr. Li is a leading behavioral ecologist with expertise in anti-predator defenses in insects. The results of the research will be valuable to other areas of biology, especially those involving evolutionary trade-off. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Autotomy, induced limb removal, is an effective trait used to avoid predation and entrapment. To investigate why coreids drop their weapons, we need to investigate the interaction between autotomy and reproductive selected weaponry. To do this, the PI will use a phylogenetic context to identify the ancestral state leading to this interaction (i.e., is autotomy ancestral to weaponry or vice versa?). Regardless of how this interaction evolved, the negative consequences of losing a weapon persist. Thus, the work will investigate if sexual selection has constrained autotomy to increase weapon retention. If sexual selection constrains autotomy it would suggest that sexual selection can constrain a naturally selected trait, lending insights into the conflict between natural and sexual selection. In addition to the research, this award will initiate a novel international collaborative effort between the National University of Singapore and the University of Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>
