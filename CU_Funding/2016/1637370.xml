    <AbstractNarration>#1637370&lt;br/&gt;Ma, Yanbao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With continuous decrease in the size of micro-/nano-/optoelectronic devices and structures, the manipulation and control of heat transport is becoming a bottleneck for the development of many nanotechnologies. While thermal conductivity in macroscale heat transfer is a material property and independent of the sample size and heating method, the measured thermal conductivity in micro-/nanosystem may depend on the sample size and the frequency in unsteady heating. The size-dependent or frequency-dependent thermal conductivity indicates the breakdown of Fourier's law to describe nondiffusive heat transfer in micro-/nanosystems. The unified nondiffusive-diffusive model to be developed in this project will provide powerful theoretical and numerical design tools for thermal management in micro/nanosystems that is crucial for breaking the developmental bottleneck of nanotechnologies. The integrated research and education plan will encourage more women and students from traditionally underrepresented communities to enter STEM careers and participate in the proposed research activities at UC Merced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phonons are the dominant heat carriers in insulators and semiconductors. The breakdown of Fourier?s law is due to the fact that there is significant ballistic heat conduction when the characteristic length scale becomes comparable to or even much smaller than the mean-free-path (MFP) of phonons. Currently, there are two major technical barriers in understanding nondiffusive heat transfer: (a) a lack of practical mesoscale nondiffusive heat transfer models that can be applied to experimental data analysis; and (b) a lack of ad hoc parameters to characterize the unique features of nondiffusive heat transfer. Consequently, most current studies of nondiffusive heat transfer focus on the predictions and measurements of effective thermal conductivity (ETC) within the framework of Fourier's law, but these provide little insight on the unique features of nondiffusive heat transfer. Although molecular scale models can describe heat conduction over a few nanometers, and Fourier's law delineates macroscale heat transfer over tens of microns or larger, a gap exists in heat conduction models between the molecular scale and the macroscale. The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) was supposed to fill this gap, but it is prohibitively expensive to solve with so many unknown parameters. Therefore, practical and computationally inexpensive mesoscale nondiffusive heat transfer models are indispensable to bridge this gap to describe heat transfer by phonons over length scales ranging from tens of nanometers to tens of microns. The research objective for this project is to develop and validate a mesoscale nondifussive heat transfer (including ballistic and ballistic-diffusive) model to elucidate unique features that cannot be characterized by thermal conductivity. The success of this project will not only bridge the gap in heat conduction theories between macroscale and molecular scale models by developing high-fidelity unified nondiffusive-diffusive models for multiscale heat transfer, but also open up new venues to study unique features of nondiffusive heat transfer outside the framework of Fourier's law.</AbstractNarration>
