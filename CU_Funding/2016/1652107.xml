    <AbstractNarration>With the advent of emerging massive datasets in image processing,&lt;br/&gt;biology, finance, and so on, traditional data mining systems&lt;br/&gt;face new challenges to induce knowledge and discover causal&lt;br/&gt;relations in dynamic streaming feature environments, where new&lt;br/&gt;features continuously stream in over time. These challenges include&lt;br/&gt;(1) continuous growth of feature volumes over time, (2) a huge feature&lt;br/&gt;space, even of unknown or infinite size, and (3) not all features&lt;br/&gt;being available before learning begins. These challenges call for a&lt;br/&gt;new learning paradigm with continuously increasing features. In this&lt;br/&gt;project, we take the increasing feature volumes as streaming features,&lt;br/&gt;and the corresponding learning problem is referred to as Online&lt;br/&gt;Learning with Streaming Features (OLSF). Since existing online&lt;br/&gt;learning efforts mostly deal with data with increasing observations&lt;br/&gt;but fixed feature dimensions, OLSF provides a unique chance to unfold&lt;br/&gt;and characterize pattern trends for dynamic systems with streaming&lt;br/&gt;features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to address two fundamental issues for OLSF: (1)&lt;br/&gt;causal discovery with sequentially increasing feature dimensions; and&lt;br/&gt;(2) causal relations for feature selection. We design novel methods&lt;br/&gt;and algorithms for causal discovery in OLSF and establish formal connections&lt;br/&gt;between casual discovery and feature selection by investigating the&lt;br/&gt;mutual benefits between them in the context of online stream feature&lt;br/&gt;learning. To evaluate the proposed research, we conduct empirical&lt;br/&gt;studies on a large body of benchmark datasets, as well as with a&lt;br/&gt;domain-specific real-world case study in personalized news filtering&lt;br/&gt;and summarization where the feature space changes over time. The&lt;br/&gt;new algorithms and techniques in this project will advance our ability&lt;br/&gt;to discover knowledge from dynamic systems using streaming features&lt;br/&gt;with bounded resources. The spectrum of the methods from the project&lt;br/&gt;will not only enrich our knowledge and understanding of pattern&lt;br/&gt;discovery and machine learning for dynamic systems, but also provide a&lt;br/&gt;new view to capture and characterize dynamic systems from a streaming&lt;br/&gt;feature perspective.</AbstractNarration>
