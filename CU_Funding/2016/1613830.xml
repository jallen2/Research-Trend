    <AbstractNarration>Reliable backup power is critical in our society to dealing with both minor and major power interruptions. For example, when a storm results in a power outage hospitals need to be confident backup systems will operate such that patients do not have to be evacuated. Backup power is also needed to continue to provide uninterrupted cell phone service and data center operations. Due to the number of applications and businesses that require backup power, there is a substantial commercial market for this service. This project will assess the commercial feasibility of a new battery technology to replace diesel generators as the market leader in backup power services. This new battery has advantages relative to similar battery systems with regards to energy density and the flexibility of extended operating times. An advantage relative to diesel generators is the lack of a need for oxygen which provides inherent flooding protection and the lack of undesirable emissions associated with diesel engines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will assess the commercial feasibility of a new battery technology developed by this I-Corps team, primarily in relation to backup power applications. Substantial effort will be taken in customer discovery and customer validation in the battery and stationary power industries with an emphasis on backup power applications. The team will also devote some effort to creation of a transportable prototype. The goal is to understand the market potential, customer requirements, and market need at this time for the technology being developed by the team. Most of this information will be gained through interviews with necessary people and enterprises within the &lt;br/&gt;battery and stationary power industry. Successful implementation of this battery for stationary power could potentially provide a more robust system for emergency backup power systems and reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions from this critical function in our society.</AbstractNarration>
