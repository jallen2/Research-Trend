    <AbstractNarration>Software performance is critical for the success of a software&lt;br/&gt;project. Performance bugs are programming errors that slow down&lt;br/&gt;execution. Many recent techniques have been proposed to detect&lt;br/&gt;various performance bugs. However, there are still many performance&lt;br/&gt;bugs that cannot be detected by existing techniques. Furthermore, a&lt;br/&gt;crucial and practical aspect of performance bugs has not received the&lt;br/&gt;attention it deserves: How likely are developers to fix a detected&lt;br/&gt;performance bug?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To significantly improve software performance, this project will&lt;br/&gt;develop a set of novel techniques that focus on a class of performance&lt;br/&gt;bugs that are very likely to be fixed by developers, specifically on&lt;br/&gt;performance bugs that have non-intrusive fixes. Performance bugs that&lt;br/&gt;have non-intrusive fixes are very likely to be fixed by developers&lt;br/&gt;because the benefits of the fix (i.e., code speedup) clearly outweigh&lt;br/&gt;the drawbacks of the fix (e.g., introducing new correctness bugs,&lt;br/&gt;breaking good software engineering practices, development time and&lt;br/&gt;effort, etc). This project will address three fundamental challenges:&lt;br/&gt;(1) What performance bugs have non-intrusive fixes and what are their&lt;br/&gt;defining characteristics? (2) How to automatically detect performance&lt;br/&gt;bugs and how to establish that their fixes will be non-intrusive? (3)&lt;br/&gt;How to automatically fix some of the detected performance bugs? This&lt;br/&gt;work will broaden our understanding of an understudied yet important&lt;br/&gt;aspect of software performance and will provide automated solutions to&lt;br/&gt;improve software performance.</AbstractNarration>
