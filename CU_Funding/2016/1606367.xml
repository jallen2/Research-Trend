    <AbstractNarration>Invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) in Australia have been expanding their range since they were first introduced in 1935. Their inherent toxicity has resulted in dramatic population crashes of dozens of native species. Based on temperature and water characteristics of their native habitats, it was assumed their invasion would be restricted to tropical areas of Australia. However, their invasion is rapidly expanding beyond the presumed limits, and this may be a result of progressive adaptation to drier conditions. If cane toads can rapidly evolve to new climatic conditions, then their range expansion might exceed well beyond previously thought limitations and thus threaten a greater portion of the continent. Through a combination of field and laboratory studies, this project will focus on the immune system to evaluate the adaptability of cane toads by testing the hypothesis that cane toads at the dry invasion front are adapting a tolerance to water limitations in order to maintain effective immune function. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Rick Shine, a noted expert on the ecology of reptiles and amphibians, at the University of Sydney, Australia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will take an ecoimmunological approach to assess the distribution potential of cane toads in Australia. This study will compare naturally occurring hydration states and immune performances of toads from the arid invasion front with those from the mesic range core. These results will be complemented by a laboratory study that will experimentally manipulate the hydration state of animals from both sites to determine whether toads from semi-arid portions of Australia will have less suppressed or even enhanced immune function when dehydrated compared to toads found in more mesic areas of Australia where they were first introduced. The results of these experiments would transform the way distributions are predicted for this, and likely other, invasive species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>
