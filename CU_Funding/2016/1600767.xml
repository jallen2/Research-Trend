    <AbstractNarration>The 2016 Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference will be held April 1-3, 2016 at Clemson University, Clemson, SC. The main purpose of this conference is to bring together graduate students in combinatorics in order to educate participants about the many areas of combinatorics, provide a venue for sharing current research topics and open questions, have participants meet fellow graduate students from across the country, and provide an opportunity for students to collaborate on current research problems. The conference will feature two plenary one-hour speakers and a number of twenty-minutes contributed talks by graduate students. This will be the 12th annual conference in this series which was started in 2005 at the University of Minnesota. The conference will be publicized via email and information will be posted on a conference website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference provides an opportunity for graduate students to learn about the current research in all areas of combinatorics, including algebraic and enumerative combinatorics, graph theory, design theory, and coding theory. The conference is designed specifically for graduate students and it is organized essentially by the graduate students themselves. Combinatorics faculty from Clemson and the invited speakers will act as mentors for the graduate students throughout the process. The conference promotes recent advances in research and exposition of students' research in a supportive environment.</AbstractNarration>
