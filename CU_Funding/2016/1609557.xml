    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding a collaborative local team at Montana State University comprised of Dr. Eric Shepard (PI), Dr. Joan Broderick, Dr. Valérie Copié, and Dr. Robert Szilagyi to investigate the minimal protein structural requirements for generating and controlling organic radical chemistry in biology. The largest known superfamily of enzymes in Nature is the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily. These metalloenzymes contain an iron-sulfur cluster that is responsible for the coordination and cleavage of the essential cofactor SAM. The cleavage of SAM generates a radical intermediate species, known as the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is responsible for propagating a diverse array of chemical transformations essential to life. Examples of such transformations include DNA repair, RNA modification, protein activation, vitamin biosynthesis, and cofactor formation. This project employs parallel synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational investigations to develop and characterize iron-sulfur cluster complexes that are functional in SAM chemistry. These synthetic compounds are used to understand the specific SAM-based carbon-sulfur bond activation event that leads to 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical formation. Students are being trained in interdisciplinary research that encompasses biochemical, spectroscopic, kinetic, computational and synthetic methodologies. Outreach and educational activities are within the Native American and home-schooling communities from rural Montana. As part of these activities young scientists are being exposed to basic chemistry/biochemistry laboratory exercises, as well as advanced scientific problem solving techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enzymes in the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily catalyze an incredible array of chemical transformations essential for life's processes. This diversity is propagated through a stoichiometrically simple Hydrogen-atom abstraction event. At the core of radical SAM catalytic processes is a redox active [4Fe-4S] cluster that harbors a site-differentiated iron site that promotes the bidentate coordination of SAM. Using a retrosynthetic approach, minimalist protein maquettes that coordinate site-differentiated [4Fe-4S] clusters are prepared to probe the importance of protein environment in fine-tuning the stability, reactivity, and selectivity of SAM based radical reactions. Complementary NMR, EPR, CD, UV-vis, HPLC, SAXS, XAS, and Mössbauer techniques, along with multi-layered DFT/MO/MM computational models are techniques that interrogate the structure, stability, and reactivity of the maquette complexes. Chemical, structural, and mechanistic characteristics of the maquette complexes are investigated through structure-function relationships. The insights gained from [4Fe-4S] maquette studies may contribute to understanding how and why Nature uses this platform as its preferred method for generating and propagating radical reactions.</AbstractNarration>
