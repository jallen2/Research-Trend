    <AbstractNarration>Access to life?s fundamental building blocks is an increasing challenge due to variability in substitution and limits in methodology. Molecules of biological interest often exist with specific special orientation, chirality. Methods of synthesis to access innumerable molecules needs to be selective and variable in order to access the plethora of desired molecules. Chemical methodology continues to improve however chemical waste and lack of scope and breadth continue to be an issue. This project will focus on synthesis of amino acid analogues utilizing light. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Yasuharu Yoshimi of Fukui University. Prof. Yoshimi has developed a methodology wherein light is used as a reagent to synthesize amino acid derivatives. However, loss of chirality in the product was noticed. Combining the methodology developed in the Sivagroup viz., atropselective photoreactions, we aim to control chirality of the amino acid analogs and obtain the desired product with high selectivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to life?s fundamental building blocks is an increasing challenge due to variability in substitution and limits in methodology.

The field of asymmetric synthesis continues to improve. However, chemical waste and lack of overall generality continue to be an issue.
