    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will address an important public health problem - restoring mobility in individuals with disability. The proposed technology offers a new assistive device for wheelchair users to improve their upper-body strength and wheelchair mobility. Adequate strength and mobility are critical for overcoming obstacles, functioning independently, and maintaining quality of life. Nearly every healthcare facility provides some form of treatment to the 3 million U.S. adults who rely on wheelchairs for assistance. The clinical significance of establishing this technology as a robust and usable assistive device is that it could be used in facilities where a large number of wheelchair users are treated. Using this technology to improve strength and mobility could help to reduce the enormous healthcare costs associated with caring for individuals that have disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will obtain feedback from wheelchair users, clinicians, and assistive device manufactures to better understand mobility challenges that wheelchair users face. Engaging in physical activity is a top priority for wheelchair users and effective interventions that improve strength and wheelchair mobility deserve widespread implementation. However, there are major barriers that negatively impact wheelchair user's ability to engage in physical activity. This technology circumvents several of these limitations. Research indicates that compared to traditional devices, this technology is wheelchair accessible and highly adjustable, elicit greater strength gains, and serves as a safe movement for wheelchair users. Exploring customer needs and motivations will provide a better understanding of the market opportunity of the technology to further address mobility related challenges.</AbstractNarration>
