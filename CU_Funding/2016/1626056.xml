    <AbstractNarration>SES-1626023&lt;br/&gt;David Melamed&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1626056&lt;br/&gt;Brent Simpson&lt;br/&gt;University of South Carolina Columbia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generalized exchange systems are those where material, social, or other forms of support flow unilaterally between three or more actors (individuals, organizations, and nations). Researchers have noted that generalized exchange systems are the basis for the evolution of human morality and widespread social solidarity. This is because, unlike direct exchange relationships, which tend to set those involved apart from a broader group or network, generalized exchange embeds actors in a much larger structure of relations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior research has identified two primary bases for generalized exchange systems: Generalized reciprocity occurs when an actor who receives benefits or help "pays it forward" by helping a third party (you help her because I helped you) while indirect reciprocity occurs when an actor who provides benefits to another is subsequently helped by a third party (he helps me because I helped you). Either type could form the basis of generalized exchange systems but they are based on very different mechanisms, with generalized reciprocity stemming from the gratitude that one experiences as a consequence of receiving help and indirect reciprocity based on the prospect of maintaining a good, or "prosocial" reputation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Importantly, almost all prior work has addressed these two processes independently. As a consequence, there is a lack answers to a range of fundamental questions: Which, if either process, is a stronger basis of cooperation in generalized exchange systems? How does each type of structure promote (or undermine) prosocial motivations of actors embedded within them? How does each type of structure impact trust towards - and cooperation with - those within the generalized exchange system versus those outside the system, i.e., strangers? And how do the processes combine to impact prosociality and solidarity in the real world? These questions are of great societal importance (as they focus on prosociality both with "neighbors" and strangers) and of broad relevance (with potential applications from the smallest groups to global communities). Insights from the research could therefore yield actionable prescriptions for increasing prosociality as well as facilitating integration, cohesion, and solidarity among members of an increasingly differentiated population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research seeks to accomplish five broad research objectives: i) Outline arguments and two controlled experiments designed to test the relative and interactive power of generalized and indirect reciprocity for supporting cooperation in generalized exchange systems, ii) Outline arguments and an experimental test of the relative power of generalized versus indirect reciprocity systems in promoting prosocial motivations and behaviors towards strangers, i.e., towards those outside of the generalized exchange system, iii) Use controlled laboratory experiments and agent-based models to establish that, in contrast to prior work that has viewed generalized and indirect reciprocity as separate systems, the two processes are more accurately (and fruitfully) viewed as parts of an integrated system, iv) Examine how different social network structures affect prosocial behaviors in generalized exchange systems, and v) Test predictions from our arguments with a large dataset on the flow of aid between nation-states. Thus, the overarching goal of this research is to tackle a fundamental research problem, of broad interdisciplinary importance, using multiple methods, including laboratory experiments, agent-based models, and macro-level data on international aid.</AbstractNarration>
