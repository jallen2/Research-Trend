    <AbstractNarration>The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program is a cooperative international science program that engages students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning, with a focus on environmental processes and student research. Now in its 20th year, GLOBE continues to engage a vibrant community of scientists, educators, and students through operations in more than 115 countries worldwide. GLOBE's fundamental approach of providing students with inquiry-based, authentic scientific research experiences that are often locally-relevant builds on an extensive STEM education research base regarding effective approaches for engaging students in learning STEM concepts and pursuing careers in STEM. The cultural diversity of the global community engaged in GLOBE, and the ability to interact with that diverse community, positions GLOBE as a compelling platform for demonstrating that ALL students have the potential for participating in and succeeding in STEM activities. Building capacity to leverage GLOBE resources, with the goal of increasing student engagement and diversity in STEM, is a major focus of this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support to the GLOBE Implementation Office at UCAR to conduct two comprehensive training workshops for ~40 existing and new GLOBE Partners. Training of local educators on GLOBE protocols has traditionally been undertaken by the GLOBE Partners, but the resources have not been available to bring on many new Partners - especially in areas that are underserved in STEM education - or enhance the abilities of existing Partners in the use of new tools that have become available to the program. In the five years since the last large-scale, comprehensive U.S. Partner workshop was offered, 40 new partners have joined the program and they have only received abbreviated one-on-one training. To address new priorities within the GLOBE program related to broadening participation of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM, these training workshops are being designed to model and disseminate best practices for implementing GLOBE within especially high minority population communities. The SCALE Immersion Model for Professional Learning (SIMPL) professional development strategy is being used during the workshops to both deliver content regarding GLOBE program resources and provide an example of how Partners might improve the pedagogical training of GLOBE educators in their local communities. The workshops are being held in April and May 2016, with one workshop being held in New Mexico for Partners from the 3 western GLOBE regions and the other being held in North Carolina for Partners from the 3 eastern GLOBE regions. Within 12-16 months following the training workshops, the participants are expected to convene local workshops on broadening participation through GLOBE in their communities, thereby amplifying the impact of the workshops.</AbstractNarration>
