    <AbstractNarration>Specialized pores (called stomata) in the leaves of plants open and close to regulate the uptake into plants of carbon dioxide from the air, and the loss of water (as vapor) from plant tissues out into the air. The opening and closing of stomata is regulated by signals that include the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air, but knowledge of how this is achieved is incomplete. This project will define the genes, proteins and networks of control involved in the regulation of stomata by carbon dioxide, and develop the knowledge necessary for the breeding of plants with improved growth properties and water use efficiency. The ability to manipulate these properties of plants is important for unfavorable weather conditions, climate changes, droughts becoming more frequent in some locations, and as carbon dioxide levels in the air increase. The investigators will pursue an outreach program involving research internships, professional preparation and mentoring with the public Preuss School for disadvantaged high school students in San Diego County as well as engaging with summer research interns from Howard University. Project personnel will be active within the San Diego Science Festival, a large annual event that brings science and innovation close to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some components (including carbonic anhydrase, anion channels and protein kinases) of the carbon dioxide signaling network that regulates stomatal aperture are known. However, the manner in which diverse signals, genes and proteins (a number of which are still to be uncovered) are integrated by guard cells into the network that controls stomatal aperture is not known. This project will use a combination of systems biology, biochemical, genetic and mathematical modeling approaches to identify additional critical molecular components of the signaling network and gain insight into the manner in which this network operates in guard cells to regulate stomatal aperture and how plants can improve their water use efficiency and drought resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics.</AbstractNarration>
