    <AbstractNarration>This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement &amp; Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation. Professor Susan Olesik of the Ohio State University is developing analysis methods with the ability to detect compounds at low concentration levels with improved analysis time compared to current capabilities. Increasing challenges in this country such as the need to monitor low levels of pollutants in natural waters and the need for fast clinical and forensic analyses may be impacted by this work. The broader impacts of this work include the potential societal benefits from the discoveries of the carbon based stationary phases as well as, middle school student and teacher engagement in active science projects developed from this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric methods with increased kinetic performance, improved sensitivity, and unique selectivity. There are four project goals. First, a carbon based open tubular liquid chromatographic methods is being developed. Second, a carbon based packed liquid chromatographic column is being studied and developed. Third, the mechanism of nanofiber-based surface assisted laser desorption ionization are studied. Fourth, nanofiber based planar chromatography that is compatible with middle school studies are developed and added to a new active-learning, science outreach program for local middle schools.</AbstractNarration>
