    <AbstractNarration>The Gemini Observatory is an international partnership that operates two large 8 meter diameter telescopes designed for observing at visible and infrared wavelengths. Situated on the summits of Maunakea, Hawai'i and Cerro Pachon, Chile, the Gemini telescopes occupy the darkest, driest, and best-developed sites for astronomy in both hemispheres. The telescopes combine a large light-collecting area with exquisite image quality to maintain best-in-class capability that is particularly suited for rapid response to astronomical transients and high-resolution imaging. With the mission "to advance our knowledge of the Universe by providing the international Gemini Community with forefront access to the entire sky", Gemini provides the largest-aperture optical/infrared (OIR) telescopes in the world for general U.S. community access. This award supports the ongoing operations of Gemini for the international partnership. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international Gemini partnership includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and the United States as full participants; Australia and Korea are currently limited-term collaborators. To enable the international Gemini user community to conduct the highest priority science prescribed in the strategic plans of all the Gemini partner countries, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) proposes to position the Gemini Observatory as the world's most versatile optical-infrared 8-meter telescopes. In AURA's vision, research at Gemini will complement the scientific discoveries of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and large surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). AURA's proposal emphasizes the core values of (1) users' science driving Gemini operations and instrumentation and (2) understanding the needs of Gemini's diverse user communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gemini is well-equipped to study diverse topics, including the solar system, planetary nebulae, star formation, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, the formation and evolution of galaxies, quasars and supermassive black holes, and the structure of the universe on the largest scales. Recent developments in instrumentation have brought Gemini to the forefront of research on extrasolar planets. AURA will continue to develop instrumentation that achieves excellent spatial and spectral resolving power and world-leading capabilities for adaptive optics on uniquely large scales, opening new scientific vistas in concert with the next-generation telescopes mentioned above. A vigorous visitor instrument program will complement the facility-class instruments, allowing community members to conduct their own experiments while at the same time opening new opportunities for all users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AURA proposes a flexible operations model to attract and efficiently execute the best ideas in research. Gemini offers observational programs targeted towards a wide range of science needs, including an innovative Fast Turnaround program that enables researchers to turn a new idea into an executed program within weeks, and a Large and Long program designed for comprehensive studies requiring large amounts of observing time. AURA also maintains a range of observing modes to make the most efficient use of the Observatory. In addition to queue observations carried out by Observatory staff and classical observations carried out by scientists who travel to the telescope on their allotted nights, AURA has implemented a Poor Weather program that keeps track of observations that can be made in overcast conditions and a Priority Visitor mode that allows observers to come to the telescope for longer than their formal allocation and choose when to observe their targets. To further increase efficiency, AURA will develop the capability for staff to perform nighttime observations from remote base stations; indeed, remote operations from Hilo have already been commissioned at Gemini-North. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AURA strongly supports professional development for Gemini staff, particularly in the areas of project management and systems engineering, and includes tailored retention plans and succession planning to avoid disruptive changes in key personnel. AURA actively seeks to increase participation of groups that are traditionally under-represented in the workforce. Gemini's Diversity Advocates implement workforce development programs tailored to site-specific diversity issues in Chile and Hawai'i. AURA will continue refining and enhancing its successful workforce diversity practices for the term of this award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AURA supports education and promotes to society the broader benefits that accrue from accomplishing Gemini's mission, proposing a series of activities that are designed to develop local STEM talent as well as to communicate Gemini's discoveries. AURA will continue its Journey through the Universe/Viaje al Universo, Live from Gemini, and AstroDay programs that reach over 8,000 K-12 students annually in Hawai'i and Chile, its internship program that places undergraduate and graduate students at the Observatory each year, and dissemination of information about the Observatory and its scientific output through press releases and social media. An assessment of Gemini's outreach programs will identify best practices and establish a process for ongoing evaluation throughout the term of the award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stakeholder communication is crucial to the success of Gemini. AURA's staffing model includes a core group of active scientists who conduct a portion of their own research at Gemini, keeping the managing organization tightly connected to the needs and perspectives of external users. AURA's interaction with the research community includes the organization of triennial Gemini science meetings and participation in the annual meetings of the astronomical societies in all the partner countries. The Observatory has regular contact with the National Gemini Offices in each partner country through its operations working group, and representatives of the international partners participate in the AURA and Gemini governing and operational management structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of AURA's management and oversight of Gemini, AURA will regularly review the technical, financial, and administrative functioning of Gemini as well as AURA's own governance and business practices. Key Performance Indicators and both qualitative and quantitative assessments will inform Gemini activities and AURA policies to achieve optimal management and operation of Gemini.</AbstractNarration>
