    <AbstractNarration>It is widely accepted that geographic characteristics, such as mountain ranges, have influenced the modern distribution of species. The Sichuan Basin in southern China is recognized globally as housing a diverse array of species. Often referred to as a continental island, the Sichuan Basin is nearly completely encircled by mountain ranges. Such characteristics are likely responsible, in part, for present patterns of biodiversity in and around the Sichuan Basin. While the landscape characteristics of neighboring regions have been recognized and studied as factors shaping biodiversity, the Sichuan Basin has received little attention regarding its role in influencing the distribution of species in this region. The White-browed Laughingthrush (Garrulax sannio) is both abundant and widely distributed throughout much of southern Asia, making this species an appropriate model organism with which to conduct this project. This research, which will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Longyin Wen and LeShan Normal University, will use the analysis of DNA samples from various populations throughout the range of G. sannio to assess the relatedness among populations. In addition, environmental niche models will be generated to show both the modern day distribution, as well as historic distribution of this species. This research is important because, in a world facing challenges related to climate change, it is necessary to understand how landscape features may influence species? response. The results of this project will allow researchers to anticipate species? response to future climate fluctuations and guide researchers and managers through more efficient and influential management practices and ultimately help conserve species diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geographic complexities have influenced the evolution of distinct lineages by periodically isolating populations during historical climatic fluctuations. The Sichuan Basin is a globally recognized biodiverse eco-region characterized as a continental island isolated by mountainous topography. Such geo-physical complexity creates a unique landscape feature that has likely facilitated the present patterns of biodiversity in and around the Sichuan Basin. While the topography of neighboring regions has been recognized as factors shaping biodiversity, the Sichuan Basin has received little attention regarding its role in influencing local biogeographic patterns. The White-browed Laughingthrush (Garrulax sannio) is both abundant and widely distributed throughout much of southern Asia, making this species an appropriate model organism to demonstrate the role of the Sichuan Basin in influencing biogeographic patterns in this region. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA will be used investigate the genetic structure and estimate periods of historical isolation among populations of G. sannio in and around the Sichuan Basin. Contemporary and paleo-distribution models will be generated to estimate periods of range expansion and contraction and demonstrate periods of historical isolation among populations. This research is in collaboration with Dr. Longyin Wen and LeShan Normal University, and will provide the scientific community with a better understanding of the factors shaping contemporary biogeographic patterns while allowing for predictions toward species? response to future climate fluctuations providing us with the tools to maintain biodiversity in one of the world?s most biologically rich regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China.</AbstractNarration>
