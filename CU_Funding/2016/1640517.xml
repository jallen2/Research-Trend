    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the science of bio-modified recycled asphalt to fill the need for substitute and supplementary supply for shrinking petroleum-based adhesives. The Bio-modified Recycled Asphalt Shingle (BRAS) is important because it enables the use of scrap shingles, which are otherwise being disposed of in landfills, to be upgraded for use as a supplementary product to asphalt binder. This technology is significant because asphalt supplies are diminishing rapidly since the advent and adaptation of coking technologies by refineries. Accordingly, this PFI project will result in a proof-of-concept for BRAS for use in pavement construction. The newly developed product, BRAS, is low-cost, durable and environmentally friendly, features that improve pavement service life while reducing pavement construction cost and carbon footprint. In addition, the production of BRAS uses products from two waste streams (scrap shingles and animal waste), which also provides a cost-effective waste management solution. Thus, BRAS is superior in terms of cost savings, extended durability, environmental impact and energy savings when compared to the existing products in the construction industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The supply of asphalt binder found in scrap shingles are highly oxidized from years of prior service. Oxidation typically disturbs colloidal stability of asphalt structure by converting maltene portions and increasing asphaltene aggregation. Accordingly, this PFI project is using specific molecular species extracted from animal waste to restore asphalt stability and enhance its properties. A multi-scale modeling and characterization followed by experiments and prototyping will be used to develop BRAS with properties similar to that of virgin asphalt binder. The project will involve research scholars and students with mechanical, chemical and material science expertise to undertake this research. Students and scholars involved in the project will receive entrepreneurship training while conducting customer interviews and meetings with potential industry partners to facilitate technology scale-up.</AbstractNarration>
