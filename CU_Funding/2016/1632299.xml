    <AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for a two-day international workshop; specifically, it provides travel support for workshop participants. The workshop will be jointly hosted by Arizona State University, the European Commission, the Institute of Medicine, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Its focus is open and responsible innovation at the interface between neuroscience, brain research and technological convergence. It will draw together researchers working on national brain initiatives with social scientists working on bioethics, law, public policy and science and technology studies. Its goal is to increase clarity and better mutual understanding amongst all stakeholders about the implications of ethical, legal, and social values in brain science and the development and use of emerging and converging technologies within the field of brain research. Outputs and recommendations stemming from the workshop shall be used to inform policy makers and other groups to strengthen values of responsible innovation in public sector research funding, development and implementation of regulatory frameworks, public and private sector research activities and commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide an opportunity to stimulate interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration around responsible brain research and related technology development. It will offer a platform for members of the scientific community, policy makers, funders, regulatory agencies and civil society to address a number of issues. They will consider options to increase the creativity and social responsibility of brain science and neuro-technological innovation through more open and collaborative approaches. They will analyze mechanisms to integrate values of open and responsible innovation into major brain research initiatives and funding programs, and consider the role of standards for the development of industrialized process and products. In addition, they will work to identify opportunities for brain science and neuro-technology innovation to inform the broader set of stakeholders in biomedical research, engineering, policy, regulation, funding and commercialization about the societal needs and desires in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
