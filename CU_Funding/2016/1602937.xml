    <AbstractNarration>#1602937&lt;br/&gt;Butler, Jason E.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable U.S. scientists and engineers representing diverse disciplines to participate in a workshop titled "Multiphase Continuum Modeling of Particulate Flows," which will be held December 9 - 11, 2015 in Gainesville, FL. The workshop will explore the development of improved continuum models to accurately predict the dynamics of particulate flows. Although the equations of motion that govern flows of simple fluids are well established, the corresponding equations for particulate flows pose special challenges. Flow-induced rearrangements of the suspension microstructure must be modeled properly in order to calculate accurately the flow of the suspension. The workshop will explore experimental results and simulation outcomes to try to reconcile data and information regarding flows describe by continuum models. Participants will be asked to identify key outstanding challenges that are common to a wide range of particulate flow regimes. The identification of common issues will help reduce duplication of efforts across disciplines and focus the community on concentrated steps toward solving particulate flow problems in a unified way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate flows are ubiquitous in natural and industrial processes. The motion of river and ocean sediment, the flow of fibers in the manufacturing of composite materials, the flow of blood through arteries and veins, the motion of bubbles in biological reactors, the flow of colloidal particles in directed-assembly of novel materials are just a few examples. Despite their commonplace appearance, these flows pose unique challenges for modeling and computation. Solving these challenges could help scientists and engineers better predict the behavior of these materials in flow, design improved equipment for advanced manufacturing, and reduce costs and environmental impacts. This award will help support scientists and engineers, especially young researchers, to attend this workshop.</AbstractNarration>
