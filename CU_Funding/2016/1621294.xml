    <AbstractNarration>Given the adoption of more rigorous mathematics standards, U.S. school districts face a pressing need to improve instruction for struggling learners who are not reaching proficiency on standardized assessments. In response to low performance, a common district solution is to add mathematics intervention classes which aim to provide struggling students with time for more intensive and targeted instruction. Researchers have begun to identify effective mathematics intervention practices, but few studies have examined if intervention teachers are actually implementing these approaches with students. Very little is known about how intervention class time is spent, what mathematics content is emphasized, which evidence-based instructional practices are used, and what challenges are faced by teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to improve mathematics instruction for struggling learners by focusing on the quality of instruction occurring in mathematics intervention classrooms. The investigators will conduct observations and interviews with teachers and district leaders to understand current practices and challenges. This will be followed by a national survey of 300 teachers to document challenges across the country in terms of providing mathematics intervention. The final aspect of the project involves the design of professional development for mathematics intervention teachers based on the needs identified in the earlier phases of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.</AbstractNarration>
