    <AbstractNarration>This project will analyze spatial patterns of genetic diversity in a novel mimicry system from South America to investigate whether the processes driving resemblance in mimicry systems can also promote diversity within species. Mimicry systems, where multiple species evolve mutual resemblance to reduce predation, are excellent natural laboratories to study the processes generating biodiversity. Species in mimetic systems often exhibit diverse geographic morphologies, which raises questions about how this diversity originated and is maintained. Addressing this question will quantify the role of natural selection in promoting and maintaining genetic differentiation among populations. Additionally, this research will provide a basis for using morphological traits to predict levels of genetic structure. The later will be especially useful for conservation purposes, particularly in groups or systems in which genetic data might not be available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These goals will be addressed by conducting a fine scale landscape genetic study on mimetic beetles from the genus Ceroglossus using next generation sequencing data. Samples will be collected across areas with different geographic morphs and levels of phenotypic matching, and from two or three different species. Correlation tests between color differences and genetic differentiation will inform whether selection for mimicry can impact levels of genetic structure, whereas model-based demographic inferences will provide statistical rigor to distinguish between specific mechanisms driving such patterns. This project will encourage collaborative work with Chilean researchers and students on the study of a new and fascinating model system.</AbstractNarration>
