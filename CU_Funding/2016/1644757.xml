    <AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed workshop is to develop Community Transparency Statements to articulate the (possibly multiple) understandings of research transparency shared among scholars undertaking specific types of qualitative research. This workshop addresses many concerns raised by the Political Science discipline's Data Access and Research Transparency initiative. The increasing push for greater research transparency raised a number of questions about how best to achieve transparency in qualitative research. The Qualitative Transparency Deliberations will allow qualitative political scientists from a wide range of research traditions to address open questions about qualitative research transparency through a process of consultation, deliberation, and reporting of insights to the profession at large. Participants will be drawn from the Qualitative and Multi-Methods Research section (QMMR) of the American Political Science Association. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed workshop is to develop Community Transparency Statements to articulate the (possibly multiple) understandings of research transparency shared among scholars undertaking specific types of qualitative research. Workshop participants will be drawn from the Qualitative and Multi-Methods Research (QMMR) section of the American Political Science Association. These qualitative scholars have broad knowledge of this research area and provide guidance to the broader political-science community concerning qualitative research and transparency issues. Community transparency statements are the main intended output of the qualitative transparency deliberation (QTD) process. This workshop will benefit both scholars and the public at large in that it contributes to increasing the credibility of scientific research. The workshop provides information and shared standards to inform concerns about ways to balance transparency with the protection of human subjects. The community transparency statement will also help political-science journal editors in making decisions about transparency policies as related to qualitative research.</AbstractNarration>
