    <AbstractNarration>This award will support a conference "Perspectives on integral geometry" which will take place at the University of Georgia in Athens, GA on May 30 - June 3, 2016. Despite its long history, only in the past few decades, and especially since the turn of the century, has integral geometry begun to mature as a coherent mathematical subject, both in its internal development as a part of pure mathematics and externally as a source of powerful tools for scientific applications. This conference will bring together researchers working in all of the major strands of the subject, with the aim of catalyzing further progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alesker's theory of valuations has provided a penetrating new language that has greatly enhanced the depth and effectiveness of the traditional ideas on integral geometry, growing mainly from Blaschke's famous kinematic formulas. At the same time, integral geometry has found new applications in stochastic analysis and data compression. The aim of the conference is to bring all of the major contemporary strands of the subject together in order to promote further internal development, to explore connections with other parts of pure mathematics, and to enhance the effectiveness of applications to science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;conference website: https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/fu/content/perspectives-integral-geometry</AbstractNarration>
