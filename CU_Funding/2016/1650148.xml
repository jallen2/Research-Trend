    <AbstractNarration>Civilization increasingly relies on computer technology and access to large databases of searchable information for all facets of life, with the world's digital data projected to exceed 16 zettabytes in 2017. However, long-term, reliable storage of this vast amount of digital data greatly exceeds the capacity of any computer system even when accounting for expected advances in the storage industry. Extraordinary breakthroughs in storage technology are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DNA offers a potentially transformative solution due to its high raw capacity of 1 zettabyte per cubic centimeter. To put that in perspective, the best technology available today would require 100,000 cubic meters of volume to store the equivalent amount of information. If successful as a storage medium, DNA could hold the world?s entire digital data in a relatively small volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's key objectives are to quantify the limitations imposed by the properties of DNA on extreme storage systems, and to engineer solutions to surpass them. To enable reliable exabyte capacities, this proposal specifically focuses on new and transformative approaches to encode data in DNA that require both developing and harnessing a deeper understanding of the chemo-physical characteristics of DNA. Interestingly, extreme DNA storage systems cannot yet be synthesized using existing technologies, yet their properties must be studied to motivate and inform their development. To achieve this, a computationally and experimentally simulated extreme capacity model system will be developed that can be used to study pertinent properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is lead by an expert in computer systems, and an expert in molecular biology and DNA manipulation and processing. The team will apply a highly coordinated combination of computer systems theory and design, simulation, and molecular biology experiments to address critical barriers to high-capacity DNA storage. This project will support the training of two Ph.D. students in the area of DNA-based Storage Systems.</AbstractNarration>
