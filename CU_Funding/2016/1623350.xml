    <AbstractNarration>Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Lincoln University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines. The project aims at improving retention, persistence and graduation rates of STEM students through an evidence-based set of activities and strategies. Colleges and universities facing similar retention problems as Lincoln University can benefit by adopting best practices from the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific activities and strategies to achieve the goals are: curriculum and pedagogy reform for gate-keeping mathematics and science courses; establishment of an integrated freshman science course; undergraduate research for about half of all STEM majors; increased enrollment of community college students into STEM majors; increased outreach activities to high schools in the Philadelphia; and establishment of a Science Village for STEM freshmen students that will include joint housing, study halls and academic support. The project strategies supporting these objectives are evidence-based and will be monitored and evaluated for effectiveness through formative and summative evaluation as well as a research study.</AbstractNarration>
