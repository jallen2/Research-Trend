    <AbstractNarration>In many industries, such as the electric power and distribution sector, energy losses due to poor heat dissipation are a significant challenge. Heat dissipating coatings can be developed by understanding and engineering the interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter which are the key for such technologies that require targeted optical and infrared characteristics. This project explores the potential of atomically thin multilayered materials towards heat dissipation applications; if engineered to specification, these nanoscale-thin coatings will passively cool an object relative to an uncoated one. This project investigates the requirements and application space for such coatings through scientific insights and application demands. Potential first adopters are expected at power utilities, power distribution, and energy efficient buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to show how nanostructured, multilayered 2-dimensional materials can be designed to exhibit specific light-matter-interaction properties. The scope extends to permittivity-engineering via a metamaterial approach. Specifically the radiation and reflection spectra are of interest towards emissivity control of a coated object, thus reducing its relative temperature. The study of broadband permittivity data of emerging 2-dimensional materials extends the understanding of photon-electron interaction and radiation profiles. The I-Corps process will increase public scientific literacy in the STEM field through the interview method of potential customers. Thus, partnerships between academia, industry, and start-up ventures are therefore expected to emerge and accelerate the time-to-market as aligned with the Materials Genome Initiative. At a larger scheme, an enhanced efficiency along with a reliability-improved power grid supports both national security and economic competitiveness of the United States.</AbstractNarration>
