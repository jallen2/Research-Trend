    <AbstractNarration>This award is a request to fund a set of research training cruises on the University of&lt;br/&gt;Minnesota?s R/V Blue Heron for early career scientists. The work will have two goals:&lt;br/&gt;1) teach early career lacustrine scientists how to acquire, plan for, and manage cruises aboard&lt;br/&gt;UNOLS ships, introducing a new generation of scientists to UNOLS and the academic fleet; and&lt;br/&gt;2) expose members of the Great Lakes scientific community, which has an abysmally low submittal&lt;br/&gt;rate of proposals to NSF requesting UNOLS ships, to UNOLS and the academic fleet. The awardee&lt;br/&gt;undertaken two successful Chief Scientist Training Cruises (in 2014 and 2015) and with this&lt;br/&gt; will expand the number of participants and our area of operations from solely Lake&lt;br/&gt;Superior to both Lakes Superior and Michigan.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The training cruise envisioned herein will allow early career scientists to collect seed data&lt;br/&gt;and test hypotheses for future proposals to NSF.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;This proposal intends to educate the next generation of researchers about the capabilities&lt;br/&gt;of UNOLS. This type of outreach between UNOLS and potential users is not only important for&lt;br/&gt;the broader scientific community, but doubly important for the Great Lakes community which&lt;br/&gt;underutilizes UNOLS assets.</AbstractNarration>
