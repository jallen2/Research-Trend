    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0835558&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Christopher Woodward&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and low-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology have been revolutionized in recent years by the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of holomorphic curve techniques. This workshop, to&lt;br/&gt;be held July 6-10, 2009, at the CIRM (Luminy) conference center,&lt;br/&gt;concerns equivariant generalizations of invariants defined by&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic curves. In Gromov-Witten theory, equivariant&lt;br/&gt;invariants have been extensively studied by Givental and others,&lt;br/&gt;in the sense of integrals of equivariant cohomology classes over&lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces of stable maps. The focus of the workshop will be&lt;br/&gt;on the following more sophisticated version of equivariant&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory: the study of moduli spaces of maps to the&lt;br/&gt;stack-theoretic quotient of, say, a smooth projective variety by&lt;br/&gt;a reductive group. By definition, such a map consists of a&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic principal bundle, together with a section of the&lt;br/&gt;associated bundle. From the symplectic point of view, suitable&lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces of such pairs are known as moduli spaces of {\em&lt;br/&gt;symplectic vortices}. The workshop is organized around this&lt;br/&gt;specific direction, with an aim to bring together researchers in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic and symplectic geometry who have had no previous&lt;br/&gt;interaction. On the other hand, the workshop will promote&lt;br/&gt;discussion of the interaction of holomorphic maps, gauge theory,&lt;br/&gt;and group actions more broadly. Applications of the theory are&lt;br/&gt;expected for instance, to the relation between Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theories of different varieties, and to the relation between the&lt;br/&gt;gauge-theoretic invariants such as Floer-Donaldson invariants and&lt;br/&gt;their symplectic analogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose a workshop which will bring together gauge theory and&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic curves. Gauge theory is the study of local symmetry&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics and physics; the most famous example is&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetism. Holomorphic curve techniques aim, in algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, to understand spaces by understanding the certain&lt;br/&gt;classes of curves in them, or in symplectic geometry, to&lt;br/&gt;understand the periodic orbits of dynamical systems. Symmetry of&lt;br/&gt;the target varieties may be used as a computational tool, and&lt;br/&gt;also combined with holomorphic curves to define new invariants.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on recent developments and emerging&lt;br/&gt;applications to algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional topology. The workshop will benefit a number of&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and postdoctoral fellows working in this area&lt;br/&gt;who have had little interaction with other groups working on&lt;br/&gt;related problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference web-page controlled by the organizers is&lt;br/&gt;www.math.rutgers.edu/~ctw/Luminy, while that controlled by the&lt;br/&gt;conference center CIRM is&lt;br/&gt;www.cirm.univ-mrs.fr/web.ang/liste_rencontre/Rencontres2009/Renc346/Renc346.html.</AbstractNarration>
