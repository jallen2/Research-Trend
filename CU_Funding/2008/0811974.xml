    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research to to develop a new generation of robust, highly&lt;br/&gt;effective unsupervised and semi-supervised models of meaning&lt;br/&gt;extraction. Our key methological insights include the use of&lt;br/&gt;global methods of inference to simultaneously consider many linguistic&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the task, the use of rich typed lexical dependencies,&lt;br/&gt;and the semi-supervised use of structured data from the web, such&lt;br/&gt;as dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias, and so on. We are&lt;br/&gt;extracting meaning at three levels: word meaning, propositional&lt;br/&gt;meaning, and conceptual meaning. At the word level, we are learning&lt;br/&gt;lexical relations like hyponymy (leptin is-a hormone), synonymy,&lt;br/&gt;and others both from raw text and from structured sources like on-line&lt;br/&gt;dictionaries. At the propositional level, we are learning&lt;br/&gt;predicate-argument structure using a global unsupervised clustering&lt;br/&gt;model as well as developing semi-supervised methods of learning semantic frame&lt;br/&gt;extractors. At a larger structural level we are inducing scripts&lt;br/&gt;and structured narrative relations between verbs. These rich models&lt;br/&gt;of meaning will have a broader impact by providing a critical step&lt;br/&gt;towards the creation of systems with true language understanding&lt;br/&gt;capabilities. The results could thus impact the creation of&lt;br/&gt;natural-language applications in every field, from educational or&lt;br/&gt;tutorial applications, to information extraction tasks like legal&lt;br/&gt;discovery, to conversational agents. All deliverables of this&lt;br/&gt;project will be available on the web: WordNet expansions, induced&lt;br/&gt;frames and scripts, our temporal event classifier, and semantic&lt;br/&gt;role, frame, and script inducers.</AbstractNarration>
