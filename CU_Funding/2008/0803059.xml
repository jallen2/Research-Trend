    <AbstractNarration>Shah&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0803059&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleagues at the Department of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics of the University of Central Florida introduce a&lt;br/&gt;year-long computational mathematics research and training&lt;br/&gt;program. Using exciting applications of mathematics in images&lt;br/&gt;and videos as motivating examples, this CSUMS program provides&lt;br/&gt;participants with a solid background in both mathematical theory&lt;br/&gt;and problem-solving techniques to pursue careers and graduate&lt;br/&gt;study in fields that require integrated strengths in computation&lt;br/&gt;and the mathematical sciences. The program starts in the spring&lt;br/&gt;semester with classes that prepare students in numerical methods,&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling, and computer vision and imaging science. &lt;br/&gt;Then, in an intensive summer component, the students immerse&lt;br/&gt;themselves in a research project. In the fall semester they&lt;br/&gt;continue to conduct research and take additional classes in&lt;br/&gt;advanced computer vision and imaging science, and advanced&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling. In the follow-up spring semester, the&lt;br/&gt;students submit their research for publication, finish an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate honors thesis, and get training in graduate career&lt;br/&gt;advancement issues. In addition, participants attend&lt;br/&gt;professional conferences, which give them a chance to present&lt;br/&gt;their research and to meet known researchers in the field, who&lt;br/&gt;may serve as their role models. To broaden the students'&lt;br/&gt;perspective, there are field trips to technology companies in&lt;br/&gt;central Florida area such as Lockheed-Martin, Harris, and Boeing. &lt;br/&gt;Finally in order to promote interaction amongst the students, a&lt;br/&gt;seminar course is installed throughout the program and several&lt;br/&gt;social events are included such as dinners with distinguished&lt;br/&gt;speakers visiting the campus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A cohort of 10 participants is selected each year among math&lt;br/&gt;majors and minors at UCF. The key elements of the program&lt;br/&gt;include: to have a full year training in carefully designed&lt;br/&gt;course work so that the participants can master the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;and computational fundamentals, to engage each participant in a&lt;br/&gt;meaningful research project integrated into the year-long&lt;br/&gt;program, and to develop the participants' skills in communicating&lt;br/&gt;scientific ideas in writing and oral presentations through&lt;br/&gt;writing journal papers for publication, giving routine seminar&lt;br/&gt;presentations, and presenting at the professional meetings. The&lt;br/&gt;program represents a team effort of faculty members from&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, computer science, education and industry. It leads&lt;br/&gt;to the development of a year-long research-oriented curriculum&lt;br/&gt;for computational mathematics. In particular, the participants&lt;br/&gt;are trained in and exposed to the latest techniques and critical&lt;br/&gt;issues in computational mathematics through both upgraded and&lt;br/&gt;newly designed courses and real-life research projects in&lt;br/&gt;computer vision and imaging science, which involve video&lt;br/&gt;compression, image denoising, object detection, tracking,&lt;br/&gt;activity and event recognition. This project contributes to&lt;br/&gt;preparing a work force of diverse scientists in order to maintain&lt;br/&gt;America's strategic position of command in science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. Participants are trained in computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics with an emphasis on computer vision and imaging&lt;br/&gt;science, in particular they learn fundamentals of computation&lt;br/&gt;with applications of consequence in areas such as national&lt;br/&gt;defense and intelligence, homeland security, and biomedical and&lt;br/&gt;life sciences. The outcome of this CSUMS model, its evaluation,&lt;br/&gt;related research, articles, and curriculum materials, is&lt;br/&gt;disseminated to other colleges and universities via a dedicated&lt;br/&gt;web site.</AbstractNarration>
