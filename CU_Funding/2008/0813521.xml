    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0813521&lt;br/&gt;Ward&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International travel support is requested for U.S. academic participants to attend the Tenth International Conference on Inorganic Membranes (ICIM 10), which will be held in Tokyo, Japan, August 18-22, 2008. The Conference brings together inorganic membrane researchers from around the world to present and discuss their results on the science and technology of inorganic membranes. The conference includes an extensive program of platform presentations, as well as poster sessions and plenary speakers. Papers address the synthesis, characterization, theory and application of a wide range of inorganic membranes, including zeolite, metallic, carbon-based, proton and ion-conducting ceramic, and inorganic-organic hybrids. This conference is a worldwide gathering focused on inorganic membranes, and is held every two years, normally alternating between the U.S., Europe and Asia. For this meeting, papers will be published via a CD-ROM. Although the research activity in the U.S. in inorganic membranes has been growing steadily for more than a decade, there is also impressive growth in inorganic membrane research and development in Europe and Asia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strong representation of U.S. researchers at the Conference is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in the many important areas of inorganic membrane technology. Some the key technology areas addressed by inorganic membrane technology include oxygen and hydrogen separations, both of which are critical to new energy technologies, solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte membranes, and novel membrane reactor concepts. It is expected that there will be approximately 15 U.S. academic participants, with a similar number coming from industry and national labs. The total number of participants is expected to be around 300, with probably 30-40 from the U.S., 60-80 from Europe and the remaining 180-210 from Japan, China, Australia and the other Asian countries. This grant will support roughly 30% of anticipated travel costs for the qualified U.S. academic participants and may provide for additional international collaborative opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
