    <AbstractNarration>The Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) is a series of three number theory meetings per year held at colleges and universities in South Carolina, the Palmetto state. The meetings take place on a rotating basis at Clemson University, College of Charleston, Furman University, and University of South Carolina. PANTS successfully completed its first year in 2006 - 2007 and plans for the future are taking shape. The three yearly meetings are to be held in September, December, and February. The September and February meetings will feature two plenary talks, while the December meeting will feature four plenary talks. The hour-long plenary talks will be given by leading number theorists from outside the Southeast. Each meeting will also have 20-30 minute contributed talks from Southeastern participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of these meetings is to provide the number theory community in the Southeast an opportunity to hear about recent research in number theory, pure and applied. PANTS meetings attract prominent number theorists, and they also provide regional mathematicians, particularly graduate students and junior faculty, an opportunity to speak. The frequency and regularity of the meetings promotes collaboration and strengthens working relationships between participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another objective of PANTS meetings is to involve number theorists at all career stages and types of institutions at minimal cost. PANTS speakers include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty.&lt;br/&gt;PANTS participants come not only from South Carolina, but from schools in neighboring states. They come from Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose highest degree awarded is a master's degree, and from institutions granting only baccalaureate degrees. The organizers will also continue to try to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and other underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
