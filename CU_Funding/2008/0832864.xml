    <AbstractNarration>A workshop will be held proposed under the sponsorship of the Chemistry Division (CHE) of the National Science Foundation (NSF). This workshop will (i) explore the research that is presently being carried out to constructively utilize carbon dioxide, (ii) identify the gaps in our present knowledge about the reductive chemistry of CO2, and (iii) indicate new directions in CO2 activation and reactivity that might be most productive for future&lt;br/&gt;Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rise of carbon dioxide levels has contributed to global warming. Can we, instead of collecting and sequestering CO2, effectively chemically recycle it and use it as a renewable carbon source and thereby mitigating its effect on global warming? To address the global warming challenges that greenhouse gases present, chemical scientists must better understand the chemistry of CO2, its reactivity, and its potential uses. Carbon dioxide is a highly stable molecule - it isn't combustible and is nontoxic. The very thermodynamic stability of the CO2 makes its activation energy intensive and challenging. Can we reuse carbon dioxide as a chemical building block and potentially recycle it through synthetic transportation fuels? In the workshop, breakout and discussions sessions are anticipated on the chemical, electrochemical, photochemical and thermochemical conversion of CO2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stronger basis of understanding of the chemical issues related to carbon dioxide activation will enable and facilitate the constructive use of carbon dioxide, and contribute to its conversion to value-added products. Carbon dioxide is a valuable carbon source and nature recycles it through photosynthesis. However, total reliance on nature to produce biofuels is increasingly becoming untenable and not practical. The broader impact of the proposed workshop is to encourage basic research towards a reduction of increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and towards the mitigation of global warming. In particular, the upcoming generation of broad diversity of chemists needs to be sensitized to the important challenges awaiting them in this critical area of CO2 research. These new areas of research will be translated to a new school of students and coworkers. A broad long-lasting stimulation of thought in new basic science thrusts of interest to NSF may be stimulated. Such basic science work incorporated wholly or in part in existing and future sponsored research will lead to the development of a backbone of scientific progress critical to the realization of greenhouse gas control technologies. These new areas of research will be translated to a new school of students and coworkers to carry such research forward in future decades.</AbstractNarration>
