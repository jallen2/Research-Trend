    <AbstractNarration>This proposal contains three projects, in number theory and its&lt;br/&gt;applications to combinatorics. The first project concerns the&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic of modular forms for noncongruence subgroups. For&lt;br/&gt;noncongruence subgroups whose associated modular curves have a model&lt;br/&gt;over the rationals, Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer suggested very&lt;br/&gt;interesting congruence relations on the Fourier coefficients of cusp&lt;br/&gt;forms which are meant to replace the Hecke operators. On the other&lt;br/&gt;hand, Scholl has attached Galois representations to the space of&lt;br/&gt;noncongruence cusp forms. The ASD congruences together with the&lt;br/&gt;modularity of Scholl representations yield extremely interesting&lt;br/&gt;congruence relations between the Fourier coefficients of congruence&lt;br/&gt;and noncongruence forms. Some examples were constructed by the PI&lt;br/&gt;and her coauthors. Continuing her joint work with coauthors, the PI&lt;br/&gt;plans to apply the modularity lifting theorems to investigate when&lt;br/&gt;Scholl representations arise from Hilbert modular forms, and to use&lt;br/&gt;the modularity result and ASD congruence relations to establish the&lt;br/&gt;conjecture which says that the Fourier coefficients of genuinely&lt;br/&gt;algebraic noncongruence forms have unbounded denominators. The&lt;br/&gt;second project is to construct zeta functions of complexes arising&lt;br/&gt;from finite quotients of the Bruhat-Tits buildings. Such zeta&lt;br/&gt;function should be a rational function which encodes topological and&lt;br/&gt;spectral information of the complex, and which satisfies the Riemann&lt;br/&gt;Hypothesis if and only if the complex is Ramanujan. When dimension&lt;br/&gt;is one, this is the Ihara zeta function attached to a graph. In a&lt;br/&gt;very recent work, the PI and a PhD student did the 2-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;case. The PI proposes to explore the general case. The third project&lt;br/&gt;concerns low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The LDPC codes are&lt;br/&gt;equipped with very efficient decoding algorithms, which make them&lt;br/&gt;highly desirable in real world applications. The source of decoding&lt;br/&gt;errors is the pseudo-codewords. One way to understand these&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-codewords is to construct a suitable infinite series, called&lt;br/&gt;a zeta function, with each term corresponding to a pseudo-codeword.&lt;br/&gt;Such zeta function should be a rational function with good&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial property. This was done indirectly in a joint paper of&lt;br/&gt;the PI. The PI proposes to pursue a more direct approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been the PI's long term research goal to do fundamental&lt;br/&gt;research in number theory and to seek applications of number theory&lt;br/&gt;to combinatorics and coding theory, especially to solve real world&lt;br/&gt;problems. The study of interplay between these areas has turned out&lt;br/&gt;to be quite fruitful. This proposal is a continuation of&lt;br/&gt; the PI's effort to pursue the same general theme. Part of the research&lt;br/&gt; will be carried out by the PI's Ph D&lt;br/&gt;students. The results from this proposal will be disseminated&lt;br/&gt;broadly through the talks given by the PI in seminars, colloquia,&lt;br/&gt;conferences, short courses, and workshops. They will also be&lt;br/&gt;incorporated in the graduate courses taught by the PI. Weekly&lt;br/&gt;informal seminars will be conducted to integrate research with&lt;br/&gt;education and teaching. A conference is planned in 2010 to&lt;br/&gt;disseminate results from this project.</AbstractNarration>
