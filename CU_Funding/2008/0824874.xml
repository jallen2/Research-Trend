    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: International Mini-Workshop series on An Assessment of Options for a Post-CMOS Emerging Research devices and Related Materials in Bonn Germany, Tokyo, Japan, San Francisco, CA, and Austin, Texas in 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Context &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This request is for funds to support an International Mini-Workshop series on An Assessment of Options for a Post-CMOS Emerging Research devices and Related Materials. By 2022 or earlier the Semiconductor Industry will approach the end of CMOS scaling. Extension of CMOS beyond this period will require invention of a new technology that, when integrated with CMOS will extend the functionality-cost ratio of CMOS-based information processing substantially and may lead to a technology to eventually replace CMOS. A variety of new concepts for devices, fabrication techniques, and system architectures are emerging today under the general heading of ?nanoelectronics? that may provide the basis for continuing the advances in information technologies that we have experienced for the last three decades. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;A wide range of new ideas have been proposed for post-CMOS technologies, such as molecular electronics, carbon nanotube devices and spintronics etc. In 2007, the Semiconductor Industry, via the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) ERD chapter, continued a process to access the applicability of a wide range of research devices and device concepts to serve as a basis for continuing historical scaling trends via set of workshops held in 2006. Similar to these workshops, held in collaboration with and partially funded by NSF in 2004 and 2006, a new set of workshops are planned for 2008. The ITRS Emerging Research device and Emerging Research materials Working groups will hold four separate mini workshops: Emerging Research Memory Devices in Bonn, Germany, Emerging Research Logic Devices in Tokyo, Japan, Emerging Research Architectures in San Francisco, and Emerging Research Materials in Austin, Texas. These workshops will set the stage for the next ITRS Roadmap. &lt;br/&gt; Broader impact:&lt;br/&gt;These workshops will result in promoting a close interaction between universities and industry and a new ITRS Roadmap for the future. The ITRS Roadmap and the ITRS chapters on Emerging Research devices and Emerging Research materials influence the directions of research in the universities as well as industry. The workshop and it will bring experts from industry and university to discuss new areas of emphasis for the next ITRS Roadmap.</AbstractNarration>
