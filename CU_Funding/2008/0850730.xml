    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past two decades, the fundamental importance of iron and other bioactive trace metals in structuring marine food webs and biogeochemical cycles has been realized. Even more recently, over the past several years, the international ocean science community has begun to mobilize in an urgent effort to understand the ecosystem-level consequences of rising anthropogenic CO2 and acidification of the global ocean. This project examines the intersection of these two major research themes, by asking the question: How will the trace element requirements of marine phytoplankton change in response to future increases in atmospheric pCO2?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary data generated by the investigators suggests that changing pCO2 can indeed profoundly affect the cellular quotas of Fe, Mo, Zn, Cd, Co and Mn in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton. Trace metals play critical roles as enzymatic co-factors for processes that are closely linked to the availability of CO2 such as carbon and nitrogen fixation, photosynthetic electron transport, and nutrient acquisition. Therefore, it is important to develop methods to quantitatively predict how algal metal requirements will change in tomorrow's rapidly changing ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will take a three-pronged approach to addressing this overarching question. Laboratory experiments will measure the trace metal quotas of steady-state cultures of key phytoplankton functional groups like diatoms, coccolithophores, Phaeocystis, and diazotrophic and pico-cyanobacteria while varying pCO2 both alone, and together with other limiting factors such as iron, temperature, and light. Field work in the Southern California bight will provide measurements in trace metal stoichiometry of natural phytoplankton communities over a seasonal cycle in relation to pCO2 and other environmental variables -- this region is already experiencing some of the largest increases in acidic upwelled water along the entire West Coast. This observational and correlative study will be coupled with manipulative experiments at the USC Catalina Island facility in which trace metal quotas of the same natural phytoplankton communities can be measured in relation to pCO2 shifts under controlled incubation conditions. Together, these three complementary approaches will enable the investigators to determine over a variety of temporal and spatial scales how phytoplankton-driven trace element biogeochemistry is likely to change in a future high-CO2 ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include providing an opportunity for a major career milestone for young lead investigator Fu, a female minority investigator at USC, as well as opportunities for under-represented students through the summer NSF-REU programs, senior research thesis programs at USC, and a new initiative for student recruitment with the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science. The societal and scientific impacts of this project include offering a novel perspective on the integrated responses of ocean biology and biogeochemistry to ongoing anthropogenic change, with the ultimate goal of better predicting future shifts in basic ocean resources and potential feedbacks to global climate.</AbstractNarration>
