    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Private and confidential information, e.g., credit card numbers and medical&lt;br/&gt;records, is increasingly being stored online. Also increasingly this information is exposed due to human errors and malicious attacks. The proposed research addresses this problem through the design and implementation of a new system, called Aeolus. Aeolus will enable construction of applications in a way that greatly reduces the danger of unauthorized release of information. Aeolus includes both a new distributed security model and its support via a distributed platform. The model is simple and high level; the goal is to provide a tool that is easy to use and understand, so that it will be used in practice. In addition, Aeolus allows programmers to use programming languages of their choice and also to use components provided by third parties. The security model is based on information flow control, which prevents leaks of confidential information by controlling what can be done with information. The model contains novel ways to provide safe and precise delegation of authority. The proposed research additionally includes a first proof-of-concept implementation to allow evaluation of the model, a second implementation aimed at improving performance and reducing the size of the trusted base, a development of an architecture and replication techniques for storage servers that prevent leaks while not requiring users to encrypt their information. The work addresses a pressing problem with online information since it will greatly reduce this exposure due to errors and malicious attacks. It will additionally impact society through education, both of students on the project and through courseware.</AbstractNarration>
