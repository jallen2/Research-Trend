    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), Jacob W. Petrich from the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University will acquire a cyber-enabled accurate-mass liquid chromatography, quadrupole (LCMS/MS) mass spectrometer for the Department's Mass Spectrometry Laboratory. This spectrometer possesses a solution-based sample introduction, quadrupole/ion trap precursor selection, and a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. This instrument will accommodate several forms of atmospheric pressure ionization (API) and two ionization methods: electrospray (ESI) and chemical ionization (APCI). The spectrometer will support the efforts of a diverse group of faculty and scientists involved in fundamental research to developing solutions to complex chemical problems varying from biological chemistry to catalytic processes to improve processing of soy bean oil to production of new materials to capture the energy of sunlight and light emitting diodes. Students from research groups of professors Larock, Pohl, Kraus, Verkade, Jenks and Jeffries-EL will utilize the instrument as well as other research groups from departments including chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, agronomy, food science, botany, geology and entomology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LCMS/MS-TOF-mass spectrometry is an important technique for obtaining accurate molecular weights on very large molecules, with extremely high sensitivity. Use of a LCMS/MS-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique, especially in studies involving biomolecules. This research will have a significant impact in a number of areas, especially chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>
