    <AbstractNarration>Within a few years, every laptop/desktop/server processor will be a&lt;br/&gt;multi-core machine. For an application to perform well, it must be&lt;br/&gt;efficiently parallelized to execute on all the cores on the machine.&lt;br/&gt;Chip manufacturers must therefore provide architectures that&lt;br/&gt;make it convenient for programmers to partition an application into&lt;br/&gt;multiple parallel threads. The Transactional Memory (TM) programming&lt;br/&gt;model is widely acknowledged to be the best known model for&lt;br/&gt;concurrency: it eliminates deadlocks, provides high performance in&lt;br/&gt;the common case, and greatly simplifies programming. It is receiving&lt;br/&gt;great attention in research conferences and is also being incorporated&lt;br/&gt;in commercial processors. One of the biggest overheads for such a&lt;br/&gt;system is the communication required between cores to implement&lt;br/&gt;transactional semantics. This overhead significantly impacts&lt;br/&gt;performance and power consumption of future processors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores algorithms to not only reduce the required amount of&lt;br/&gt;communication, but also explores mechanisms to reduce the overheads&lt;br/&gt;of communication. The key insight behind the proposed work is that an&lt;br/&gt;optimal on-chip network and transactional memory implementation will&lt;br/&gt;emerge by closely studying the interaction between the two. The&lt;br/&gt;insight developed during this work will lead to better methodologies&lt;br/&gt;to compute an optimal on-chip network. The simulators and tools&lt;br/&gt;developed during the research efforts will also support projects in&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate courses at the University of Utah.</AbstractNarration>
