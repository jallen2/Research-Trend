    <AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize the human condition through fundamental contributions&lt;br/&gt;to science and technology. The chances of realizing the full potential of nanotechnology have been buttressed&lt;br/&gt;by recent demonstrations of rational control and manipulation of matter at the atomic level. Yet, in spite of&lt;br/&gt;the remarkable feats achieved in its nascent years, nanotechnology has formidable challenges to overcome in&lt;br/&gt;the areas of manufacturing methods, system design, and basic understanding. These challenges have to be&lt;br/&gt;overcome before the promise of this new paradigm becomes a reality.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to establish a paradigm for real-time use of models in Atomic Force Microscopy&lt;br/&gt;(AFM). The concept of using models in real-time has significant potential that has not received the deserved&lt;br/&gt;attention by atomic force microscopists as the related tools are primarily employed by engineers. Such a&lt;br/&gt;perspective facilitates interpretation of data since it provides a precise means of delineating the effects of&lt;br/&gt;the inherent dynamics of the system from the properties of the sample being probed. Thus it provides an&lt;br/&gt;effective means of interpreting sample properties. In addition to the proposal goal of laying the foundations&lt;br/&gt;of a new paradigm, specific aims of the proposal will result in a new ultrafast investigation tool for AFM,&lt;br/&gt;termed the Transient Force Detector (TFD). The prototype will yield hundred thousand features per second&lt;br/&gt;detection rates without compromising sample size and resolution. A particular advantage of the TFD is that&lt;br/&gt;the resolution of the detection process, dependent on the quality factor of the cantilever probe, is decoupled&lt;br/&gt;from the speed of the detection process. Issues of the loss of the probe signal and high resolution imaging&lt;br/&gt;based on the likelihood that the probe is detecting the sample will be addressed. Use of models in realtime&lt;br/&gt;is very well suited to explore model based imaging where a more detailed information is desired when&lt;br/&gt;compared to detection. A finer characterization of the sample will result only if cantilever-sample interaction&lt;br/&gt;models amenable for real-time use are available. Based on averaging theory, a methodology is proposed to&lt;br/&gt;extract sample characteristics that include topography, local stiffness and local damping at the nanoscale.&lt;br/&gt;This includes a parallel operation where the sample characteristics will be gleaned by real-time models built&lt;br/&gt;on the results of the averaging analysis of the tip-sample dynamics. Observer theory based active modification&lt;br/&gt;of the cantilever probe is presented. This systems viewpoint opens up new vistas for tailoring bandwidth,&lt;br/&gt;resolution and forces on the tip and sample. This enhanced flexibility is absent from the present set of tools&lt;br/&gt;on modifying the cantilever dynamics. The innovative methods to be developed in the proposed investigation&lt;br/&gt;will be complemented by the existing and future experimental facilities. Preliminary proof of concept results&lt;br/&gt;indicate the vast potential of the model based imaging paradigm presented.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Micro-cantilevers are being used in diverse areas with increasing impact and has in-&lt;br/&gt;fluenced science in a fundamental manner. The methods proposed are enabling technologies and will open&lt;br/&gt;doors for investigating basic science issues by providing ultra-high bandwidth and resolution. The innovative&lt;br/&gt;contributions of the proposals will directly impact most aspects of scanning probe microscopy, as the proposed&lt;br/&gt;methods apply to most of the existing setups. For example, it will directly impact the extremely high&lt;br/&gt;density data storage (3 Tb/in2) and read out technologies as well as the array technologies employed by the&lt;br/&gt;bio industry. The experimental aspects of the proposed research will be accomplished in collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;Asylum Research, and Bioforce Nanosciences Inc. both leading biology related scanning probe microscope&lt;br/&gt;(SPM) company. This collaboration is expected to foster transfer of the theory and technology developed&lt;br/&gt;in this program between the academic institution of the PI and the SPM industry. The PI has successfully&lt;br/&gt;disseminated the system and control theory viewpoints to the physics community that is heavily involved in&lt;br/&gt;scanning probe microscopy. Under this proposal goals the PI will continue to push the synergistic transfer of&lt;br/&gt;knowhow between the two communities by exchanging student visits and presenting specialized workshops.&lt;br/&gt;A web based remote operation of SPMs is being explored by the PI in collaboration with Asylum Research&lt;br/&gt;that can be used for remote operation that will aid this effort.</AbstractNarration>
