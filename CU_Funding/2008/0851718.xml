    <AbstractNarration>The University of Maryland Eastern Shore REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Eight students, particularly rising sophomores, will be selected each year to participate in an intensive 10-week research program in marine and estuarine science. Students will be offered a broad range of mentorship in disciplines ranging from environmental chemistry to fish ecology. Students will receive a stipend, free housing and board at the University and supply money for conducting research with a faculty mentor. The program is supported with funds from the National Science Foundation Directorate of Biological Sciences, in partnership with the Division of Ocean Sciences. In addition to research, weekly workshops will be conducted to train students in writing a research proposal, analyzing data, scientific ethics, and various contemporary topics such as global climate change. The workshops will be led by experts at the University or with NOAA. Apart from weekly workshops, REU interns will also participate in field trips involving canoeing along the pristine Pocomoke River, and hiking through an internationally recognized wetland on the lower eastern shore of Maryland. At the end of the summer, REU interns will present research they have conducted with their faculty mentors during a symposium that will be held at the Paul S. Sarbanes Coastal Ecology Center. Interns will prepare a short report of their research which will be culminated into a publication of symposium proceedings. Students with limited opportunities for research, particularly in coastal systems, and from groups under-represented in science are particularly encouraged to apply. Additional information on the REU internship can be found at www.umes.edu/lmrcsc/reu, or by contacting the Project Director, Dr. Paulinus Chigbu at tel: (410) 621-3034, email: pchigbu@umes.edu, or Project Coordinator, Dr. Joseph Love at tel: (410) 651-6023 or email: jlove@umes.edu.</AbstractNarration>
