    <AbstractNarration>Scientific Research&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a combination of genetics, cell biology, and molecular biology to determine the structure and function of the mouse gene Cyclin B1 interacting protein 1 (Ccnb1IP1) during male and female meiosis. This research has three components: (1) to determine the complete gene and messenger RNA transcript structure for Ccnb1IP1, (2) to determine specific protein-protein interactions involving CCNB1IP1 during meiosis in mice, and (3) to identify the extent and cause of chromosomal defects in female meiosis. This research will advance knowledge across the field of meiotic biology by providing a new mouse resource for study, by elucidating the protein networks necessary for progression through meiosis, and by determining the key constituents of female meiosis. This work represents an important contribution to the research community because it increases the understanding of meiosis, a process of central importance for the generation of life's diversity through sexual reproduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project describes a program to conduct state-of-the-art molecular biological research and to integrate that research into the curricula of local public schools. An outreach program will be developed and staffed by Middlebury College undergraduate students, using a mobile DNA lab called the Gene Wagon, as an integral part of the undergraduate research program. Students will travel to local schools and, in collaboration with local teachers, will design and implement genetics-based educational laboratories. Additionally, this project will engage public school teachers through direct participation in primary research each summer. This project will improve interest and learning in biology in a school district with high rates of students below the poverty level. The benefits to society of this project are that basic research in meiosis will provide fundamental information regarding how organisms reproduce, generate genetic diversity, and as a result how they evolve. Further the principal investigator will be preparing teachers and students to succeed as scientists. The community outreach program will directly affect all local students but will be particularly beneficial to the rural poor. As a model, this program will also serve to stimulate the implementation of other such outreach programs in the area.</AbstractNarration>
