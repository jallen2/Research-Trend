    <AbstractNarration>Oprea&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0854518&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project is dedicated to the organization of an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary Workshop on Mathematical Modeling and Computer&lt;br/&gt;Simulations for Soft Materials, to bring together scientists from&lt;br/&gt;different fields, ranging from applied and computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and applied physics to a variety of disciplines&lt;br/&gt;relevant to soft matter physics, unified by their common interest&lt;br/&gt;in search for a deeper understanding of soft materials. The&lt;br/&gt;workshop is conceived specifically to identify new challenges for&lt;br/&gt;theory, modeling and simulation of soft materials, and to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the growing role of applied and computational&lt;br/&gt;mathematics in meeting those challenges. The goal of the&lt;br/&gt;workshop is to attract researchers at all levels, from graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and junior researchers to leaders in the field, with&lt;br/&gt;focus on breadth and diversity of the participants. Particular&lt;br/&gt;emphasis is placed on the training of young participants. The&lt;br/&gt;results are disseminated in a format useful to students,&lt;br/&gt;scientists and engineers, through graduate courses with&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary audience at Colorado State University, and&lt;br/&gt;through the publication of a refereed Collected Lectures volume&lt;br/&gt;of the invited and contributed talks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; From blood and lipid complexes, detergents, paints,&lt;br/&gt;plastics, personal care products, to liquid crystals and&lt;br/&gt;bio-materials, we are made of and surrounded by soft matter in&lt;br/&gt;all aspects of our lives. While many properties of hard matter&lt;br/&gt;are now understood, we are still on the learning curve with soft&lt;br/&gt;matter, and the study of the salient features and complex&lt;br/&gt;behavior of soft materials is one of the 21st century's&lt;br/&gt;challenges, requiring the development of new tools, new&lt;br/&gt;understanding, and an unprecedented level of interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;collaboration. Progress in materials science achieved in the&lt;br/&gt;last decades, as well as the rapid development of computer&lt;br/&gt;technology, have brought scientists to a better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;soft matter behavior and phenomena. Although much progress in&lt;br/&gt;this area has been made in recent years, fundamental challenges&lt;br/&gt;remain, such as the development of a unified scientific approach&lt;br/&gt;to soft materials, and the conversion of the important scientific&lt;br/&gt;discoveries into useful technological solutions. The workshop&lt;br/&gt;brings together experts in mathematics, physics and engineering&lt;br/&gt;to explore and develop the potential in this rich&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary area, and generates a diverse,&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary, but highly cooperative research environment&lt;br/&gt;that increases the accessibility of this interdisciplinary field&lt;br/&gt;to both students entering the field and non-specialists. The&lt;br/&gt;workshop presents a broad spectrum of current research and&lt;br/&gt;prospects for future directions that provides young researchers&lt;br/&gt;with an intensive learning experience and a larger perspective&lt;br/&gt;beyond their individual PhD thesis topics.</AbstractNarration>
