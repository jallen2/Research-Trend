    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL: The aim of the Workshop is to review the current status of high technology magnets and their applications, to identify current and future needs in high performance magnets and discuss/propose research initiatives that will allow us to develop the next generation magnet materials with the desired properties. The conference would bring together leading researchers on magnetic materials, primarily from USA and Europe, to discuss the ?alarming downtrend? in advanced magnets, and ways to reverse this trend. The workshop would provide a 5-7 years roadmap for high performance magnets, and promote collaboration amongst universities, national labs, and industry. The workshop would discuss fabrication, processing, and consolidation of high performance magnets. NON-TECHNICAL: High performance magnets, both permanent magnets and soft magnetic materials, are currently being used in many military and commercial applications, and are considered to be essential and critical not only for DOD but also for the US economy. The demand for advanced magnets is very high with a growing number of applications demanding better properties (better performance and higher operating temperatures and frequency) that are not available with the current materials. However, research and development of these materials have been in decline in recent years in United States and Europe despite their importance and the fact that they have been instrumental for most of the modern technology advances. The Workshop will focus on high performance hard and soft magnets.</AbstractNarration>
