    <AbstractNarration>NSF-CISE-CCF-EMT Workshop on Emerging Models Technologies for Computations in Nanoelectronics&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology is an exciting field with many potential applications. Its impact is already being felt in materials, engineering, electronics, medicine, and other disciplines. Current research in nanotechnology requires strong multi-disciplinary knowledge and emerging models technologies for computations in the field of nanoelectronics with promising. Nanoelectronics become the main research domain that successes in today?s microelectronics. It brings an unprecedented revolution in not only communications and computing, but also in other scientific and engineering fields such as nano-scale measurements in industrials, bioscience, medical and environmental sciences.&lt;br/&gt;A NSF workshop, funded by a NSF grant from the Emerging Models and Technologies (EMT) for Computation (EMT) Program was organized by Drs. Kathleen Meehan and Yong Xu, Virginia Tech. on October 15-16, 2007 in Arlington, Virginia. The primary objective of the workshop was to allow the current principal investigators and leading researchers in the field of nanoelectronic systems to review the impacts of the EMT Program for the nanoelectronics program element on various fronts: research, technology transfer culminating into better competitiveness of the USA and establishing new start-up companies, undergraduate and graduate education, promotion of cross-disciplinary teaching and research activities, training of engineers, and societal benefits, namely engendering enthusiasm amongst high school students and society in general. The workshop focused several challenge topics: molecular electronics, nanoarchitecurre, and CAD tools for uncertainty and defects in quantum electronics. The attendees also recommended NSF to create student exchange programs for information and experience sharing, to develop short course training, interdisciplinary conference/workshops with tutorials at different levels, and to create high-level lectures on the state-of-the-art research, and as well as interdisciplinary grant proposals for small but collaborative investigations.&lt;br/&gt;Based on the recommendations, the PI proposes to organize the need-based external NSF funded workshop to enhance the existing EMT Program in nanoelectronic systems research. The proposed workshop aims to providing an opportunity to share and develop education components. In addition to promote a series of short courses and lectures in nanoelectronics, the workshop will have a training session for undergraduate students, high school teachers of science and selective K12 students.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this education workshop is a great opportunity fro faculty to share their experience and course curriculum which are related to emerging model technologies for nanoelectronics and to discuss how the current research topics can be integrated into existing graduate credit courses, and to develop short and knowledge-based courses for undergraduate students, and how to create off school program to encourage K12 students and their teachers to participate in and involve to nanotechnology learning and exploration.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide (1) basic courses about fundamental nanoelectronics in nanotechnology for K12, undergraduate and graduate students, (2) provide online, open-access repository and course curriculum developments for public; thus to promote college education in this interdisciplinary field, (3) Develop short courses for college students and PIs to learn multiple subjects and materials that are related to nanoelectronics, (4) provide advanced tutorials for workshop participations and organize a tutorial sessions, and (5) solicit scientific papers; and organize workshop technical presentation, poster sessions; and process workshop paper proceeding publication and selected paper recommended for journals.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this proposal lie in the shortage of existing internal workshop and education program mechanism the multidisciplinary domain in nanoelectronics. The proposed workshop attempts to organize a national-recognized workshop in this domain and make it available not only to research institutes but also to public. There are three major scientific merits in this workshop. The first is to coordinate a workshop for education at all levels, and the second is to remain the state-of-the-art of technical tutorials and lectures in nanoelectronics, especially through EMT Program to provide the linkage between nano-computation promoted by NSF-CISE-CCF and other NSF programs. The third one is to promote nanoelectronics device inventions and its applications.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal is considered that the area of nanoelectronics has great potentials for future applications. Nanotechnology has emerged as a significant and exciting field, primarily with respect to the basic sciences, and will undoubtedly have a broad impact on nano-electronic devices, nano-structured materials, and nano-medicine in the near future. As a result, powerful nanoelectronics CAD design tools are needed to bring this technology to fruition and to stimulate the nanotechnology revolution. Consequently, the project bridges the research and development communities of nanotechnology and EMT. In addition, the proposed effort includes a training component at all levels, including courses and a nanotechnology education for science engineering undergraduate and graduate students in this nanoscience and technology fields, thus to increase the competitiveness for the nation.</AbstractNarration>
