    <AbstractNarration>This proposal outlines a challenging career developments plan focusing &lt;br/&gt;on several fascinating problems in Discrete Mathematics. Specific areas in &lt;br/&gt;which PI plans to work include Ramsey Theory, Graph colorings, Extremal &lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics and Random and pseudo-random graphs. Furthermore the author &lt;br/&gt;plan to study application of all these areas to Theoretical Computer &lt;br/&gt;Science. The main tools which are going to be used in this investigation &lt;br/&gt;combine combinatorial techniques, probabilistic methods, tools from Linear &lt;br/&gt;Algebra and spectral techniques amongst the others. First group of &lt;br/&gt;questions in this proposal deals with Ramsey numbers. The author wants to &lt;br/&gt;bound these numbers for sparse graphs, i.e., graphs in which every &lt;br/&gt;subgraph has bounded average degree. Here the goal is to show that such &lt;br/&gt;graphs have Ramsey numbers which grow linearly in the size of the graph. &lt;br/&gt;An additional topic is to study various extremal problems. In particular &lt;br/&gt;to obtain extensions of classical Turan's theorem and prove better bounds &lt;br/&gt;on the Max Cut in the graphs with forbidden subgraphs. Some of these &lt;br/&gt;problems were posed many years ago by Erdos, and despite all efforts are &lt;br/&gt;still open. Another set of questions deals mainly with the study of the &lt;br/&gt;chromatic and choice numbers of graphs. Usually there is a huge gap &lt;br/&gt;between these two parameters, so one of the goals in this proposal is to &lt;br/&gt;understand the graphs for which chromatic and choice numbers are equal. &lt;br/&gt;Finally the PI also intends to study the asymptotic properties of random &lt;br/&gt;and pseudo-random graphs which is one of the central topics in &lt;br/&gt;Probabilistic Combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Concepts and questions of Combinatorics appear naturally in many &lt;br/&gt;branches of mathematics, and have also found applications in other &lt;br/&gt;disciplines. These include applications in Information Theory and &lt;br/&gt;Electrical Engineering, in Statistical Physics and Molecular Biology, and &lt;br/&gt;most notably in Computer Science. The PI is convinced that progress in the &lt;br/&gt;problems he discusses will be interesting and significant, and will lead &lt;br/&gt;to new developments in Discrete Mathematics. He believes that the new &lt;br/&gt;approaches and techniques resulting from this project will be applicable &lt;br/&gt;and useful in other fields as well. The author also proposes a wide range &lt;br/&gt;of educational measures closely related to his project. He plans to &lt;br/&gt;develop a series of courses for senior undergraduate and starting graduate &lt;br/&gt;students, which will serve as a gentle introduction to the variety of &lt;br/&gt;powerful methods in modern Combinatorics. Part of these courses will be &lt;br/&gt;closely related to the research problems in this proposal. Along the &lt;br/&gt;course, the author plans to integrate research activities into the &lt;br/&gt;teaching by introducing open questions that will motivate the students to &lt;br/&gt;undertake research on these fascinating topics, which can lead to a B.A. &lt;br/&gt;thesis or Ph.D. dissertation.</AbstractNarration>
