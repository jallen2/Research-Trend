    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this effort is to organize the 1st International Conference from Nanoparticles and Nanomaterials to Nanodevices and Nanosystems in Halkidiki, Greece, in June 2008. The preliminary list of invitees/participants includes a Nobel Laureate and several world leaders and distinguished researchers from the US and around the world who are at the scientific forefront in the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed conference has several clear foreseeable intellectual merits. The meeting has been designed to include Symposia and Special Sessions addressing and linking current state-of-the-art in the field of nanoparticles and nanomaterials to building future nanodevices and nanosystems to address global issues relating to energy, human health and the environment. The presentations outlining present knowledge and interactions between researchers in the field will deepen the scientific understanding of (i) the underlying mechanisms in the formation and evolution of nanostructures and nanomaterials and (ii) utilizing these new nanostructures into building nanodevices and nanosystems. Knowledge gained from these interactions can enable profound progress in these research fields. Finally, the conference can stimulate new research ideas leading to novel concepts and applications. Such stimulation is possible due the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed conference. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed conference provides an excellent venue and environment for the exchange of ideas and open discussions that allow for the presentation of the researchers? latest work, augmenting efforts to advance the research frontiers in this field. A publications committee has been establish by the organizers to archive the presentations in a form that can be easily disseminated to the community at large. In additions, participants can submit manuscripts based on their presentations for consideration for publication to a number of referred journals. The conference will provide a significant opportunity for human resource development and graduate education, training and exposure to an interdisciplinary international environment. Attraction of underrepresented minorities will be pursuit through our relation with the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers (housed on UTA campus). The theme of the proposed conference also impacts fields of critical technological importance to the U.S. including microelectronics, nanotechnology, and bioengineering.</AbstractNarration>
