    <AbstractNarration>For problems exhibiting strong anisotropic features the finite element method &lt;br/&gt;(FEM) based on anisotropic meshes can be much more efficient than the one &lt;br/&gt;based on isotropic meshes, provided the meshes are properly aligned and the &lt;br/&gt;right aspect ratios are maintained. However, there has been little rigorous &lt;br/&gt;analysis about it, and most computational work has been restricted to linear &lt;br/&gt;elements, based on heuristic justification and ad-hoc treatments.&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to provide the numerical analysis for the FEM &lt;br/&gt;on anisotropic meshes and develop effective controls for the adaptive&lt;br/&gt;mesh refinement. The main objectives of this project include:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Analyze various recovery type error estimators for the FEM &lt;br/&gt;on anisotropic meshes; (ii) Develop reliable mesh metrics and mesh &lt;br/&gt;quality measures to control the anisotropic mesh refinement process; &lt;br/&gt;(iii) Develop a software tool box for the post-processing of the&lt;br/&gt;finite element solutions, including error estimation, mesh metrics &lt;br/&gt;construction, and mesh quality evaluation. (iv) Provide research training &lt;br/&gt;to graduate students on adaptive finite element computation in science &lt;br/&gt;and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Error estimation and adaptive mesh refinement are two major components &lt;br/&gt;in practical finite element simulations. The former assesses the accuracy &lt;br/&gt;of the solution and provides the quality assurance when it is delivered. &lt;br/&gt;The latter is an indispensable tool for improving the solution when the &lt;br/&gt;desired accuracy has not been reached. For anisotropic FEM, the elements &lt;br/&gt;are allowed to be long and narrow to fit the underlining problems more&lt;br/&gt;effectively. They may vary in sizes, orientations, and aspect ratios. &lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at providing better understanding of the behavior &lt;br/&gt;of anisotropic FEM and developing more efficient techniques for the FE &lt;br/&gt;simulations. Since the recovery type error estimation techniques &lt;br/&gt;are simple, extraordinary robust, and most commonly used in engineering, &lt;br/&gt;it will be the main focus of this research. Successful completion of &lt;br/&gt;this project will provide rigorous mathematical theory and more efficient &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for practical FE modeling and simulations in aerospace &lt;br/&gt;engineering, material processing, and biomedical researches.</AbstractNarration>
