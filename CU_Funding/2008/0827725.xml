    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0827725&lt;br/&gt;Zou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systematical study of photonic elements interactions with deterministic positioning at nanometer scale is very important for: 1) fundamental understanding of the underlying distance dependent interactions and energy transfer between various photonic elements; 2) providing useful models to understand photonic antenna systems existing in nature; 3) providing crucial information for constructing artificial biophotonic systems for applications ranging from light harvesting to biosensing. Structural DNA nanotechnology has developed to the stage that self-assembled fully addressable DNA nanoarrays can be constructed with rational control. It is now possible to position metallic particles and various biomolecules (proteins or peptides or RNA/DNA sequences) or functional molecules (ligands or fluorophores) on DNA nanoscaffolds in a programmable fashion. Our goal here is to utilize the exquisite power of the deterministic addressability developed in the structural DNA nanotechnology in connection with theoretical simulations to have a better understanding of the interactions between nanophotonic elements linked on the self-assembled DNA nanostructures by systematically varying the position, distance and geometry of these elements. Specifically, we aim to use DNA directed self-assembly to: (1) study distance dependent effects between metallic nanoparticles and organic fluorophores; (2) construct a molecular antenna system for efficient light harvesting; (3) construct and understand geometry dependent energy transfers between fluorophores. A strong collaborative team has been established that aligns theoretical modeling and experimental expertise together to address these questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This proposal is both technology and problem driven. The use of selfassembling DNA nanostructures provides unprecedented opportunities to have a true control over spatial arrangements of particles and molecules in two and three dimensions. The complexity achieved at molecular level mimics what exist in nature and far exceeds the current capabilities of top-down lithographic approach. This approach will open up the possibility of incorporating a remarkable degree of complexity and functionality into an artificial supra-molecular system that is entirely self-assembled. As a result, systematic experiments can be designed to test theoretical hypothesis and modeling. New models will be developed by taking into account of many experimental parameters resulting from the deterministic positioning of photonic elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Our proposed research will answer many fundamental questions of how photonic elements interact with each other in a controlled fashion with a high degree of complexity. It will offer useful information for energy related applications, such as energy transfer between nanoparticles and dye molecules, which will help and guide the development of nanotechnology in the applications of light energy harvesting. It also provides a novel platform to develope biosensing elements for sensitive detection. With these broader societal implications, this research naturally leads to opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students training and outreach programs currently existing at both ASU and UCF. For example, Dr. Liu plans to offer summer internships to high school teachers to help them to develop new biotechnology curricula and summer research opportunities for high school students to expose them to the cutting edge research happening in a University lab to attract excellent high school students into science research. These efforts are in align with the RET and SIP program of Biodesign Institute at ASU. Dr. Zou is currently accommodating three undergraduate students in his research group. Dr. Zou's group also offers internship positions for high school students so that they may be well prepared for their higher degree educations.</AbstractNarration>
