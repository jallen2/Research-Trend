    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Change Agents for Teaching and Learning Statistics (CATALST) project is designed to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate an introductory, non-calculus based statistics course that involves changes in both content and pedagogy. This project builds on several previously funded projects, connecting them in a way that enables the project to design and teach a unique course. The project is also designed to carefully research and study the impact of the course on students and faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project builds on and integrates theory and research from several disciplines: cognitive science, statistics, statistics education, mathematics education and engineering education, connecting these to teaching and professional development. The project goals are to: (a) develop and adapt innovative materials based on cognitive theory and proven methods to promote deep conceptual understanding, problem solving ability, retention, and transfer of learning; (b) implement the materials in all sections of an introductory statistics class at the university; (c) adapt and use a variety of high quality assessments aligned with student learning goals; (d) conduct research studies on the effectiveness of the material and approaches; and (e) develop expertise among a group of faculty at other institutions to implement the materials and pedagogical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project affects both content and pedagogy, shaping a very different and much needed introductory statistics course. Workshops familiarize statistics faculty members with the CATALST course and motivate and support them to use the content and pedagogy. After the workshops, online support assists faculty as they make changes in the their own classes. Ten class testers receive more intensive training and support program that prepares them to be catalysts for change in their own institutions and communities.</AbstractNarration>
