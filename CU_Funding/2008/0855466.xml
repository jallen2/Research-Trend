    <AbstractNarration>Disentangling historical patterns and events that have resulted in the modern day distributions of living organisms continues to provide a challenge to biogeographers. This is particularly true in Africa and Eurasia, where our knowledge of historical events leading to avian speciation is largely restricted to relatively small portions of each continent. As a model system from which to conduct biogeographic analyses on these continents, this study will perform a sweeping DNA study of phylogenetic relationships among the 315 species comprising the subfamily Muscicapinae (thrushes, chats and flycatchers). These phylogenies will allow tests of biogeographic hypotheses at inter- and intra-continental levels, to include assessing the potential roles of climatic cycling and ecological gradients in driving speciation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly, this research will lead to improved avian taxonomy, as well as a better understanding of the origin and maintenance of biodiversity and avian conservation. This study will further lead to empirical studies seeking to identify and model the origin, diversification, and distribution of species and evolutionary lineages, and to determining the tempo and mode of evolutionary change. The biogeographical studies will be some of the first to establish broad patterns illustrating how avian biotas are assembled in these little explored continental regions and will thus serve as a template for future studies of diverse plant and animal groups.</AbstractNarration>
