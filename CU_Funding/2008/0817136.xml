    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing a comprehensive science and technology educational program using low cost, very small radio telescopes (VSRT). These systems have already been successfully tested in a community college setting under a CCLI Phase 1 grant. MIT Haystack Observatory is working with faculty and students in a variety of colleges and universities to enhance the capabilities of the existing VSRT systems and widely disseminate the resulting curriculum applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project involves the enhancement of a very small radio telescope (VSRT) system to introduce students at a wide range of undergraduate academic settings to radio science technology and radio astronomical observations. All components in the VSRT are commercially available through radio equipment outlets and can be easily assembled according to instructions the project has developed. The VSRT uses a 0.5m satellite TV antenna operating at 12.5 GHz. It can be easily pointed at the Sun to observe its emitted radio flux and can be used with two or three similar antennas for higher resolution radio-interferometry experiments using transit or pointed observations of the Sun. Laboratory experiments to demonstrate the principles of interferometry have been developed and are being widely disseminated. New enhancements to the hardware allow new projects to be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Importantly, and quite serendipitously, observations of the 11 GHz line of mesospheric ozone are possible. The first-ever measurements of this important spectroscopic line were recently made during the development of the VSRT. Since this is a new discovery, it opens a scientific area to students to allow them to participate in cutting edge research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The VSRT program also provides faculty with hands-on workshops to introduce the technical materials, the software and data analysis procedures to enable them to effectively include the systems in the classroom. A web forum is being developed to allow students and faculty to share ideas, discuss their results and communicate their successes and failures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: MIT Haystack Observatory has a long history of undergraduate education programs. Having a small, portable, simple, and low-cost system, that does not require permanent installation, can be extremely valuable in developing teaching materials in science and engineering. Haystack Observatory also has a strong record of public outreach. These venues provide excellent opportunities to use the VSRT as a demonstration of radio-wave science.</AbstractNarration>
