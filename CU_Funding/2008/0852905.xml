    <AbstractNarration>0852905&lt;br/&gt;Bendezu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twelve-month research fellowship by Dr. Felipe O. Bendezu to work with Dr. Sophie Martin at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polarized growth is a critical process carried out by many biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, vegetatively growing cells&lt;br/&gt;utilize the microtubule and microfilament cytoskeletons to coordinate polarized&lt;br/&gt;growth to the cell tips to increase in length and to mid-cell for division. Very little&lt;br/&gt;is known, however, about how fission yeast coordinate polarized growth during&lt;br/&gt;mating, or sexual reproduction. Preliminary evidence suggests both the&lt;br/&gt;microtubule and microfilament networks are required for establishing matinginduced&lt;br/&gt;polarized growth. Additionally, a member of the actin-nucleating family of&lt;br/&gt;formins has been implicated in the cell fusion event following cell-cell contact.&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the mechanisms governing polarized growth and cell&lt;br/&gt;fusion during mating of fission yeast. Using the powerful tools of fission yeast&lt;br/&gt;genetics and cell biology, the PI will 1) define the organization and role of&lt;br/&gt;the mating cytoskeleton through live-cell imaging, 2) investigate the localization&lt;br/&gt;and function of formins during mating and 3) identify additional factors required&lt;br/&gt;for mating-induced polarized growth in a genome-wide screen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide insight into the poorly understood process of polarized growth during mating of fission yeast. The fission yeast has been established as a powerful model system to decipher fundamental mechanisms of cell proliferation and polarization. Indeed, many of the mechanisms governing cytoskeletal function have been conserved&lt;br/&gt;from yeast to man, which remarkably share over 70% of their genes. Since many&lt;br/&gt;of the components important for polarized growth have been conserved through&lt;br/&gt;evolution, this work is likely to further our understanding of conserved&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of cell polarization in more complex systems. This fellowship will&lt;br/&gt;provide the PI with the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art equipment&lt;br/&gt;and facilities under the guidance of a leader in the field of cell polarity and to&lt;br/&gt;develop an original research project that he can pursue independently in the&lt;br/&gt;future.</AbstractNarration>
