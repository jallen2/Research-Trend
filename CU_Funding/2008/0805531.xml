    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to develop an analog, in the homotopy&lt;br/&gt;category, of the category of mixed Tate motives which have proved to&lt;br/&gt;be so important in recent developments in arithmetic geometry. The&lt;br/&gt;central idea is to replace the algebraic K-theory of the ring of&lt;br/&gt;integers in the latter subject with Waldhausen's K-theory of the&lt;br/&gt;sphere spectrum. This would explain the appearance of zeta-values&lt;br/&gt;at odd positive integers in both the theory of motives, and as values&lt;br/&gt;of Igusa's Reidemeister invariants in differential topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Certain values of Riemann's zeta function are widely conjectured to be &lt;br/&gt;transcendental. These numbers have recently been shown [through work of&lt;br/&gt;Connes, Kreimer, and Marcolli] to play a central and unexpected role&lt;br/&gt;in the theoretical basis for the renormalization techniques fundamental&lt;br/&gt;to perturbative quantum field theory, but WHY they should be so important&lt;br/&gt;is quite mysterious. However, these same numbers are of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;importance in other parts of mathematics, eg in arithmetic algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry and in differential topology. Their role in algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;has been rationalized by the development of a theory of `motives', and it&lt;br/&gt;seems likely that some version of these ideas can be extended to&lt;br/&gt;differential topology as well. The deep links between topological quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theories and differential topology suggest that this&lt;br/&gt;will lead to a new level of understanding of the geometric foundations&lt;br/&gt;of phyics.</AbstractNarration>
