    <AbstractNarration>Event-driven software (EDS) spans multiple domains, from industrial embedded devices and robotic controllers to web interfaces. Researchers experimenting with new software testing techniques for EDS do not have benchmarks that they can use to compare their techniques. This project investigates the requirements for a community infrastructure of event-based testing researchers to provide uniformity in experimentation. It uses the results of the requirements analysis to develop a preliminary prototype called COMET: COMmunity-Event-based Testing. COMET will consist of a core set of requirements for EDS testing that provides a repository of both logical and concrete test artifacts. This includes processes and models to standardize the way experiments are conducted as well as on- line web services for common computational components. Techniques developed in this project will have a broad impact: COMET has the potential to bring EDS testing techniques to a broader community and will promote greater transferability of ideas. Artifacts for EDS testing will be available to other disciplines such as computer human interaction researchers who are interested in EDS usability.</AbstractNarration>
