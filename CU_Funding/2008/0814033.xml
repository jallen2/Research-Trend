    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is concerned with planning new research agendas for developing digital tools for the humanities and arts as well as creating sustainable repository infrastructures and organizational mechanisms to curate and grow tool resources as they are created. Both of the organizing institutions are part of an international network of digital humanities centers Called centerNet, with representatives from over 100 centers world wide. The need to develop computational resources for cyberscholarship in the humanities and arts for scholarship in these areas has been widely recognized and their effectiveness proven. Because of the complex data involved and interpretive methods used in humanities research applications are complex and advance computation and digital technologies.</AbstractNarration>
