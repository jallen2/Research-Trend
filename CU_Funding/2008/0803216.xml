    <AbstractNarration>The PI plans to establish new results concerning geometric and dynamical &lt;br/&gt;properties of special subsets of the representation variety of a finitely &lt;br/&gt;generated group into a semisimple Lie group. Besides classical methods &lt;br/&gt;from differential geometry, rigidity theory and algebraic groups, new &lt;br/&gt;techniques from continuous bounded cohomology will be employed in an &lt;br/&gt;essential way. The project builds upon previous joint work with M. Burger &lt;br/&gt;and A. Iozzi,in which the bounded Kaehler class, a second continuous &lt;br/&gt;bounded cohomology class, was used, both, to establish rigidity results &lt;br/&gt;for Zariski dense representations of arbitrary finitely generated groups &lt;br/&gt;into Lie groups of Hermitian type, as well as to define and study &lt;br/&gt;connected components of the representation variety of a surface group, &lt;br/&gt;which give generalizations of Teichmueller space. One part of the project &lt;br/&gt;concerns the study of refined geometric properties of surface group &lt;br/&gt;representations in these special components, of parametrizations similar &lt;br/&gt;to Fenchel-Nielsen or shear coordinates on Teichmueller space, and of the &lt;br/&gt;explicit relations between these generalized Teichmueller spaces and the &lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and of locally homogeneous geometric &lt;br/&gt;structures on the surface. In a second part of the project, methods and &lt;br/&gt;techniques used in the study of the bounded Kaehler class will be extended &lt;br/&gt;to define and investigate bounded cohomology classes in higher degree, &lt;br/&gt;which are expected to give rise to new rigidity phenomena and structural &lt;br/&gt;results about representations into other semisimple Lie groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetries arise everywhere in nature and are very important in biology, &lt;br/&gt;chemistry, physics and mathematics. Mathematically one way to study &lt;br/&gt;symmetries is to consider symmetry groups, that is groups of &lt;br/&gt;transformations preserving the given symmetries. Patterns with many &lt;br/&gt;symmetries are often optimal configurations and as such stable or rigid, &lt;br/&gt;because small deformations or changes destroy the symmetry. Sometimes &lt;br/&gt;patterns with symmetries arise in families and form so called "moduli &lt;br/&gt;spaces"; then, small or even large deformations do not break symmetry even &lt;br/&gt;though they change the pattern. In this project both phenomena are &lt;br/&gt;detected and studied using a special measurement for the geometric &lt;br/&gt;complexity of objects, which depends only on their symmetries.</AbstractNarration>
