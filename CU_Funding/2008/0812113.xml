    <AbstractNarration>In traditional social choice, it is assumed that each agent explicitly ranks all of the alternatives. In Artificial Intelligence applications this is generally impractical: for example, there are exponentially many joint plans&lt;br/&gt;or allocations of tasks/resources. Nevertheless, even the computational social choice community has so&lt;br/&gt;far focused primarily on the explicit-ranking model. While this was a necessary phase to establish a solid&lt;br/&gt;foundation for this line of research, it is now time to move on and consider the combinatorial domains with&lt;br/&gt;exponentially many alternatives that motivated computational social choice in the first place. This is what&lt;br/&gt;the proposed research will do.&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes the following 5-part research plan. First, he plans to study how agents? votes should&lt;br/&gt;be represented, that is, what language the agents should use to express their preferences in a combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;domain. Once the language has been determined, he plans to study what rule should be used to make a&lt;br/&gt;decision based on the votes. Such a rule would be useless without a good algorithm for executing it, that&lt;br/&gt;is, for solving the winner determination problem. Even with a good language, it may be overwhelming&lt;br/&gt;for an agent to report its complete preferences, so the PI plans to study how to elicit the (relevant parts of)&lt;br/&gt;agents? preferences by asking the agents simple queries. Finally, he plans to address the problem of agents&lt;br/&gt;voting insincerely to manipulate the decision, in part by investigating whether such manipulation can be&lt;br/&gt;made computationally infeasible.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will allow agents to coordinate when solving a complex problem, even if they have&lt;br/&gt;been created by different designers with different objectives. For example, robots in search-and-rescue or&lt;br/&gt;other exploration settings can vote over how they will divide the exploration. This allows a much greater&lt;br/&gt;diversity of agents to participate in such a task, undoubtedly leading to better results. Also, some of the&lt;br/&gt;research is likely to be applicable to human decision making.&lt;br/&gt;Europe is starting to take the lead in computational social choice; if funded, this proposal will ensure that&lt;br/&gt;the U.S. retains expertise in and continues to shape this burgeoning research area. Of course, research is not&lt;br/&gt;a zero-sum game, and the PI plans to collaborate closely with the other researchers in the area. In fact, this&lt;br/&gt;proposal corresponds to the PI?s part of a 12-investigator proposal that was just recommended for funding&lt;br/&gt;by the European Science Foundation (ESF). This (NSF) proposal would also support the PI?s collaboration&lt;br/&gt;with Jeff Rosenschein (Hebrew University); for this collaboration, Jeff and the PI already received a small&lt;br/&gt;US-Israel Binational Science Foundation grant that serves to support the Israeli side as well as travel.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal also includes plans to develop a new graduate course on computational social choice,&lt;br/&gt;mentor graduate and undergraduate students, build connections to economics and political science, and&lt;br/&gt;attract more women to computer science (as well as participate in other outreach activities).</AbstractNarration>
