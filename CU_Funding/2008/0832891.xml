    <AbstractNarration>This Ethics Education in Science and Engineering project will articulate an ethical foundation for sustainability and develop materials for delivery to graduate students in engineering, the sciences, and the design professions. Because sustainability ultimately rests on ethics, this is a crucial link in extending sustainability from a mere intellectual exercise to a much wider incorporation into virtually every sector and field of endeavor. The first year of the project will involve a full development of an ethics of sustainability that will be based on a framework of nine principles proposed by the PI. The second year will involve the design of a dissemination system and three delivery systems for use by any institution. These three delivery systems will be tested and refined at the University of Florida as part of a Masters Degree program in Sustainable Construction and as part of the Continuing Education delivery system at the University of Florida. It is expected that four graduate students will be engaged in the concept development in the first year and four graduate students will be involved in the design of the three delivery systems. The results of the research will be tested at the University of Florida via several delivery systems, addressed to both graduate students and professional development, and disseminated to other universities for use in their technical education curricula.</AbstractNarration>
