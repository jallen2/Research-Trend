    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry (CHE)and the Cellular Systems program of the Division of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB)will support the CAREER development plan of Prof. Muhammad N. Yousaf of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Prof. Yousaf and his students will develop a class of electroactive and dynamic surfaces to study cell polarity and cell migration. Microfluidic and high-resolution live-cell fluorescence microscopy techniques along with genetically encoded biosensors will be used to generate dynamic surface gradients to study internal signaling during directed cell migration. The research will provide multidisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students. Prof. Yousaf also will integrate research in microfluidics and surface characterization of biologically relevant systems with educational activities focused on implementing the exchange of research and mentoring activities with a local university that caters to underserved minority groups.</AbstractNarration>
