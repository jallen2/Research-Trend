    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will continue support for the International Materials Institute (IMI) on New Functionality in Glass at Lehigh University in close collaboration with Pennsylvania State University, which was established four years ago. This IMI combines fundamental research with technological applications and focuses on studies of optically active glasses for light production, photo-responsive glasses for a variety of sensors and detectors, and glasses for biomedical applications. The Institute will continue to promote research and educational activities related to glass science on a global scale through its partnership with many US universities, national laboratories, international institutions, and industries. Researchers from eight foreign countries (Brazil, China, Egypt, France, India, Japan, Portugal and UK) are involved in research collaborations and as advisory board members. Activities of the IMI include international exchange programs for faculty, postdoctoral scholars and students, internet-based lectures and courses by senior researchers, domestic and international research experience for undergraduate students and secondary school teachers, development of multi-media education modules, demonstration experiments in science museums, annual international schools and workshops. Participating students and faculty gain valuable international research and educational experience to be globally competitive in their careers. Minority student recruitment is targeted through proactive interactions with Tuskegee University faculty and students. Furthermore, in partnership with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, this IMI plans to work with glass companies in PA to meet the needs of solar industries. Three advisory boards with representation from several US universities and national laboratories, glass industries, and international institutions will provide annual evaluation of the IMI activities and guidance on emerging areas of focus. In addition to the peer evaluation by the advisors, the IMI activities will be evaluated by independent experts.</AbstractNarration>
