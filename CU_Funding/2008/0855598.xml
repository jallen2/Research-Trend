    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0855598 PI: Roeder, Ryan ORG: Notre Dame University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Biological Materials Science Symposium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The Biological Materials Science Symposium at the Annual Meeting of the Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society (April 2009) provides a venue for researchers exploring the intersection of materials science and biology. Materials science and engineering is expected to play a highly significant role in the foreseeable future of biomedicine. Conversely, noting that materials science finds its roots in solid state physics and chemistry, biology is logically the next great frontier for materials science. The BMS Symposium is different from other related symposia in emphasizing the primacy of the study of biological materials to the development of biomaterials and biomimetic materials, as well as the application of materials science and engineering principles to the study of biological materials. The well-planed program of the proposed five-day symposium provides an important venue for discussion of the role of biologically-derived materials in the broader field of biomaterials, which encompasses not only bioderived materials but also biomimetic, bioinspired, and biocompatible materials that may not be of biological origin. Outstanding keynote and other invited speakers from around the world have been asked to highlight recent advances and emerging trends in the biomaterials field in each of eight topical sessions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: A particularly strong feature of this symposium is its commitment to the involvement of students, whose travel to the symposium will be supported in part by this award and who will participate in a student poster contest for which prizes will be given to the best presentations. These students will not only be active symposium participants but will have ample opportunity to meet an international array of biomaterials researchers and learn of their work. Sessions of the broader meeting are specifically designed to highlight the opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities in the field.</AbstractNarration>
