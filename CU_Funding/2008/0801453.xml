    <AbstractNarration>Transparent Solar Cell Antennas for Small Satellites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop modular transparent antenna designs that can be placed on top of commercially available solar cells. This is an important step forward for small satellite designs, allowing an inexpensive after-market antenna to be integrated with an off-the-shelf solar panel to provide the least expensive, most flexible design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The approach is to use wire meshes to build patch antennas that can be adhered to the surface of the solar cell, or to use ink-jet printing to print these designs. The materials and designs will be optimized using a genetic algorithm to create patterned antennas that may appear random but provide significant improvements in performance. This project will provide a significant cost reduction for small satellites, which are becoming the backbone of inexpensive space science for universities and low-cost deployment for industry. Other applications for transparent antennas include integration onto window glass of buildings or vehicles, wearable antennas (on clothing) and antennas for vehicles built from non-conducting composites (the future of most cars and airplanes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The technology broadens communication system architecture where security, amiable appearance, and space limitations are important. The design and prototyping methods used for this project can also be used in student courses, potentially allowing college and high school students to participate in highly creative antenna design projects. The project will broaden participation of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
