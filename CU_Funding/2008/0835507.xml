    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0604807&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Tara S. Holm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator's principal focus in this proposal is group&lt;br/&gt;actions and reduction in symplectic geometry. A fundamental problem&lt;br/&gt;in symplectic geometry is to relate the geometry and topology of a&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian system to the combinatorics of the moment polytope, and&lt;br/&gt;vice versa. The principal players on the geometric side include the&lt;br/&gt;symplectic manifold itself and its symplectic reductions.&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorially, the vertices, edges, k-dimensional faces, and even&lt;br/&gt;the chambers of the moment polytope play a significant role.&lt;br/&gt;Generically, a symplectic reduction has orbifold singularities. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator outlines a program towards understanding the&lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology of such orbifolds. These results will provide&lt;br/&gt;insight into the structure of the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring,&lt;br/&gt;yielding information about orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants. This&lt;br/&gt;work has also naturally led to foundational questions regarding group&lt;br/&gt;actions on orbifolds. Finally, the PI will distill the geometry and&lt;br/&gt;topology of the Hamiltonian system into combinatorial data associated&lt;br/&gt;to the moment polytope. This will shed new light on recent&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial results concerning intervals in the Bruhat order on any&lt;br/&gt;Coxeter group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry is the mathematical framework for describing&lt;br/&gt;phenomena in mathematical physics, from classical mechanics to string&lt;br/&gt;theory. The moment map is an important tool that translates the&lt;br/&gt;symmetries of a physical system into discrete data. An expert in&lt;br/&gt;symplectic geometry, the PI will achieve a deeper understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between the geometry of a symplectic manifold and the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics of the moment map data. Her work will shed light on&lt;br/&gt;stringy invariants in this context. The proposed activities will&lt;br/&gt;advance our knowledge in the fields of symplectic geometry and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, with applications to algebraic geometry, algebraic&lt;br/&gt;topology and mathematical physics. The PI's broader objectives&lt;br/&gt;include increasing the participation and visibility of women in&lt;br/&gt;research mathematics, and enhancing the undergraduate experience in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
