    <AbstractNarration>In many economic environments the participants do not have the same information&lt;br/&gt;about the relevant aspects of their situation. For example, in a financial market each&lt;br/&gt;investor may have different pieces of information about the underlying value of an asset&lt;br/&gt;or a company. In product markets, each competiting firm may have private information&lt;br/&gt;about its cost structure. In auctions, such as the wireless spectrum auctions organized&lt;br/&gt;by the Federal Communications Commission or the offshore oil tracts auctioned off by&lt;br/&gt;the U.S. Department of the Interior, the bidders have private information about their&lt;br/&gt;valuations and also some, possibly noisy, information about the valuations of their&lt;br/&gt;competitors.&lt;br/&gt;The private information of an agent, whether it is about his/her own valuations or the&lt;br/&gt;valuations of the competing agents will determine the behavior and the strategy of the&lt;br/&gt;agent. But in practice, the theoretical and/or empirical analysts do not have a clear&lt;br/&gt;understanding of what the economic agents know and, in particular, what they do or do&lt;br/&gt;not know about each other. The missing and incomplete information si also highly&lt;br/&gt;relevant from a policy perspective as the supervising or regulatory authority in many&lt;br/&gt;markets face similar informational constraints.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs develop methods that allow predictions about the behavior of economic agents&lt;br/&gt;and the reulting market allocations in such settings. These predictions are robust to a&lt;br/&gt;large class of private information structures by the agents. They identify conditions on&lt;br/&gt;the nature of the interaction and the market under which it is possible to make unique&lt;br/&gt;predictions about economic behavior. When these conditions are not met, the PIs&lt;br/&gt;establish robust bounds on the distribution of possible economic outcomes, especially&lt;br/&gt;the mean and the variance of the outcomes. They use these bounds to predict the&lt;br/&gt;welfare impact of information sharing in markets. They also use the bounds to design&lt;br/&gt;robust mechanisms, such as auction and voting methods, that perform well in many&lt;br/&gt;information environments.&lt;br/&gt;This project provides an economic theory that can lead to practical solutions to market&lt;br/&gt;and mechanism design problems. It also provides a theoretical foundation for future&lt;br/&gt;work in econometrics aimed at testing models in situations where the researcher does&lt;br/&gt;not know the market's information structure.&lt;br/&gt;This research will have broader impacts for the many different areas of social science&lt;br/&gt;that use game theory as a fundamental tool. In addition, the project has direct&lt;br/&gt;implications for antitrust policy, since whether or not to allow sellers to share information&lt;br/&gt;is a question for price-fixing policy.</AbstractNarration>
