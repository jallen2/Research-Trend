    <AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on the development of methods that combine two or more catalysts in one system with the goal of making known reactions faster and more selective and also enabling new reactions. While existing multi-catalyst systems yield more efficient and selective reactions at less expense, their current range is limited. By broadening their use to even more reactions, significant benefits across the field of synthesis are expected. This project focuses on bifunctional catalysts (with two catalytic features in one molecule), which can lead to faster reaction rates with greater enantio- and chemoselectivity as well as better yields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor D. Tyler McQuade of the Department of Chemistry at Florida State University. Professor McQuade's research efforts revolve around the development of multi-catalyst systems. The rising standard of living worldwide has resulted in greater demand for life-saving small molecules, but access to these molecules is threatened by rising costs of energy and raw materials. Success of the proposed work would lead to advances in synthetic efficiency and significantly accelerated reaction rates that would help to satisfy the global demand for these important molecules</AbstractNarration>
