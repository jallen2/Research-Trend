    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2008. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "The Role of Mobile DNA in the Evolution of Genes and Genomes in an Extremely Diverse Mammalian Group" for Sarah R. Schaack. The host institution for this research is University of Texas - Arlington and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Ellen Pritham and Dr. Cedric Feschotte. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequencing of whole genomes has revealed that "typical" genes coding for essential proteins actually constitute a very small fraction of the genome in most plants and animals. Instead, a significant proportion of the genome is made up of transposable elements (TEs), a unique category of DNA that, unlike typical genes, can move around the genome. Sometimes, however, when TEs move they also bring along neighboring genes accidentally. This type of hitch-hiking can result in new gene combinations or duplicate copies when the TE finally inserts into a new position. Helitrons are a recently discovered group of TEs that are known for their ability to transport neighboring genes in this way. Recently, they have been discovered in the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, and have been shown to represent a surprisingly large percent of that genome. This research is surveying Helitrons and their patterns of mobilization in this and closely-related species of bats in order to identify potential cases of novel gene formation or duplication and to understand the role of these TEs in diversification of these species over long time periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include developing the computational skills necessary to take advantage of the wealth of data now publicly available as a result of the recent surge in whole genome sequencing projects. This training will, in turn, be used to mentor students also interested in discovering more about the role of mobile DNA in the genome now that its ubiquity is appreciated. In addition, it will further illuminate the capacity of Helitrons to copy and reshuffle genes in mammals and shed light on the potential role of Helitrons in the evolution of the extremely diverse bat lineage.</AbstractNarration>
