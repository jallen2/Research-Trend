    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses a crucial area in the globalization of science: the transmission of skills to future scientists. It does this by examining doctoral training practices critical to the transmission of skills acquired through close interaction and hands-on experience, also known as 'tacit skills.' Although an under researched area in scientific training, 'tacit skills' play a crucial role in the creativity and innovation in experimental and mathematical sciences, laser and nuclear technology development. While there is a standard set of accepted scientific principles shared by most scientists, there are also differences in terms of what is learned and how it is taught. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Each of these countries has consistently exhibited high rates of innovation and productivity in recent years. However, while these countries have been successful in science education, each of them approaches the task of training scientists in various methods. The core hypothesis of the study is that student-mentor relationships significantly configure levels of scientific creativity, pioneering discoveries, technical innovation, and research productivity. The project's main goal is to develop an empirically tested and contemporary model of science that will inform science and innovation policy about the role of 'tacit skills' in knowledge production, and to enhance best practices in U.S. graduate science training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project analyzes the different methods using analytical, conceptual, and methodological tools from the areas of knowledge sharing, social networks, and the extended translation model of science. While a component of the project will uncover the degree of codified knowledge that is taught by most standard text books and the mastery of this knowledge, the project also seeks to understand advanced knowledge acquisition and transmission through the study of graduate science training by exploring students' relationships with mentors and peers. Contemporary research has shown that the nature of informal educational practices is not only conducive to the acquisition of 'tacit skills' but enhances professional competencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Project not only advances understanding of how 'tacit skills' are transmitted, but also informs pedagogical programs, and generates 'best practices' in advanced scientific training that recognize the changing nature and morphology of knowledge production brought about by globalization. It enhances scientific manpower and infrastructure by establishing networks of collaborations across disciplinary boundaries among scientific institutions globally. This Project involves the active participation of students from underrepresented Hispanic populations located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This participation exposes and socializes these students to actual multicultural research work and to professional scientific careers critical to socioeconomic development of the U.S. southern border.</AbstractNarration>
