    <AbstractNarration>Man&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807543&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project comprises three parts. In Part 1, the&lt;br/&gt;objective is to develop a group-theoretic method by which&lt;br/&gt;explicit expressions that delineate the effects of&lt;br/&gt;crystallographic texture on material tensors of weakly-textured&lt;br/&gt;polycrystalline materials can be derived systematically. A&lt;br/&gt;representation theorem is proved that reduces the problem to that&lt;br/&gt;of finding irreducible tensor bases of the rotation group. A&lt;br/&gt;method is developed to generate irreducible tensor bases for a&lt;br/&gt;given tensor space. The method delivers representation formulas&lt;br/&gt;at once applicable to all texture and crystal symmetries. &lt;br/&gt;Specific instances important for applications in&lt;br/&gt;acoustoelasticity and plasticity are fully worked out. Part 2&lt;br/&gt;concerns nondestructive inspection of subsurface residual stress&lt;br/&gt;by ultrasonic measurements. The material body in question is&lt;br/&gt;modeled as a vertically heterogeneous, prestressed, anisotropic&lt;br/&gt;half-space. An extension of the Stroh formalism is developed to&lt;br/&gt;relate the dispersion of the Rayleigh wave to the vertical&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity of stress and/or texture. In Part 3 a&lt;br/&gt;phenomenological theory is developed for the interpretation of&lt;br/&gt;resonance shifts and line shapes in ultrasound resonance&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy of sheet metals. The sheet metal in question is&lt;br/&gt;modeled as a textured, largely elastic material with a small&lt;br/&gt;power-law viscosity. An attempt is made to draw information on&lt;br/&gt;resonance shifts, line shapes, and frequency dependence of&lt;br/&gt;attenuation through analysis of the basic initial-boundary-value&lt;br/&gt;problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The crystal grains that constitute polycrystalline materials&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., wrought and cast metallic alloys) often carry preferred&lt;br/&gt;orientations (or crystallographic texture) that strongly affect&lt;br/&gt;mechanical behavior of the aggregate material (e.g., the&lt;br/&gt;formability of sheet metals). Part 1 of this project delivers&lt;br/&gt;formulas that describe quantitatively how crystallographic&lt;br/&gt;texture affects the behavior of a polycrystalline material in&lt;br/&gt;elastic and plastic deformations. Part 2 arises from the&lt;br/&gt;industrial need for a nondestructive measurement technique that&lt;br/&gt;allows monitoring of the retention of subsurface residual stress&lt;br/&gt;induced by surface conditioning treatments on metal parts for&lt;br/&gt;lifetime enhancement against fatigue failure and stress corrosion&lt;br/&gt;cracking. The availability of such nondestructive technique&lt;br/&gt;also allows emerging surface-enhancement technologies (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;laser-peening, low plasticity burnishing) to be more cost&lt;br/&gt;effective and improves quality control of surface conditioning&lt;br/&gt;processes. Part 3 helps lay the mathematical foundations for the&lt;br/&gt;development of an ultrasonic technique for monitoring of texture&lt;br/&gt;and material microstructures in sheet metals (and hence of their&lt;br/&gt;formability) on the production line.</AbstractNarration>
