    <AbstractNarration>The investigators propose a three-day meeting, the Midwest Conference on Mathematical Methods for Biomedical Images and Biological Surfaces, to be held in the fall semester of 2008 in Michigan State University. This meeting will bring together researchers at different career stages and graduate students, mainly from the Midwestern area who work or are interested in mathematical methods for biomedical images and biological surfaces. With the explosion of new ideas and exciting new challenges in this area, this meeting aims to provide a forum to exchange new ideas and results related to research and equally importantly, to foster the interaction and collaboration between faculties and students in mathematics, engineering and life sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funding will be used principally to support participants. Additional funding will come from Michigan State University. A large portion of the NSF funding will be used to support the participation of graduate students and junior faculty members, particularly those in the under-represented minority groups.</AbstractNarration>
