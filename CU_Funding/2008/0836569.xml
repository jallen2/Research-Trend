    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop an accurate technique for determining the atomic oxygen density in the mid-latitude thermosphere by combining modern instrumentation with state of the art modeling. The method will combine optical and radar measurements to constrain a forward model of a key thermospheric O-atom emission, the twilight airglow at 8446 A, and in turn use the constrained model to develop an [O] estimation scheme suitable for application at other mid-latitude locations. The 8446 A emission has long been considered an ideal candidate for [O] remote sensing owing to its relatively simple emission model, and the project will acquire an unprecedented set of 8446 A spectral data under various observational conditions at two distinct mid-latitude facilities: Millstone Hill (MH) Observatory in Massachusetts and Arecibo Observatory (AO) in Puerto Rico. Additional parameters derived from nested incoherent scatter radar, Fabry-Perot interferometer, and photometer measurements will not only serve as additional forward model constraints, but also help assess the validity of current model assumptions, specifically with regard to the role of secondary sources of 8446 A production. Together with a thorough quantification of model parameter dependencies, the constrained forward model will be used to develop a novel inverse-theoretical technique to estimate thermospheric [O] from measured 8446 A brightness at mid-latitudes. Quantification of neutral atomic oxygen, the dominant constituent in the Earth's thermosphere between 200 - 600 km, is important for several reasons. In this region, its resonant charge exchange with O+, the principle ion in the F-region ionosphere, plays a vital role in both the momentum and energy exchange between the thermosphere and ionosphere. Similarly, its charge exchange with H+ has long been recognized as an important influence on ion transport between the ionosphere and plasmasphere. Owing to this strong chemical coupling, the accuracy of many fundamental aeronomical calculations -- such as the derivation of transport coefficients, neutral wind speeds, energy deposition rates, chemical reaction rates, or photochemical emission brightnesses -- hinges on accurate specification of [O]. Thus, current uncertainties in thermospheric composition and density limit the understanding of the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere system, both with regard to its climatological variability as well as its response to impulsive forcing from above and below. The development of a new, ground-based capability of measuring thermospheric [O] will benefit both of these central priorities of the NSF CEDAR program. One graduate student will be trained in this Aeronomy-related area with support from the project. The student will gain familiarity with acquisition and analysis of ISR spectra as well as that of optical SHS, FPI, and photometer data. Available internal funds for undergraduate research support, together with the strong involvement of AO in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, presents another opportunity to introduce undergraduate students to aeronomy as well.</AbstractNarration>
