    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a device capable of volumetric 3D images providing true 3D measurement of and spatial relationship among the displayed 3D objects, while the multiview 3D images provide photo-quality textured surface properties of the displayed 3D objects. It seamlessly integrates these two 3D display modes into a single 3D display system, the proposed true 3D display technology offers an unprecedented capability never available before: a volumetric 3D display capable of showing both true 3D positions of voxels, as well as various surface properties (occlusion, shining, reflection, shadow, etc) that are essential to many high image quality biomedical image visualization applications. Unique advantages of the proposed true 3D display technology include: 1) Capable of display 3D image in both volumetric and multiview mode simultaneously in single system, for the first time; 2) Preserve 3D spatial voxels and 3D measurement capability while producing photo-quality 3D images with realistic surface properties (shining, shadow, occlusion, etc, 3) High resolution, capable of displaying several hundred million voxels in single 3D image; 4) Offer volumetric mode, multiview mode and simultaneous multiview/volumetric mode in 3D display, suited for various visualization and 3D measurement applications; and 5) No special viewing glasses or any special eyewear is needed to view the 3D images. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful this 3D display technology will have a tremendous impact because it will provide a new level of realism and literally add a new dimension to the dynamic interaction between human and the world around us. The potential market for 3D display systems is large with far reaching applications for medical and military uses.</AbstractNarration>
