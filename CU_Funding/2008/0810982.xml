    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this collaborative proposal is to develop&lt;br/&gt;theoretically based algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers for Hermitian&lt;br/&gt;(and, where possible, non-Hermitian) positive-definite problems. The&lt;br/&gt;team aims to improve understanding of the performance of the family of&lt;br/&gt;AMG algorithms and, with this improved knowledge, to develop AMG&lt;br/&gt;methods that offer provable, computable, a priori information on the&lt;br/&gt;algorithm's performance. The project team represents a close&lt;br/&gt;collaboration of experts in this area, each of whom has made&lt;br/&gt;contributions in the field. Over the past several years, the team has&lt;br/&gt;begun to work collectively on developing new multilevel solvers and&lt;br/&gt;rigorous theoretical results for the convergence and complexity&lt;br/&gt;analysis thereof. Together, the team will have the capability to take&lt;br/&gt;a step toward answering some of the fundamental research questions&lt;br/&gt;associated with these two essential aspects of the analysis and design&lt;br/&gt;of efficient algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We expect the work proposed here to: (1) directly impact computational&lt;br/&gt;simulation codes currently employing multi-level solvers, by providing&lt;br/&gt;faster and more reliable computational tools for the numerical&lt;br/&gt;computations at the core of physical simulations; and (2) allow for&lt;br/&gt;simulation of phenomena for which suitable solvers are currently&lt;br/&gt;unavailable. The results from the proposed research will, thus, have&lt;br/&gt;a direct impact on scientific and engineering problems, including&lt;br/&gt;those from energy, through both the simulation of particle physics and&lt;br/&gt;processing of data from oil reservoir models, biophysics, in surgical&lt;br/&gt;simulation, and the environment, in climate prediction and contaminant&lt;br/&gt;remediation models. The algorithms to be investigated here are&lt;br/&gt;already in use in many of these fields, but are often considered to be&lt;br/&gt;"expert-only" tools. The goal of this proposal is to develop more&lt;br/&gt;reliable and robust versions of these tools. The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will have a strong educational impact as well, as it provides for a&lt;br/&gt;solid base for training of graduate students in the modern theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and practical aspects of numerical methods for modeling of&lt;br/&gt;applications arising in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
