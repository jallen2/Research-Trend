    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the proposed research program is to study the interaction between laser beams and a collection of ultra-cold atoms. The mutual interaction leads to a "self organization" of the atoms, where they assemble into nanometer-scale structures. These structures, in turn, enhance the interaction between the laser beams and atoms, leading to dramatically increased nonlinear optical interaction strengths. This work is providing new theoretical and experimental understanding of light-matter interactions on the quantum scale and is leading to new methods for storing and processing quantum information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is improving the sensitivity of nonlinear optical devices, resulting in devices that are smaller and more energy efficient. Two graduate students are being trained in an interdisciplinary environment and in the enabling field of optical physics and photonics. The Duke researchers are collaborating with the atomic physics and laser group at the Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Brazil, which give an international exposure to the students. The Principal Investigator is undertaking outreach in the local area elementary and middle schools to help attract more people to the science disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
