    <AbstractNarration>Geology (42) This project introduces Mesa Community College and other Maricopa County Community College District students enrolled in geology, physical geography, and archaeology courses to basic field research on rock art. Rock art, prehistoric rock engravings (petroglyphs) and rock paintings (pictographs) common in the American West, is being degraded as a result of anthropogenic activities and natural processes. The curriculum modules being developed take advantage of the students' interest in their cultural heritage and use the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI) to help them link their knowledge of rock types and weathering characteristics to the preservation of the rock art. As the students learn about weathering processes, they are generating data that contribute to the preservation of the rock art. These data are being shared with cultural resource managers and may lead to new and improved rock art preservation techniques. The evaluation of the modules is contributing to advancing the understanding of how "place-based" and meaningful research attracts and retains underrepresented students in STEM disciplines. K-12 teachers are becoming familiar with the modules through workshops offered by the Arizona Geographic Alliance.</AbstractNarration>
