    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Matthew Covington is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Missouri - Columbia. Dr. Covington will augment computer models for karstic aquifers that relate the geometry of the conduit to recharge and discharge. These models will be tested against natural systems, Devli's Icebox and Maramec Springs, in Missouri. Monitoring stations for water level and temperature will be placed in the main recharge and discharge areas of these two aquifers; these three parameters will be entered into the computer models to draw conclusions about the geometry of the conduit. The results from this investigation will provide information on the geometry of the conduit network in karstic aquifer systems, a factor of critical importance when managing water resources for significant number of the population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Dr. Covington will establish an outreach program to local high schools to share with students his experiences and anecdotes while exploring caves for recreational and scientific purposes. Dr. Covington will also teach an introductory level Geology class.</AbstractNarration>
