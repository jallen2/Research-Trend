    <AbstractNarration>In the Information Age, processing and representation of multidimensional data has gained critical importance. The goal of this project is to train students at Northern New Mexico College in effective use of the power of parallel computing in processing and visual representation of large volumes of data. The High Performance Cluster of computers will be used for both and research and educational projects. At least, ten of the faculty at the College will actively use the cluster for research. The PI will model the nanotechnology of semiconducting materials like gallium arsenide and its applications to solar devices. Dr. David Torres, Co-Principal Investigator, will conduct simulations of incompressible fluid flow and surface tension. Surface tension is important in many industrial settings, including casting, fuel injection sprays and inkjet printers. Dr. Cathy Berryhill and Mr. Jean Constant will team up with the PI to conduct research on scientific visualization, including the study of novel ways of displaying information and the effective use of visualization software in the classroom. Dr. Claudia Aprea will use the cluster for research in Earth and Planetary Science and Environmental Science, including work on mapping the subsurface of Mars, on creating a 3-dimensional geophysical model database for the state of New Mexico, and on the mapping the surface of the Earth for scientific or prospecting purposes. Research areas of interest to other faculty include a database of local pollen counts, the design of feedback control systems, the performance of solar photovoltaic systems, and the reliability of computer storage systems. The project will facilitate research, teaching and outreach activities at the host institution.</AbstractNarration>
