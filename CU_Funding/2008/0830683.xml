    <AbstractNarration>Complex networks, including communication, economic and social networks,&lt;br/&gt;have long been studied due to their fundamental technological, &lt;br/&gt;financial and societal significance. Over the last ten years, the dramatic&lt;br/&gt;growth of the Internet, the WWW and their applications,&lt;br/&gt;has intensified the study of complex networks more than ever.&lt;br/&gt;This work isolates parameters, including semantics and incentives,&lt;br/&gt;that differentiate the structure and function of distinct applications. &lt;br/&gt;This work also develops models capturing features of&lt;br/&gt;dynamic and evolving networks, such as online communities.&lt;br/&gt;Otbaining accurate models for complex networks is of fundamental &lt;br/&gt;significance in simulation, prediction and information retrieval.&lt;br/&gt;All the above enhance performance and range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first generation of models for complex networks involved topologies&lt;br/&gt;with skewed statistics and the small world phenomenon. However, in several&lt;br/&gt;applications, these features are not adequate. This work develops &lt;br/&gt;"flexible models" which generate graphs with a wide variety of further &lt;br/&gt;characteristics. In particular, the work develops: &lt;br/&gt;(a) Topologies with very low assortativity, such as the ones observed&lt;br/&gt;in routing and biological networks. This is accomplished by an extension&lt;br/&gt;of the classical Erdos-Gallai and Havel-Hakimi graph algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;(b) Networks whose nodes and links capture semantics. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;nodes are associated with vectors (one dimension for each relevant attribute),&lt;br/&gt;and links are added with probabilities proportional to some vector &lt;br/&gt;similarity function (such as the inner product). This is a vast generalization&lt;br/&gt;of classical Erdos-Renyi random graphs.&lt;br/&gt;(c) Networks formed by selfish agents, which evolve according to &lt;br/&gt;incentive-based dynamics. The work also develops algorithms which exploit &lt;br/&gt;the special features and structure of the network.</AbstractNarration>
