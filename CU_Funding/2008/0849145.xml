    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the Foundations of Molecular Modeling and Simulation (FOMMS) 2009 conference to be held in Blaine, Washington July 12 ? 16, 2009. The conference will promote the applications and development of computational quantum methods, molecular science, and engineering simulation. The funds will be used to support participant costs for the meeting, facilitating attendance by young researchers, including junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students, as well as under-represented minorities. The conference features an outstanding and diverse slate of 19 renowned innovators in and practitioners of molecular modeling and simulation from the US, Europe, and Japan who have accepted invitations to present plenary talks over the 4.5 day conference. Additionally, workshops on the development of open source molecular simulation code and on the use of molecular simulation modules in the classroom, and a tutorial and related plenary session on multicore and graphics processor chips for molecular-based simulation, are new highlights of FOMMS 2009. &lt;br/&gt;The FOMMS 2009 conference will broadly impact researchers and students who develop or use molecular-based modeling and simulation tools in academia and industry. The conference format and venue provide ample time and opportunity for interaction among participants, cross-fertilization of disciplines, and mentoring of young researchers.</AbstractNarration>
