    <AbstractNarration>The East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD) 2008 is a one-day session held at Shepherd University on May 10, 2008. The conference is endorsed by ACM SIGSAM and SIAM and includes four invited speakers, more than one dozen poster presentations and software demonstrations. There are more than 80 participants, from a region roughly bounded by New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Texas and Ohio. A moderated panel discussion on hybrid numeric-symbolic computing is included. A pre-conference tutorial workshop on using computer algebra systems in K-12 classroom is held on May 9, 2008, which is aimed at high school teachers seeking to bring technology into their classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference aims at dissemination and discussion of research in the area of Computer Algebra systems. Modern day problems require sophisticated computer algebra systems that can efficiently emulate numerical and symbolic calculations with a high accuracy and speed. The need for such systems is motivated by the desire to solve mathematical models which provide an accurate representation of real life systems, the solution of which predicts their behavior in a simulated environment. The conference stimulates interest in the technical aspects of computer algebra, including Algebraic Algorithms, Hybrid Symbolic-Numeric Computation, and Computer Algebra Applications in Engineering, Economics and Education area.</AbstractNarration>
