    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: CCR-0133956&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: A Two-Tier Approach for the Analysis and Evolution of High-Integrity &lt;br/&gt;Software Product Lines&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gerald C. Gannod&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the research component of this project is to develop software &lt;br/&gt;architecture analysis and software reverse engineering techniques that support &lt;br/&gt;the evolution of existing software into software product lines with an emphasis &lt;br/&gt;on high-integrity systems. To this end, this research will first involve the &lt;br/&gt;development of an approach for analyzing software from both the architecture and &lt;br/&gt;component views in order to support assessment along different quality attribute &lt;br/&gt;dimensions. The approach will consist of models for static and dynamic analysis &lt;br/&gt;as well as simulation to determine level of compliance with quality attribute &lt;br/&gt;constraints. Second, this research will involve the development of a methodology &lt;br/&gt;for modifying and evolving software at both the architecture and component levels &lt;br/&gt;in order to ensure compliance with different quality attribute constraints and &lt;br/&gt;goals. For the software architecture community, this research will address a &lt;br/&gt;need for analysis approaches that allow software architects to assess the extent &lt;br/&gt;to which a software architecture meets various quality concerns. In addition, &lt;br/&gt;the results of this research will facilitate the long-term evolution of a software &lt;br/&gt;architecture based on long-term product-line goals. For the software reverse &lt;br/&gt;engineering and maintenance community, this research addresses the need for &lt;br/&gt;approaches that allow a software maintainer to determine the extent of the &lt;br/&gt;support for various quality attributes by individual components and provides &lt;br/&gt;a technique that facilitates component modification in order to ensure compliance &lt;br/&gt;to quality constraints.</AbstractNarration>
