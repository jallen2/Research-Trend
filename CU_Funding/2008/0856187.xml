    <AbstractNarration>TITLE: A Mechanically Based Polymer Microfiber Approach to Probe Mechanotransduction in Calcium Response of Stem Cells &lt;br/&gt;PI: Philip LeDuc, Carnegie Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to probe the response of living cells to mechanical stimulation is directly tied to material-based technology. There is though no one unique technology, which can imitate the physiological environment perfectly. It has also been suggested that optimal tissue recovery is vitally related to the mechanics of cells and that essential understanding can be achieved through building new materials based technology. Furthermore, stem cells have been used in therapy for mechanics based systems such as in cardiac disease, but the mechanisms of the associated recovery process are debated. This project will develop a material-based approach to investigate the biomechanics of stem cells and associated live-cell calcium response. This project will have important results in areas including mechanics of materials, imaging, and cell mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be transformative through providing future researchers with the ability to optimize mechanical stimulation for stem cell therapy, which may ultimately contribute to successes in medical applications including cardiac therapies and tissue engineering that could potentially save and make better millions of lives. The project also will build an education and training pipeline for preparing future leaders in engineering and science. This will be accomplished through work with K-12 students, undergraduates, and graduate students. These efforts will include one of the most academically challenged public schools in Pennsylvania, whose minority population is greater than 95%. This work will also be integrated with the Sloan Foundation Minority PhD program in continuing to build diversity efforts.</AbstractNarration>
