    <AbstractNarration>Workshop: Issues in Teaching Computational Linguistics,at the ACL:HLT 2008 Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Association for Computational Linguistics&lt;br/&gt;(ACL) is the primary international organization in the field of&lt;br/&gt;natural language processing and language engineering.&lt;br/&gt;The ACL's annual conference is the major international meeting in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support subsidizes travel,conference, and housing expenses of researchers selected&lt;br/&gt;to participate in The Third Workshop on Issues in Teaching&lt;br/&gt;Computational Linguistics, held during the joint ACL on 19th to 20th June&lt;br/&gt;2008 in Columbus, Ohio. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary challenge addressed in this workshop is that of working&lt;br/&gt;out what is necessary in order for computational linguists to&lt;br/&gt;communicate and collaborate effectively across disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;boundaries, and then to articulate principles for the design of&lt;br/&gt;curricular materials and pedagogical strategies for fostering this&lt;br/&gt;collaboration in the classroom. Participants will discuss these&lt;br/&gt;issues at the workshop, and carry the results back to their home&lt;br/&gt;instititutions for practical validation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a&lt;br/&gt;community of scholarship about teaching in Computational Linguistics&lt;br/&gt;and Natural Language Processing. The panel sessions and paper&lt;br/&gt;presentations are designed, in part, to disseminate experiences about&lt;br/&gt;the strategy and tactics of teaching to the audience that will be most&lt;br/&gt;able to use them, in part, to elicit suggestions from industrial,&lt;br/&gt;government and academic employers about the unmet needs they perceive&lt;br/&gt;for training and education.</AbstractNarration>
