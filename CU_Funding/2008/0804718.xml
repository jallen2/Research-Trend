    <AbstractNarration>In this exploratory research project the PI and his collaborators propose to fabricate and test the proof-of-concept of a novel carbon nanotube-based biosensor. The detection of biomolecules and biological agents represents a critical aspect of environmental sampling for pollutants and contaminants and also in pharmaceutical quality control monitoring, forensic analysis, and clinical diagnosis. Conventional biosensors currently in use, include plaque assays, immunological assays (ELISA-based), chemically sensitive field-effect transistors, and PCR-based testing of nucleic acids. In this exploratory research proposal, the PI will develop a prototype of a new, ultrasensitive multiplex carbon nanotube (CNT) biosensor (termed, nanobiosensor) that will incorporate electrochemical detection, thereby affording high sensitivity and compatibility for miniaturization. The proposed nanobiosensor relies on a highly novel nanocoaxial architecture, recently developed by several members of the research team, which is believed will afford a dramatic improvement over conventional and CNT-based sensors by providing: 1) real-time; 2) multiplexing; 3) miniaturization; and 4) high sensitivity and selectivity. There are three key objectives during the funding period: I. Complete the fabrication of a functional nanocoaxial sensor platform. II. Optimize the parameters involved in the immobilization of antibodies to the inner CNT structure, which will serve as the biorecognition molecule. III. Evaluate the amperometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and broadband dielectric spectroscopy for detection following capture of the target antigen by the biorecognition antibody. The proposed project will significantly advance small sample (approaching and including single molecule) biomolecule detection for use in pathogen, virus, disease and bioterror targets, with specificity. The proposed research will also integrate research and promote student training in biochemistry and physics at several levels, including undergraduate and graduate. This interdisciplinary, research will bring together elements of biochemistry, molecular biology, and condensed matter and material physics (in the form of carbon nanotube design and fabrication) and in doing so will promote research and learning in forefront integrated science areas that will greatly benefit its student participants as well as advance biosensing technology. The results of this research will be communicated in the form of published papers and posters/talks at conferences. The experimental design is collaborative, bringing together faculty and graduate students from the Physics and Biology Departments. The applicants are firmly committed to science education, having mentored dozens of high school students and biology and physics undergraduates, a large number of whom have gone on to graduate programs. The PI currently serves as a mentor for the Beckman Scholars undergraduate research program at Boston College and has a long standing record of providing research opportunities to underrepresented minorities, having served as a mentor for the McNair Scholar program and as a National Minority Medical Fellows Mentor. The co-PIs have longstanding policies of including high school students and undergrads in their laboratories for summer internships and academic research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
