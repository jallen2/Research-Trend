    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator's proposed research has three parts. The first &lt;br/&gt;constructs representations using tools from topology and symplectic &lt;br/&gt;geometry, especially the theory of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson, and &lt;br/&gt;extends those tools to larger classes of varieties. The second tackles &lt;br/&gt;algebraic and combinatorial projects that solve problems in the geometry &lt;br/&gt;of the associated varieties. This subject is often called modern Schubert &lt;br/&gt;calculus; specific projects include determining multiplication formulas &lt;br/&gt;inside the cohomology ring of flag varieties and Grassmannians. The third &lt;br/&gt;focuses on computational and enumerative geometric properties of &lt;br/&gt;varieties, such as Hessenberg varieties, that arise in areas of &lt;br/&gt;representation theory including the Langlands program. The projects will &lt;br/&gt;identify fundamental geometric properties of the varieties, like &lt;br/&gt;pure-dimensionality, that are critical to advances in representation &lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric representation theory builds algebraic structures called &lt;br/&gt;representations from geometric objects. This leads to deep insights &lt;br/&gt;connecting different mathematical disciplines, including algebra, &lt;br/&gt;geometry, combinatorics, and mathematical physics. Crucially, a geometric &lt;br/&gt;representation establishes a table of correspondences between geometry and &lt;br/&gt;algebra. On one hand, the table answers questions in representation &lt;br/&gt;theory via geometry; on the other, it answers questions in geometry using &lt;br/&gt;algebra and combinatorics. The proposal includes projects to foster &lt;br/&gt;student development at all levels and to provide mentoring for women and &lt;br/&gt;other underrepresented minorities in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
