    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site is focused on cognitive communications at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and hosts 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks for 3 years. The site recruits, trains, and retains undergraduate students to research by supporting them in the following ways:&lt;br/&gt;? Prepares them to think creatively and independently;&lt;br/&gt;? Motivates them to pursue graduate studies;&lt;br/&gt;? Helps them to develop general research skills in an interdisciplinary context;&lt;br/&gt;? Allows them to gain hands-on experience in cognitive radios, wireless networking, and their applications;&lt;br/&gt;? Promotes a sense of confidence, team spirit, and an appreciation of the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration in creating new knowledge;&lt;br/&gt;? Exposes them to the intellectual excitement involved in research activities; and&lt;br/&gt;? Teaches them to effectively assimilate latest research, assess their own knowledge, present experimental results, effectively prepare reports and publications, and understand the methods for translating ?research to practice (R2P).?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Cognitive communications is an area of high interest to researchers in wireless communications. The mentors in the project have a strong background in this area and are well suited to carry out the projects with the students. The site has access to a high quality test bed for student experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project recruits a high percentage of the students from underrepresented groups in computing. They especially focus upon minority serving institutions without large research programs.</AbstractNarration>
