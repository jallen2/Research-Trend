    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: A Computational Investigation into Biological Motion Perception&lt;br/&gt;Hongjing Lu, Principal Investigator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In everyday activities ranging from running in a proper trajectory to avoid hitting other pedestrians, recognizing a friend based upon his walking style from a far distance, to practicing boxing with a partner in the gym, action perception plays a critical role in interpreting the intentions of other people and interacting with the world. Despite the importance of action perception, there are major gaps in our understanding of three basic computational issues: (1) how efficiently human observers can process visual information to make action identifications in different contexts; (2) how humans learn and represent action categories, such as walking, boxing, and dancing; and (3) how humans acquire the ability to understand social interactions by bridging perception and reasoning. With the support of an NSF CAREER award, Dr. Hongjing Lu will integrate computer modeling approaches with behavioral experiments to answer the above three questions. This research will develop greater understanding of how visual information is used to achieve apparently effortless recognition of human actions at different processing levels. The work will significantly extend conventional computational approaches in order to render them applicable to the study of visual processes more complex than those to which they have previously been applied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the computational basis of action perception is essential to achieving a scientific account of our ability to understand the external world and to conduct social interactions. Furthermore, understanding how the human visual system perceives actions will guide development of artificial vision systems to recognize and interpret complex biological movements. This research will improve a range of applications, including action visualization (e.g., deciding what visual information is important or could be ignored in 3D animation), security surveillance systems (e.g., detection and recognition of suspicious actions in airports or train stations), robotics (e.g., the ability of machines to interact effectively with people), blind assistance system and driver assistance systems (e.g., blind spot detection systems for drivers when backing the car). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the integration of research and education activities in the project will provide students with training opportunities in interdisciplinary research, encompassing psychology, statistics, computer science and mathematics. A new Ph.D. Major in Computational Cognition will be established in the Psychology Department at UCLA. Mathematical training will be promoted at both the graduate and undergraduate levels in Psychology; at the same time, training in experimental research will be introduced to students with mathematical and computer science backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
