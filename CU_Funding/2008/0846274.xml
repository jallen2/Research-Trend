    <AbstractNarration>0846274&lt;br/&gt;Kokkoli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Aptamers are short single-stranded oligonucleotides. They are chemically produced, have the capability of binding with high affinity and specificity a variety of different targets, and have been shown to be useful as therapeutic agents and diagnostic tools. Their affinities are often comparable to those observed for monoclonal antibodies, and are significantly higher compared to those of peptides. As aptamer-amphiphiles, aptamers attached to a hydrophobic tail, they can assemble with other amphiphilic molecules into a variety of different structures. Their assembly with lipids to form aptamer-functionalized liposomes will be desirable in biotechnological applications, such as, targeted drug delivery. The PI proposes to study aptamers as aptamer-amphiphiles and, in particular, aptamer sequences that bind fractalkine (an adhesion molecule expressed only at sites of infection or inflammation, such as cancer), and hypothesizes that the orientation of the aptamer headgroup, and the use of a spacer between the hydrophobic tail and the headgroup, will affect the assembly behavior of the molecule, and the secondary structure of the aptamer, thus subsequently affecting its binding affinity for its target. To test this hypothesis the following research tasks have been set: In Research Task 1, the goal is to test the biological affinity of the designed aptamer-amphiphiles, free in solution, and incorporated in liposomes, thus evaluating which designs bind to fractalkine. The PI will characterize the aptamer-amphiphiles in Research Task 2 with different techniques (CD, melting curves, cryo-TEM, SAXS, and SANS) that will evaluate the secondary structure of the aptamer, and assembly behavior of the amphiphiles. These results will enable a connection between the biological function of aptamer-amphiphiles with their structure and corresponding phase behavior. This research will advance knowledge and understanding as it will not only furnish favorable amphiphilic properties (headgroup orientation, spacer design, secondary structure, assembly behavior) for the design of aptamer-amphiphiles, but will provide a fundamental understanding of why these properties are beneficial. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: -Technical Impact. The PI proposes the design and characterization of a novel tool, "aptamer-amphiphiles", based on the expectation that by changing their structural segments one can control their morphology, surface chemistry, and function. A comprehensive characterization of secondary structure, amphiphilic and self-assembly properties, and the link between these properties and the engineering of targeted delivery vehicles is proposed here for the first time. The research activities represent transformative research as they may lead to the genesis of a new field of research on "aptamer-amphiphiles" (a new term in the literature) that will merge rational amphiphile design principles, chemistry, biology, and engineering in order to provide advanced systems for targeted drug delivery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Societal / Educational Impact. Fractalkine is an attractive new target for the development of anti-angiogenesis and anti-cancer agents. By choosing aptamers that bind to fractalkine as the model system, the proposed work outlines a logical approach that can be applied to the future design of aptamer-amphiphiles that can functionalize nanoparticles and increase the particle's specificity and affinity for fractalkine, thus having great therapeutic potential and significantly benefiting society. &lt;br/&gt;The educational plan is strongly integrated with the research plan. The PI is collaborating with "DragonflyTV" (a science series that presents middle school students doing real science, supported by NSF and produced by Twin Cities Public Television (TPT), and seen on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations nationwide) with the goal of enhancing scientific and technological understanding among children and adults. Furthermore, the PI has participated, and continue to participate, in outreach activities organized by TPT with the goal of attracting women in sciences and engineering (a long term goal for the PI), and is currently collaborating, and will continue to do so in the future, with MRSEC. Through MRSEC the PI will be hosting during the summer high school teachers, and minority undergraduates from a nationwide pool of applicants, through a well established network of high schools, and minority undergraduates from a number of Minority Serving Institutions.</AbstractNarration>
