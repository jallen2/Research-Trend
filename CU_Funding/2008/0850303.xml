    <AbstractNarration>This S-STEM scholars program is a partnership between the Tarrant County College District (TCCD) and the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). This project provides scholarships to financially needy, academically talented students who have completed basic math and science requirements at TCCD and are transferring into the physics or chemistry programs at UTA. A feature of this project is that scholarship recipients are given the opportunity to participate in ongoing research projects where they will receive mentoring from the faculty and graduate students conducting the research. The faculty and graduate student mentors are given training in mentoring with an emphasis on mentoring students from underrepresented groups. The project builds on the success of prior NSF funded scholarship programs and leverages the existing partnership between TCCD and UTA. There is a comprehensive project management team that includes faculty and administrators from both TCCD and UTA. The project includes a formal evaluation plan with both formative and summative components.</AbstractNarration>
