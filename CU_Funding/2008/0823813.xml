    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate the influence of 3-D magnetic layer geometry on the performance of magneto-electronic devices. Most magnetic nano-structures today are ultrathin or nanostructured films and multilayers. The key challenge for the future will be a suitable technology to integrate and to contact nanostructures in a reliable manner. Real devices are truly 3-dimensional structures, particularly where the roughness and shape of the contact lines influences a performance to such an extent that they modify the mechanism of operation. The topography must absolutely be taken into consideration during the design phase. This move towards non-flat device structures requires advanced fabrication, testing, and modeling in realistic 3-D geometries. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in its potential impact: this research has the potential to overcome the limits of CMOS performance, power dissipation and scaling, and open a new approach to electronic circuitry with faster switching time and lower power consumption. This new magneto-electronics could be the next level of performance for electronic components in the near future. Since this project brings together several sophisticated and forefront interdisciplinary techniques and concepts, it provides a rich environment for training and education of students in nano-fabrication, theoretical modeling, and modern characterization and visualization techniques. The project will have a broader impact on curriculum development, involvement of underrepresented groups, infrastructure enhancement, and broad outreach to grades K-12 (Chicago inner-city high-schools and the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy) at a level of sophistication currently beyond the reach of many inner-city schools.</AbstractNarration>
