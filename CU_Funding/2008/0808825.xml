    <AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Guy Bertrand of the Chemistry Department at the University of California - Riverside, will study four different classes of compounds, the isolation of which have been impeded by the belief that they are inherently unstable, or have eluded the synthetic skills of investigators. They are non-heteroatom substituted cyclopropenylidenes (hydrocarbon carbenes) and their dimers (triafulvalenes), larger ring size carbocycliccarbenes that benefit from aromaticity, and bent-allenes. These species have not only been chosen because they represent exciting synthetic challenges but more importantly because they should feature interesting electronic and steric properties, which can lead to important applications, especially as ligands for transition metal catalysts. Over the years the success of homogeneous catalysis can be attributed largely to the development of a diverse range of ligand frameworks that have been used to tune the behavior of the various systems. The ultimate goal of this effort is to provide the catalytic community with new, readily available ligands, which will allow for the development of truly practical catalysts that will find application in both academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this project is at the interface between physical, organic and organometallic chemistry and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels. It is of paramount importance for the future to find catalysts able to transform abundant and cheap molecules into useful compounds ranging from bulk chemicals to therapeutics. The University of California- Riverside, classified as a minority serving institution, is well positioned to provide the highest quality educational experience for students underrepresented in science. Because of this fact, a diverse group of students will be involved in the project. This research will also promote collaborative research and the exchange of undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral fellows between UC Riverside and several French universities.</AbstractNarration>
