    <AbstractNarration>This award will support participation of 13 representatives from the U.S. Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Reserves network in the 3rd World Congress of Biosphere Reserves on February 4-9, 2008 in Madrid, Spain. Participants will assist in evaluating implementation of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve program and will help elaborate an Action Plan for the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, which include 47 Biosphere Reserves in the U.S. The US has not been an official participant in the MAB Biosphere Reserves activities for over two decades. Participation will allow existing and prospective U.S. MAB Reserves to reconnect with the World Network. Many existing and possible future Reserves are affiliated with networks such as the U.S. Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network and the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS). U.S. participation should enhance linkages among activities at MAB Reserves and these existing networks. U.S. representatives are affiliated with U.S. MAB Biosphere Reserves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. participants will cultivate capacity building opportunities and address topics including: 1) promotion of collaboration among ecological researchers and research networks; 2) increased promotion of research, education and outreach; 3) enhanced comparability, exchange, and preservation of ecological data from sites around the world; 3) development of best ecosystem management practices; 4) education of the next generation of scientists, and; 5) development of strategies for addressing trans-boundary issues (e.g. migratory species, sustainable development, stewardship and management of genetic resources). A report to the NSF and the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO describing partnership opportunities identified during the Congress will be produced.</AbstractNarration>
