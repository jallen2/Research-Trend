    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to connect Americans with international collaborators in engineering education research by recommending research areas most likely to benefit from American-international collaboration and by hosting a workshop to facilitate this interaction. Within traditional engineering research areas, international collaborations have developed around specific topics but, since engineering education research is a relatively new area, international collaborations have not yet developed. The project team is analyzing conference publications to identify specific engineering education research areas that would benefit from strong intellectual collaboration and partnerships between researchers in the U.S. and one other nation or region. The two or three areas are being selected through a comparative publication analysis, and this analysis also is being used to identify one international location with complementary research strengths for the 2-day international workshop. The project is providing support for nine American researchers to travel to the international location. A small initial advisory board is reviewing the publication analysis results to recommend the workshop topics and research experts; then a different, content expert advisory board is planning specific aspects of the workshop including agenda, invitees, assessment, and dissemination. Evaluation efforts are using participant surveys at the end of the workshop and long term tracking of co-authorship and proposal patterns. Results are being disseminated by a publication in the Journal of Engineering Education describing the comparative document analysis and through the American-international collaborations around specific engineering education research areas leading to joint publications and proposals. Broader impacts include the resulting international collaborations, dissemination of the results through publications, and specific efforts to involve individuals from underrepresented groups on the advisory board.</AbstractNarration>
