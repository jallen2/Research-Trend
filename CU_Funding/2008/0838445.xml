    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT: The 2008 KUMUNU conference will be held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, September 20--21. KUMUNU is an annual weekend conference anchored by the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri- Columbia (MU) and Nebraska-Lincoln (NU), promoting interaction among researchers, post docs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines (such as algebraic geometry, K-theory and coding theory) at regional schools (which in 2007 included 16 different institutions). Although the KUMUNU triad has significant strength in these areas, geographic separation raises a hurdle to taking the most advantage of this strength. Fortunately, the distances are small enough that regional participants can fairly inexpensively gather at a central location for a weekend conference. The goal of the KUMUNU conference series is to provide a cost-effective annual venue for regional researchers at various stages of their careers, including graduate students, recent PhD's and faculty at nonPhD granting institutions, to interact with each other and with experienced researchers based at KU, MU, NU and a limited number of invited experts from outside the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel and lodging support to facilitate participation, especially for graduate students, is a key element for KUMUNU to achieve its main goals. These include: playing a strong regional mentoring role at all levels by showcasing the research of post docs and young faculty and by helping recent Ph.D.s and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines enrich their research programs by meeting senior researchers based at KU, MU, NU and elsewhere; and promoting research in commutative algebra by providing a venue for discussion of the latest developments in the field, for exchanging ideas and for setting the basis for future research collaborations. The conference design also furthers these goals: KUMUNU comprises 6 or 7 plenary talks accessible to graduate students by speakers representing a geographically diverse mix of senior researchers, young faculty and post docs, with plenty of time reserved outside of talks for additional interaction. The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus also encourage participants to establish productive collaborative relationships. In addition to the stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of the students and early career participants, participants from nonPhD granting institutions will take ideas from the conference back to their colleagues and students, stimulating further research and mathematical enrichment at their home institutions.</AbstractNarration>
