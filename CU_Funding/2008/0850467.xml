    <AbstractNarration>Chemical components delivered to the surface ocean through atmospheric deposition influence ocean productivity and ecosystem structure thus are tightly related to the global carbon cycle and climate. Accordingly, the major aim of this project is to quantitatively estimate the variable impact of aerosols on marine phytoplankton and to determine the specific effects on various taxa. Such data could in the future be used to better understand the global impact of aerosols on the oceanic ecosystem. To accomplish this goal the PI will monitor aerosol dry deposition fluxes, determine aerosol sources, obtain the chemical composition and solubility of aerosols, and evaluate the contribution of aerosols to nutrient and trace metal budgets of seawater at two oceanographically different sites (Bermuda and Monterey Bay) representing open ocean and coastal setting. The effects of the different aerosol "types" (defined by source and chemical characteristics) on specific phytoplankton taxa will also be evaluated using pure culture and natural samples bioassays. This project is particularly important in light of the role atmospheric deposition can resume in oligotrophic and coastal settings and the predicted future global conditions of increased aridity and urbanization and associated changes in dust fluxes and composition.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;In addition to achieving research aims and graduate student education, this project will provide several distinct and complementary opportunities to inform and train individuals across the educational spectrum. The educational component of this project includes substantial contribution to undergraduate education with emphasis on hands-on inquiry-based experience through classes and direct involvement and participation in the project. To disseminate the role of aerosols in our environment to the general public and particularly to middle school and high school students over the next 3 years, the PI will design, develop, implement, and evaluate a hands-on inquiry-based educational "Aerosol Monitoring Program". This interdisciplinary course material and methodology will be compiled and disseminated broadly, so it could be applied in other environmental and science education programs. In addition, the PI will teach the COSEE (LHL) developed Communicating Ocean Science course and is participating as a featured scientist in the NSF funded "Kids' Science Challenge" a nationwide program to promote science inquiry (http://www.pulseplanet.com/planetkids/). The PI will expose high school and underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students to the process of scientific inquiry through existing outreach activities at the University of California Santa Cruz (AGEP, SURF, UC LEADS, STEPS). All efforts will be made to include women and underrepresented groups in the project.</AbstractNarration>
