    <AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Carla M. Sinopoli, Elizabeth Bridges will conduct archaeological survey at and analyze data from Keladi and Ikkeri, regional capitals of the Vijayanagara Empire of medieval South Asia (ca. 1330s-17th c. C.E.). These sites are located in what is today the state of Karnataka in southern India; they were occupied as sequent capitals of a regional polity which ruled under an imperial charter starting in 1499 C.E. Bridges' research focuses on the systematic survey and documentation of archaeological remains visible on surface today. Such finds include: temples, military fortifications, structural remains of unknown function, carved stones, pre-industrial processing areas, artifact concentrations, and water management and agricultural features. These locations within what were larger urban and suburban contexts in the Medieval Period are documented using GPS, photos, hand drawn maps, and written descriptions. Artifacts, such as pottery (local earthenwares and imported porcelains and glazewares), ground stone, metal objects, and coins, will be collected for analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research focusing on imperial regional capitals of the pre-modern era is important because it contributes toward our understandings of how these large, expansionist states emerged, grew, functioned, and collapsed. Many studies of imperial states have focused on core capital regions at the cost of developing perspectives on the outlying areas which underwrote the centralized prosperity for which most well-known empires are recognized. This project contributes to the study of imperial dynamics through documenting settlements at two regional centers which operated under the central imperial authority. Documenting the presence, location, and variability of features and artifacts that represent political, military, economic and social activities at these sites will allow comparisons between the regional settlements themselves, and between the regional settlements and the imperial capital thus allowing for examination of change over time as well as the nature of the relationship between empire and regional authorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond contributing to social science research questions, this project will have a broader impact by enhancing the understanding of the science of archaeology in India, through both public outreach and work within the academic community of South Asia and beyond. In the local environs surrounding Keladi and Ikkeri, public awareness of the cultural significance of monuments as well as smaller sites has been and continues to be accomplished through face to face interaction, open meetings, and the sharing of reports and publications with village assemblies. This project is also coordinated with the Keladi Museum and Research Bureau of Kuvempu University, Shimoga District, which curates exhibitions and assists in the sharing of research between scholars in different disciplines. In addition to anticipated contributions to refereed journals and professional publications in North America and Europe, the author will make available results to the scientific community in South Asia. Furthermore, the author has trained and will continue to work with student and professional archaeologist volunteers in field methods of the North American scientific tradition.</AbstractNarration>
