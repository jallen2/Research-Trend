    <AbstractNarration>This project the University of North Texas (UNT) Department of&lt;br/&gt;Anthropology is a continuation of funding for an existing program providing quality research experience&lt;br/&gt;for undergraduates (REU). The current project will represent an opportunity not only to&lt;br/&gt;continue the existing program through 2012, but to utilize ongoing program evaluations and outcome&lt;br/&gt;monitoring to more finely hone the program as developed, assess its outcomes over a longer term, and&lt;br/&gt;disseminate the results.&lt;br/&gt;Objectives. 1) To expose under-represented minority and first-generation undergraduate students to&lt;br/&gt;research methods in cultural anthropology; 2) To prepare students for competitive application to McNair&lt;br/&gt;Scholars Programs or similar mentoring programs on their home campuses; 3) To foster undergraduate interest&lt;br/&gt;in research and to increase their ability to pursue grant opportunities and graduate study, all with the aim of&lt;br/&gt;developing their academic career goals; 4) To apply insights gained from previous years of systematic program&lt;br/&gt;evaluation to continue refining the program; 5) To use systematic methods to evaluate the program?s long-term&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness in terms of both its impact on undergraduate research activity and its contribution to quality&lt;br/&gt;social science research; 6) To publish the results of the analyses described in Objective 5.&lt;br/&gt;Activities and Students to be Recruited. Since 2000, UNT has been funded by NSF to provide intensive,&lt;br/&gt;quality research mentoring to minority and/or first-generation (for whom neither parent went to college)&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates, particularly those coming from junior and community colleges. This has been accomplished&lt;br/&gt;through intensive, 10 week programs each summer, with the first five weeks instructing fundamental cultural&lt;br/&gt;anthropology research techniques, and the second five weeks offering individualized research experiences. In&lt;br/&gt;the current proposal, as in previous years, nine minority or first-generation students will be selected each year&lt;br/&gt;for training in four major areas of cultural anthropology research: historical and testimonial case studies,&lt;br/&gt;participant observation, conducting focus group studies, qualitative data analysis on text-interview material,&lt;br/&gt;and quantitative analysis of census and survey data. Students will also be taught the techniques and critical&lt;br/&gt;thinking skills necessary for conducting resource material location, library research, and the use of the Internet&lt;br/&gt;for research purposes. Throughout the 10-weeks, students are exposed to such topics as writing research&lt;br/&gt;results, reading comprehension, stages of research, validity and reliability, critical thinking, note-taking during&lt;br/&gt;research, getting published, and presenting at conferences. Students also participate in the UNT McNair&lt;br/&gt;Scholars? Friday Seminar, in order to stimulate student interaction with the McNair Scholars Program.&lt;br/&gt;Students are, and will continue to be followed, to assess the impact of the REU on their college and postcollege&lt;br/&gt;research careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Currently, nine years of funding have allowed the beginning of&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the longer-term impact of the program, both in terms of its continuing effect on REU graduates, and&lt;br/&gt;the significant contributions its graduates are able to make to research in the social sciences. The information&lt;br/&gt;to be gathered, analyzed, and disseminated between 2009-2012 should be rich in both the useful evaluation and&lt;br/&gt;practical application of intensive mentoring programs, and the longer-term influence of such programs on the&lt;br/&gt;academic and career trajectories of first-generation and under-represented undergraduates. An extension of&lt;br/&gt;funding would provide a valuable opportunity to track and monitor programmatic outcomes over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. Results of the program to date are demonstrable and encouraging. In follow-up surveys&lt;br/&gt;with our REU graduates, 75% of those from the first funding cycle have gone on to graduate school; 58 % of&lt;br/&gt;graduates from the second funding cycle have gone on to graduate school, and 40% of participants from the&lt;br/&gt;third funding cycle have so far gone on to graduate school (100% of the 2008 participants indicate an intent,&lt;br/&gt;but have not graduated). The existing UNT REU program funded by NSF thus provides a baseline of&lt;br/&gt;longitudinal evaluative data to be built upon in the current application. In qualitative interviews, they voice the&lt;br/&gt;broader impact of the program on their intellectual and professional development, their confidence, and their&lt;br/&gt;appetite for researching the world.</AbstractNarration>
