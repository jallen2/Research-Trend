    <AbstractNarration>TLSAMP Phase II ? Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;In 2002, Tennessee State University, LeMoyne-Owen College, Middle Tennessee State University, University of Memphis, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and Vanderbilt University partnered to form the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TLSAMP). The partners share a strong commitment to increasing access and opportunities for underrepresented minority students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The Alliance was formed to substantially increase the number of underrepresented minorities (e.g., African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans) earning STEM degrees, beginning with the bachelors degree and continuing to the masters and the doctorate degrees. Sharing a long-term commitment to work together, TLSAMP will play a significant role in increasing the production of underrepresented STEM professionals to meet the needs of government, industry, and academia.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Phase I was to double the number of underrepresented minorities receiving STEM degrees by the end of the five-year grant period. The Alliance produced 63 additional graduates above the baseline. Our goal to double the number is a challenge, but a recognizably achievable goal requiring continuity and extension of current efforts as well as application of lessons learned regarding the recruitment of Hispanic Americans and Native Americans, the retention of African Americans, and the need to intensify retention as recruitment increases.&lt;br/&gt;Applying the lessons learned from Phase I, our Phase II proposal will focus on three key objectives: 1) aggressive continuation of Phase I goal and initiatives with special emphasis on recruiting more African American, Hispanic American, and Native American students; 2) significant improvement in retention with special emphasis on enhancing the development of African Americans to increase their retention in STEM; and 3) preparation for progression to graduate school. In other words, TLSAMP Phase II will apply the lessons learned, continue the best practices, and build upon the results of Phase I.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of TLSAMP is its efforts to strategically and tactically address the under representation of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans in STEM disciplines. The TLSAMP basic principles include personal attention, peer and faculty mentoring, hands-on experiences, bridges to the next level, and continuous evaluation. TLSAMP is prepared to implement and further study these principles for African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans from the high school to the undergraduate level through completion of the doctorate.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The TLSAMP institutions enroll about 3,000 underrepresented minorities annually in STEM and our objective is to increase the production and quality of students entering STEM careers. This will positively impact the pool of underrepresented professionals in STEM and ultimately enhance the STEM workforce of this nation. More minority students will graduate with influential STEM degrees and there will be an increased/improved pool of minority STEM graduates to fill the nation?s workforce needs.</AbstractNarration>
