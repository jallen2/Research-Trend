    <AbstractNarration>Advancing knowledge in the biological sciences involves&lt;br/&gt;experimentally testing hypothesesand interpreting the &lt;br/&gt;results based on prior scientific work. Researchers face &lt;br/&gt;the challenge of collecting, evaluating and integrating &lt;br/&gt;large amounts of different kinds of information about &lt;br/&gt;organisms, cells, genes and proteins to generate a valid&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis. And once a hypothesis is generated, the challenge &lt;br/&gt;is to evaluate the hypothesis with respect to what &lt;br/&gt;is already known. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed research will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Test the scalability and extensibility of a novel &lt;br/&gt; computer system that allows biologists to construct &lt;br/&gt; and evaluate alternative hypotheses against a knowledge &lt;br/&gt; base on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Test a knowledge archive that supports the archiving &lt;br/&gt; and search of validated hypotheses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In our work, we define a hypothesis as a statement about &lt;br/&gt;relationships between components of a biological system &lt;br/&gt;that are intended to explain experimental observations. &lt;br/&gt;A set of validated hypotheses can be used as building blocks &lt;br/&gt;to construct larger, more complex models such as &lt;br/&gt;pathways. We plan to develop and test a new paradigm: &lt;br/&gt;that of hypothesis-driven querying of model organism knowledgebases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work, called HyQue (for Hypothesis-based Querying &lt;br/&gt;of pathway models), will take as input working hypotheses about&lt;br/&gt;pathway models expressed in a knowledge-based formalism, &lt;br/&gt;evaluate their consistency using existing data in a knowledgebase, &lt;br/&gt;and provide as output contradictory evidence and suggestions for&lt;br/&gt;improving hypotheses. HyQue will incorporate formal knowledge &lt;br/&gt;representations based upon Semantic Web standards and &lt;br/&gt;an ontology to represent biological objects and relationships.&lt;br/&gt;HyQue will also contain a library of rules that determine &lt;br/&gt;counts of support and contradiction for a given hypothesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will prototype an archive of hypotheses that allows users &lt;br/&gt;to compare their hypothesis with other hypotheses submitted by &lt;br/&gt;their peers. We will explore the capability to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (1) express working hypotheses about the yeast cell cycle; &lt;br/&gt; (2) provide integration of data in the Saccharomyces Genome &lt;br/&gt; Database to evaluate/test pathway-specific hypotheses; &lt;br/&gt; and&lt;br/&gt; (3) archive these results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As analytical tools and database resources proliferate, &lt;br/&gt;biologists require facilities to integrate existing data &lt;br/&gt;into knowledge that can create a shared understanding of&lt;br/&gt;biological models. Our work will explore the expressivity &lt;br/&gt;and scalability of unique and novel querying and contradiction based &lt;br/&gt;reasoning methods that use rich formal knowledge specifications of&lt;br/&gt;biological events in order to accomplish information integration. &lt;br/&gt;Our proposed work will lead to a novel paradigm of querying &lt;br/&gt;biological knowledge that can dynamically retrieve, integrate and&lt;br/&gt;interpret information in terms of biologically relevant &lt;br/&gt;relationships asserted as pathway models. Our work will &lt;br/&gt;examine the value of Semantic Web technologies in building &lt;br/&gt;a knowledgebase for such querying and reasoning and will &lt;br/&gt;aid in standardizing models of biological knowledge and &lt;br/&gt;add momentum to a range of ongoing ontology building efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on the project can be found at the &lt;br/&gt;project web page: http://nigam.web.stanford.edu/hyque</AbstractNarration>
