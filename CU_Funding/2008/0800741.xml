    <AbstractNarration>The main objectives of this research are: (i) to investigate the issues, techniques and principles of a novel methodology to manipulate micro/nano-scale objects by means of coordinated action of multiple micro-scale fingers, and (ii) to realize a multifingered micromanipulator capable of coordinated manipulation tasks such as grasp, rotate, move point-to-point and position micro-scale objects in a defined workspace area on a substrate. The approach involves synthesizing a chip-scale device comprised of multiple independently actuated compliant micromechanisms with optimized topology and end effectors that can be guided to any point of interest within the workspace to contact and interact with a micro-scale object by suitably controlling the input actuations. The approach includes understanding the kinematics and mechanics of coordinated micromanipulation and necessary input actuation schemes through detailed models derived from the first principles of rigid-body and flexible-body kinematics and dynamics as well as the finite element method. The research exploits the interdisciplinary knowledge of macro-scale robotics, micro/nano-scale physics, compliant mechanisms, microsystems and microfabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, if successful, could lead to a new chip-scale micromanipulator with advanced capabilities for dexterous manipulation of micro/nano-scale objects and thus offer several potential benefits and broader impacts including: (i) advancement of the nanomanufacturing technology for building complex micro/nano electromechanical systems, (ii) facilitation of large-scale nanomanufacturing via an array of micromanipulators, and (iii) advancement of the instrumentation in the scanning electron microscopy and the atomic force microscopy by replacing simple cantilever end effectors with more dexterous micromanipulators. The broader impacts in terms of educational aspects of this research include providing several inquiry-based learning opportunities to high school students and research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students including underrepresented and minority groups, online dissemination of education materials, integration of emerging topics from the research such as nanomanufacturing and micro/nano robotics in undergraduate and graduate level courses.</AbstractNarration>
