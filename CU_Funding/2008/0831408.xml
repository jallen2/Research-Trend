    <AbstractNarration>Recent years have witnessed a dramatic change in the goals and modus&lt;br/&gt;operandi of malicious hackers. In particular, hackers realized the&lt;br/&gt;potential monetary gains associated with Internet fraud. As a result,&lt;br/&gt;there has been an integration of sophisticated computer attacks with&lt;br/&gt;well-established fraud mechanisms devised by organized crime. This&lt;br/&gt;process has created a vibrant underground economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research has mostly focused on the visible aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;underground economy, such as botnets, spam, and phishing. However,&lt;br/&gt;little has been done to understand this economy as a whole and to&lt;br/&gt;analyze and model its characteristics. What is needed is a holistic&lt;br/&gt;approach to the study and analysis of the underground economy that&lt;br/&gt;includes all aspects of the criminal process. In this project, novel&lt;br/&gt;techniques and tools are developed that help to analyze the&lt;br/&gt;underground economy and obtain a comprehensive picture of the complete&lt;br/&gt;criminal process. More precisely, the underground economy is analyzed&lt;br/&gt;and modeled from two different vantage points: First, the analysis&lt;br/&gt;identifies the actors participating the underground economy and models&lt;br/&gt;their different roles. Second, the analysis examines the&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure that is used by criminals to carry out their&lt;br/&gt;operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project are techniques and tools to gather&lt;br/&gt;information about the infrastructure of the underground economy and&lt;br/&gt;the involved actors. The broader impact is a reduction in the amount&lt;br/&gt;and severity of crime performed in the Internet. Moreover, the results&lt;br/&gt;of this project support the task of cyber crime law enforcement in&lt;br/&gt;their fight against the underground economy.</AbstractNarration>
