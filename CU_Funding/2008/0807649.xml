    <AbstractNarration>AST-0807649&lt;br/&gt;Komatsu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will develop theoretical tools to extract the maximum cosmological information from the observed power spectrum of galaxies at high redshifts, obtaining the primordial spectrum on scales and with accuracies not achievable by studies of the cosmic microwave background. These results will have far-ranging implications for a variety of planned and proposed studies, both ground- and space-based. Theoretical work of this sort on non-linear gravitational growth and astrophysical effects was a primary recommendation of the Dark Energy Task Force. The tools to be developed will take into account the key non-linear effects: (a) non-linear matter clustering, (b) non-linear and stochastic galaxy bias, and (c) non-linear redshift space distortion. These effects will be the dominant systematic errors in future dark energy constraints from galaxy surveys. This project will improve the accuracy of perturbation theory, and find the maximum wave-number below which one can use perturbation theory reliably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work integrates research and education naturally by involving two graduate students in cutting-edge research. The simulation data will provide an attractive and efficient tool for providing research experiences to undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
