    <AbstractNarration>0841739&lt;br/&gt;Rowe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal seeks funding of ~$31K to purchase a UIC coulometer and acidification module to perform paleoenvironmental research. The system will be able to analyze total organic and total inorganic carbon (TOC and TIC) in water, rock, and soil samples. The PI has experience with this instrument and it will be configured and housed in the stable isotope facility at UT-Arlington. The PI will offer analyses with a small fee structure to allow purchase of supplies and support consumables. The overall research goals for this acquisition revolve around better understanding paleooceanographic conditions. The coulometer will be used to assess DIC and DOC in depositional formations to relate biogeochemical indicators (such as under oxic-anoxic conditions), primarily in high-deposition areas (like ocean basins). Land-derived nutrient loadings will also be assessed through understanding oxic-anoxic conditions in organic-rich sedimentary material. The instrument will also be crucial in examining the geostratigraphy associated with the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction. Finally, stream geomorphology will be assessed in recent times by linking hydrological parameters with carbon and elemental biogeochemistry. Data from this instrument will be made available to the community through PaleoStrat and CHRONOS databases. It will be used in an REU program examining coal mining impacts on carbon dynamics in Appalachian streams. This instrument will allow the PI to be more selective for samples needing additional analysis and allow students the opportunity to take vital, but perhaps more straight-forward measurements. The PI will incorporate the instrument into three courses. The PI is well-represented in female and minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
