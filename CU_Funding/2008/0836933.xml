    <AbstractNarration>0836933&lt;br/&gt;Cerro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aninternational travel grant Dr. Ramon Cerro to participate in the Fluids-2008 to be held in Santa Fe, Argentina the week of November 19-21, 2008. This conference is the 10th National Meeting on Recent Advances in Physics of Fluids and its applications, organized by Argentinean universities and sponsored by the Secretary of Science and Technology. The PI of this grant has been invited to deliver a plenary conference paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of Proposal: The PI was invited to give a plenary lecture on the "Contact Angles: Static and Dynamic". A topic that draws heavily from the research conducted by the PI and sponsored by NSF on multiphase fluids transport. This line of research is of particular interest for the conference on the light of recent advances on flows in micro channels and under very low gravity. The interfacial effects have a large effect on the transport in the micro-channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This conference takes place every two years and is a point of gathering for fluid mechanics experts from Argentina, Chile and Brazil. The audience are chemical, nuclear and mechanical engineers as well as physicists and mathematicians. This is an excellent opportunity to meet the leading scientists of South America and to develop collaboration with the University of Alabama Huntsville graduate research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All expenses of the PI and travel within Argentina are paid by the organizing Argentinean Committee, but this grant provides the coach airfare to/from Argentina. International collaboration and contacts with South American and Latin American countries, as well as other countries, have resulted in many beneficial effects to USA researchers supported in this NSF program.</AbstractNarration>
