    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this RCN project is to establish an interactive community of researchers and students in the area of molecular structure and dynamics of macromolecular assemblies, with a specific focus on the forefront technology of solid-state NMR. This project will foster communication of ideas and allow exposure to off-campus equipment facilities for six research groups at the City University of New York (CUNY), the New York Structural Biology Center, Columbia University, and New York University. The networking will be accomplished through an ongoing seminar series held at participating institutes across New York City; an annual symposium held alternately at the CUNY Graduate Center and at the New York Structural Biology Center; an annual hands-on workshop rotating among different laboratories of the core participants; a communications system for teleconferencing and video conferencing; and an interactive website that will announce the activities described above and allow technical networking among the researchers located at the various sites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These programs will facilitate the ability of both junior and well-established investigators to exchange ideas and results, form collaborations in "real time," and advance the field of solid-state NMR as it applies to biopolymers and macromolecular assemblies. In addition, the seminars and website will reach a broad array of researchers and students who would not otherwise have ready access to state-of-the-art NMR methods and experimental results on the molecular structure of biological solids. These individuals include research counterparts in locations distant from New York City as well as local faculty and students. Importantly, the Research Coordination Network will include a significant population of minority students, who comprise 69% of CUNY's student population.</AbstractNarration>
