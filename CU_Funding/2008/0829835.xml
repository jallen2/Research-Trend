    <AbstractNarration>Large-scale databases from sequencing projects, microarray studies, gene-function studies, protein-protein interactions, comparative genomics, structural biology, and so on are growing at rapid rates. These data come in diverse forms including expression data, network/interaction data, ontologies, text documents, and raw image/spectrum data. An integrated mining approach, combining these vast public repositories, is a crucial component in answering important scientific questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is focusing on developing novel data mining techniques for integrated analysis and mining of complex gene/protein expression and interaction datasets taken from multiple sources. In particular, this research aims at: 1) Mining patterns of gene expression and regulation via Boolean expression and coherent cluster mining. 2) Mining novel protein interactions and network modules/motifs. 3) Integrated functional relationship mining over multiple genome-wide datasets. Given the proliferation of such complex, networked data in a variety of domains such as social networks, biological networks, semantic web, and so on, the methodology and algorithms being developed in this research will be widely applicable to other important areas.</AbstractNarration>
