    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Direct generation of multi-excitons from single photon absorption events promises to revolutionize a broad category of devices. The key intellectual merit of this research is to investigate the photophysics and transport properties of excitons and biexcitons in carbon nanotubes as the basis for investigating multi-exciton generation. This research will be carried out in one of the most technologically important devices: the p-n diode. The proposed research will develop structures consisting of many p-n diodes of varying complexity along individual carbon nanotubes to allow simultaneous investigation of multiple parameters. This will be accomplished by developing state-of-the-art devices, novel carbon nanotube growth techniques, and photoconductivity measurement techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;Solar technology offers clean renewable energy that could play an integral part of meeting current and future energy needs and helps to curtail global warming. The broader impact of the proposed research could lead to higher efficiency solar cells based on new physics that arise from quantum confinement. An integral part of this research is to energize the next generation of scientists and educate those who will inspire them. This will be accomplished through several fronts. First, this research will offer K-12 teachers summer research experience. For training the next generation, students from several levels will have opportunities to learn that nanotechnology offers solutions to meet future energy needs. This research will provide experience for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who are under-represented in science. Finally, the results from this research will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
