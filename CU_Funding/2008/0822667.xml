    <AbstractNarration>2008 NSF-MEXT YOUNG RESEARCHERS EXCHANGE PROGRAM&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal seeks support for an innovative exchange program for young scientists and engineers working in the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Jointly funded by the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), this program will support fifteen US researchers and thirteen Japanese researchers, by providing a venue to develop professional relationships and explore new research frontiers in nanotechnology. In March 2008, the team from Japan will visit seven US institutions for tours of facilities. The trip will be enhanced by a symposium at Northwestern University with speakers from both the US and Japanese teams. In October 2008, the US team will visit five institutions in Japan for reciprocal tours of facilities and a final symposium.&lt;br/&gt; The US and Japan recognize the potential widespread impact of prospective applications resulting from the pioneering research being conducted in the broad arenas of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Additionally, both countries recognize that multi- and inter-disciplinary teams facilitate research success and that constructive research and training efforts in this emerging field must span international boundaries. The proposed program addresses these needs by engaging researchers at a time in their careers when professional connections are being forged. It lays a foundation for lasting, productive future associations, and increases the likelihood of successful global research collaborations and outcomes. Further educational benefits are realized through the symposiums, which are open to academic communities in both countries</AbstractNarration>
