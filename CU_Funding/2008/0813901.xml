    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on multiscale and stochastic numerical methods&lt;br/&gt;for complex multiphysics problems. A parallel computational framework&lt;br/&gt;for modeling various multiscale applications will be developed. The&lt;br/&gt;models of interest will be based on coupling the Stokes or the&lt;br/&gt;Navier-Stokes equations with single phase or multiphase Darcy flow.&lt;br/&gt;The flow system will be coupled with reactive transport. The research&lt;br/&gt;approach is based on a multiblock domain decomposition methodology.&lt;br/&gt;The simulation domain is a union of subdomains (blocks). Each block&lt;br/&gt;is associated with a physical, mathematical, and numerical&lt;br/&gt;model. Physically meaningful interface conditions are imposed on the&lt;br/&gt;discrete level via mortar finite elements. The formulation provides&lt;br/&gt;great flexibility for multiphysics and multinumerics&lt;br/&gt;couplings. Furthermore, this domain decomposition approach, combined&lt;br/&gt;with coarse scale mortar elements, provides a multiscale approximation&lt;br/&gt;and an efficient way to solve the coarse grid problem in parallel.&lt;br/&gt;Uncertainty in the physical characteristics is modeled via stochastic&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations. Approximation in probability space is&lt;br/&gt;achieved using stochastic finite element and collocation methods. The&lt;br/&gt;main components of the research will be 1) development of multiscale&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models, identifying appropriate interface conditions, and&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the well-posedness of the models; 2) novel discretization&lt;br/&gt;techniques for stochastic partial differential equations; 3) a&lt;br/&gt;posteriori error estimates and adaptive mesh refinement algorithms in&lt;br/&gt;physical and stochastic space; and (4) efficient parallel domain&lt;br/&gt;decomposition solvers and preconditioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research methodology can be applied for the design, analysis, and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of computational methods for a large class of problems&lt;br/&gt;arising in science and engineering applications. The project will&lt;br/&gt;emphasize accurate, robust, and efficient numerical methods for&lt;br/&gt;problems exhibiting behavior on a wide range of scales in space and&lt;br/&gt;time. The research also aims to quantify uncertainty in the prediction&lt;br/&gt;due to to uncertainty in the input parameters through stochastic&lt;br/&gt;modeling. The research results will be applied to two main&lt;br/&gt;application areas: couplings of surface water with groundwater flows&lt;br/&gt;and modeling complex multiscale processes occurring in the&lt;br/&gt;inflammatory response in the human body. Computer modeling of&lt;br/&gt;subsurface and surface flow and transport has a major economic impact&lt;br/&gt;on environmental and energy industries. Due to the proximity of&lt;br/&gt;groundwater and surface water systems, contamination of rivers, lakes,&lt;br/&gt;and wetlands can lead to contamination of aquifers and&lt;br/&gt;vice-versa. Simulating these complex interactions is a major&lt;br/&gt;computational challenge. Acute inflammation, which occurs in response&lt;br/&gt;to trauma or infection, may lead to a systemic inflammation or&lt;br/&gt;sepsis. Sepsis frequently leads to organ failure and death (with more&lt;br/&gt;that 500,000 fatal cases per year in the U.S.). Effective treatments&lt;br/&gt;are lacking, due to the complexity of the process. Mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computer modeling is becoming a more common tool in the effort to gain&lt;br/&gt;insight of the dynamics and spatial characteristics of the&lt;br/&gt;inflammatory process.</AbstractNarration>
