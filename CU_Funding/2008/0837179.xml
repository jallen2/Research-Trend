    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences(61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory investigations using flow cytometry are being developed and implemented for use across the undergraduate biology curriculum. The investigations are being designed to foster growth in student understanding of how the diverse, dynamic, and developmentally labile properties of living cell populations emerge from the physical and chemical properties of individual cells, as an enhancement to the technology typically available in undergraduate teaching laboratories. These investigations are also allowing students to pursue authentic, sophisticated and interdisciplinary laboratory investigations in cell biology, microbiology and aquatic ecology courses. The project team is working with neighboring colleges and high schools to provide additional instructors and students with access to the flow cytometer and associated curriculum, and is collaborating with a regional educators' group on the development and piloting of curriculum, supporting materials, and assessment tools in which flow cytometry plays a central role. These curriculum materials are being designed to demonstrate the utility and versatility of flow cytometry technology, and to be suitable for adoption by biology instructors and students nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
