    <AbstractNarration>This research investigates the way political conflicts are influenced by sacred values, which are values that incorporate ethical or religious beliefs and are associated with human behavior that seems motivated independently of its prospect of success. Past research has approached the study of political conflicts as though they were between instrumental actors -- people and groups aiming to maximize their instrumental gains and minimize losses. Indeed, rational actor models have long dominated strategic thinking at all levels of government policy. However, many key components of decision-making vary with context, across social relations and domains, and as a function of whether or not a choice has ethical or moral entailments. The guiding hypothesis of this research is that people in political conflicts make non-instrumental judgments and decisions when they conceptualize the issues under dispute as sacred values, such as when groups of people transform land from a simple resource into a "holy site." Previous research carried out by this interdisciplinary team of investigators has advanced theoretical understanding of sacred values, developed novel methods of studying their impact on political decision-making and negotiations, and demonstrated their role in non-instrumental and often violent choices in political contexts. However, scientific investigation of sacred values is still in its infancy and more needs to be done. Specifically, this research: 1) investigates biological and cultural antecedents of sacred values and the social identity functions of sacred values across cultures, 2) probes the role of sacred values in influencing violent and seemingly intractable political conflict, and 3) uses this knowledge to investigate possibilities of reducing political and cultural conflict. The methodology integrates basic and applied research, combining brain imaging studies with laboratory and field experiments, surveys and interviews in order to provide "real-world" relevance for policymakers as well.</AbstractNarration>
