    <AbstractNarration>0824729&lt;br/&gt;Neuhoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding to purchase an X-ray diffractometer to replace a current 30-year old model within the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida. The current instrument suffers from loss of quality and accuracy in the diffraction pattern and is no longer supported by the manufacturer. The proposed acquisition is a Rigaku Ultima IV vertical goniometer powder X-ray unit. This unit is supplied with cross-beam optics which support both traditional focusing and parallel beam diffraction allowing analysis of samples with varying geometry. The requested system is complete with software and automation capabilities. XRD is a common technique for studies in mineralogy, sedimentology and petrology. The research team will put the requested instrument into service to 1) understanding the mineralogy of heterogeneous sediment and rock samples, 2) assessing the stability of zeolites, clays, and anion salts which control the physicochemical behavior of surface rocks, 3) understanding the physical properties of water in angstrom to nanometer scale pores within amorphous and crystalline solids, 4) defining water-rock interactions in marine, estuarine and terrestrial systems ? with focus on aquifier rocks and sediments during groundwater-surface exchange, 5) understanding biogeochemical impacts of submarine groundwater discharge in coastal systems, 6) understanding the global sedimentation increase associated with the late Cenozoic Northern Hemisphere glaciation, 7) understanding coastal urbanization through studying sedimentation processes in modern impacted and paleo-estuarine environments, and 8) to better understand human impacts such as deforestation, soil erosion, and land-use changes on watershed sedimentology. The management plan has the PIs administering the upgrade and maintenance. Laboratory space is allocated through the department and a state-supported non-tenure track faculty member will provide technical support. Overhead support will provide electrical and cooling requirements. A small remuneration ($5-10 per hour in-house and ~$40 per hour for outside users) will be collected to support periodic maintenance. Currently, students are not provided hands-on training in XRPD due to safety concerns. The proposed instrument will be made available to students performing research and also used classes in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum: mineralogy, petrology, sedimentology, and geochemistry. The instrument is to be used in outreach such as the Florida Scholar?s program, targeting high school students and K-12 teachers. PIs will also publish data in peer-reviewed papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
