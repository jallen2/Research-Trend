    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of&lt;br/&gt;2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical explanation:&lt;br/&gt;The ability to predict the response of crystalline solids to forces that&lt;br/&gt;cause them to change shape, or in other words deform, is important in many&lt;br/&gt;areas including materials engineering, metallurgy and geoscience and has&lt;br/&gt;applications to problems ranging from metals forming to mountain building.&lt;br/&gt; This research project will investigate the deformation behavior of&lt;br/&gt;quartzite, a common quartz-bearing rock, at the temperatures and pressures&lt;br/&gt;relevant to the earth's interior. We will use a combination of in-situ&lt;br/&gt;synchrotron x-ray diffraction, computer based simulations and sample&lt;br/&gt;analysis to study the behavior of specific groups of crystals within the&lt;br/&gt;rock which will improve our understanding of how the behavior of groups of&lt;br/&gt;crystals within a rock integrate to produce the overall behavior of the&lt;br/&gt;rock. Our results will be most useful in understanding geological&lt;br/&gt;processes such as those that produce mountains or determine where in&lt;br/&gt;Earth's crust, earthquakes occur. However, because the deformation&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms that allow quartz crystals to deform are the same as those that&lt;br/&gt;operate in metals and ceramics, we anticipate that our results will also&lt;br/&gt;shed light on more general questions that have applications to a range of&lt;br/&gt;engineering problems. The majority of the funding requested for this&lt;br/&gt;project will support the education of young scientists including&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate scholars by supporting them as&lt;br/&gt;they participate in cutting edge research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical explanation:&lt;br/&gt;This project will use in-situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction from high&lt;br/&gt;pressure, high temperature deformation experiments on quartz combined with&lt;br/&gt;elastic plastic self consistent modeling and careful examination of sample&lt;br/&gt;microstructures to learn about the distribution of stress between grain&lt;br/&gt;populations during deformation. The experiments are designed to allow us&lt;br/&gt;to examine the relative roles of various deformation mechanisms and&lt;br/&gt;grain-grain interactions in generating the overall rheological behavior of&lt;br/&gt;polycrystalline quartz. In addition, the combination of microstructural&lt;br/&gt;analysis with synchrotron diffraction observations will add a great deal&lt;br/&gt;to the understanding and interpretation of diffraction data gathered from&lt;br/&gt;high pressure deformation experiments. Therefore the results from this&lt;br/&gt;study will have implications for and applications to deformation studies&lt;br/&gt;of other earth materials made with large volume high pressure apparatus,&lt;br/&gt;as well as ultrahigh pressure deformation studies in the diamond anvil&lt;br/&gt;cell (DAC) that utilize the same type of diffraction data. The results&lt;br/&gt;will also have implications for neutron and x-ray diffraction studies of&lt;br/&gt;engineering ceramics and metals.</AbstractNarration>
