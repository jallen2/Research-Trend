    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides infrastructure to the University of Pennsylvania to build from their existing work into the area of mobile manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRASP Lab is an internationally recognized robotics research group at the University of Pennsylvania. It hosts 14 faculty members and approximately 60 Ph.D. students from the primary departments of Computer and Information Science (CIS), Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE), and Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRASP recently launched a multidisciplinary Masters program in Robotics and involves these students, as well as many Penn undergrads, in its research endeavors. The research conducted by the members of the GRASP laboratory includes such areas as vision, planning, control, multi-agent systems, locomotion, haptics, medical robotics, machine learning and modular robotics. This proposal requests funding for instruments that would enable us to broaden our research to include the important new area of mobile manipulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An increasing amount of research in robotics is being devoted to mobile manipulation because it holds great promise in assisting the elderly and the disabled at home, in helping workers with labor intensive tasks at factories, and in lessening the exposure of firemen, policemen and bomb squad members to dangers and hazards. As concluded by the NSF/NASA sponsored workshop on Autonomous Mobile Manipulation (AMM) in 2005, the technical challenges critically requiring the attention of researchers are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? dexterous manipulation and physical interaction&lt;br/&gt;? multi-sensor perception in unstructured environments&lt;br/&gt;? control and safety near human beings&lt;br/&gt;? technologies for human-robot interaction&lt;br/&gt;? architectures that support fully integrated AMM systems &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers at GRASP fully support these recommendations and want to help lead the way in addressing them. Though GRASP conducts a great deal of research on similar challenges in related areas, this group has not worked on the unique and potentially transformative topic of mobile manipulation. The primary inhibitor to pursuing these challenges is that research in mobile manipulation critically depends on the availability of adequate experimental platforms. This group is requesting funding that would allow them to acquire such equipment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this group is requesting funding for &lt;br/&gt;(a) one human-scale mobile manipulator consisting of a Segway base, Barrett 7-DOF arm, and 3-fingered BarrettHand equipped with tactile sensors and a visual sensing suite; and &lt;br/&gt;(b) four small Aldebaran Robotics NAO humanoid robots capable of locomotion and manipulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These instruments will allow the GRASP community to perform research in such areas as autonomous mobile manipulation, teleoperated mobile manipulation, navigation among people, bipedal locomotion, and coordination of multiple mobile manipulation platforms. Advances in this area are beneficial to society in a variety ways. For example, mobile manipulation is one of the most critical areas of research in household robotics, which aims at helping people (especially the elderly and the disabled) with their chores. Mobile manipulators will also see great use in office and industrial settings, where they can exibly automate a huge variety of manual tasks.</AbstractNarration>
