    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is to provide partial support for an international workshop to be held at the Univerity of Oklahoma in May 2009, namely the 3rd International Workshop on the Interconnection between Particle Physics and Cosmology (PPC 2009). The previous meetings were very successful and compelling. With the recent turn-on of CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and start-up of the Xenon-100 dark matter search experiment, a workshop on particle physics and cosmology is more timely than ever. Topics to be addressed in this workshop include: recent progress and data from LHC and Tevatron, recent results from Xenon-100 dark matter search, results from GLAST and Pamela, Higgs phenomenology, supersymmetry, grand uni&amp;#64257;cation, extra dimensions, little Higgs models, direct/indirect dark matter searches, dark energy measurements, and large scale and deep surveys, and cosmological parameters and models.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this conference are as follows: This is an interdisciplinary conference. The workshop will bring together experts in high-energy physics and cosmology. &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will contain a significant education component, involving graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and established leading scientists, and will provide substantial opportunities for unstructured discussion to facilitate collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
