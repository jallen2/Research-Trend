    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The objective of this research is to experimentally understand the requirements for manipulating light in waveguides using electron spin polarization in order to develop integrated optoelectronic devices to be used for optical communication. The objective of the educational component of this proposal is to convey the excitement of semiconductor physics and nanotechnology to students and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Recent measurements of electron spin polarization that is generated and manipulated at picosecond timescales using electric fields combined with recent advances in integrated photonics technology offer a pathway for demonstrating electrically-controlled integrated optical isolators, gigahertz electro-optic modulators and low-loss waveguide switches in conventional semiconductors. With the educational component of this proposal, it will promote greater understanding of nanotechnology through demonstrations for introductory physics classes, public lectures and open discussions with the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This research aims to demonstrate a new class of integrated optoelectronic devices for optical communications, based upon control of electron spin polarization. These devices do not require applied magnetic fields and are compatible with the materials currently used for electronics. The proposed educational activities will disseminate current developments in nanotechnology to the public through the Physics Demonstration Lab, the Saturday Morning Physics program and Science Cafes at the University of Michigan. The "Science for Tomorrow" Career Program will reach students in grades 6-9 and their families and inform, motivate and prepare them for careers in science.</AbstractNarration>
