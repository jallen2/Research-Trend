    <AbstractNarration>The Virginia State University's Center for Biosystems and Engineering (CBE) describes a plan to use a molecular imaging system to continue faculty &amp; student research and teaching in an interdisciplinary biosystems and engineering research program. The proposed instrument is the Agilent 5500 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)/ Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) system. Currently, the CBE has research projects conducted by four faculty members in the areas of material science, surface chemistry, nanolithography, bioelectronics, biosensors, bioscience, and quantitative nanoscale measurements. These current research projects are addressing questions about surface derivatization, surface contamination, defect inspection of silicon chips, nano roughness and quantitation, and characterization of metals. Our research is at the interface between these technologies and disciplines such as biology, chemistry, nanotechnology, and engineering. The CBE conducts fundamental studies for gaining the knowledge necessary for the predictable design and optimization of future bioelectronic detection devices. The research is a university-wide initiative to strengthen the area's bioscience/biotechnology/semiconductor industry and it is attractive to both students and researchers who are seeking an understanding of the relationships between biology, chemistry, and engineering to produce the best bioelectronic devices to protect and improve the health of individuals and our environment. The research programs not only contribute significantly to the knowledge base, but also provide the best possible dynamic training environments for future researchers, our students. Thus, the acquisition of the AFM/SPM system will allow for the continuation of our interdisciplinary research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virginia State University (VSU) provides an environment conducive to teaching and research training for our students through (a) our summer research program that includes over 30 minority students and (b) our researched-based undergraduate laboratory classes. The proposed Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)/ Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) system will enhance the undergraduate program through new course contents and curriculum. In addition, it will promote faculty and undergraduate research and increase the number of students and researchers using this instrument throughout the academic year. The proposed instrument will also offer necessary training in modern technology to undergraduate students. The result of increased use of the instrument will be manifested in our intellectual progression and an opportunity to contribute to the overall scientific field. By providing access to the instrumentation, we can obtain preliminary data, which can increase the likelihood for the researchers to publish, procure external funding, and engage in more joint collaboration with researchers from other universities. VSU creates environments where all our students can succeed through our hands-on approach to teaching and research. Thus access to modern instrumentation insures that our students will be prepared to take part in this exciting field and build capacity by broadening the engineering research experience for minority undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
