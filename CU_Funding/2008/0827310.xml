    <AbstractNarration>John Taylor-Montoya, under the supervision of Dr. David J. Meltzer, will investigate the evolution of Paleoindian stone tool manufacture and technology on the southern Plains of North America during the period of ~11,500-8500 radiocarbon years before present. The goal of the study is to explore variations in stone tool technology across space and through time to better understand the changing adaptations of the groups who made them. It is a particularly interesting period for study, since this was a time when the environment was undergoing significant changes (the Ice Age was coming to an end), and these descendants of the first Americans were beginning to settle in to their new land. The artifact sample that will be used for this study comes from Paleoindian sites that have been excavated over many years, the collections of which are housed in various museums and facilities in the southern Plains region. These existing collections provide valuable data, but are often an underutilized resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variation in Paleoindian stone tool technology over time comprises one of the more intriguing records of material culture change in North America. As archaeological methods of analysis have themselves evolved, there are now new tools to explore the relationships between Paleoindian stone tool technology, the social dynamics of the people who made and used those stone tools, and their interactions with the environment. The implications are far reaching and can inform our ideas about the origins and cultural evolution of the earliest Americans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Taylor-Montoyas research is aimed at testing two specific hypotheses to explain technological change during this time: 1) Climate change altered the availability of certain species of game animals, causing adaptive responses in hunting technology 2) Changes in technology were part of the final process of the initial peopling of North America, where the settling in of groups into specific geographical areas and their increased population led to reduced social interaction the end result being regionally and locally distinct stone tool traditions reflected in different styles of artifacts across the landscape. Because spear points are stylistically diagnostic and were also used to harvest and process game, they represent an ideal artifact class for testing whether variation in material culture was the result of climate change or settling in. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research into the evolution of cultural traits is used as the framework for this study. If the climate forcing model is accurate, it is expected that variation in stone tool technology will follow changes in ecological conditions across space and time. If the settling in hypothesis is correct, stylistic patterns should take place independent of changes in climate and environment. There is likely more complexity to the problem than indicated in these models. However, beginning with simplified models will allow Mr. Taylor-Montoya to test clear hypotheses and identify weaknesses in those models which will guide future work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study can provide the foundation for resolving questions regarding the relative influence of ecology and social dynamics on long-term changes in material culture on a regional scale. The results will be of interest to a broad audience of social scientists. In addition to the dissertation, the results will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and professional conference presentations. The study will also produce the most comprehensive regional Paleoindian artifact database for the study area. Pending permission from the institutions housing these artifacts, the database will be published on the internet. In addition to being a research tool for specialists, the digital archive would also be an excellent source for educators and the interested public.</AbstractNarration>
