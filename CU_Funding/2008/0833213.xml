    <AbstractNarration>Cyndee L. Gruden&lt;br/&gt;0833213&lt;br/&gt;University of Toledo&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Intellectual Merit: Nanotechnology, which focuses on the synthesis, manipulation, and application of materials less than 100nm in size, is a tremendously popular subject in modern day science and engineering research. These nano-sized particles possess properties, such as increased surface area and mobility, which are unique and can be exploited to advance emerging technologies. To date, nanoparticles have been used in a wide array of technologies including electronic, biomedical, energy, environmental, catalytic and materials applications. Due to their significant potential, nanoscale materials are expected to be manufactured at an increasing rate in the near future. However, it is currently uncertain whether their environmental risks outweigh their technological benefits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposed research is on inorganic nanoparticles, specifically metal oxides (e.g., ZnO and TiO2), which have been incorporated into personal care products (PCPs) for UV-protection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toxic substances in sludge will adversely affect the biological processes responsible for anaerobic digestion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Nanotechnology is a dominant area of research in the fields of science and engineering. A significant amount of resources, allocated by both public and private agencies, have been directed toward advances in the development and manipulation of nanoparticles resulting in a variety of nanotechnologies with considerable potential. Research, as described herein, is necessary to eliminate the uncertainties and to determine the environmental risks associated with specific applications of nanoparticles (e.g., personal care products).</AbstractNarration>
