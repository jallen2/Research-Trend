    <AbstractNarration>Node compromise occurs when an attacker through some subvert &lt;br/&gt;means, gains the control of a node in the network after deployment. &lt;br/&gt;Once in control of that node, the attacker can alter the node to &lt;br/&gt;listen to information in the network, input malicious data, cause &lt;br/&gt;black hole, or any one of a myriad of attacks on the network. &lt;br/&gt;Generally a node compromise occurs in two ways. The first way is &lt;br/&gt;called physical/external attack, when the attacker physically &lt;br/&gt;accesses or captures a node, and then directly connects the node &lt;br/&gt;to his/her computer via a wired connection of some sort. Once &lt;br/&gt;connected the attacker controls the node by extracting the data &lt;br/&gt;and/or putting new data, etc. Most researchers in this area have &lt;br/&gt;only considered this kind of node compromise attack and many &lt;br/&gt;methods have been discovered to detect such attacks. The second &lt;br/&gt;way is called soft/internal attack, when the attacker compromises &lt;br/&gt;a node in a network via software/viruses which can spread over &lt;br/&gt;the physical communication channels or over the air interfaces. &lt;br/&gt;The soft attack method is hard to be detected and is the main or &lt;br/&gt;the only reason that leads to the emergence of compromised nodes &lt;br/&gt;in some practical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research aims at developing node compromise &lt;br/&gt;distribution models and their defending considerations for &lt;br/&gt;Mobile Ad-hoc Sensor Networks. Specifically, the research &lt;br/&gt;involves an exploratory investigation of modeling attack &lt;br/&gt;distribution that can help system to estimate the probability &lt;br/&gt;of a node being compromised and thus defend against it &lt;br/&gt;effectively and efficiently. We develop several models for a &lt;br/&gt;node compromise based on different application environments. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, we develop an analytical framework to theoretically &lt;br/&gt;evaluate our node compromise distribution models. The analytical &lt;br/&gt;results will be evaluated by extensive simulations and &lt;br/&gt;experimental measurements.</AbstractNarration>
