    <AbstractNarration>Bocea&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0806789&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project is motivated by several questions in two&lt;br/&gt;distinct areas of materials science. The first part of the&lt;br/&gt;project undertakes the development of a general theory that&lt;br/&gt;allows for efficient characterizations of the yield set of a&lt;br/&gt;polycrystal by means of suitable variational principles in&lt;br/&gt;L-infinity. A new variational formalism leads naturally to&lt;br/&gt;several problems in the emerging area of calculus of variations&lt;br/&gt;in L-infinity for the case where the functionals to be optimized&lt;br/&gt;are the essential supremum of some expression involving&lt;br/&gt;divergence-free fields. Here the natural approach is to minimize&lt;br/&gt;the maximum of certain relevant quantities instead of their&lt;br/&gt;average. The investigator studies selected issues in this&lt;br/&gt;direction, with an emphasis on those that can have an impact on&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of plasticity. Among these, the study of the&lt;br/&gt;systems of partial differential equations that arise as Aronsson&lt;br/&gt;equations associated to the new variational principles in&lt;br/&gt;L-infinity is of particular interest. The second part of the&lt;br/&gt;project deals with the derivation of nonlinear membrane theories&lt;br/&gt;from three-dimensional elasticity, seeking to better understand&lt;br/&gt;the formation of interfaces in thin films of martensitic&lt;br/&gt;materials. The project sheds light on the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;minimizers for a new effective thin film energy, and indicates&lt;br/&gt;appropriate minimizing sequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project aims to set on rigorous mathematical grounds&lt;br/&gt;some of the traditional models used by engineers and material&lt;br/&gt;scientists and, on the other hand, to explore new variational&lt;br/&gt;principles in the case where one wants to know how big some&lt;br/&gt;quantity can be at its maximum value, not merely on average. &lt;br/&gt;This question arises in many areas of science and engineering and&lt;br/&gt;is of fundamental importance in such applications as elasticity,&lt;br/&gt;image processing, damage and fracture mechanics, and plasticity. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies this question in the first part of the&lt;br/&gt;project. In the second part he deals with the derivation of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear membrane theories from three-dimensional elasticity. &lt;br/&gt;This is motivated in part by the need, originating from important&lt;br/&gt;technological applications, to better understand and predict the&lt;br/&gt;formation of interfaces in thin films of martensitic materials. &lt;br/&gt;The project sheds light on the structure of the minimizers for a&lt;br/&gt;new effective thin film energy recently proposed by the&lt;br/&gt;investigator, and indicates appropriate minimizing sequences that&lt;br/&gt;are expected to provide some insight into the design of&lt;br/&gt;technologically useful active material structures, more complex&lt;br/&gt;than those suggested by existing thin film theories.</AbstractNarration>
