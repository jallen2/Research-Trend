    <AbstractNarration>In this research supported by the NSF Chemistry Division, Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and Office of International Science and Engineering, Blanchard (Michigan State University) and Marken (University of Bath, UK) research groups focus on studying photo-electrochemical processes at microphase liquid:liquid interfaces and at triple phase boundaries. Such structures offer a unique environment where excited molecules and reaction intermediates are in close proximity to both electrode surfaces and liquid:liquid interfaces. The goal in studying such systems lies in the critical role that these types of structure play in processes such as photosynthetic light harvesting. The project is divided into four main, interconnected parts: (A) the study of electrochemically or photo-electrochemically driven ion transfer processes using fluorescent probe anions, (B) the study and screening of simultaneous electron and ion transfer at liquid:liquid interfaces and triple phase boundaries, (C) the investigation of two-phase processes involving electron and ion transfer at selected interfaces, and (D) characterizing the local environment at liquid:liquid interfaces using fluorescent probe molecules for the purpose of understanding how the potential of the interface and flux of ions across the interface affects the local environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The larger purpose of this research program, beyond understanding photo-electrochemical dynamics at complex interphase systems, is to educate students at the cutting edge of multidisciplinary science. It is imperative that the United States train a diverse population of students to be globally competitive for careers in science. This research serves as an important vehicle in that effort. By fostering a synergistic relationship between the Blanchard (Michigan State University) and Marken (University of Bath UK) research groups, a multinational cohort of globally competitive scientists will be educated, directly benefiting both the United States and the United Kingdom. This project will facilitate the creation of a bilateral think tank and will foster the free exchange of ideas in a field of research and development that has direct impact on science at the interface between biosystems and energy conversion. The ideas and experiments developed in this collaborative study can help screen and identify new light harvesting processes, possibly mimicking natural processes, and therefore contribute to new energy harvesting/storage/management systems.</AbstractNarration>
