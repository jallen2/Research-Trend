    <AbstractNarration>MarineTech will serve 60 students in grades eight through twelve, over a period of three years, providing 144 hours of instruction and hands-on learning experiences in the fields of marine engineering and physical sciences with a shipbuilding focus. The program will run for eight Saturdays during academic years, with an additional two-week academy during the summers. MarineTech's progressive curriculum covers foundational skills and knowledge of basic physical science as it relates to ship building, through the application of these principles in a culminating ship design competition. The curriculum is enriched with program activities such as field trips to shipbuilding and repair companies, marine science museums and career day events. MarineTech concurrently targets 60 math, science, and technology education teachers for grades eight through twelve, each of whom will receive 40 hours of summer professional development and 40 hours of follow-up training and support. Teachers will work an additional 40 hours in working with their students to build underwater robots and design and build a human powered container ship for competition. Participating teachers will be fully trained in curriculum implementation and will be given materials and resources necessary to replicate MarineTech activities in their classrooms. MarineTech addresses the urgent need to enhance under-represented students' interest and performance in STEM courses, while fostering skills that are important prerequisites for STEM careers, particularly in marine engineering, physical science and information technology. In the near term, the project will incorporate activities designed to boost student scores on academic achievement measures. However, the project also addresses the critical shortage of qualified workers needed to sustain the ship building and repair industry in the USA.</AbstractNarration>
