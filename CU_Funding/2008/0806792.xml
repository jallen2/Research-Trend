    <AbstractNarration>This project is establishing a new program, Providing Support Structures for Chemistry Majors (PSSCM), to support 15-20 students throughout their undergraduate chemistry education. To qualify for PSSCM scholarships, students must demonstrate significant financial need and show promise for success in chemistry. The goal of this project is to provide significant academic support for this cohort of students. This program builds on three existing St. Olaf resources: (i) a nationally-recognized chemistry program; (ii) TRiO/Special Students Services (SSS) program, which supports students in overcoming financial, social, and cultural barriers to success in higher education; and (iii) St. Olaf's Center for Experiential Learning (CEL), which uses workshops, internships, and career counseling to link students' undergraduate experiences to future careers. A steering committee includes chemistry faculty and the directors of financial aid, the SSS program, and the CEL. The committee is guiding the program, recruiting and selecting PSSCM Scholars, and overseeing program activities and mentorship.</AbstractNarration>
