    <AbstractNarration>The Minority Student Pipeline Math Science Partnership (MSP)2 is led by Bowie State University (BSU) with the additional core partners of the Prince George's County Public Schools (PGCPS), the Prince George's Community College (PGCC), the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP), the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI), and the University System of Maryland (USM). (MSP)2 proposes to establish a strong, multifaceted partnership among the essential P-16 players in one of the largest minority-majority counties in the country, Prince George's County, Maryland, in order to expand the minority student pipeline in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in higher education. (MSP)2 will employ four strategies engaging STEM faculty, teachers, undergraduates, and high school students: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Working with approximately 750 teachers in grades 4-8 over five years, &lt;br/&gt; science faculty will develop two different types of professional &lt;br/&gt; development programs designed around principles of teaching and learning &lt;br/&gt; through inquiry science. &lt;br/&gt;2. A total of 110 high school science teachers will engage in summer research&lt;br/&gt; experiences over five years with college and university STEM faculty. &lt;br/&gt;3. At least 375 high school students over five years will be offered &lt;br/&gt; opportunities to take challenging science courses through an innovative &lt;br/&gt; early college/dual enrollment programs. &lt;br/&gt;4. 100 undergraduate underrepresented minority college undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt; will be offered opportunities for teaching experiences (with 100 PGCPS &lt;br/&gt; science teachers to mentor them) and 50 undergraduate will be offered &lt;br/&gt; research experiences over 5 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(MSP)2 will explore four research strands through four implementation strategies: (1) In what ways do different inquiry-based professional development experiences and training for elementary and middle school teachers influence students'interest in science? Are different models more effective at achieving different outcomes? How do these possible effects compare for underrepresented minority students and teachers versus non-minority? (2) What characteristics of summer research opportunities for secondary science teachers, paired with intentional learning communities focused on the nature of scientific inquiry, lead to enhanced curriculum and greater success for students in science, particularly underrepresented minorities? (3) In what ways do opportunities for secondary students to take early-college and dual-enrollment courses affect the likelihood that students, particularly underrepresented minorities, will attend college and choose science majors? And (4) How do opportunities for undergraduate science majors to teach science lessons in elementary and secondary schools affect the likelihood that science majors will consider a career in teaching? How do early research experiences affect the likelihood that STEM majors will complete science degrees?</AbstractNarration>
