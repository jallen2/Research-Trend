    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0821247&lt;br/&gt;Angel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MRI project involves the acquisition of a state-of-the-art IM-Q-TOF spectrometer will enable a collaboration of faculty from four departments at Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce (A&amp;M Commerce) to conduct cutting-edge biochemical research. The research programs and the training of students from the chemistry, biology and environmental sciences, agriculture, and health and human performance departments will benefit tremendously from this instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves seven multidisciplinary collaborations to utilize the unique capabilities of an IM-Q-TOF instrument. Dr. Angel and the Science and Technologies instrument technician, Richard Miller, will manage the IM-Q-TOF and provide necessary training to other collaborators on the operation and capabilities of the instrument. Acquisition of the IM-Q-TOF mass spectrometer will allow students to achieve highly sought-after mass spectrometry training and research experience. These are essential tools in proteomics; a research field that has promising potential for expanding and advancing our knowledge of protein functions and the factors that influence the onset of disease. The research projects made possible through acquisition of an IM-Q-TOF will help faculty integrate research with education and will increase the scientific awareness among the students to adequately prepare them for future scientific/technological opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The acquisition of a state-of-the-art IM-Q-TOF mass spectrometer will advance the knowledge of both faculty and students as carefully designed research projects are developed, conducted and evaluated. The IM-Q-TOF will provide a unique capability for enabling a wide range of research by offering exceptional qualities for bioanalytical chemistry, proteomics and structural studies of mid-tolarge size biomolecules for the research projects involved. The PI will research specific areas using the IM-Q-TOF including: investigating the self-assembly of metal-peptide complexes; characterizing the structures of metal-peptide complexes; measuring the gas-phase, metal-binding affinities of peptides; exploring the energy-resolved, gas-phase reactivity of metal-peptide complexes; determining the solution phase, metal-binding affinities and hydrolysis kinetics of peptides; developing Q-TOF methods for wine quality control. The PI will also support collaborative research detailed in this proposal: Studies of Zn, Cu and Fe Metal-Peptide Complexes; Mass Spectrometric Study of Palladium and Platinum Aqua Complexes as New Proteomics Reagents; Identification of Glycolipids in Stem Cells; Determining Metabolites Induced Under Extreme Exercise; Design and Synthesis of Porphyrin Receptors for Anions and Molecules; Flavonoid Interactions with Segments of Amyloid Beta Peptide and Tau Protein; and, Isolating Scent Chemicals Utilized by Snakes for Hunting Prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Advanced mass spectrometry techniques are a vital part of the explosion in knowledge in biochemical research. There are tremendous possibilities for a non-Ph.D. granting institution to attract, retain, and graduate students with sophisticated instrumentation knowledge as well the experience of being a part of significant scientific research. Students and faculty from eighteen 2-year colleges in Northeast Texas will have the opportunity of collaborating with university faculty and students on research projects using this instrument. The total enrollment of these colleges is over 70,000 with 20,000 of these involved in science courses, and over 23% of the students from underrepresented groups. The nature of the instrumental training and research provided by A&amp;M-Commerce will also be fully conducive in providing appropriately trained personnel for the rapidly developing bioanalytical, proteomic, bioengineering and biochemical career markets. The huge requirement for qualified candidates and knowledge in these rapidly growing science fields will be partially supplemented by the research conducted by highly qualified faculty at A&amp;M-Commerce.</AbstractNarration>
