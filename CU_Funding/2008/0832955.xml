    <AbstractNarration>The University of Florida's Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program is a collaborative effort between the National Science Foundation, the Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, the University's Graduate School and its four colleges with STEM disciplines, the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Agricultural and Life Sciences, and Medicine. Integrating research and education, students will engage in cutting edge research experiences through the Particle Engineering Research Center, The McKnight Brain Institute, the Center for Chemical Research at the Bio/Nano Interface and over 100 other interdisciplinary centers at the University of Florida and alliance institutions. The term of the program is 24 months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program activities provide student graduate opportunities and linkages to the Southeast Alliance for Graduate Education in the Professoriate (SEAGEP) and other graduate associations as well as the commitment of support for graduate education through the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 12 students from underrepresented minority populations in STEM fields will participate in the program at the University of Florida during the 2008-2010 academic years. Results from this support will broaden the participation of African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Pacific-Islanders in the STEM pipeline, U. S. workforce and abroad. Results from rigorous evaluation of the project will add to the body of literature in the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
