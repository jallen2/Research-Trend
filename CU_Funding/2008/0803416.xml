    <AbstractNarration>This Mathematics Scholars Program (MSP) S-STEM project supports scholarships for academically talented and financially needy students in mathematics. The program has seven objectives: (1) Enroll a group of 15 academically talented but financially needy undergraduates majoring in mathematics; (2) Retain 90% of students who enter the MSP to graduation; (3) Increase the number of students who graduate with a bachelor's degree per year in mathematics by 50% by the end of the grant period; (4) Ensure 90% Scholar participation in the Study Buddy Sessions; (5) Ensure 90% Scholar participation in Mathematics Scholar Group activities; (6) Place 85% of Scholars in at least one summer internship during the grant period; and (7) Facilitate the job placement of 10 graduated MSP Scholars in a technical field or post-baccalaureate program by the end of the grant period. The MSP recruits candidates from local high schools, junior colleges, and from existing students on campus. MSP Scholars are selected by a committee, and scholarships will amount to up to $8,750 per student for up to four years. Scholars are supported through a variety of university and MSP-specific initiatives provided by faculty mentors in the mathematics department and in student support offices across the campus. MSP investigators also work closely with Career and Placement Services to provide job search training to Scholars and to strengthen partnerships with local industry representatives.</AbstractNarration>
