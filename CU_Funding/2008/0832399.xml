    <AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC in Space Power and Propulsion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832399 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; Alec Gallimore&lt;br/&gt;0832434 Michigan Technological University; Lyon King (lead institute)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan and Michigan Technological University propose a planning grant for a collaborative center "I/UCRC in Space Power and Propulsion" to pursue research in areas including launch vehicles, in-space propulsion, energy generation, energy storage, and energy processing. The program is motivated by the increasing penetration of commercial applications in the space industry. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of new methods and standards for terrestrial testing of space craft. By standardizing testing techniques, new designs can be more readily benchmarked and failure rates can be predicted with less time in testing. By improving standards for measuring ground test facility capability and consistency of measurement, industry will be better able to judge the merits of tested designs and accept them with greater confidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center in collaboration with two universities and endorsed by several government agencies and industries, if successful, will facilitate the research development to support the US satellite communication and aerospace industries. This research will help maintain U.S. strategic competitiveness in space power and propulsion. Once the center has been established, the PIs will seek to broaden the research expertise by recruiting other universities and members. Both universities have also institutionalized programs to recruit, educate, and retain under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
