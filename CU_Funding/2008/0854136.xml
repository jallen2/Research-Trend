    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0854136&lt;br/&gt;Pennell &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the rapid development of nanotechnologies over the past decade, our current understanding of nanomaterial fate and transport in the environment remains quite limited. For example, it is not known how most engineered nanomaterials will interact with soil matrices, whether or not their transport can be modeled as colloidal particles using classic particle filtration theory, or how unsaturated conditions impact nanoparticle transport, retention and persistence in natural soils. Although some effort has been devoted to investigate the behavior of carbonaceous nanomaterials in the environment, a very limited number of studies have focused on the transport of metal-based nanoparticles, a particularly important class of nanomaterials because of their potential toxicity and widespread use in personal care products. For this reason, the proposed research will focus on three representative metal-based nanomaterials; nano-silver (Ag), nano-titanium dioxide (TiO2), and nano-manganese oxide(s) (MnOx). The research program is designed to couple detailed laboratory experimentation with mathematical modeling to elucidate mechanisms governing the fate and transport of metal-based nanoparticles in quartz sands and natural soils. To achieve this goal, the research is structured around four specific tasks, (1) characterization of metal-based nanoparticle suspensions and soil properties, (2) measure the transport and retention of metal-based nanoparticle under water saturated conditions, (3) measure the transport of metal-based nanoparticle under unsaturated conditions, and (4) develop and validate mathematical models for the prediction of metal-based nanoparticle transport and persistence in subsurface systems. Particularly novel aspects of the research plan include the consideration of surface coatings and emulsifying agents commonly used in sunscreens and cosmetic products containing TiO2 and the use of force-volume microscopy to image nanoparticles deposited on sand grain surfaces. Information gathered from each task will be integrated to advance our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing metal-based nanoparticle transport in porous media, with the ultimate goal of developing a numerical simulator that can be used to predict the transport behavior of engineered nanoparticles in the subsurface based on known input parameters. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in two areas critical to the safe and sustainable development of nanotechnologies; (1) advancement of our fundamental understanding of metal-based nanomaterial fate and transport in porous media and (b) development and validation of mathematical models that can be used to simulate nanoparticle transport in the subsurface. The unique coupling of experimental studies and mathematical modeling proposed in this work provides for rigorous validation of conceptual models of nanomaterial behavior in unsaturated and saturated porous media, and will culminate in the development of numerical simulator capable of predicting nanomaterial fate and transport over a range of conditions that might be encountered in natural systems. We anticipate that the experimental parameters and mathematical models developed in this work can be adapted to predict the fate and transport of other nanomaterials (e.g., ferroxane) in subsurface systems. The fundamental knowledge of nanoparticle retention in porous media can also be used to model the performance of filtration technologies for treatment of drinking or waste water containing nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An essential component of the project will be the incorporation of education initiatives into the research and instructional activities of the investigators, with the goal of extending the impact of acquired knowledge beyond the traditional framework of journal publications and conference presentations. This goal will be achieved through the following initiatives: (a) the inclusion of undergraduate students conducting integrated experimental and mathematical modeling research, (b) the development of interactive, multi-media instructional tools, and (c) recruitment of female and underrepresented minority students. The instructional materials, consisting of tutorials, illustrative case studies and modeling tools, will be released on a dedicated web site so that students and instructors alike can explore processes that govern the fate and transport of metal-based nanoparticles in terrestrial environments.</AbstractNarration>
