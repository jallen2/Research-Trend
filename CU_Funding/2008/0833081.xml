    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research involves the study of high-end parallel finite element mesh generation software capable to deliver and sustain concurrency which will fully utilize current Teraflop and next generation Petaflop high-end architectures. Other than the direct impact to supercomputing this research will have a broader impact to many (bio-) engineering applications that can benefit from scalable field solvers and Teraflop/ Petaflop supercomputers. Such software can also provide challenging and realistic benchmarks which can help to understand the behavior of end-to-end dynamic applications on multi-layered architectures, and thus will be invaluable for the performance evaluation community and design of new supercomputers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome of this research is an effective and efficient implementation of adaptive finite element mesh generation and refinement on high-end parallel architectures. However, parallel mesh generation belongs to the broader class of adaptive and irregular applications which are challenging and labor intensive to develop and maintain. As a result, parallel mesh generation is one of the last applications to be installed on parallel architectures. This research will remedy this problem for high-end architectures by focusing on the following objectives. Develop a runtime system for multi-layered parallel adaptive and irregular applications that can efficiently orchestrate intra- and inter-layer data movement and load balancing. Use the runtime system to design an evolutionary approach for developing multi-layered parallel mesh generation software capable of exposing concurrency from the very beginning of the execution and sustaining up to one quadrillion concurrent work units.</AbstractNarration>
