    <AbstractNarration>Larsen&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807825&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops and studies models for the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of elastic damage (i.e., regions of weakened elastic&lt;br/&gt;properties) and fracture. Difficulties come from, among other&lt;br/&gt;things, the irreversibility of these phenomena, and the fact that&lt;br/&gt;existing models are essentially variational (static). The&lt;br/&gt;general strategy is to first develop quasi-static models that are&lt;br/&gt;consistent with these variational principles, and prove existence&lt;br/&gt;and approximation results. Next, the goal is to extend these&lt;br/&gt;results to the fully dynamic setting. The first step has been&lt;br/&gt;essentially completed for damage and brittle fracture, and the&lt;br/&gt;investigator works on developing corresponding methods for&lt;br/&gt;cohesive fracture. Dynamic models and their analysis are major&lt;br/&gt;open problems for all these phenomena, and are the main focus of&lt;br/&gt;this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Material damage and fracture prediction are of fundamental&lt;br/&gt;importance in the areas of materials and manufacturing, civil&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, etc., yet in the most physically realistic&lt;br/&gt;setting (dynamics) there is no sound mathematical footing, making&lt;br/&gt;engineering models largely ad hoc. The investigator works on&lt;br/&gt;developing this mathematical support, as well as creating and&lt;br/&gt;rigorously justifying algorithms for computing approximate&lt;br/&gt;solutions. The project includes training mathematics Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;students through work on important interdisciplinary problems.</AbstractNarration>
