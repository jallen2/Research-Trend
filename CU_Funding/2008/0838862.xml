    <AbstractNarration>The proposal is to support the Frontiers in Networked Game Theory and Control workshop, to be held at MIT, on October 10-12, 2008. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to bring together leading researchers from Control Theory, Game Theory, and Economics to create a strong interface and facilitate future collaborative research in these areas. The workshop will host leading researchers from across these disciplines and will invite a significant number of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, thereby playing a major educational role as well. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to foster new research and to enable researchers from different disciplines to become familiar with new complementary techniques and approaches. In addition, the attendees will have an opportunity to learn about the latest developments in these fields and share their different perspectives on research questions emerging from the widespread use of game-theoretic techniques in control theory and distributed optimization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will be to lay the foundations for future cooperation among researchers from these various disciplines and to introduce students and junior researchers to new and exciting directions. With the growing demands on large-scale distributed control coming from networked-systems in many different applications, the topics covered in this conference are becoming increasingly important in both academia and industry. Such a conference, in bringing together experts from different disciplines, is very timely, and its broad impact will be in both academic research and applications.</AbstractNarration>
