    <AbstractNarration>0755702&lt;br/&gt;Nessler &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robotic Locomotor Training and Muscle Atrophy in the Rat Model of Spinal Cord Injury&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will investigate the effects of a robotic gait training algorithm on the preservation of lower extremity muscle mass and strength, and the molecular mechanisms involved in skeletal muscle atrophy/hypertrophy in the rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives for this project are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop a novel version of the rat stepper that includes force sensors to measure interaction forces between the device and the animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Examine the effects of using a robotic training algorithm to increase plantarflexion torque during stance in spinal cord injured rats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Examine the effects of eight weeks of robotic gait training on hindlimb muscle mass, crosssectional area, and the atrophy/hypertrophy molecular signaling cascades following SCI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locomotor training will be performed using a specially designed, robotic gait device, patterned after a previous model developed by the PI (i.e. the 'rat stepper'). Select modifications to this device will make possible the measurement of interaction forces between the animal and the robot, as well as muscle forces generated during stepping. Muscle strength will be measured in vivo as the animal steps in the robotic device using inverse dynamic techniques. In vitro measures of muscle function will include muscle mass, cross-sectional area, and molecular signaling cascades related to skeletal muscle atrophy/hypertrophy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIGNATURE &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marshall M.
