    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary Research on Aging at Washington University was developed to extend meaningful research opportunities in aging to talented undergraduates. This proposal was developed out of the belief that, commensurate with its history of outstanding research in aging, Washington University should take a leading role in promoting and developing careers in aging for talented undergraduates by providing them an opportunity to gain access to and experience with issues in aging. The proposal calls for recruiting 10 undergraduate participants for an 8-week summer program at Washington University designed to provide research experience and instruction in a diverse set of areas related to aging. The activities will fall into three categories. First, the majority (80-85%) of the student's time will be spent with their mentor in the laboratory setting. Researchers in the fields of psychology, biology, social work, civil engineering, and graphic design will serve as mentors. The students will work on a hands-on project during the eight-week session and present their project with their mentor during a research symposium the final week of the program. Second, the remaining 15-20 % time will be spent in seminar sessions, informal discussion sessions, lab tours, and brown bag "lunch and learn" ethics in science sessions. Third, the students will have the opportunity to participate together in social outings outside of the training program, including a St. Louis Cardinal's ballgame, a botanical garden tour, and an overnight retreat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Most undergraduates have limited opportunities to gain information about, and experience with, current issues in aging. The proposed REU site in aging has been designed to address this problem by providing an opportunity for extensive collaboration between an established investigator in aging and students interested in one or more aspects of the discipline. We have developed the program to be multifaceted so that participants will increase their familiarity with the extant literature, gain general research skills, obtain experience with investigations in aging, and understand some of the ethical considerations specific to aging research. An important aspect of this application is developing an appreciation for the multidisciplinary nature of aging research in the next generation of aging investigators. We also view the establishment of an REU site administered through the Center for Aging as an opportunity to complement many of the ongoing activities in WUCFA. For example, an undergraduate research program in aging will encourage even greater interaction among WUCFA faculty and has the potential to facilitate collaboration in developing new research projects related to aging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The proposed REU site will have a number of broader impacts for the participants, faculty, WUCFA, and Washington University. First, the intensive collaboration between faculty and participants provides an ideal model for integrating discovery and teaching. By contributing to state-of-the-art research projects, REU participants and faculty will have the opportunity to make important contributions to different fields of aging. At the same time, faculty will provide intellectual and professional role models for participants and thereby encourage and support the next generation of researchers in aging. In this regard, an important aspect of the current proposal is the fostering of long-term relationships between mentors and participants. We have therefore included a number of components, such as a provision to provide support for participants to attend conferences and a long-term follow-up plan, as critical elements in maintaining strong professional relationships between mentors and participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, a strong emphasis will be placed on recruiting underrepresented groups and individuals with limited opportunities to conduct research. Thus, the proposed REU site will attract highly capable minority students and other individuals who would not typically have an opportunity to enter the field of aging. With the average age of the population increasing for the foreseeable future, the ability to provide opportunities for gifted students with limited research opportunities to enter the field is essential to optimize research leading to productive and healthy aging. Moreover, attracting highly qualified individuals from underrepresented groups will serve to strengthen already strong ties between WUCFA and underserved groups within the community.</AbstractNarration>
