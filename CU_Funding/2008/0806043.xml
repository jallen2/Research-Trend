    <AbstractNarration>This proposal supports a senior scientist position to work with the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium (BASC). BASC is funded by NSF through a cooperative agreement with the Arctic Sciences Division. Their purpose is to provide logistics and research support to NSF projects in the Barrow area. The primary objectives of the Senior Scientist are 1) to interface between the diverse spectrum of research projects funded by NSF in Barrow and the logistics provider BASC, 2) to ensure projects receive the appropriate support, 3) to assist in developing research collaborations and resource sharing, 4) to identify common needs and provide input from the research community to BASC, and 5) to act as a science resource for the community to communicate about research. This is a pilot approach to providing a senior scientist that will benefit the Barrow research community in lieu of adding a staff position to BASC. Through San Diego State University, co-PI Dr. Hastings will work as a Senior Scientist in Barrow for one year. Lead PI Dr. Walt Oechel will oversee the performance of the grant activities performed by Dr. Hastings. Dr. Hastings has worked in the Barrow area for more than two decades on a variety of research projects. During that time, he has built a solid working relationship with BASC and within the community of Barrow. This proposal provides a willing and qualified senior scientist to fill the role requested by BASC in a manner that retains Dr. Hastings' affiliation with his university. Dr. Hastings will work directly with BASC staff including the Executive Director Glenn Sheehan, Facilities Manager Lewis Brower, and Project Planner Alice Drake and with NSF program managers facilitating research support in Barrow. His work with high school and college students in the region will help develop a new generation of scientists from Barrow and improve the productivity of NSF-supported projects in Barrow.</AbstractNarration>
