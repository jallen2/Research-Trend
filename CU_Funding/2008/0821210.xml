    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to study the electrical properties of nanoscale material systems, including resistance-change materials, carbon nanofibers, nanotubes, and polymer nanocapsules. The properties of the systems are measured directly by contacting the systems with the nanometer-sized tips of a Zyvex Instruments nanomanipulator, which is connected to external test equipment. Measurements and SEM imaging can thus be done simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issues to be addressed include the scalability of resistance-change materials for advanced nonvolatile memory; the relationship between microstructure, electrical resistance and reliability in interconnects based on carbon nanofiber/s and nanotubes; and the size dependence of the chemical environment for solubilized molecules inside polymer nanocapsules. These topics are of high importance for the continued advancement of digital electronics and the potential development of chemical sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research will be enhanced undergraduate education at Santa Clara University, and improved nanotechnology research capability in the Bay Area. Use of the nanomanipulator in undergraduate research projects at Santa Clara University will provide science and engineering students with advanced training at an early stage in their careers. The unique capabilities of the nanomanipulator will also serve as a focal point for collaborations between Santa Clara Universit and research institutions in the Bay Area, providing two complementary benefits; Santa Clara University undergraduates will gain exposure to nanoscale research that cannot be supported solely by Santa Clara University, and collaborating institutions will gain access to the state-of-the-art capabilities of the nanomanipulator system.</AbstractNarration>
