    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is an instance of SAGE Days (number 11 to be precise), a&lt;br/&gt;periodic gathering where developers of the software package SAGE, a&lt;br/&gt;free and open software that supports research and teaching in algebra,&lt;br/&gt;geometry, number theory, cryptography, and related areas, address&lt;br/&gt;current issues of the software, program for very long hours, either&lt;br/&gt;improving existing code or adding new code, and plan the next steps to&lt;br/&gt;be taken. For example, this workshop includes working on adding to&lt;br/&gt;SAGE the capability to work with modular forms over function&lt;br/&gt;fields. In addition to the above standard features of such a meeting,&lt;br/&gt;this particular workshop includes a strong emphasis in the interaction&lt;br/&gt;betwen algebra and number theory (the area of the bulk of the SAGE&lt;br/&gt;developers and researchers in attendance) and computer science,&lt;br/&gt;supercomputing (from TACC, the Texas supercomputing center) and&lt;br/&gt;applied Mathematics (from ICES, the Institute for Computational&lt;br/&gt;Engineering and Sciences) at the University of Texas at Austin, as&lt;br/&gt;well as researchers working outside academia (from Entought, an Austin&lt;br/&gt;based company).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of this workshop are: (i) to support the development of&lt;br/&gt;the free and open source software SAGE by gathering some of its&lt;br/&gt;developers as well as researchers that use it in their own research;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) to bring together the SAGE commnunity and various research&lt;br/&gt;groups at the host location, the University of Texas at Austin, that&lt;br/&gt;while might have very different research focus share many common&lt;br/&gt;computational problems and needs. To give just one example, being&lt;br/&gt;able to solve large linear algebra problems accurately and fast is a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problem that underlies essentially any type of scientific&lt;br/&gt;computation imaginable. The availability of high level software is&lt;br/&gt;nowadays of crucial and increasing importance for research in&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, both in applied and pure Mathematics. SAGE is an example&lt;br/&gt;of a be very powerful computer package that is at the cutting edge&lt;br/&gt;(in terms of the sophistication of its capabilities as well as its&lt;br/&gt;speed) of existing tools for research in Mathematics and its&lt;br/&gt;applications; particularly, in those areas related to algebra, number&lt;br/&gt;theory, geometry and cryptography. The workshop is planned with the&lt;br/&gt;SAGE development model in mind, distinguished by an emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;openness, community, cooperation, and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
