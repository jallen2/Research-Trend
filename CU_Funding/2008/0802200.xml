    <AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this project is to discover novel viruses in Yellowstone hot springs, and learn what role they play in determining composition and function of the microbial communities in which they exist. The specific objective of the research is to significantly contribute to our understanding of virus diversity, ecology, and evolution. The specific aims are to (i) significantly expand knowledge of virus diversity and (ii) elucidate the mechanism(s) and impacts of virus movement on virus and microbial community structure and dynamics. These aims will be accomplished by temporal sampling and analysis of total virus communities associated with high temperature (&gt;80°C) acidic (pH&lt;4.0) hot springs found in Yellowstone National Park. The effects of virus movement and the mechanism of movement will be investigated experimentally by blocking migration within a hot spring and by directly sampling the air column for viruses, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and scientific importance of this project is to understand how and to what extent viruses influence Earth's ecosystems. This research is aimed at beginning to overcome our ignorance of virus diversity and function in nature due to the limited attention that they have received as compared to their cellular hosts. The broader impacts of this research include, but extend well beyond the training of postdocs and graduate, undergraduate and high school students. These broader impacts encompass development of a dynamic outreach program promoting Yellowstone's thermal environments, including but not limited to, (i) an outreach program that targets K-12 learners and teachers nationally through the development of science curriculum; (ii) a field-based teacher training class; (iii) participation in a variety of community outreach programs including a community lecture series; (iv) participation in field experiences for adults; (v) participation in ParKids, a 3-day thermal biology based learning experience for kids in Yellowstone Gateway communities; and (vi) distribution of national and international film documentaries, radio and popular press articles concerning Yellowstone's thermal biology and our research.</AbstractNarration>
