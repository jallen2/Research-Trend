    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macromolecular and supramolecular chemistries, along with nanomaterials are expanding rapidly; however, it is at the intersections of these disciplines where the creation of novel materials has the most interesting potential and a wide appeal. This research, submitted to the US Egypt International collaboration and funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering, will lead to the construction of new polymeric materials based on cellulose modification and the tools of crystal engineering, self-assembly, and polymer and materials sciences. Specifically, the PIs will explore dendritic and non-dendritic polymeric architectures, based on (1) ligand-metal-ligand assemblies of preconstructed and precisely designed components resulting in macromolecular, network-based architectures; and (2) potential polymeric megastructures obtained by the logical combination of dendrons, metal cations, and cellulosic materials for the construction of precisely positioned components within matricies attached to polymeric scaffolds. Such strategies have afforded advantages in photophysical and electrooptical materials, and as a result of the ability to tailor the properties of the active site(s), it herein is proposed that the construction of metal-containing, polymerized, dendritic networks onto a polymeric array will result in layered regions of nested nanoparticles. The potential surface-protection and electronic interaction of the nested, internal nanoparticles will be evaluated. Application of this process to the formation of poly-layered polymeric surfaces is also envisioned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is in the area of new materials utilizing natural resources. Advancement of discovery and understanding of the proposed work will promote the integration of student training and enrichment, at all education levels, including K-12, undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral and visiting scientists (national and international), by providing appropriately staged conceptual and technical scientific challenges, as well as foster US/Egyptian collaborative efforts. This will facilitate student competence while instilling and nurturing specific elements of critical thinking, requisite for all disciplines. Participation of underrepresented groups and minorities is encouraged through direct support and community outreach projects as well as includes inner-city school presentations and K-12 teacher involvement that broadly promote scientific and technical understanding. Additionally, scientific information about polymeric materials, and dendritic materials in particular, is promulgated through the principal investigator's website (www.dendrimers.com ), which currently averages 6,000-7,000 visits per month.</AbstractNarration>
