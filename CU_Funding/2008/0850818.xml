    <AbstractNarration>The IEEE COMPSAC2009 will be held in Seattle, Washington from July 20 to July 24, 2009. &lt;br/&gt;This preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research &lt;br/&gt;results in the computer systems and software: theory and applications along with a number&lt;br/&gt;of workshops with topics such as Security, Trust, Privacy for software; Barriers towards &lt;br/&gt;Internet-Driven Information Services, Software Cybernetics, Open Complex &lt;br/&gt;System - Metasynthesis of Computing Paradigms, and is widely attended by researchers and&lt;br/&gt;practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as COMPSAC is of paramount&lt;br/&gt;importance for the research and career development of graduate students. Participants&lt;br/&gt;have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote talk sessions, and&lt;br/&gt;interact with many others performing leading-edge research in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to support approximately 12 graduate students in the United &lt;br/&gt;States to attend this premiere conference. The travel awards will target graduate students,&lt;br/&gt;in particular, women and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences&lt;br/&gt;is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel &lt;br/&gt;funds.</AbstractNarration>
