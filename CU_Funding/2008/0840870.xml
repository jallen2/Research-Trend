    <AbstractNarration>The average impact of internationally co-authored research, measured through published papers, is significantly higher than the overall average. Establishment of international collaborations requires international exposure, and such exposure is likely to be most effective when it occurs early in one's education and scientific career. However, for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, the cost of international travel can be prohibitive. This award will provide supplementary travel support for 30 graduate students/postdoctoral fellows working in the area of Animal Behavior to attend the 2009 Animal Behavior Society (ABS) meeting in Brazil. There are several aspects of the meetings that will provide students with exposure to international scientists, including 5 mini-courses (6 hours each) that will be conducted by invited international researchers. Criteria for selection will include quality of the science, likely potential for developing future collaborations, progress in graduate school (students in the last two years of their programs and first two years of postdoctoral fellowships will be given priority), and representation from under-represented groups. Students who receive funds for travel will be asked to complete an evaluation of their experiences at the ABS meetings in Brazil. The broader impacts of this proposal will be the exposure of 30 scientists early in their careers to global initiatives and cultural differences, with the goal of promoting future international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
