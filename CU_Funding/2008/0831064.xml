    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: CT-M: Unification Laboratory for&lt;br/&gt;Cryptographic Protocol Analysis&lt;br/&gt;Institution: SUNY at Albany&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 08/13/08&lt;br/&gt;The ability to reason about different equational theories is very&lt;br/&gt;important to the analysis of cryptographic protocols. An understanding of&lt;br/&gt;how equational properties of a function used by a protocol can be&lt;br/&gt;exploited by an intruder can be invaluable in finding flaws that might&lt;br/&gt;otherwise be missed. Numerous examples exist in the literature and even&lt;br/&gt;in fielded protocols. One very powerful tool for cryptographic protocol&lt;br/&gt;analysis with equational theories is equational unification. Equational&lt;br/&gt;Unification was the basis of the NRL Protocol Analyzer (Maude-NPA). Its&lt;br/&gt;use of these theories allowed it to both reproduce existing flaws and find&lt;br/&gt;new ones at a level of precision way beyond that available to other tools&lt;br/&gt;at its time. This suggests that equational unification if properly&lt;br/&gt;extended, can give support in a similar fashion to analysis of&lt;br/&gt;cryptographic protocols that use functions that obey more expressive&lt;br/&gt;equational theories. The aim of this project is to provide a&lt;br/&gt;laboratory for equational unification that will develop the algorithms&lt;br/&gt;and techniques that can be used to support the use of equational&lt;br/&gt;unification in cryptographic protocol analysis. This effort will&lt;br/&gt;consist of two parts: the development of unification algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;theories of interest to cryptographic protocol analysis, and the development&lt;br/&gt;of new techniques for employing unification in cryptographic protocol&lt;br/&gt;analysis. The project will help in the design and implementation of next&lt;br/&gt;generation tools for protocol analysis. Tools developed in the project&lt;br/&gt;will be made available to other researchers working on formal protocol&lt;br/&gt;analysis methods as well as to protocol designers for experimentation. The&lt;br/&gt;educational component of the project will involve undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students at both institutions.</AbstractNarration>
