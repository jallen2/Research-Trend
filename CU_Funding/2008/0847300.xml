    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Oligocene microfossil Konservat-Lagerstätte: Implications for planktonic foraminiferal taxonomy, paleobiology, and marine temperatures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bridget Wade&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M University EAR-0847300&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Earth today has major ice caps on Antarctica and Greenland, but this was not always the case. This research focuses on climate change during a time period known as the Oligocene (34 to 24 million years ago). This interval of time began with a big shift in climate, when a large ice sheet developed on Antarctica. Once the Antarctic ice cap was established, it waxed and waned many times between periods with relatively little ice and periods with very expansive ice sheets. However, the impact of these large variations in Antarctic ice volume upon tropical sea surface temperatures and marine biota are largely unknown. Previous estimates of Oligocene sea surface temperatures from microfossil geochemistry indicate tropical and subtropical temperatures that were substantially lower than modern. But there is a problem in previous studies: microfossil shell geochemistry can be altered post deposition and bias temperature reconstructions. To address this problem, PI will examine microfossils from sites with exceptional preservation (Konservat-Lagerstätte). A detailed study of well preserved microfossils will build an accurate picture of how the Oligocene climate changed and will lead to a greater understanding of Oligocene climatic events and the impact on tropical biota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be integrated with a number of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate activities that involve project-based discovery learning. In partnership with the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program at Texas A&amp;M, PI will expand a successful pilot program for minority high school students, Summer pre-College Ocean Research Experience (SCORE), which emphasizes integrated research experiences in ocean sciences. A permanent exhibit on polar climates and the history of Antarctica will be designed and PI will create 3D podcasts of microfossils "micropods" for incorporation into teaching activities.</AbstractNarration>
