    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Materials Science and Engineering (57)&lt;br/&gt;The majority of students who are learning about materials in undergraduate courses do so without the benefit of a hands-on laboratory. Through this project, a computer game is being developed to integrate an open-ended approach to a laboratory experience where students can apply their lecture-based knowledge. The Gaming for Applied Materials Engineering (GAME) software includes reporting, interaction, and simulated hands-on experience. GAME incorporates experimental roadblocks into the software that are similar to those that would normally be encountered during a real lab experience. Group interactions are also being promoted through the generation of student group posters that are uploaded into a special gallery within the game. The students are assisted and queried through the game by the "Super-Tech" lab technician. Safety and lab protocols are an integral part of the game system. Student learning and motivation are being rigorously assessed throughout the project.</AbstractNarration>
