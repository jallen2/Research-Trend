    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing critical financial support to approximately 20 young women who have shown promise in their first year studies, specifically in the College's gateway courses in Biology. Ten returning sophomores are then selected in each of two consecutive years to become BioScholars. These students are enrolled in an Honors Colloquium in Biology and in workshops to assist them to obtain scientific internships, admission to graduate school, and/or employment in one of the life sciences. In addition, a Biology tutor has been hired in the College's Learning Resource Center to provide support for students in the program. Each participant receives a scholarship to help close the gap between their existing aid and the cost of attendance. This award is adjusted annually and follows each Bioscholar through to graduation as long as need and eligibility continue. In addition, other science students at the College may participate in certain activities within the program on a space available basis, increasing the impact of BioScholars.</AbstractNarration>
