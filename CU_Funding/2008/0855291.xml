    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). It will provide funds to pursue the analysis of IceCube data. IceCube is a high-energy neutrino telescope currently under construction at the South Pole. Half of the detector has been installed and is being operated. Once completed in 2011, the in-ice component will have a volume of one cubic kilometer. IceCube's main objective is the observation of high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. It is strongly connected with other experiments in the field of astroparticle physics and its results can be used for a multi-messenger survey of the high-energy sky. The group plans to make contributions in three areas of research:&lt;br/&gt;1. Search for neutrinos in coincidence with gamma-ray bursts: detection would prove these objects to be the source of the highest energy cosmic rays. &lt;br/&gt;2. Search for high-energy neutrinos from core collapse supernovae: a discovery would significantly enhance our understanding of supernovae.&lt;br/&gt;3. Observation of atmospheric neutrinos via the cascade channel: to date, high-energy atmospheric neutrinos have not yet been observed with the cascade channel. Increasing the detector size and improvements in reconstruction algorithms and background rejection techniques will allow IceCube to make this observation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the program include activities involving elementary, middle and high schools particularly where a large fraction of the student body is of Latin-American descent.</AbstractNarration>
