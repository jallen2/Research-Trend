    <AbstractNarration>IIS-0808994&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jonathan Furner&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;$34,880 - 12 mos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;i-Conference Doctoral Research Colloquium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 12-month standard award to support a Doctoral Colloquium program at the i-Schools i-Conference to be held on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles (February 28 - March 1, 2008). This will bring together 30 dissertation-stage doctoral students in diverse information and informatics subfields for one day of talks and interaction with 9-10 faculty members selected from among distinguished information researchers. This project provides support for the travel, lodging and registration of students, plus the registration for the participating faculty mentors, as well as the direct expenses of putting on the Doctoral Colloquium at the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the i-Conference Doctoral Colloquium is the students' doctoral dissertations. These represent state-of-the-art research in the field of information. The Doctoral Colloquium provides an opportunity both for these projects to be shaped through intellectual exchange and to communicate the character of the work to a key group of young professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The i-Conference Doctoral Colloquium brings together the best of the next generation of information researchers. This allows them to create a social network both among themselves and with several senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession. Since the students and faculty are a very diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific roots, methods), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.</AbstractNarration>
