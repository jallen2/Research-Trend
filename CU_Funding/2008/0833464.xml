    <AbstractNarration>This research program consists of three lines of investigation, each &lt;br/&gt;connected to multivariate analogues of generalized hypergeometric &lt;br/&gt;functions. The first concerns a family of biorthogonal abelian &lt;br/&gt;functions associated to elliptic curves that generalize multivariate &lt;br/&gt;orthogonal polynomials due to Macdonald and Koornwinder. The second &lt;br/&gt;aspect involves certain multivariate analogues of quadratic &lt;br/&gt;transformations of hypergeometric functions, which generalize identities &lt;br/&gt;from the theory of symmetric spaces; related to this is the study of &lt;br/&gt;natural deformations of permutation actions of Coxeter groups to &lt;br/&gt;representations of the associated Hecke algebras, some of which have led &lt;br/&gt;to proofs of multivariate quadratic transformations. Finally, the &lt;br/&gt;investigator will be studying multivariate elliptic hypergeometric &lt;br/&gt;(contour) integrals, with a view to understanding the functional &lt;br/&gt;equations satisfied by such integrals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, the study of "special functions" originated in the fact &lt;br/&gt;that quite a few functions of interest in applications turned out to be &lt;br/&gt;members of a single family, the hypergeometric functions. The new &lt;br/&gt;family of functions the investigator is studying is a significant &lt;br/&gt;generalization of this family, combining several existing &lt;br/&gt;generalizations (each with their own applications and connections to &lt;br/&gt;other areas of mathematics) under one roof. In addition to the &lt;br/&gt;potential that new applications may arise, this investigation should &lt;br/&gt;also lead to a greater understanding of the existing families.</AbstractNarration>
