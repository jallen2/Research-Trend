    <AbstractNarration>This project provides undergraduate scholarships in computer science, computer information systems, mathematics, and physics (CMP) programs to academically talented, but financially needy, students. The CMP Scholars Program is designed to: &lt;br/&gt;(a) Increase the number of African American college graduates that enter the nation's science, technology, and academic workforce.&lt;br/&gt;(b) Support and mentor two cohorts of scholars through four years at the university.&lt;br/&gt;(c) Enhance the knowledge and professional readiness of CMP scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The cohort of interdisciplinary scholars (1) meet regularly with CMP faculty advisors and each other to build a supportive CMP community; (2) enroll in common computer science and mathematics courses; (3) attend extracurricular activities to enhance their academic background; (4) connect knowledge with experiences by reflecting on academic work using CMP scholar portfolios, and (5) participate in high quality undergraduate research during each scholarship year. Scholars have increased retention rates, more content knowledge, extensive research experience, curiosity about their field, increased graduation rates, and self-assessment portfolios to better navigate their myriad career choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The program recruits and selects students from the New Orleans metropolitan area that, like Xavier, is predominately African American. Scholars' research experiences enhance the linkage between research and education; and the scholars are role models for other underrepresented students in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
