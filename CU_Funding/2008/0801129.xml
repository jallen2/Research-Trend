    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Xu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves studying problems in noncommutative geometry using tools&lt;br/&gt;from operator algebras, in particular groupoid C*-algebras. Xu proposes to&lt;br/&gt;continue the study of twisted K-theory over differentiable stacks using&lt;br/&gt;KK-theory of C*-algebras, based on the theory developed by Tu,&lt;br/&gt;Laurent, and himself. The problems include studying the periodic cyclic&lt;br/&gt;homology of convolution algebras of proper Lie groupoids, investigating the&lt;br/&gt;relation between the twisted K0-group and the Grothendieck group of twisted&lt;br/&gt;vector bundles over groupoids, studying the Chern-Connes character map for&lt;br/&gt;twisted K-theory, and studying the ring structure on global twisted&lt;br/&gt;cohomology. The project also aims to study C*-algebras associated to&lt;br/&gt;non-abelian gerbes and 2-groupoids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of noncommutative geometry in the sense of Connes is to study geometry via algebras of functions on ?noncommutative manifolds.? On such a ?noncommutative manifold,? the relevant objects are no longer points in a space, but rather an associative algebra, which may not be commutative. Nevertheless, many notions in classical (commutative) geometry including vector bundles, connections, K-theory, (co-)homology, elliptic pseudo-differential operators, Chern characters, and measures can be generalized to noncommutative settings arising naturally from geometric situations. In string theory, space-time is modeled by a new kind of mathematical structure called gerbes. A very useful way to think of the stringy space-time is to consider it as a ?noncommutative space? in the sense of Connes. Such a noncommutative space can be constructed using the convolution algebra of a certain groupoid. The project, which is centered on the application of noncommutative geometry and operator algebras, is to investigate questions motivated from mathematical physics by a combination of ideas from algebraic and differential geometry, noncommutative geometry, operator algebras, and KK-theory, and thus the project promotes further interaction between these fields.</AbstractNarration>
