    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this proposal is to request funding MEMS Education Workshop. Which will be held in Tucson, AR on January 13, 2008? This workshop will precede the International MEMS 2008 Conference, which provides an ideal and convenient venue for broad international participation. The funding is to be used for increasing the participation of students and junior faculty in this workshop. In this workshop the attendees will share and discuss best MEMS educational practices amongst an international group of academic and industrial participants from the US, Europe, and Asia. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will disseminate MEMS educational practices at all levels, will discuss curricula that effectively prepare students for the future workforce, and share information across interdisciplinary and international barriers. While the educational systems are fundamentally different internationally, US programs need to train students to be competitive in the global workforce and the perspectives gained from the diverse group of attendees will facilitate the development of creative and effective ways to teach MEMS globally. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will have broad impact for the entire international MEMS community and for engineering education. The knowledge gained and experiences shared from the workshop will be captured electronically and broadly disseminated via a website. Benefiting from the recommendations and improved teaching and training, students will be better prepared for both MEMS research and MEMS-focused careers. In addition, effective educational improvement will help spawn innovations and create ground breaking MEMS technologies, and hence benefit the society at large</AbstractNarration>
