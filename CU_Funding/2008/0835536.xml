    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0835536&lt;br/&gt;Cohen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel funds are requested to partially support the participation of 24 US university students from across the country at the International Congress on Membranes (ICOM) July 13-18, 2008 in Honolulu, Hawaii. The funds will be used to assist those students who are participating as authors or co-authors in oral and poster presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will be used to cover registration, housing, and airfare costs for students attending the meeting. Funds will be used to provide 24 stipends of $500 each. Additional travel support for students has been solicited from various companies that are engaged in the manufacturing of membranes, working in the general area of membrane technology or with a stake in membrane science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will be given the opportunity to attend conference sessions, and interact with academics and professionals from around the world. The student participants will interact and discuss various aspects of membrane science and technology with leading scientists from around the world, get feedback on their own research work, and advance their own knowledge of the sate-of-the-art in membrane science and its technological applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICOM 2008, the largest membrane technology meeting in the world (held every three years), will consist of 54 cutting-edge technical sessions on fundamental and applied membrane science and technology. Over 1,000 membrane researchers are expected from all various parts of the world representing industry, government, and academic institutions. ICOM 2008 is organized by the North American Membrane Society (NAMS) and is co-sponsored by the three major membrane societies in the world, NAMS, the European Membrane Society, and the Aseanian Membrane Society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student support will also have broad impacts as it will increase the international visibility of U.S. Universities, demonstrate the high level of student research in the U.S., and help to attract an upcoming young generation of professionals to the rapidly growing areas of membrane science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
