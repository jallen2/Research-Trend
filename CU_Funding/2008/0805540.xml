    <AbstractNarration>AST-0805540&lt;br/&gt;Novak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the Martian atmosphere by (1) mapping ozone diurnally and latitudinally above and below 20 km; (2) mapping HDO and H2O diurnally and latitudinally; and (3) searching for trace species and undiscovered absorption (or emission) bands in the one to five micron range. It will provide useful scientific information both for modeling the Martian atmosphere and for future space missions. Current work has measured ozone in the middle atmosphere (20-50 km) and this study will complement those values by measuring the total column density of ozone, thus giving insight into the vertical distribution of the gas. New Deuterium-to-Hydrogen ratio (D/H) measurements will add a diurnal component to existing values taken along the sub-Earth meridian of Mars. Data will come primarily from CSHELL on the NASA IRTF, Phoenix on Gemini South and SOAR, and NIRSPEC on Keck II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An integral part of this research is to engage undergraduate students, who reduce and analyze data, participate in observing runs, and present their findings at meetings. The project will be conducted at Iona College, an undergraduate institution, but with wider exposure through collaborators at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Talks given to meetings on undergraduate education and to local community groups will incorporate the results.</AbstractNarration>
