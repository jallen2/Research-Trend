    <AbstractNarration>The intent of this proposal is to organize the first international workshop devoted to evaluate options for "Expanding Renewable Energy to Reduce Global Emissions - A Case Study for US and Africa". The workshop will involve energy experts, researchers, and university scholars / students as well as policy makers and market players as participants and invited speakers at plenary and panel sessions. The venue for the workshop in Sub-Saharan Africa will provide the US participants with knowledge of renewable energy issues and related environmental problems on the African continent that may affect climate change on a global scale. In addition, it promotes interaction and collaboration of US participants with colleagues from Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the proposed workshop include (1) new understanding of renewable energy resource applications for achieving its adaptation to Climate Change impacts; (2) development of fundamental understanding of computation methods for mitigation and control of energy use as well as identification of necessary control applications and computational intelligence needed to address environmental pollution from greenhouse gases; and (3) understanding new trends in US and Sub-Saharan African power industry that are focused on meeting the energy balance through various energy sources through development of innovative ways to tackle global climate change issues; cost benefit and social implications of renewable energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include (1) promoting and developing renewable energy resources to meet energy demand and promote national security; (2) promoting integration of research and education activities and training of students among US and Africa collaborations on areas of climate change and renewable energy and the economic and social impacts on standards of living; (3) promoting activities that lead to joint research activities between US and African participants as documented by increased joint journal publications.</AbstractNarration>
