    <AbstractNarration>Blackfeet Community College, Little Big Horn College, and Montana State University will collaborate in a project which will provide research experience, mentoring, and academic enrichment to students at the three schools. A total of 30 students over a five-year period will participate in the project beginning Summer 2009. Students from the three schools will engage in 2-year cohorts where they will they will do research in ecology, environmental science and microbiology projects relevant to their lives and career goals. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Missouri and Yellowstone River systems, numerous mountain ranges and the Northern Great Plains will provide diverse ecosystems and opportunities for research. The collaborative network will enhance student opportunities on all three campuses and will also support graduates of LBHC and BCC as they transition to MSU for their bachelor?s degrees. The student participants will be mentored by science faculty and by Native American professional biologists in developing academic and research skills to prepare them to complete baccalaureate degrees and continue on in graduate school. The overall goal of the project is to increase the number of Native Americans completing bachelor?s degrees and entering graduate programs in ecology, in environmental science and in biological fields. More information is available from Cindy Doore (cindy_doore@fbcc.org) at Blackfeet Community College, from Neva Tallbear (tallbear@lbhc.cc.mt.us) at Little Big Horn College, and from John Watts (jwatts@montana.edu) at Montana State University.
