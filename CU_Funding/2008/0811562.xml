    <AbstractNarration>This project involves the design and building of&lt;br/&gt;a knowledge base (KB) system that&lt;br/&gt;learns to more accurately integrate the many heterogeneous sources of&lt;br/&gt;information that are relevant to a single scientist's research needs.&lt;br/&gt;The system works by loosely integrating data of many sorts (including&lt;br/&gt;unstructured text) into a single typed directed graph, and then&lt;br/&gt;querying the graph using a query language that allows "schema-free&lt;br/&gt;similarity queries". These queries specify a set of query terms&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. keywords, entities in the KB, etc) and constraints on the&lt;br/&gt;desired output (e.g. a target data type). The result of a query is a&lt;br/&gt;ranked list of KB entities, ordered by similarity to the query terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a query, a user can optionally label any subset of the ranked&lt;br/&gt;list of suggested answers as ``relevant'' or ``non-relevant''. These&lt;br/&gt;labels drive a learning phase, the goal of which is to produce a&lt;br/&gt;better ranking. Types of learning currently being investigated&lt;br/&gt;include EM-based parameter turning, learning to discriminatively&lt;br/&gt;re-rank, and learning to restructure the graph (by adding or deleting&lt;br/&gt;edges or vertexes). Queries collected in the laboratory of working&lt;br/&gt;biologists are used to evaluate these learning methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broadest impact of this project is on the problem of learning to&lt;br/&gt;integrate heterogeneous data sources (including free text and&lt;br/&gt;structured data). However, if successful, the KB system will have&lt;br/&gt;broad impact in the biological research community; in particular, we&lt;br/&gt;believe that adaptive personal KB systems of this sort will be a&lt;br/&gt;valuable complement to existing biological KBs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on this project can be found at&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/querendipity/</AbstractNarration>
