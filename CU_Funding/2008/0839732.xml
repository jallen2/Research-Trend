    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a cell and blood compatible, non-clotting drug-eluting prosthetic artery that can release, in a controlled manner, drugs or other small compounds that can inhibit scarring and clotting. Potential drug candidates will be loaded using various concentrations and conditions, in order to determine the release rate and dosing that should be used to move the technology forward towards human application. It is expected that grafts will show controlled release and an effect on vascular cells tested in the lab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include the development of engineering principles that will facilitate the fabrication of drug-eluting grafts that could potentially be useful in: a) procedures to correct blood flow occlusion due to peripheral artery disease, b) vascular access grafts for hemodialysis patients, and c) procedures where traditional prosthetic grafts cannot be used such as coronary artery bypass. This innovative technology and product has the potential to reduce the incidence of limb amputation and have a significant impact on the care of patients with vascular disease.</AbstractNarration>
