    <AbstractNarration>The overall stability and health of coral reefs is declining world-wide at an unprecedented rate. Mass coral bleaching, wherein exposure to elevated temperature leads to the loss of significant numbers of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp., commonly called zooxanthellae) and/or photosynthetic pigments, serves as a primary global example of how fragile this symbiosis is. While we have begun to understand the ecological and physiological impacts of bleaching, there remain key fundamental gaps in knowledge. In particular, it is becoming increasingly clear that a) not all corals either respond to, or recover from, bleaching events the same way, and that b) the impact of annual or repeated bleaching events on corals has not been examined in sufficient detail. Several non-mutually exclusive ecological and physiological pathways could impact how a particular coral species succumbs to or recovers from bleaching. Recent evidence suggests that the following features may play key roles for coral survival in the face of future seawater warming and mass bleaching events: 1) shifts in trophic partitioning (e.g., proportional reliance on autotrophy and heterotrophy) and energy reserve utilization, 2) enhanced thermal tolerance through host and algal-mediated physiological responses, and 3) harboring of different Symbiodinium phylotypes. However, these mechanisms have yet to be investigated in a unified approach that covers the entire coral holobiont system (algae, host tissue, and skeleton), or under scenarios of repeated bleaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objectives of this study are as follows: 1) to determine the effect of single and repeated bleaching on the physiology, biogeochemistry, and recovery of some Caribbean coral species, and 2) to determine which Symbiodinium-type and host-species combinations are more resilient to single and repeated bleaching, what aspects of their physiology and biogeochemistry render them resilient, and to use this information to evaluate the long-term persistence of Caribbean coral reefs. To address these objectives, the following physiological variables will be measured: 1) Symbiodinium type, photochemical function and algal stress physiology, and 2) animal host energy reserves, defense enzyme concentration, skeletal growth, and feeding capacity in the corals Porites porites, Porites astreoides, and Montastraea faveolata. Corals will be examined immediately following thermal stress designed to approximate natural bleaching, and recovery will be monitored over short and long-term time scales. Next, the impact of repeated bleaching will be examined in the subsequent year, followed by examination over the next recovery period. This research is designed to simultaneously evaluate the symbiotic algae, coral host, and skeleton, and to identify patterns of physiological responses and recovery of each Symbiodinium-type and host-species combination that would be indicative of the resilience capacity of Caribbean corals to future more frequent thermal perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research should significantly increase understanding of how (or if) reef corals can survive future climate change. This is especially critical for Caribbean corals where sensitivity appears to have a very low threshold, and where bleaching is predicted to occur biannually within the next 20-30 years. Such information is key for the effective future management of coral reefs. This project will incorporate the training of two PhD students and several undergraduates, and the PIs will incorporate the research findings into their teaching. Several female and Hispanic students (both minorities in marine sciences) are mentored by the PIs. In addition, collaborative efforts between Grottoli and Warner will be enhanced by the field research monitoring efforts of the Central Caribbean Marine Institute at the Little Cayman Research Center, and the remote-sensing-based products from colleagues at the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program. Results of the research will be broadly disseminated through peer reviewed publications, presentations at scientific conferences, and online via the PI's respective websites.</AbstractNarration>
