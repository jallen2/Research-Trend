    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves precise measurements of the properties of the lead flouride molecule to hunt for a property of the electron known as its electric dipole moment or EDM.   This hunt continues a 58-year-old search initiated by Nobel prize winning physicists Edward Purcell and Norman Ramsey.  Because probes of the electron's EDM are on such a tiny scale, the relevant Physics is that of tremendous energies. The discovery of an electron EDM would require a change in our understanding of the laws of physics on the most fundamental level, and could help explain the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the Universe.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an electron EDM is found, it would impact broad areas of science including Elementary Particle Physics and Cosmology. The fundamental nature of this work captures the imagination of the public and attracts students to the study of science. This experiment will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in cutting edge techniques in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. Many of the undergraduate students participating in this research are women and/or minorities.</AbstractNarration>
