    <AbstractNarration>The University of Texas at El Paso REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summer of 2009 through 2012. The Site will host eight students in a ten-week summer Research Experience for Undergraduates Program. The main goal of the program is to provide participating students with a nurturing and exciting environment in which to obtain the tools, information, and research experience that encourages the pursuit of graduate careers. Students are required to engage in a research project under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Students will be trained to address questions in various areas of basic biology utilizing molecular and cellular techniques. Students also attend two weekly meetings, a "Career Development Workshop" and "Careers in Science Seminar Series". The first workshop provides the students with the tools to enhance both their oral and written communication skills and the second seminar series introduces students to careers in science. Throughout the summer, several social activities are organized to help students get acquainted with each other, with the University, and with the surrounding area. At the conclusion of the program, the students present their research accomplishments in both written and oral reports. Although not strictly limited to the immediate geographical area, the program will focus its recruitment efforts on students who are from the southwest U.S.- Mexico border region. Students from underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged to apply. More information is available by visiting http://www.reu.utep.edu, or by contacting the Program Director, Dr. Garza, at kgarza@utep.edu.</AbstractNarration>
