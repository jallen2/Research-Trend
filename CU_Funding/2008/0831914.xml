    <AbstractNarration>Cross-Layer Designs for Streaming Video in Multihop Wireless Mesh Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As unprecedented advances on wireless mesh networks continue, there is an increasing expectation on such networks to support content-rich multimedia communications (e.g., video and voice) in addition to simple data communications. Given the resource constraints and the uncertainties or variable nature of resource availability, quality of service (QoS) provisioning in wireless meshes is a challenging task. These constraints coupled with the requirements for supporting video traffic, layer-specific and isolated solutions are not adequate; hence, arises the need for cross-layer and integrated design approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the researcher will pursue cross-layer approaches to support video streaming over wireless mesh networks. The work will be primarily based on experimental studies, backed by theoretical analysis, and evaluated on an existing wide-area mesh test-bed. Intellectual components of the project are: (a) Experimental characterization of video streaming in wireless mesh networks; (b) Exploring cross-layer schemes for admission control and scheduling of video flows; (c) Exploiting packet retransmissions for quality enhancement of video streaming; (d) Experimental validation of the proposed schemes using the existing test-bed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the project will have a broader impact on the society as well as the education and training of the students. Video streaming over wireless mesh would enhance and facilitate remote monitoring facilities and enable new applications. Several parts of the project will be integrated with the educational missions at UC Davis, both at graduate and undergraduate level. Dissemination of the results and inferences will also incite further research in the broader community.</AbstractNarration>
