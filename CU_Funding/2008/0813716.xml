    <AbstractNarration>The importance of understanding how stocks and flows of human resources in science and technology is critical. Developing indicators for international indicators that can be used across countries would have broad intellectual interest. This proposal seeks to inventory thef micro data sets that might be used to study the implication of human resources on science and technology (HRST).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, a workshop would be held with a panel of experts (academics) from different countries having experience in conducting econometric studies from the selected datasets. The objective of the workshop would be to define and develop 3-4 proposals for comparative econometric work to be conducted subsequently in parallel in the countries represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the proposal, by suggesting micro-econometric work on the role played by HRST in economic performance, addresses the need for micro-economic models as raised by John Marburger, Director of the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, as part of building a new social science discipline.</AbstractNarration>
