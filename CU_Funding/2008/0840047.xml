    <AbstractNarration>Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this effort is to enable the development of high speed atomic force microscopy. The approach is to research a transformational concept in high speed positioning: using lithographically manufactured arrays of coils for magnetic actuation of a probe tip. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed approach entails the development of an integrated electronics solution by way of the following: (1) replace the conventional piezo-actuation by an array of coils, as opposed to a single coil, that provides electromagnetic actuation; (2) reduce the delay in actuation to below micro-seconds; (3) investigate the efficient use of multiple cantilevers to image in parallel where various arrays on the same die can be dedicated to several cantilever imagers. For higher resolution high speed imaging, the range can be sub-divided among the probes to image sub-regions in parallel. The project will also address the issues of synchronization among the imaging drivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed effort is in the cross-disciplinary knowledge outcome of the research that would encompass integrated electronics, systems, and biology. It is anticipated that such knowledge, with the help of the research assistant, would be integrated in one current class in electronics and medical imaging. It will also be disseminated through the website for this course. The investigator will include one undergraduate female student currently working in his laboratory on chip testing activities for this project.</AbstractNarration>
