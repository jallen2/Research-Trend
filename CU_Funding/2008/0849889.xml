    <AbstractNarration>This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures and programs. Students from underrepresented groups are being especially targeted for support and student scholars are enrolled in undergraduate or graduate programs in computer science. The scholarship program builds on a successful CSEMS program on campus and includes targeted, deliberate activities aimed at building a community of scholars. The scholars are participating in seminars, internships, service learning activities, and mentoring. Students are working closely with faculty who assist them in the development of graduation goals and a career plan. Career counseling sessions provided to the scholars cover topics such as developing organization skills, time management, team-building, improving communication skills, intercultural sensitivity, conflict resolution and professional ethics. The results from the project are being rigorously evaluated through a variety of measures.</AbstractNarration>
