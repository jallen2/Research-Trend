    <AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: 0845983 &lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Wireless Network-on-Chip: A New Communication Paradigm for Heterogeneous Gigascale MPSoCs&lt;br/&gt;PI name: Zhao, Danella &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Louisiana at Lafayette &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Many-core System-on-Chip (MCSoC) designs are rapidly emerging, where hundreds or even thousands of IP cores are integrated on a single die. Such MCSoC devices allow superior performance gains while side-stepping the power and heat dissipation limitations of clock frequency scaling. Consequently, the on-chip communication fabric becomes the performance determinant. This project aims at developing a new on-chip communication system, dubbed Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) to sustain the exponential growth of computing performance in the next generation gigascale heterogeneous MCSoCs. The PI lays out the research directions of WNoC from various crucial aspects. The UWB physical layer will be explored to accomplish high data-rate, high bandwidth and low-power wireless on-chip communication. The system architecture will be designed in a way that decouples communication from computation, and a reconfigurable RF infrastructure will be developed to address the heterogeneity of MCSoC. The layered protocol will be specially designed to tackle distinct features of WNoC from conventional wireless networks and to simplify the hardware implementation. Highly compact and configurable RF nodes will be designed to support heterogeneous architecture and customization for specific application mapping. A suite of development and prototyping activities will be carried out to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of WNoC. Some breakthroughs could be forthcoming in the area of intra-chip RF/wireless interconnect network for high performance computing in the upcoming nanoscale MCSoC paradigm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boarder Impact: This project will have a very broad impact on the on-going and future research in Nanodevices for high performance computation. Innovative pedagogical methods for classroom instruction will be explored. Research opportunities will be offered for minority and female students. It will foster the partnerships with industry and government laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
