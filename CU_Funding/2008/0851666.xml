    <AbstractNarration>EEC -0851666&lt;br/&gt;P.I. - Sheng-Jen Hsieh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two year REU site program at Texas A&amp;M University will provide an opportunity for ten undergraduate students per year to participate in hands-on research focused on the use of imaging techniques to characterize biomarkers and biomaterials. In addition to the research projects, students will participate in weekly research seminars, field trips, and career development workshops. They will be required to write a report and present the results of their research to their REU peers and at an REU poster session on campus. After completing the program, participates will be encouraged to polish their reports in order to present at a national conference and/or publish in an academic journal. Participants in this program will benefit from the activities coordinated with other REU and summer research programs at the university, shared housing accommodations with other REU and summer school students, and special programs for minority students offered by the Associate Dean for Diversity in the College of Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU site program is to help participants learn and understand the research process, to acquire laboratory skills, and to prepare for graduate school and career success. Recruitment efforts will be targeted to participants from underrepresented groups in engineering and science and students who have limited opportunities to participate in research at their home institutions. All participants in this REU site program will come from outside the host university.</AbstractNarration>
