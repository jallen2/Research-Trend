    <AbstractNarration>In this research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, a powerful combination of x-ray spectroscopies will be used to measure the surface, bulk and interface electronic structure of organic semiconductors. These new semiconductors are the subject of great interest due to the promise they hold for the development of advanced, flexible, carbon-based electronic devices. This program will measure the fundamental electronic properties of these materials in thin film form, as well as how they interact with their physical environment. It aims to produce definitive spectroscopic measurements of electronic structure in organic semiconductors which have hitherto been missing, and thus transform our understanding of such materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This program will have broad impact in three areas. First, this project will have a significant impact on the education of students and postdoctoral research associates by exposing them to a highly collaborative research environment at national synchrotron radiation x-ray user facilities. Second, this program will have a broad impact on scientific infrastructure by supporting the full utilization of a state-of-the-art multi-technique x-ray spectrometer system. This apparatus is a significant infrastructure enhancement at a national user facility. Finally, this program is interdisciplinary and collaborative by its very nature. The successful application of these measurement techniques to organic systems will potentially have broad impact in a number of areas of chemistry, physics, materials science, and electrical engineering.</AbstractNarration>
