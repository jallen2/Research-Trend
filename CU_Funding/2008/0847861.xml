    <AbstractNarration>As a result of the success of Senator Obama, African American voters are registering to vote in large numbers. Early indications suggest that there will be a record turnout from every sector of the African American community. According to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, fully 75% of African Americans of voting age say that they have given a lot of thought to this election. This compares to only 58% of the same population as reported in a similar poll in 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using exit polls, this project will examine the manner in which African Americans voted in the 2008 Presidential election at selected precincts in Georgia and Mississippi as well the factors that influenced their decisions. Researchers have argued that African American political socialization is different from that of white Americans. Traditionally, scholars have identified black churches, families, schools, and peer groups as the major agents of political socialization within the former population. Other researchers have pointed to major political actors such as Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson as being important factors. This project attempts to differentiate the impacts of traditional socialization factors versus the impacts of personalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exit poll process and results will be incorporated into the researcher?s interdisciplinary seminar at Morehouse College. Students will conduct the survey, process data and present results to the college. In addition, the researchers are partnering with Tugaloo College in Mississippi and students at that institution will be involved in the same process as those at Morehouse.</AbstractNarration>
