    <AbstractNarration>A Metabolically Active Transient Storage Model&lt;br/&gt;for Predicting Nutrient Retention in Streams&lt;br/&gt;Roy Haggerty, Alba Argerich, David D. Myrold, Eugènia Martí &amp; Nancy B. Grimm&lt;br/&gt;Transient storage has become one of the most important concepts in hydrology in the past 25 years,&lt;br/&gt;helping to predict solute and heat transport in streams, and it is one of the most frequently quantified&lt;br/&gt;processes in stream ecology. However, recent research shows that transient storage has minimal&lt;br/&gt;explanatory power for nutrient retention in streams. This is a paradox because nutrient retention is&lt;br/&gt;closely tied to aerobic metabolism, which in turn is very strongly tied to hyporheic exchange, a major&lt;br/&gt;component of transient storage. Further, other processes that retain nutrients (sorption of phosphorus,&lt;br/&gt;and anaerobic microbial processes) also should happen preferentially in transient storage zones.&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, it is surprising that transient storage has not been a better predictor for nutrient&lt;br/&gt;retention.&lt;br/&gt;We hypothesize that nutrient retention is mostly associated with transient storage that is&lt;br/&gt;metabolically active. Metabolically active transient storage (MATS) is defined as water with velocity&lt;br/&gt;much slower than the mean in which there is significant primary production or respiration. We&lt;br/&gt;predict that MATS will include much of the hyporheic zone and some benthic areas of pools. Given&lt;br/&gt;known mechanistic relationships between nutrient transformations and metabolism, we predict that&lt;br/&gt;MATS zones will also be hotspots for nutrient retention.&lt;br/&gt;We have done preliminary work to develop a MATS-sensitive tracer, resazurin. Resazurin quickly&lt;br/&gt;reduces to resorufin in the presence of aerobic respiration. Our tests indicate that it is feasible to use&lt;br/&gt;resazurin in streams to measure MATS, and that a standardized methodology to measure MATS can&lt;br/&gt;be adopted similar to what is commonly done with a conservative tracer (e.g., NaCl) to measure&lt;br/&gt;transient storage.&lt;br/&gt;We will conduct a series of column and mesocosm experiments to relate nutrient retention to&lt;br/&gt;metabolism (focusing on respiration). We will also test the relationship between resazurin reduction&lt;br/&gt;and respiration in different substrates and multiple sediment samples, and further characterize&lt;br/&gt;resazurin sorption, photodegradation, and degradation. We will then conduct field experiments,&lt;br/&gt;adding nutrients and resazurin in streams. These will primarily be conducted in heterotrophic, lownutrient&lt;br/&gt;streams of Oregon, but a few experiments will also be conducted in Arizona and Spain to&lt;br/&gt;add a gradient in metabolism and dissolved inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus (DIN:P) ratio.&lt;br/&gt;Injections will also be carried out at different times of the year encompassing a metabolism gradient&lt;br/&gt;within the Oregon streams, so that our interpretations are not limited to inter-stream variability.&lt;br/&gt;Streams will be surveyed and geomorphically characterized to help control for physical differences.&lt;br/&gt;A preliminary model of MATS is presented, and will be further developed during the study. A&lt;br/&gt;computer code will be updated and released that can model and do parameter estimation for reactive&lt;br/&gt;transport in streams in the presence of MATS, where the timescales of exchange may be the&lt;br/&gt;conventional exponential distribution or another distribution.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Correlation of nutrient retention with MATS would improve our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the hydrologic component of nutrient retention and help us to predict transport of nutrients in streams.&lt;br/&gt;Resazurin reduction could prove a valuable tool for measuring MATS, and open the way for a tracerbased&lt;br/&gt;quantification of respiration. Lastly, we will work with an elementary school to gauge a stream&lt;br/&gt;and collect stream nutrient data as part of their science curriculum. The data are important to the&lt;br/&gt;City of Corvallis because of a proposal to use a large quantity of treated wastewater for irrigation in&lt;br/&gt;the watershed that the stream drains, and there is no gauge.</AbstractNarration>
