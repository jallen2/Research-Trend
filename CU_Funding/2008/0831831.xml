    <AbstractNarration>Providing each node in a multihop wireless network with one or &lt;br/&gt;more multi-channel radios offers a promising avenue for improving &lt;br/&gt;the networking performance. Recently, the impact of multiple channels &lt;br/&gt;and radios on network throughput has been extensively studied. But &lt;br/&gt;little is known about their impact on communication latency, which &lt;br/&gt;is an important performance metric for a broad class of time-critical &lt;br/&gt;applications such as emergency response and disaster recovery. While &lt;br/&gt;it is of no doubt that multiple channels and radios hold potentials &lt;br/&gt;of reducing the communication latency, what really matters is how &lt;br/&gt;much benefit can be realized by specific algorithms. This research &lt;br/&gt;conducts comprehensive algorithmic studies of minimizing the &lt;br/&gt;communication latency by utilizing multiple channels and radios. &lt;br/&gt;The algorithms developed in this research can be applied directly &lt;br/&gt;to support real-time applications in multihop wireless networks. &lt;br/&gt;The theoretical analysis of the performance against the number of &lt;br/&gt;channels and/or the number of radios can also provide guidance to &lt;br/&gt;industries on cost-effective design of multihop wireless networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the communication schedules for four &lt;br/&gt;primitive communication tasks which are involved in almost all&lt;br/&gt;applications: broadcasting, aggregation, gathering, and beaconing. &lt;br/&gt;The problem of seeking a shortest communication schedule for each &lt;br/&gt;of these four tasks is NP-hard. The investigators develop &lt;br/&gt;constant-approximation algorithms for them and analyze the impact &lt;br/&gt;of the number of channels and the number of radios on the latencies &lt;br/&gt;of the constructed communication schedules. This research is of &lt;br/&gt;interest to a number of research communities, and may serve as a &lt;br/&gt;basis for interesting future projects on multi-channel multi-radio &lt;br/&gt;multihop wireless networks. Both student training and curriculum &lt;br/&gt;development are integrated into this research.</AbstractNarration>
