    <AbstractNarration>0824908&lt;br/&gt;Zhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal seeks funding to purchase a triaxial testing device for measuring rock ultrasonic velocity, permeability, electrical resistivity and acoustic emission activity at crustal pressures and temperatures. The requested apparatus will be optimized for moderate pressure (up to 150 MPa) and temperature (up to 150 °C) performance. Requested is a New England Research AutoLab 1500 which is the least expensive commercial option (given their academic discount). Many fundamental Geoscience questions rely on a thorough understanding of origin, composition, deformation mechanisms, physical properties, and frictional behavior of fluid-saturated rocks under crustal temperatures and pressures. Deep drilling projects have heightened the need for laboratory studies into sedimentary rock transport (seismic velocity, permeability, conductivity, and porosity) and mechanical (friction, strength) properties. Specific projects to be supported by the proposed apparatus are 1) NanTroSEIZE ? a Southwest Japan subduction zone interdisciplinary study directed by the IODP, 2) SAFOD ? a component of study in which geophysical and geochemical properties of fault rocks will be determined, and 3) The Taiwan Chelungpu-fault Drilling Project ? a component of which will provide samples for geophysical analysis of rocks in country, damage and fault core zones. The PI has considerable research funding through NSF-EAR, other NSF divisions and other federal agencies. The apparatus will be housed in a 500 ft2 room already allocated. The Department of Geology has pledged support (machine shop service, electricity, water and compressed air). The PI will install and operate the device. The PI will train graduate and undergraduate students, postdocs and other users. Outside users will fund materials and expendables for experiments performed on the apparatus. The triaxial testing device will support research and training at UMd. Graduate students from UMd and other institutions will be hosted as well other outside researchers with which the PI has numerous collaborations. The device will be incorporated into undergraduate senior theses. An industry partner will be incorporated to expose students to potential employment opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
