    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of the S-STEM Nurture Project at the School of Science and Technology of Universidad Metropolitana in San Juan, Puerto Rico is to support twenty (20) academically talented, financially needy students enrolled in any of its Bachelor of Science programs thereby enabling them to enter the workforce or pursue graduate studies. In addition to scholarships, the project provides enrichment activities that address the challenges these students face in both academic and personal areas, including six (6) seminars a year on financial management, study skills, graduate school, and career fairs, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcomes are an increase in the number of Hispanic STEM graduates; a comprehensive assessment plan that allows for the establishment of a well-suited scholarship program; improved student support services and an increase in graduation rates from 40% to 60% for the scholarship recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through involvement in this project, science faculty members broaden their understanding of student needs and can transform the curricula. The assessment conducted prepares the project leadership, the institutional leaders, as well as other scientists and educators to revise their STEM programs to provide a higher educational level. This translates into a science workforce of free-thinking individuals capable of becoming leaders in their fields and creates a cadre of well educated and skilled Hispanic scientists.</AbstractNarration>
