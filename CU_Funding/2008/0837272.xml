    <AbstractNarration>Atmospheric Sciences (41) There is an increasing demand for professionals who can serve as authorities on weather and climate phenomena, and interpret associated data. However, the education of atmospheric scientists at the undergraduate level generally does not emphasize how atmospheric science research is performed, or the evolutionary nature of its results. Thus, graduates of such programs do not develop an appreciation of the strengths and limitations of current scientific information, and thereby are less able to communicate the uncertainty of this information to each other, policymakers, the media, and the general public. This project is developing a new atmospheric science laboratory course to investigate if a research-based learning experience in the early stages of an atmospheric science curriculum can enhance students': 1) scientific understanding; 2) ability to communicate science; and 3) retention in the program. The course is based on an established, successful model of incorporating research into introductory chemistry laboratory courses (from the Center for Authentic Science Practice in Education, "CASPiE"). Three research modules - forecast verification, potential influences of regional climate change on precipitation, and thunderstorm identification and geospatial distribution - are being designed. The modules take into account the depth of understanding that students have at this early stage in their coursework, while still challenging them by using state-of-the-art analysis software and numerical modeling necessary to perform novel research in these areas. The modules require students to analyze preliminary results, revise their experimental design to conduct further inquiry, and synthesize and present their final results. The results should provide valuable feedback for the atmospheric science community in improving numerical weather prediction models, provide information to agriculture and government agencies regarding the regions where precipitation in the U.S. may be highly susceptible to regional climate change, and provide initial data that can be used to improve climate model predictions of weather extremes. This project serves to advance our understanding of how the CASPiE model can be adapted to programs in atmospheric science, the geosciences, and other disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
