    <AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation is providing partial funding for sponsorship of the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences (BBCSS) at the National Academies of Science. This board, comprised of an impressive range of expertise with outstanding scholars as its members, facilitates the exchange of information and ideas on topical policy issues through meetings and workshops, and explores avenues (e.g. through planning meetings) that may lead to new and important studies. Several new projects under the auspices of BBCSS that are likely to begin during this granting period include the convening of expert committees to address issues of national security with relevant federal agencies, the development of a report outlining the principles and practices of effective Institutional Review Boards for ensuring the protection of human research participants, and exploring the impact of neuroscience and its technologies on various fields, including education. Also on the agenda for exploration in the next few years are topics such as: demography and aging, climate, human capital, the cognitive basis of racial bias, and bilingualism and multi-culturalism in terms of language and skill acquisition. Sponsorship of BBCSS will also support the retention of experienced staff who can be responsive to requests and opportunities as they arise to enhance the ability of the BBCSS to meet its mission and fulfill its responsibilities.</AbstractNarration>
