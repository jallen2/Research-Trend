    <AbstractNarration>The Chicago State University (CSU) Robert Noyce Teacher Scholars Program is facilitating 23 STEM undergraduates and 12 STEM professionals in becoming effective high school science teachers in the Chicago Public School (CPS) District through scholarships, mentoring, and induction year support. The project seeks to: (i) encourage more science students to enter secondary teaching and graduate through a recruitment process centered on highlighting the professionalism of teaching and providing academic scholarships, (ii) increase the number of highly qualified science teachers of color at CPS by conferring more science teaching certifications through CSU's high quality science education program, (iii) support new teachers throughout an extended induction period to encourage retention and continued teaching improvement, (iv) use evaluation to improve CSU's in-service and pre-service programs, and (v) involve students in educational research to promote the professionalism of teaching and disseminate programmatic findings to the science education research community. Increasing student awareness of the professional nature of teaching is accomplished through a journal club, involving students in education research and curriculum development, and attendance at local and national conferences. Since the science major curriculum at CSU emphasizes modern teaching techniques and the use of inquiry in the classroom, teacher candidates leave the program with an understanding and appreciation for how people learn. In addition, new teachers are supported during the difficult induction years with professional development programs, equipment and instructional support services, and outreach efforts through the existing Science Van program, supported by the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE).</AbstractNarration>
