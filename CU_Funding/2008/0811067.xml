    <AbstractNarration>Proposal No: 0811067&lt;br/&gt;PI name: Fisler, Kathi&lt;br/&gt;Title: CPA-DA: From Informal Specifications to RTL Assertions for Bus Protocols&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Worcester Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hardware-verification engineers routinely use informal specification documents to develop formal behavioral descriptions (such as RTL assertions) for validating designs. Informal specification documents present protocols through both descriptions and examples using a combination of diagrams, tables and carefully-written prose. Validation artifacts, in contrast, are consumed by tools and require precise behavioral details. Generating validation artifacts from informal documentation is a laborious manual task. Automating it, however, is challenging given the inherent gap between the informal and formal representations. This proposal aims to partially automate the extraction of RTL assertions from informal bus protocol specifications. The PI will develop a novel intermediate language for describing these protocols that reflects the structure and notations of informal specifications. The software tools envisioned will produce (1) a partial yet executable formal model from an informal specification and (2) a set of details that a human engineer needs to check or provide. After the engineer modifies the model to clarify these details, the tools will generate validation artifacts from the refined formal model. This process focuses the engineer's effort on closing the gap between the informal and formal specification, the task that actually requires human intervention, rather than on the more mundane transcription tasks in the current manual process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this project is successful, it will yield a much lighter-weight process for creating needed validation artifacts from informal specifications. This in turn will simplify the validation process itself, an increasingly time-consuming yet critical part of hardware design. As validation has become a bottleneck in hardware design, the project has the potential to improve modern hardware development practice. Additionally, the students involved in this project will gain skills in working at the boundary between informal and formal representations of designs. Such skills are increasingly valuable for researchers as users of information technologies diversify beyond those with graduate training in the field.</AbstractNarration>
