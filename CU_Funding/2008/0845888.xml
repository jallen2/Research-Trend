    <AbstractNarration>Protein identification is a major research perspective in proteomics holding the promise of signaling and treating diseases. Several techniques have been developed for protein identification. Among which, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is currently the most popular technique used to identify proteins. The process of identifying proteins by tandem mass spectrometry is analogous to identifying a person using his/her fingerprints. Since a MS/MS spectrum usually is incomplete and contains noise peaks due to contaminants, poor peptide segmentation, and other technical or biological reasons, it is a challenging problem to protein identification. The problem becomes more difficult when the spectrum contains post-translational modifications (PTMs). The presence of PTMs significantly increases the difficulty of both de novo sequencing and database search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses this challenging problem of protein identification with theoretical studies and computational approaches. This work builds a complete system focusing on identifying proteins by determining the amino acid sequences of the proteins from their MS/MS spectra. In particular, for a given experimental tandem mass spectrum, the system identifies its amino acid sequence and PTMs through a series of activities: (a) separating different ion types and noises, (b) generating sequence tags, c) identifying candidate peptide sequences, and (d) verifying the candidate peptide sequences and identifying PTMs.</AbstractNarration>
