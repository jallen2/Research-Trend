    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Arizona is awarded a grant to develop and evaluate a set of algorithms/software to help computers to read and ?understand? taxonomic descriptions of plants, animals, and other living or fossil organisms. The major functions of the algorithms/software include 1) annotate large sets of text descriptions in a machine-readable way to support various knowledge applications, including producing character matrices and identification keys for various taxon groups. The algorithms do not need large sets of training examples or hand-crafted regular expression or grammar rules; this makes the algorithms easy to use with different document types and/or subjects; 2) generate interactive identification keys for various taxon groups with minimal human intervention; 3) discover and verify the use of ontological concepts and relationships as represented in the descriptions to improve coverage and literary warrant of domain ontologies; and 4) produce high quality, reusability resources (e.g. lexicons, benchmarks, etc.) for future bioinformatics research. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work include: support community-based informatics activities (e.g. ontology development, document annotation and retrieval); all software produced by the project will be made open source, along with documentation and training materials; reusable knowledge entities (glossaries, lexicons etc.) generated by the project will be conveniently accessible via Web services; annotated document collections will be accessible for research, education, and the public. In addition, Web-based education modules will be developed to spark interests of K-12 students in taxonomy and introduce them to scientific ways of collecting, observing, describing, and identifying ant specimens, and lastly, training opportunities and a mentoring program for graduate level students interested in digital information management will be created, using the software and document collections provided by the project.
