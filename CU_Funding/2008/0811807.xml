    <AbstractNarration>Abstract HRD 0811807&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project, which is based at Jackson State University (JSU), is to increase enrollment of minority students in engineering to contribute to the NSF HBCU-UP target of increasing the number of minority students in STEM education. The focus of this project is, therefore, to establish a new undergraduate Electrical Engineering program at JSU, in an effort to attract more minority students in STEM education. An initial curriculum for the new Electrical Engineering program has already been developed by the JSU Department of Computer Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has four very specific objectives to implement the curriculum in order to attain its goal. The objectives of the project are: development of new courses and have them approved by University committees, design of experiments for new laboratories, acquisition of laboratory equipment, and teaching the five new courses in Spring 2009. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackson State University has an active NSF-HBCU-UP supported implementation project to establish several new programs including an Electrical Engineering program. Our new project complements the overall goals of the ongoing implementation project at JSU. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Computer Engineering is part of the newly established School of Engineering at Jackson State University (JSU). The University is committed to engineering education and is constructing, at a cost of over $22 million, Phase I (90,000 square feet) of a new building for the School of Engineering, with a completion date of July 2008. Starting with modest beginning in the year 2000, the Department has shown remarkable growth in the last few years and now has 11 faculty members. The Department offers two undergraduate programs: Computer Engineering and Telecommunications Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
