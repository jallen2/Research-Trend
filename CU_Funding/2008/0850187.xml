    <AbstractNarration>This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures and programs. Women and students from underrepresented minorities within the electrical and computer engineering programs are being especially targeted for support. Electrical and computer engineering are the least diverse of all of the engineering programs, and this project will serve as a national model for improving recruitment and persistence for students from underrepresented groups in these fields. The scholars are participating in a wide variety of professional development activities as well as one-on-one faculty mentoring. Features of the program include well-structured academic advising, establishment of social networks, study skills and strategies workshops, and role model seminars. The results from the project are being rigorously evaluated through both qualitative and quantitative measures.</AbstractNarration>
