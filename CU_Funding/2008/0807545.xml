    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0807545&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Gregory J. Galloway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mittag-Leffler Institute in Djursholm, Sweden is running a&lt;br/&gt;semester long program on Geometry, Analysis, and General&lt;br/&gt;Relativity from August to December, 2008. The program will start&lt;br/&gt;off with a conference at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)&lt;br/&gt;in Stockolm, August 25-29, 2008. This will be a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;program focusing on analysis and geometry problems revolving&lt;br/&gt;around the Einstein equation, the the field equation of general&lt;br/&gt;relativity. The purpose of this award is to help U.S. researchers&lt;br/&gt;and students with travel expenses to Sweden, and with local&lt;br/&gt;expenses pertaining to their participation in the KTH conference.&lt;br/&gt;The Einstein equation is one of the most important geometric&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, in both the Lorentzian and the&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian settings. Spectacular progress has been made in&lt;br/&gt;recent years in the study of the Einstein equation, wih progress&lt;br/&gt;being made on many fronts. These developments have brought into&lt;br/&gt;focus the deep connections between the Einstein equation and&lt;br/&gt;other important geometric PDE's, including the wave map equation,&lt;br/&gt;the Yang-Mills equation, the Yamabe equation and the Ricci flow&lt;br/&gt;equation. The main aim of this Mittag-Leffler Institute program&lt;br/&gt;is to bring together the leading contributors to these&lt;br/&gt;developments to promote collaboration in the study of the global&lt;br/&gt;structure of solutions to the Einstein equation and related&lt;br/&gt;geometric PDE's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid progress on experimental and numerical aspects of&lt;br/&gt;gravitational physics has been made in recent years, and it is of&lt;br/&gt;increasing physical importance to understand effects such as&lt;br/&gt;gravitational radiation, gravitational collapse and inflation,&lt;br/&gt;where the strong field features of the Einstein equation play a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental role. The results of the collaborative research and&lt;br/&gt;analysis to be carried out during the program will have a&lt;br/&gt;significant bearing on these fundamental physical problems.&lt;br/&gt;Participation of graduate students and recent PhD's is a key&lt;br/&gt;component of the program, and is crucial to the continuing&lt;br/&gt;vitality of the area.
