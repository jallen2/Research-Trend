    <AbstractNarration>The fundamental issue being addressed by this workshop is the formation and growth of continental crust ? one of the most fundamental issues in continental dynamics. There is a long standing observation that continental crust has a composition that is more silicic than basalt, but also more mafic than andesite. One idea is that basaltic oceanic plateaus (oceanic Large Igneous Provinces ? LIPS) may be important nuclei for continent formation. The PIs argue that Costa Rica may be an example of a basalt plateau that is being converted to continental crust by arc magmatism. Their objective is to establish that the Costa Rican crust is in fact now approaching what would be accepted as ?continental?, that no older continental material is there, and to what degree the arc magmatism has changed it chemically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team of PIs involved in this effort has worked on the design of a research program for over a year. However, to date, all members of the team have not had a chance to interact in person. Such a meeting is crucial for the successful working of a large scientific collaboration such as this one. This award provides funding for a 2-day science plan development workshop, to be held at Rutgers University in the fall of 2008. The workshop will pursue two primary goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Reassessment of goals and targets of study in view of the most recent work performed (or planned) in Costa Rica;&lt;br/&gt;2. Formulation of the specific research program, along with a training and outreach schedule.</AbstractNarration>
