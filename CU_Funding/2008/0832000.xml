    <AbstractNarration>CNS ? 0832000&lt;br/&gt;Li, Jiang&lt;br/&gt;Howard University&lt;br/&gt;XPLR: Scheduling and Routing in Pigeon Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project applies the concept of pigeon post with extension to computer networking. Such networks, called pigeon networks, are formed by autonomous mobile wireless devices emulating pigeons. Each of these devices, called messengers, is dedicated to one or more other devices (called home devices) that are the ultimate senders and/or receivers of data. Like pigeons, messengers move back and forth between home devices, carrying and forwarding data, but they can also do much more when they communicate between themselves and cache data intelligently. The research of the project will focus on the algorithm design for scheduling the movement of messengers, their data pickup (from home devices) and the interactions between the two aspects. The concepts and results will be brought into related courses in the CS Department at Howard University to educate students (mostly minority) about the forefront of computer networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Pigeon networks target communications under unconventional conditions such as disaster response and surveillance in remote wide areas where traditional computer networks cannot work. If successful, this model may lead to an innovative way of building computer network architectures that can provide people with communications even in the most difficult environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the network model carries critical distinctive properties that have rarely been studied, the project will study a number of interesting and yet challenging problems. Some of the problems have strong connections with industrial management and transportation. The project will hence benefit from previous research in that area. More importantly, it will contribute to the latter, which has broad social and industrial applications. The PI has been conducting research in computer networking and has been teaching the majority of the computer networking courses in his department. In particular, his research team has already begun the study and produced preliminary results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The project will help foster computer networking research at Howard University as a historically black college and university (HBCU). At present, the Department of Systems and Computer Science (that the PI is affiliated with) only offers a Master degree, and the research in the department needs to be strengthened. Hosting active funded networking research programs in the department will help attract minority students into networking, and prepare them for more advanced graduate degree programs. The activities are also hoped to raise Howard's reputation in computer networking research. In the Internet era, that will not only attract students into this research area, but will eventually also help attract students into the computer science discipline overall, which has been experiencing significant enrollment downturn in recent years. All the results produced by the project will be submitted to academic conferences and journals, and be published online for public access. Since the results have natural applications in some other disciplines such as industrial management and transportation, articles will also be submitted to conferences and journals in related disciplines to further broaden the impacts of the project.</AbstractNarration>
