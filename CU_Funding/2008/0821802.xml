    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Mary Cloninger from Montana State University (MSU) will develop and commission two fluorescence spectrometers: one primarily for high throughput screening and imaging work and the other primarily aimed at UV applications. The instruments will operate routinely in the microplate format with temperature control of the plate. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop instruments on which researchers can routinely produce high quality fluorescence lifetime data. The instruments will use technology acquired through an industrial collaboration with Fluorescence Innovations. Eight research projects by an equal number of researchers will be developed: (1) multivalent protein-carbohydrate interactions, (2) fluorescence lifetime imaging of 2D gels, (3) surface antigens on activated blood leukocytes detected by specific monoclonal antibodies, (4) genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, (5) viruses and protein cages, (6) protein-protein complexes, (7) single-transient, receptor-potential mutants of normal and modeled disease-like prion protein and (8) interactions of proteins with small molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluorescence spectroscopy is a type of electromagnetic spectroscopy which analyzes fluorescence from a sample that has been irradiated by a beam of light that excites electrons in molecules and causes them to emit light of lower energy. These measurements are of great importance in Chemistry, Biochemistry and Life Sciences and provide understanding of chemical and biochemical processes. The instrument development process will involve a large group of investigators including professors, graduate and undergraduate students, some of them from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
