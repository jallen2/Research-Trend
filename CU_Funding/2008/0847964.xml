    <AbstractNarration>Student Travel Support for the 2008 North American Power Symposium, held at Calgary, Canada, September 28, 2008 ? September 30, 2008.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to subsidize the travel expenses incurred by students attending the 40th Annual North American Power Symposium to be held at Calgary, Canada from September 28 to September 30, 2008. It is anticipated that this subsidy will positively impact the extent of student participation at the conference. The North American Power Symposium (NAPS) is a non-profit event that is aimed primarily at student participation. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of the papers are presented by students. At the 2008 NAPS, the organizers are taking several other steps to foster and encourage student participation. This includes arrangement for free accommodation of registered students. Additional measures are being taken to encourage women and minorities to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: NAPS is unique in its focus on students preparing and presenting technical papers. This conference provides a unique opportunity for NSF to interact with and promote interaction among students, academia and power industry to promote and discuss NSF?s vision of technical challenges in power and energy, and complex systems, sensing, communication and control as well as its economic, educational and sociological impact. NAPS is also venue to an exciting student paper competition for identifying and fostering high quality research performed by students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: NAPS conferences have a history of giving students their first opportunity at research presentations. Further, NAPS encourages discussion of systematic integration of research and teaching. Based on recent history of NAPS conferences the student program has been able to attract 20% minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>
