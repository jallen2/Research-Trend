    <AbstractNarration>The research objectives are to (a) bring together researchers and engineers at various stages in their careers to discuss recent advances in experimental mechanics and the role that is being played by non-contacting measurement methods, including full-volume measurements (e.g., computer aided tomography), general surface motions (e.g. stereo-vision) and simulation methods integrated with experimental measurements, (b) serve as a catalyst for international collaboration and partnership in the broader area of experimental mechanics and (c) provide participants with the opportunity to view and use modern, vision-based technology to make quantitative measurements. To meet these objectives, (a) internationally recognized research scientists and engineers will serve on the organizing committee and (b) outstanding investigators in non-contacting methods will be provided partial travel support to ensure their active participation via an invited presentation.&lt;br/&gt; The growth and development of digital imaging technology, coupled with extraordinary advances in computational and image processing technology, is culminating in a wide range of vision-based, non-contacting measurement methods, providing the impetus for this Workshop and Symposium. Educational efforts will include (a) broad dissemination of the time and place for the symposium via email, direct personal contact and professional society distributions (e.g., the Society for Experimental Mechanics), (b) special encouragement to young investigators to attend via small travel grants, (c) direct access to vision equipment and technology for hands-on experience, and (d) dissemination of the results from symposium in the form of proceedings (CD-ROM, print) and, for those cases where high quality papers are available, publication in archival outlets such as the Journals of Strain and Experimental Mechanics.</AbstractNarration>
