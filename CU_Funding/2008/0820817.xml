    <AbstractNarration>In the past decade, new nonlinear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations (PDEs) have been developed for various image processing&lt;br/&gt;applications, such as noise reduction, edge detection, image&lt;br/&gt;segmentation and restoration. While the attention of the&lt;br/&gt;scientific community in this area predominantly focused on&lt;br/&gt;creating the new PDEs, very little attention was paid to&lt;br/&gt;developing numerical algorithms that approximate their solutions.&lt;br/&gt;The few numerical algorithms that are currently used suffer from&lt;br/&gt;a variety of problems: they are not accurate enough, too slow,&lt;br/&gt;and not fault-free. In this project, the investigator develops&lt;br/&gt;accurate, efficient, and robust numerical algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear PDEs in image processing. The research activities are&lt;br/&gt;based on the investigator's extensive work in the field of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic conservation laws, and include numerical methods for&lt;br/&gt;the Hamilton-Jacobi equations, fast algorithms for high-order&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear PDEs, algorithms for computing steady-state solutions,&lt;br/&gt;numerical homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and&lt;br/&gt;multi-resolution analysis, analysis of nonlinear diffusion&lt;br/&gt;equations, constrained morphing active contours and geodesic&lt;br/&gt;flows, and "non-blind" algorithms for image processing. A&lt;br/&gt;portion of the research activities focuses on improving existing&lt;br/&gt;algorithms in order to solve a specific imaging problem in&lt;br/&gt;radiation oncology treatment planning.&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops novel mathematical techniques for&lt;br/&gt;image processing and uses these techniques for solving problems&lt;br/&gt;in the field of radiation oncology imaging. Radiation oncology&lt;br/&gt;treats cancer by delivering relatively small doses of radiation&lt;br/&gt;to tumors in order to eliminate cancer without destroying or&lt;br/&gt;chronically damaging healthy tissues in and around the growth.&lt;br/&gt;CT and MRI scans are used as three-dimensional anatomical models&lt;br/&gt;to ensure that the treatments conform geometrically to the tumor&lt;br/&gt;target. This process depends critically upon identifying the&lt;br/&gt;location of the tumor as well as the healthy organs (in order to&lt;br/&gt;minimize the dose of radiation in these areas). Despite extended&lt;br/&gt;research, the existing mathematical tools for image processing&lt;br/&gt;are unsuitable for clinical medical applications. The&lt;br/&gt;segmentation of the CT and MRI scans is still carried out by&lt;br/&gt;manual tools, and consumes about one-half of the time required to&lt;br/&gt;plan the treatments. The investigator designs accurate and&lt;br/&gt;reliable automated algorithms that would significantly shorten&lt;br/&gt;this time and have a big impact on radiation oncology. He&lt;br/&gt;integrates into his work educational activities that demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;the importance of applied mathematics in a broad spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;sciences. Special emphasis is given to applications of&lt;br/&gt;computational mathematics in biology and cutting-edge&lt;br/&gt;technologies. The planned educational activities include&lt;br/&gt;programs for junior-high, high-school, undergraduate, and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students. The investigator works to increase the gender&lt;br/&gt;and ethnic diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging&lt;br/&gt;under-represented groups to study applied mathematics and choose&lt;br/&gt;it as a future career.</AbstractNarration>
