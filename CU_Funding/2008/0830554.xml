    <AbstractNarration>This research involves the development of optimization techniques for&lt;br/&gt;the automatic determination of the material properties of deformable&lt;br/&gt;solids via modern imaging and scanning technologies (e.g. MRI, CT,&lt;br/&gt;etc.) with particular focus on hyper-elastic materials under large&lt;br/&gt;deformation, high strain rates and often plasticity. Such materials&lt;br/&gt;are characteristic of biological soft tissues (e.g. muscle, fat, skin&lt;br/&gt;etc.) and their determination is critical to creating accurate,&lt;br/&gt;subject specific simulations of the function of these anatomical&lt;br/&gt;structures. Simulation using modern computational techniques is an&lt;br/&gt;increasingly reliable tool for answering many questions in biomedical&lt;br/&gt;engineering ranging from basic functionality to post-surgical response&lt;br/&gt;of complex regions of the anatomy. However, reliable results are only&lt;br/&gt;possible when accurate constitutive descriptions of the simulated&lt;br/&gt;materials are available. Although much work has been done to develop&lt;br/&gt;and determine constitutive models for biological soft tissues, most&lt;br/&gt;material parameters have been estimated from cadaveric specimens or&lt;br/&gt;from a small group of individuals. This is an unacceptable&lt;br/&gt;simplification given the widely established variation in material&lt;br/&gt;behavior across subjects and from the material changes inherent in&lt;br/&gt;cadaveric specimens. This research will establish techniques for the&lt;br/&gt;near-automatic determination of subject specific behavior necessary to&lt;br/&gt;continue the relevance and reliability of biomedical simulation of&lt;br/&gt;soft tissues. Though motivated by biomedical simulation, the&lt;br/&gt;techniques developed in this research transcend the boundaries of&lt;br/&gt;biomechanics and will provide a more general framework for determining&lt;br/&gt;material properties for engineering applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and collaborators will use their combined experience in&lt;br/&gt;constitutive modeling, finite element simulation of soft tissues, mesh&lt;br/&gt;generation, optimization and medical imaging to formulate and develop&lt;br/&gt;methods for the determination of constitutive parameters from imaged&lt;br/&gt;behaviors. This task is formulated as an inverse problem of fitting a&lt;br/&gt;constitutive model to observed material motion (involving imaging,&lt;br/&gt;segmentation and denoising). The PI and collaborators will draw upon&lt;br/&gt;their prior experience with similar techniques for estimating muscles&lt;br/&gt;activation parameters and muscle material properties from material&lt;br/&gt;deformation. The capstone problems to be solved involve accurately&lt;br/&gt;tracking material particle trajectories with imaging technologies and&lt;br/&gt;approximating the Jacobian of elastic equilibrium configurations of&lt;br/&gt;soft tissues with respect to unknown material parameters in a given&lt;br/&gt;constitutive model. With this functionality, the PI and collaborators&lt;br/&gt;will determine the suitability of established optimization techniques&lt;br/&gt;and develop novel approaches (both engendered by the successful&lt;br/&gt;solution of previously mentioned capstone problems).</AbstractNarration>
