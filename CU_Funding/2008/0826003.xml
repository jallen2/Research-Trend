    <AbstractNarration>The proposal plans to develop a novel, nano-scaled, fast response silicon nanowires based force sensor to measure the cell adhesion force that uses the piezoresistive effect of silicon. The investigator will fabricate a silicon nanowires array to study the mechanical interaction between a fibroblast (NIH 3T3 ) and its extra-cellular matrix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this is a very well written proposal but the idea for using nanowires as force probes is not novel to the PI. However, the application of such nanowires as force probes to measure cell adhesion forces is novel, potentially leading to knowledge that is currently unavailable. The PI conducted an outstanding literature review and has good technical knowledge of the state-of-the-art in nanowire synthesis and their applications for force sensors in biological systems. The PI also makes a very good effort to seek out collaborators who have expertise in cell biology to assist in the experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the proposed research if successful will have significant scientific impact in the field of nanosensors for cell interactions, adhesion and the dynamics of cell behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The review panel recommends that this proposal be funded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell adhesion is critical for many fundamental processes in living organisms and its malfunction can cause serious diseases. The cell adhesion force is typically small and varies at the nanometer length scale but the current cell adhesion force measurement largely relies on microscale sensors. Nanoscale force sensors using nanowires will be developed to enable new capabilities in the cell adhesion measurement. The proposed research has four objectives: 1) developing methods to fabricate and assemble nanowire force sensors; 2) quantification of the piezoresistive effect of nanowires through electromechanical measurements; 3) investigating methods to functionalize nanowires with the extracellular matrix proteins; and 4) integration of force sensor arrays with the fibroblast for cell adhesion force measurement. This project will advance the fundamental knowledge on the mechanical and electronic properties of nanowires and provide critical experimental data to understand on how cell adhesions affect the behaviors and functions of cells. This project will be participated from the underrepresented groups at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels in engineering. Research results will be broadly disseminated through journal publications, classroom teaching, conference presentations, and collaborations with other research groups.</AbstractNarration>
