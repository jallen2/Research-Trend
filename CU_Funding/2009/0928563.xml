    <AbstractNarration>Scale model tests in boundary layer wind tunnels have been the primary tool for the development of the design wind loads prescribed in codes. However, questions have been raised concerning the ability of wind tunnel methods to replicate the hurricane wind environment and to determine peak loads on low rise structures in hurricanes. This research will address two outstanding issues in the development of risk consistent construction practice in hurricane prone coastal regions. First it will quantify the precision and accuracy of wind tunnel modeling of extreme wind loads on low rise structures, and second it will develop the proper representation of the approaching turbulent hurricane wind field. Both efforts will utilize an existing hurricane wind velocity and pressure load database collected in-field during eleven hurricane seasons. Four wind tunnel facilities will independently produce estimates of loads on scale model houses. Results will be compared with real hurricane wind load data measured on the models? full scale counterpart. The upstream turbulence employed by the wind tunnel facilities will be compared with turbulence data directly measured during land falling hurricanes. Thus the relative influence of scaling effects, approach turbulence, and variability between facilities on the precision and accuracy of extreme wind load estimates will be quantified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will produce evidence to foster the professional consensus required to validate or suggest changes to current experimental wind load evaluation methods and prescriptive wind load practice. Research outcomes will improve the scientific methods used to mitigate loss of life and property and promote coastal development consistent with an accurate view of the wind damage risk. Reducing damage and post-storm recovery time via risk consistent construction results in shorter down time for coastal businesses, improving the economic sustainability of hurricane prone coastal regions. Engineering students will participate in the research, and findings will be incorporated into the wind engineering curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
