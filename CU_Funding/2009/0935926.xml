    <AbstractNarration>0935926&lt;br/&gt;Lengsfeld&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to support the registration fee for 20 students to attend the 11th International Conference on Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems (ICLASS-2009) conference in Vail, Colorado. Every three years the entire international atomization community convenes to share the latest information, lessons and technical advances of the community. The topics covered at the ICLASS Conference include advances in atomization fundamentals, developments in diagnostics and modeling methods as well as cutting edge solutions in atomization and deposition applications. The conference is expected to have about 200 contributed presentations/papers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ILASS-Americas has a long history for student support, the community's preference is to see the student present rather than the faculty advisor. Attracting a broad community to an international conference requires a site with significant appeal; unfortunately this comes with a price. The student conference fees for ICLASS 2009 are double previous years conference, limiting the number of Universities able to support student attendance. The international component provides an unprecedented opportunity for student exposure to the breath and depth of technological advancement available world wide. Application requirements for this NSF conference participation scholarship will be (i) active masters or Ph.D. student at an US based university, (ii) US citizenship or permanent residency, (iii) letter of support from a faculty advisor, and (iv) commitment to work the conference for one of the four days. There will be no requirement for paper or poster submission to the conference for the award but the preference will go to those students presenting.</AbstractNarration>
