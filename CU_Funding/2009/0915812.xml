    <AbstractNarration>The staff in trauma centers are faced with complex problems under time pressure.&lt;br/&gt;Despite the introduction of standard protocols, the diversity of injuries that can occur&lt;br/&gt;requires a coordinated approach to the evaluation and treatment for each patient.&lt;br/&gt;Trauma care involves complex teamwork under time pressure, and teamwork errors&lt;br/&gt;endanger patient care and increase costs. Our proposed ethnographic study will use&lt;br/&gt;observation and detailed analysis of video recordings of trauma resuscitations to&lt;br/&gt;determine the nature and extent of teamwork errors in a trauma center. This detailed&lt;br/&gt;study of complex teamwork will uncover the causes of teamwork errors in collaborative&lt;br/&gt;high-risk environments. Methods will be developed to understand how teams work and&lt;br/&gt;where difficulties arise. This work will yield detailed descriptions of errors and their&lt;br/&gt;causes, a taxonomy of teamwork errors, information on how to improve team&lt;br/&gt;performance, and guides to the use of technology for teamwork support. It extends the&lt;br/&gt;level of detail of ethnographic research so that we can achieve precision in the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of procedures which are difficult to monitor automatically but where&lt;br/&gt;step-by-step records are essential to detect the causes of errors.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding and improving the effectiveness of trauma teams has direct benefit to&lt;br/&gt;society. Further, complex collaborations are ubiquitous in modern enterprises and these&lt;br/&gt;results could improve collaborations both in terms of quality and productivity across&lt;br/&gt;organizations. In addition, this work will serve to develop the skills needed by a new&lt;br/&gt;cadre of researchers with knowledge of computer-supported collaborative work,&lt;br/&gt;video-content analysis and cooperative research.</AbstractNarration>
