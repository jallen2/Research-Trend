    <AbstractNarration>0923084&lt;br/&gt;Tamargo&lt;br/&gt;CUNY City College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This proposal aims to establish a comprehensive X-ray diffraction analysis facility at The City College of New York (CCNY) that enables a wide range of materials research programs and educational programs in areas spanning molecular beam epitaxy, nanotechnology, materials synthesis, crystal growth and environmental science. CCNY has identified Materials Research as a strategic area of growth. This instrument will be essential to accomplish that goal. We propose to acquire a High Resolution X-ray diffraction apparatus for Materials Research that is especially suitable for thin film applications such as rocking curve analysis, reciprocal space mapping, reflectometry, thin film phase analysis, residual stress and texture analysis, and nanoparticle structure analysis. In addition to four-bounce high resolution optics, the system will incorporate micro-diffraction, glancing angle X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectometry and a Nano-accessory kit. Important advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology, environmental science, energy systems and materials science are anticipated outcomes. There are eleven participating faculty from CCNY whose research will benefit immediately from this instrument acquisition. Participants from other CUNY Colleges and neighboring institutions, as well as industrial partners will also be users. CCNY is a minority institution with an exceedingly diverse student population at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. Having the proposed instrumentation in-house will expose our students to state-of-the-art techniques in materials science, will attract more students to research, and will increase the involvement of underrepresented minority students in these vital scientific areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LAYMAN SUMMARY: X-ray diffraction is a fundamental analytical tool that allows the investigation of the atomic arrangement of materials, and many structural properties, such as the presence and nature of defects, or special atomic ordering in materials. Materials are used in many critical applications, including electronic and photonic semiconductor devices, solar cells, etc. The knowledge of the precise atomic arrangements of materials is essential in order to improve their properties, design new materials, and understand the fundamental physics that govern their behavior. At the City College of New York (CCNY), we have identified Materials Research as a top priority in which to focus our efforts, due to the potential impact of this discipline in our nation?s economic and technological development. A High Resolution X-ray diffraction apparatus is essential to perform the state-of-the-art research in materials that our faculty are trained to do. This instrument is multifaceted and versatile. In addition to offering the high resolution options needed for the investigation of highly ordered crystalline structures, it allows the incorporation of accessories that facilitate other studies carried out by our faculty. Important advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology, environmental science, energy systems and materials science are anticipated. CCNY has an exceedingly diverse student population, with large fractions of students from underrepresented minority groups. This instrument will expose a large number of students to state-of-the-art techniques in materials science, will attract more students to research, and will increase the involvement of underrepresented minority students in these vital scientific areas.</AbstractNarration>
