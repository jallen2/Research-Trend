    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0906391&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Boris Tsygan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is devoted to studying microlocal methods in index&lt;br/&gt;theory and in symplectic geometry. A part of the project deals&lt;br/&gt;with noncommutative differential calculus which is one of the&lt;br/&gt;central tools in the above. By noncommutative differential&lt;br/&gt;calculus we mean the study of algebraic structures arising from&lt;br/&gt;the standard differential calculus on manifolds, defined in terms&lt;br/&gt;in such a way that is valid of the algebra of functions on a&lt;br/&gt;manifold and in such a way that is valid if this algebra is&lt;br/&gt;replaced by any algebra, commutative or not. This leads to the&lt;br/&gt;study of algebraic structures on Hochschild chain and cochain&lt;br/&gt;complexes of an algebra; those complexes play the role of&lt;br/&gt;differential forms and multivector fields, a development of works&lt;br/&gt;of Dolgushev-Tamarkin-Tsygan, Kontsevich-Soibelman, Costello,&lt;br/&gt;Lurie and other authors. The techniques of noncommutative&lt;br/&gt;calculus will be applied to obtain new index theorems and&lt;br/&gt;theorems about the determinant of the cohomology of elliptic&lt;br/&gt;systems, generalizing recent results of Beilinson. Also, the&lt;br/&gt;project will study a new object on a symplectic manifold that we&lt;br/&gt;call an oscillatory module. These objects are modules over&lt;br/&gt;deformed algebras of functions on a manifold, but with extra&lt;br/&gt;structures that make their category much closer to the Fukaya&lt;br/&gt;category. This extra structure is largely motivated by microlocal&lt;br/&gt;methods in partial differential equations, in particular the WKB&lt;br/&gt;method. This is a part of a series of works that try to&lt;br/&gt;understand mirror symmetry microlocally (Bressler-Soibelman,&lt;br/&gt;Kapustin-Witten, Nadler-Zaslow, Gukov-Witten, Tamarkin).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three related parts in the project: noncommutative&lt;br/&gt;calculus, index theory, and oscillatory modules. Noncommutative&lt;br/&gt;calculus is a theory that describes parts of the standard&lt;br/&gt;differential calculus in such a way that it can be applied in&lt;br/&gt;situations more general than that of an ordinary space, in&lt;br/&gt;particular when, for coordinates on our imaginary "space", the&lt;br/&gt;equation xy=yx is no longer required. Index theory is a part of&lt;br/&gt;the theory of differential equations that expresses the number of&lt;br/&gt;solutions of an equation in terms of the topology of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying space. Oscillatory modules are objects on geometric&lt;br/&gt;spaces that describe the motion of quantum particles on these&lt;br/&gt;spaces (in other words, they treat the space in question as the&lt;br/&gt;phase space of a quantum mechanical system). These objects are&lt;br/&gt;intended to be applied to study other invariants of these spaces,&lt;br/&gt;also physically motivated and much more complicated; they are&lt;br/&gt;called A-branes and describe the motion of a quantum string on&lt;br/&gt;our space. They are called A-branes and are subject of much&lt;br/&gt;current research in mathematical physics and geometry. Let us&lt;br/&gt;finish by explaining why noncommutative calculus is natural for&lt;br/&gt;applications both in differential equations and in quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics. Indeed,if x and y are basic operations with&lt;br/&gt;functions, for example multiplication by some function and&lt;br/&gt;differentiation, then xy differs from yx, in the sense that, if&lt;br/&gt;you apply them in different orders, you get different&lt;br/&gt;results. Similarly, in quantum mechanics, if x is the position of&lt;br/&gt;a particle and y is its momentum, then xy differs from yx; this&lt;br/&gt;is a mathematical expression of the Heisenberg uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;principle.</AbstractNarration>
