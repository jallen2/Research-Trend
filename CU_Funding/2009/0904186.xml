    <AbstractNarration>In all cellular organisms the genetic information contained in DNA (chromosomes) is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA), which then serves as a template for translation of the genetic code into protein. Thus, the primary function of mRNA is to serve as a template for protein synthesis. Recently, the applicant discovered a novel structural function of the Veg T mRNA in frog (Xenopus laevis) germ cells (oocytes). It was found that VegT mRNA also has a role in maintaining the integrity of the cytokeratin cytoskeleton of the cell. Experimental removal of this mRNA from oocytes results in the disruption of the cytoskeleton and leads to the abnormal development of embryos. These findings suggest that mRNA has, in addition to initiating protein synthesis, a structural function in the organization of the cellular cytoskeleton. The applicant will map the regions on the VegT mRNA, which are required for maintaining structural integrity of the cytoskeleton by using mutagenesis and X-ray microscopy/tomography imaging techniques. X-ray microscopy/tomography techniques allow much better resolution than light microscopy, and are not subject to the artifacts encountered with conventional electron microscopy. &lt;br/&gt; This conceptually novel discovery of a role for mRNA in maintaining the structural integrity of the cellular cytoskeleton establishes a new paradigm, and should open new frontiers in the study of RNA function. The involvement of high school, undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in this project, with the focus on the involvement of minority students, will ensure that these novel scientific concepts and methodologies will be disseminated among apprentices.</AbstractNarration>
