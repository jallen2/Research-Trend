    <AbstractNarration>The PI has requested partial funding for two special issues of The Oceanography Society (TOS) Magazine, "Oceanography", NOPP and Ocean Acidification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCEANOGRAPHY issue on NOPP - "Ten Years of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP)" - In celebration of the tenth anniversary of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP), to be released in June 2009. NOPP is a collaboration of federal agencies that provides leadership and coordination of national oceanographic research and education initiatives. Through NOPP, the public and private sectors are brought together to support larger, more comprehensive projects, promote sharing of resources, and foster community-wide innovative advances in ocean science, technology, and education. The special issue will include an introductory article focused on the successful government-academia-industry partnerships that were forged because of NOPP, and then eight to 10 articles will highlight individual NOPP projects and accomplishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCEANOGRAPHY issue on Ocean Acidification - "The Future of Ocean Biogeochemistry in a High CO2 World". The guest editors will put together a comprehensive list of articles, to be written by an interdisciplinary group of scientists, that will describe the causes and consequences of lowering the pH of our ocean, what tools we use to study this topic, what the paleo record tells us, and what the economic impacts for U.S. fisheries might be, among other topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special issues shouldn't just provide interesting reading, but should also provide information about where the community is headed in the next few years. What are the future priorities for NOPP? How is the US going to meet the challenge of addressing acidification through coordinated interdisciplinary research? These issues could be covered for the most part in the conclusions sections of each issue and would not require significant alterations to plans. This proposal is creating an approachable, scientifically based summary on the cutting edge oceanographic research over the past decade. These issues will serve as a valuable resource for not only those in the field of oceanography, but also those in other science fields as well as informed lay persons. Many educators at various levels would use these documents in their education efforts. They can be extremely useful tools in undergraduate and graduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
