    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Mary Wirth of the University of Arizona. Prof. Wirth and her students will investigate how the binding of a peptide ligand to a G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) translates to receptor conformational change. Prof. Wirth and her students will develop and employ single molecule fluorescence microscopy to realize this ambitious goal. Success of the project would lead to adaptation and acceptance of single molecule microscopy and spectroscopy as complementary tools to NMR and X-Ray crystallography in studying biological systems. In the long term increased understanding of the interactions between peptide ligands and GPCRs may lead to the development of new drugs that would target this important group of receptors. The research of Prof. Wirth will provide excellent training opportunities for students and postdoctoral research associates in a highly multidisciplinary area at the forefront of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
