    <AbstractNarration>This project is aiding in the development of undergraduate research at community colleges by developing and delivering workshops for community college administrators and faculty considering starting research programs. The workshops, specific to the needs of community colleges, are accompanied by supplementary web materials on funding undergraduate research and building a mentoring network of community college faculty. Over the three-year project period three workshops are being held in each of the north, east, south and west regions of the Country for a total of twelve workshops. The workshops are distributed over urban, suburban and rural districts. Three faculty members accompanied by an administrator represent each of the eight community colleges admitted to each workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactions between two- and four-year institutions are being enhanced to the benefit of both. The community colleges gain access to instrumentation, library resources, and the opportunity for joint work with faculty at the four-year institutions. The four-year schools enjoy increased transfer rates and increased student interest and abilities in research activities.</AbstractNarration>
