    <AbstractNarration>0948298&lt;br/&gt;Taylor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support two workshops jointly sponsored by NSF, NIH and FDA focused on Computational Methods for Cardiovascular Device Design &amp; Evaluation. These workshops will be held in 2010 and 2011 in the Washington DC area. The overall objective of these workshops is to provide a forum for academic, industry and government communication and collaboration related to the development of optimal computer modeling methods in medical device development. Such methods are not widely used in cardiovascular device design, but have considerable potential to aid in the development of safer, more efficacious medical products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These meetings will follow on the highly successful 2008 and 2009 conferences where, each year, over 200 participants from academia, industry and government discussed the best-practices and unmet needs in industry and academia related to modeling the cardiovascular system and predicting safety and efficacy of cardiovascular devices. These meetings are promoting the development, application and validation of computational methods for cardiovascular device design and evaluation identifying the roles of device companies, engineering software companies, academic institutions and government agencies. A highly unique aspect of this meeting is that it industry and government attendees attend and participate at a significant level.</AbstractNarration>
