    <AbstractNarration>Fluorescent-Magnetic Nanomanipulators for Cytoskeletal Mechanical Investigations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to develop a new methodology to examine the role of mechanical force in cell migration. The approach consists of fluorescent-magnetic nanomanipulators that impart force to the cell?s internal scaffolding (i.e., the cytoskeleton) through stimulation by custom-designed magnetic instrumentation. Cell response is observed via the nanomanipulators? fluorescence property. This research will focus on examining migration of cells crucial to the wound healing process (i.e., fibroblasts). Fluorescent-magnetic nanomanipulators will be characterized and optimized to interact with magnetic instrumentation; proof of concept of nanomanipulator delivery to the cell interior and manipulation potential will be demonstrated; and the effect of force applied by nanomanipulators on cell migration will be evaluated in fibroblasts. Deliverables include optimized nanomanipulators and magnetic instrumentation, validation of the intracellular force application method, documentation of research results in the fibroblast model, engineering student education at the graduate and undergraduate level, and a module based on this research for public school outreach disseminated by COSI, a local science museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will provide new tools to explore the influence of mechanical force on protein expression and cellular processes, in particular those that underlie cell migration. Cell migration is a critical component of several biological events including wound healing, fetal development, and cancer metastasis. This research would provide methods to apply force to subcellular components with the smallest manipulators yet studied (~ 10-50 nm), sizes that are similar to many of the components of interest (e.g., protein receptor, cytoskeletal element). Research results will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations, and also, to the general public, through interactions with an area science museum. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research, and results will be disseminated through classroom materials as well.</AbstractNarration>
