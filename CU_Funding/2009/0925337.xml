    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop the network control system technology infrastructure necessary for high-productivity greenhouses specialized to harsh environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of our proposed research is Global food production is coming under increased resource pressure due to urbanization, reduced fresh-water availability, population increase, and targeting agriculture for bio-fuels. Greenhouses offer a 6-20X productivity increase by creating controlled growing environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid convergence of sensing, computing and communication technologies on cost effective, low power, miniature devices is enabling a revolution in Networked Control Systems. These are distributed control/estimation systems with large numbers of sensors, actuators, and computing nodes that communicate over wire-line or ad hoc wireless networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networked control systems will enable the next generation of high-technology greenhouses. These will include wireless sensor networks for ubiquitous sensing, optimized control architectures for regulation of environmental variables, and distributed fault-detection algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;The societal impact of the project comes is in developing technological tools that can be used for cost-effective production of food in harsh environments through protected precision agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific impact of the project will stem from developing fundamental system-theoretic analysis and design methods for networked control systems across a class of application contexts. Layered architecture approach will be developed to navigate design tradeoffs such as computational resource allocation, communication protocol choice, and power/reliability compromises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technological impact of the project is that it will enable the systematic, cost-effective design of network controlled greenhouses particularly suited for harsh environments. Specifically, control-oriented models suitable for generic greenhouses will be developed, algorithms for distributed fault detection and isolation will be investigated, and appropriate scalable distributed control architectures will be devised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transformative aspect of this project is to develop the foundational network control infrastructure necessary to increase crop yield by environment control of high-volume production greenhouses.</AbstractNarration>
