    <AbstractNarration>Center for Friction Stir Processing (CFSP)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-034383&lt;br/&gt;South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT)&lt;br/&gt;Arbegast&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-0934319&lt;br/&gt;University of South Carolina (USC)&lt;br/&gt;Reynolds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-0934377&lt;br/&gt;Brigham Young University (BYU)&lt;br/&gt;Nelson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award id funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests a five rear renewal of NSF funding for the SDSMT, USC and BYU sites of the Center for Friction Stir Processing (CFSP). The Center, comprised of these three sites, was established in 2204; and currently has two additional sites (Wichita State University and Missouri University of Science and Technology) who joined later. The lead institution is SDSMT. The main vision of CFSP is to provide the forum for industry/university cooperative research on the development, validation, and industrial implementation of the emerging solid-state materials joining and processing technologies known as Friction Stir Welding and Friction Stir Processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CFSP continues to perform basic and applied research programs that address the implementation needs of the Center's industrial and government sponsors. The specific research areas include: Friction Sir Joining (FSJ), Friction Stir Processing (FSP), friction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW), Friction Stir Post-Processing, Friction Stir Structural Designs and Analysis, Friction Stir Intelligent Controllers and Efficient Tooling, and Friction Stir Cost Benefits Analysis. The Center has numerous publications in archival journals and conference proceedings, and notable commercial successes have also resulted from the Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts on the community are strongly built into the proposal through university, local, regional, national and international participation in the center activities. The membership of the Center is derived at a national and international level. In addition several teaming arrangements have already been established between the participating universities and local (Native American) colleges and community technical schools for the purpose of technology transfer and collaborative educational opportunities. Each CFSP site has supported outside activities to promote educational opportunities and to increase awareness of FSW in the world.</AbstractNarration>
