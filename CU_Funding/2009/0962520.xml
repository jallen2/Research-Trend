    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0850898&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Doyle &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The top level goal of this project is to advance the developing relationship between "network science" and "network design" by contributing to the development of a cross-cutting research agenda in these areas. For this purpose workshops and tutorials will be organized. Critical issues, open questions, and research challenges in the topic areas of (i) the state of network science, (ii) the relationship between network science, other theories, and network design, and (iii) identifying and enabling new research methodologies and tools for the filed, will be carefully examined. The potential of this project is to not only connect diverse and previously fragmented mathematical and application domains but newly integrate both education and research based on the theoretical insights themselves, creating layered real and virtual organizations with greater scope and evolvability. The success of this project should be both immediate and long-lasting, from practical network architecture design in all areas of engineering, to providing a much-needed conceptual framework for systems and synthetic biology, to radically transforming and unifying the teaching of systems and complexity.</AbstractNarration>
