    <AbstractNarration>With each advance in computing technology, researchers develop innovative user interfaces so users can leverage the technology to enhance productivity. 3D immersive virtual environments have long been considered a new frontier in computing; however, lack of effective user interfaces within these virtual worlds has prevented them from being widely used in industry. The PI's prior work has focused on a user interface framework for immersive virtual environments that facilitates context-driven interaction techniques, which have been proven to enhance productivity. One aspect of "context" is the use's workspace: the area and position in the virtual world that the user is most interested in. In this project the PI will build on his previously developed framework to create methods for automatically inferring workspace size and location, and for enabling applications to select the most appropriate navigation technique. The underlying hypotheses are that contextual information can be automatically inferred by observing the user's actions, and that automatically activating specialized interaction techniques suited for the current context will enhance productivity. The hybrid navigation aid to be developed will be based on the well-known WIM and Orbital Viewing approaches. Finding ways to effectively transition between navigation aids based on a changing workspace is a principle objective of this research, which will represent a significant contribution toward making navigation within a virtual world less cumbersome and more efficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This work will lead to more effective user interfaces for immersive virtual environments, which will help unlock their true potential for applications such as architectural design, scientific exploration, and collaborative training applications. The implicit recognition of workspace coupled with the activation and transitioning between navigation techniques will be a valuable addition to the current body of knowledge in 3D user interface design. Although the current project focuses on a single particular area of 3D user interface design, the PI's context-driven framework outlines dozens of instances benefit from this technique. Each of these additional highly focused projects can be undertaken with the equipment funded through this award; together, they constitute excellent opportunities for undergraduate research, which will continue long after the current effort is completed. Virtual environment development inherently requires input from a wide range of specialties (e.g., domain experts to help develop simulation applications and graphics artists to help create content); the PI will take full advantage of his institution's liberal arts focus to bring together students and faculty from a variety of disciplines when carrying out this research.</AbstractNarration>
