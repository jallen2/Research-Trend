    <AbstractNarration>Existing data storage systems based on the hierarchical directory-tree organization do not meet the scalability and functionality requirements for exponentially growing datasets and increasingly complex metadata queries in large-scale Exabyte-level file systems with billions of files. This project focuses on a new decentralized semantic-aware metadata organization that exploits semantics of file metadata to improve system scalability, reduce query latency for complex data queries, and enhance file system functionality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has four major components: 1) exploit metadata semantic-correlation to organize metadata in a scalable way, 2) exploit the semantic and scalable nature of the new metadata organization to significantly speed up complex queries and improve file system functionality, 3) fully leverage the semantic-awareness of the new metadata organization to optimize storage system designs, such as caching, prefetching, and data de-duplication, and 4) implement the new metadata organization, complex query functions, and system design optimizations in large-scale storage systems. This project has broader impact to data-intensive scientific and engineering applications, graduate and undergraduate education, and K-12 education through its contributions to storage system research and its integration with an existing NSF-REU site award and an NSF-ITEST award.</AbstractNarration>
