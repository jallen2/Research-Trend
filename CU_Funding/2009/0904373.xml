    <AbstractNarration>We propose to provide support for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend a&lt;br/&gt;conference on Engineering Principles for Biological Systems, to be held at Cold Spring Harbor&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory on 10--13 December 2008. The conference is intended to foster cross-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;exchange of ideas and expertise between engineers, mathematicians and biologists interested&lt;br/&gt;in the analysis of diverse biological systems through the application of engineering principles.&lt;br/&gt;Support from this grant would be used to help offset the cost of the conference for graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdoctoral researchers who wish to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Through the process of evolution, living systems retain solutions arisen by&lt;br/&gt;chance to problems they must solve in order to survive. In the past, theoretical biology has&lt;br/&gt;largely focused on explanations of the physico-chemical mechanisms behind such solutions,&lt;br/&gt;while explanation in the form of function-solution pairs has been studied in a relatively ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;manner and has not been approached from a disciplinary perspective. This conference will&lt;br/&gt;promote the development of an emerging approach to theoretical biology with more formal&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on design or engineering principles. Here, the premise is that although solutions or&lt;br/&gt;designs in biological systems are not engineered but instead arise incrementally through natural&lt;br/&gt;selection, they may nevertheless be studied in their existing forms in the framework of&lt;br/&gt;engineering theories developed alongside human-engineered systems.&lt;br/&gt;This conference is part of a series of workshops and conferences organized by Partha Mitra&lt;br/&gt;(CSHL), Richard Murray (Caltech) and others to help foster a community of researchers working&lt;br/&gt;on theoretical frameworks for understanding biological systems across a variety of scales. A&lt;br/&gt;starting point for these theories can be drawn from courses taught in engineering departments.&lt;br/&gt;The idea is therefore to start with major existing engineering theories (controls, communication,&lt;br/&gt;computation) and to examine whether these apply to biological systems, and if not, what&lt;br/&gt;modifications are in order. The conference series and this CSHL conference in particular, will&lt;br/&gt;provide an educational opportunity for biological researchers to learn about engineering theories&lt;br/&gt;which may be relevant to their work, and for engineering theorists and computer scientists to&lt;br/&gt;learn about biological problems they might help to be understood. Each session at the&lt;br/&gt;conference will have a two invited talks, one each by a biologist and a theoretician/engineer,&lt;br/&gt;integrated with a set of contributed talks, chosen from submitted abstracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination and Broader Impact: The proposed conference will foster this new approach to&lt;br/&gt;understanding biological systems and the collaborative culture across disciplines that its&lt;br/&gt;success will require. The conference venue and format are ideal for encouraging open&lt;br/&gt;discussion and initiating collaborative efforts, and it is hoped that a continuing series of such&lt;br/&gt;meetings will also encourage the development of an enduring and progressive theoretical&lt;br/&gt;framework. To complement the direct training opportunity for conference participants, talks&lt;br/&gt;presented at the conference will be put on a website for the benefit of the wider scientific&lt;br/&gt;community. Options will be provided to individual presenters to make their talks publicly&lt;br/&gt;available through the Leading Strand web site.</AbstractNarration>
