    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;Technical. The goal of this focused research group (FRG) proposal is to achieve an atomic-level understanding of the growth and novel properties of switchable oxide hetero-interfaces, with advanced properties and new functionalities. The idea is to create new 2D interfacial materials, switched by external stimuli, whose electronic, magnetic, optical, and transport properties depend critically on atomic-scale materials characteristics. Switchable interface materials with, spatially modulated conductance, tunable by an applied electric field, and spin-polarized interface materials responding to magnetic fields will be explored. The focus is on identification and understanding of atomic level mechanisms and electrical transport associated with atomic layer-by-layer synthesis. It is anticipated that functionalizing 2DEGs at oxide interfaces may be transformative, in that it could lead to new research fields where interplay between ferroelectricity and 2D transport reveals unexplored properties important for device applications. Logic devices with switchable electron and/or spin current based on 2D interface materials are envisioned. The approach involves a collaborative coordinated effort to explore materials science issues of growth and novel properties of switchable oxide hetero-interfaces. Specific tasks are (1) theoretical exploration of the dependence of interfacial properties on materials characteristics; (2) atomic layer epitaxial growth and characterization of switchable two-dimensional oxide hetero-interface materials; (3) electrical transport and magnetic characterization of interfacial electronic properties. &lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. This research is expected to identify and resolve fundamental materials science issues in switchable 2D interfacial oxide heterostructures; prototype electronic devices fabricated from these interfacial materials may find new and wide-ranging applications. Education and outreach activities will be integrated with the research. The education goal is to provide a broad interdisciplinary experience for all students. This includes first-year student rotation through research groups, working in an international institution and the Argonne National Laboratory, research interactions with individuals of diverse backgrounds, and participating in outreach programs. Students from underrepresented groups will be actively recruited through collaboration with U. Puerto Rico-Mayagüez. Secondary school teachers will come from Puerto Rico to the U. WI for a nanoscience learning/research experience. They will develop classroom material, and put in place programs for implementation at their schools in Puerto Rico. Graduate students will be involved as mentors to the teachers. The results of the program will be widely disseminated through teacher presentations at schools and at education conferences, and through published articles.</AbstractNarration>
