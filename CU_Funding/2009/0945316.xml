    <AbstractNarration>The ACL2 theorem prover has an established user community in industry,&lt;br/&gt;government, and academia. ACL2 supports industrial-scale verification&lt;br/&gt;projects by combining automation and controllability, but its&lt;br/&gt;extensibility is limited: its large (10 MB), complex code base&lt;br/&gt;requires, for soundness, that it be entrusted solely to its two&lt;br/&gt;authors. The PIs propose to modify ACL2 radically, opening up the&lt;br/&gt;system by making it more modular, thus enabling trusted development by&lt;br/&gt;untrusted users while maintaining proof security. Key challenges are&lt;br/&gt;to expose the functionality of system components, and to separate out&lt;br/&gt;a trusted core from code that need not be trusted for correct&lt;br/&gt;functionality, such as code implementing heuristics, I/O, theory&lt;br/&gt;management, and interactive proof development and debugging. Code&lt;br/&gt;refactoring is already a hard problem, especially for a system with&lt;br/&gt;the complexity of ACL2, but in this project there is also the&lt;br/&gt;challenge of making the resulting system modifiable in a way that does&lt;br/&gt;not compromise logical soundness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected results include an ACL2 system that can be modified soundly&lt;br/&gt;by users according to specific needs. In particular, research on&lt;br/&gt;teasing apart inherently sequential output from reasoning code should&lt;br/&gt;support research on parallel reasoning algorithms taking advantage of&lt;br/&gt;modern multi-core machines, leading to formally verified parallel&lt;br/&gt;implementations. More generally, the system will provide a platform&lt;br/&gt;that promotes research in heuristics for automating reasoning. It&lt;br/&gt;will also facilitate the customization of ACL2 for use in the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate classroom. The resulting system will be freely&lt;br/&gt;distributed on the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
