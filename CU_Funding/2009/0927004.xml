    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is to provide partial support for two international workshops to be held at the UC Davis in April 2009. The two workshops ?Missing Energy Signals at LHC? workshop, and the fourth workshop in the ?Monte Carlo Tools for Beyond the Standard Model Physics? (MC4BSM) series are to be held at University of California, Davis and take place on consecutive days, ?Missing Energy Signals at LHC? workshop on April 1?2 and MC4BSM on April 3?4, 2009. &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the ?Missing Energy Signals at LHC,? workshop is to discuss the &lt;br/&gt;strategies to search for new physics with jets/leptons plus missing energy signals and how to identify the new physics if such experimental signals are discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). New physics with missing energy signals is highly motivated as most new models with a dark matter candidate will produce such signals at the colliders when the dark matter particles escape the detector. However, searching for such signals and identifying the underlying physics are highly non-trivial because the backgrounds and the detectors need to be understood very well in order to establish such signal events and the missing information carried away by the missing particles needs to be reconstructed to identify the new physics. The workshop will bring together both experimentalists and theorists who are experts in this area to discuss the best approaches to the questions from experimental searches to the model identi&amp;#64257;cations. &lt;br/&gt;The series of the MC4BSM workshops aims to gather together theorists and experimentalists interested in developing and using Monte Carlo tools for Beyond the Standard Model Physics in an attempt to be prepared for the analysis of data focusing on the Large Hadron Collider. Since a large number of excellent tools already exist for the study of low energy supersymmetry and the MSSM in particular, this workshop will instead focus on tools for alternative TeV-scale physics models. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are that the discovery of new physics in the LHC era will require close collaborations between experimentalists and theorists. These workshops provide a platform for such collaborations through detailed discussion and idea exchanges. New tools and strategies will be developed to make the studies and experimental searches of the new physics more e&amp;#64256;ective and powerful. The emphasis will be to enhance the discussion and collaborations between the theorists and the experimentalists along the topics of the workshop. All the talks will be recorded and posted together with the slide &amp;#64257;les on the workshop website for everyone to access.</AbstractNarration>
