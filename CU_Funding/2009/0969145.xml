    <AbstractNarration>The program proposed by Karl Schwede aims to study relations between higher dimensional algebraic geometry and positive characteristic commutative algebra. Over the past 30 years, a dictionary has been developed linking, by reduction to characteristic p, seemingly unrelated concepts coming from these two distinct areas of mathematics. However, the dictionary as it exists seems incomplete. For example, while there is a good positive characteristic analog of ``log terminal singularities'', there is no known analog of ``terminal singularities''. Schwede will attempt to fill in these gaps. Furthermore, inspired by this dictionary, Schwede will explore both the local and global geometry of varieties in positive characteristic and characteristic zero. One problem that Schwede plans to explore is how the test ideal (a positive characteristic analog of the multiplier ideal) behaves under birational maps. Another problem that Schwede plans to study is whether Du Bois singularities deform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is a centrally important and very active field of mathematics with strong ties to many other areas including fields as disparate as string theory and coding theory. Explicitly, algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) made up of the solutions to polynomial equations (such as y = x^2). At the most basic level, Schwede plans to study relations between the geometry of these algebraic varieties, with algebraic properties of the equations themselves. In the past, this interplay has led to new insights in both the geometric and algebraic theories. In algebraic geometry, one of the major areas of research in the last 30 years has been the classification of algebraic varieties -- the "minimal model program". In order to accomplish this, one must study singular varieties (an example of a singular variety is the solution set to the quadric cone, z^2 = x^2 + y^2). The particular questions that Schwede proposes to study will hopefully lead to a deeper understanding of the varieties and the singularities that appear in this classification.</AbstractNarration>
