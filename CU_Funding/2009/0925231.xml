    <AbstractNarration>The completion of the first plant genome sequence from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in December 2000 sequence ushered in a new era in plant biology. This coordinated international project drew in scientists from 25 laboratories in the U.S., Europe and Japan to develop a high quality sequence resource that is freely accessible to all. The subsequent expansion of genome sequencing efforts to other model and crop plants, functional genomics efforts and development of new tools and technologies has moved the whole field forward in understanding the structure and function of plants. As the first decade of genome-enabled plant biology draws to a close, it is time to develop a new vision for plant biology for 2011-2020 that builds on these tremendous advances. A small workshop will bring together scientists from around the world working on a range of plant systems and processes to develop a vision document that will outline a forward-looking, bold, science-driven roadmap for the plant sciences at an international scale. The draft document will be available for comment at http://pbio.sal.edu/pbioe/ and the final version submitted for publication in December 2009.</AbstractNarration>
