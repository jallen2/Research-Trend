    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0943629&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;PI: S. DeBow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support (SSSE) items for the vessel operated by University of Rhode Island (URI); namely the R/V ENDEAVOR. The requests specifically include items that have been recommended from past NSF inspections, or Post-Cruise Assessments (PCA's) and have been otherwise deferred by the operators due to cost. All of the items requested will either improve safety, enhance science support capability, or extend vessel service life. Due to the nature and timing of these requests, the vendor quotation standards normally required by the SSSE Program were waived out of necessity with many of the figures provided as estimates for budgetary purposes and based mainly on past experience of the vessel operators for similar work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V ENDEAVOR supports federally funded scientific research in the Atlantic in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, and participation in both the Teachers at Sea and MATE programs. The ENDEAVOR is scheduled to complete over 140 NSF sponsored days in 2009.</AbstractNarration>
