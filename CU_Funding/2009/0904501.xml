    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: RI: Medium Collaborative Research: Minimalist Mapping and&lt;br/&gt;Monitoring&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 05/05/09&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses fundamental and challenging questions that are common to&lt;br/&gt;robotic systems that build their own maps and solve monitoring tasks. In particular, the&lt;br/&gt;work contributes to our general understanding of the interplay between sensing, control,&lt;br/&gt;and computation as people attempt to design systems that minimize costs and&lt;br/&gt;maximize robustness.&lt;br/&gt;Powerful new abstractions, planning algorithms, and control laws that accomplish basic&lt;br/&gt;mapping and monitoring operations are being developed in this effort. This is expected&lt;br/&gt;to lead to improved technologies in numerous settings where mapping and monotoring&lt;br/&gt;are basic components.&lt;br/&gt;Ample motivation is provided by technological challenges that involve searching,&lt;br/&gt;tracking, and monitoring the behavior of people, wildlife, and robots. Examples include&lt;br/&gt;search-and-rescue, security sweeps, mapping abandoned mines, scientific study of&lt;br/&gt;endangered species, assisted living, ground-based military operations, and even&lt;br/&gt;analysis of shopping habits.&lt;br/&gt;The work is particularly transformative because it lives outside of the traditional&lt;br/&gt;boundaries of algorithms, computational geometry, sensor networks, control theory, and&lt;br/&gt;robotics. Furthermore, national interest continues to grow in the direction of developing&lt;br/&gt;distributed robotic systems that combine sensing, actuation, and computation. By&lt;br/&gt;helping to break down traditional academic and scientific barriers, it is expected that the&lt;br/&gt;work will transform the way we think about robotics algorithms, the engineering design&lt;br/&gt;process, and the education of students across the robotics, computational geometry,&lt;br/&gt;and control disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0905523 PI Name:LaValle, Steven&lt;br/&gt;Printed from eJacket: 05/06/09 Page 1 of 1</AbstractNarration>
