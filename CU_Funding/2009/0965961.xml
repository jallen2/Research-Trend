    <AbstractNarration>Jackson State University (JSU), a Historically Black College and University, serves academically talented but often economically disadvantaged students. The Computer Science Department has historically been a leading producer of African Americans with the BS degree in Computer Science. While the demand for such professionals is on the increase, current national enrollment in the discipline does not meet the demand.&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the Students Promoting Interest in Computing supported by Educational&lt;br/&gt;Scholarships (SPICES) are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Provide the economic means for more highly qualified, economically disadvantaged, students to enroll in and complete the Computer Science BS degree program;&lt;br/&gt;2. Provide opportunities for SPICES Scholars to receive professional mentoring through a faculty to scholar mentoring program and a peer to peer mentoring program,&lt;br/&gt;3. Provide enrichment activities including research and internship opportunities to enhance scholar's professional skills; and&lt;br/&gt;4. Provide enhanced communication and leadership opportunities for Scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project awards 12 four-year scholarships to entering freshman and 2 two-year scholarships to transfer students. Traditional and social media activities are used to promote SPICES. A peer mentoring model has been adopted and modified to fit the unique needs of the SPICES program. This project addresses the need for more members of an underrepresented group to become highly trained graduates in computer science.</AbstractNarration>
