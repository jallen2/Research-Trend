    <AbstractNarration>The Michigan Biology Academy Scholars program, from the Departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and Molecular, Cellular, and Development Biology (MCDB) in the University of Michigan's College of Literature, Science and the Arts, supports up to twenty scholarship recipients per entering cohort, for a total of up to 80 students over a four-year period. This effort is part of the University of Michigan (M) STEM Academy which recently implemented a new integrated, holistic curricular and co-curricular support system for students with high ability and potential in STEM disciplines, but who, for reasons of socioeconomic status, first generation college status, racial or gender bias, or lack of rigor of high school background, might not be successful at a highly competitive elite research university. The Academy provides academic support for first and second year undergraduates to increase the number, success, and diversity of STEM students. The biological sciences component of the M-STEM Academy is geared towards increasing the number and diversity of students entering biologically-related fields by two different yet interrelated methods: (1) increase the actual number of students pursuing degrees in biological sciences, and (2) increase the retention to degree and the academic success and experiences of diverse students. Increased financial support is critical for both of these aspects to reduce the debt burden and the time spent away from studies to earn money during the academic year. Assessment and evaluation of the Michigan Biology Academy Scholars program is being provided by the Center for the Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special aspect of this project is the extensive collaboration across University of Michigan college boundaries. In particular, critical STEM departments in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts and the College of Engineering have initiated curricular innovations and bring a myriad of academic support offices in order to provide comprehensive services to all M-STEM students including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - the Science Learning Center, which supports student learning in the sciences by providing well-coordinated resources, vibrant learning communities and engaging co-curricular programs;&lt;br/&gt; - the Comprehensive Studies Program, a learning community that offers a variety of academic support services designed to support, academically enrich, and retain students;&lt;br/&gt; - the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, a nationally recognized program that enhances the undergraduate educational experience through the integration of teaching and research;&lt;br/&gt; - the Women in Science and Engineering Program, a nationally recognized model for advocacy and research on issues for girls and women in STEM fields; and&lt;br/&gt; - through collaborations with other educational pipeline programs on campus, including the Michigan Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and the Michigan Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate.</AbstractNarration>
