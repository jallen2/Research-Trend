    <AbstractNarration>Greenberg (0946385)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Workshop is to define the future research directions for computer graphics and visualization. Over the past two decades, computing environments have radically changed in terms of processing power, parallelization, bandwidth, storage, and computer architectures. More recently, with the introduction of touch panel displays and the availability of large area screens, new user interfaces are now possible. Yet there does not appear to be any long-term research strategy which is compatible for future computing environments. According the workshop is bringing together computer graphics leaders and visionaries, as well as innovators from closely related fields, to define broader, more fundamental, longer term research areas. The workshop will establish an appropriate set of research challenges to help guide the National Science Foundation in their mission. A broad range of topics and unsolved problems will be identified, each with a set of specific goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is being organized by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? Professor James Foley ? Stephen Fleming Chair in Telecommunications, Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;? Professor Donald P. Greenberg ? Jacob Schurman Professor of Computer Graphics, Director, Program of Computer Graphics, Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;? Professor Pat Hanrahan ? Canon USA Professor, Computer Graphics Laboratory, CSEE Dept., School of Engineering, Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;? Professor Jessica Hodgins ? Computer Science and Robotics, Associate Director for the Faculty in the Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University, part-time Director of the new Disney Research, Pittsburgh Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the two-day workshop, each participant will be assigned the responsibility of making a brief presentation during the first day. For each sub-area one participant will be selected and will have the responsibility for the documentation of the summary findings. At the conclusion of the workshop, the four primary investigators will edit and compile the results.</AbstractNarration>
