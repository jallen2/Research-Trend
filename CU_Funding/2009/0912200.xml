    <AbstractNarration>A Conference on Ecosystem Services will bring together government and non-governmental leaders as well as scholars to advance the use of the concept of ecosystem services in conservation, restoration, resource management, and development decisions. The issue of ecosystem services and their valuation and location has become an increasingly important factor in resource management and conservation, in decisions related to prioritizing conservation and development locations, and in the management of public lands. This 3-day conference will facilitate interactive discussions across disciplines, the creation of research partnerships, and the development of a research agenda.</AbstractNarration>
