    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCF - 0903408 &lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research - MCDA: Formal Analysis of Multicore Communication APIs and Applications&lt;br/&gt;Gopalakrishnan, Ganesh L. &lt;br/&gt;University of Utah &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCF - 0903491 &lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: Formal Analysis of Multicore Communication APIs and Applications&lt;br/&gt;Mercer, Eric G. &lt;br/&gt;Brigham Young Univ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSRTACT&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes tools to engineer future information processing systems so that they operate reliably and efficiently. Given that many of these systems will be produced on single micro-chips, and given the increasing demands for rapid turn-around times of designs, manufacturers are standardizing on methods by which the central processing units in these chips may communicate. Such standards will eliminate duplication of labor and allow components originating from different manufacturers to be mixed and matched. Since such standards will govern the construction of millions of future systems, one has to apply rigorous engineering principles accompanied by mathematically sound analysis methods to ensure that the standards are not flawed. This is one of the important goals of this project. The other key goals are to ensure that the manufacturing of these systems proceeds as per the standard definition and that testing methods to check the correctness of manufacture will be in place in a timely manner. The complementary strengths of the principal investigators, one of whom is from the School of Computing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, and the other from Brigham Young University in Provo Utah will help drive this project forward in unique ways. The first year of this project will investigate rigorous specification methods for this standard called MCAPI. The second year will involve the research design of a variety of analysis tools for programs written using MCAPI. The third year will involve pilot testing of our tools at the manufacturer sites of systems on chips.</AbstractNarration>
