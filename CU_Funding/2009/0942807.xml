    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, a collaborative effort between Texas Southern University and Prairie View A &amp; M University -- two HBCUs, is revamping laboratories to provide virtual and remote (V-R) access and preparing instructional material for this type of laboratory. The project team is developing the framework and website for the laboratory and web-based experiments for courses in digital signal processing and in robotics. The web-based framework is scalable so that faculty members can gradually add more VR-Lab courseware to benefit more courses and more subjects. Developing this laboratory is setting the stage for infrastructure sharing between different institutions. The evaluation effort, which is being led by an outside evaluator, is using surveys and utilization statistics to monitor progress toward the project outcomes. The project's material and results are being disseminated through website postings, conference presentations and journal papers. Broader impacts include the emphasis on minority students, the dissemination of the instructional material, providing laboratory experiences to remote and non traditional students, and K-12 outreach through existing programs</AbstractNarration>
