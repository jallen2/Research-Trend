    <AbstractNarration>Distributed Camera Networks: Research Challenges and Future Directions&lt;br/&gt;Bir Bhanu, University of California-Riverside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a two-day workshop, to be held in spring 2009 at the University of California-Riverside, to discuss and identify research challenges and future research directions in the multidisciplinary research area of distributed camera networks. The workshop also intends to encourage multidisciplinary research in this area, facilitate greater interaction among researchers, and increase understanding of potential applications. Participants are from academia, industry, and government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the workshop addresses an emerging and potentially important multidisciplinary research area in what is intended to be a comprehensive manner. The workshop includes a mix of participants and topics from different disciplines. Topical areas represented include: (i) distributed sensing, processing, communication, and control; (ii) distributed understanding of video content; (iii) real-time embedded systems; (iv) graphics; and (v) simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, the workshop itself and follow-on research and other activities have the potential to have a significant impact on important potential applications including video surveillance, monitoring of disaster sites, traffic monitoring, in-home care of the elderly, and entertainment. The workshop includes discussion of educational issues. The workshop intends to engage a diverse set of participants.</AbstractNarration>
