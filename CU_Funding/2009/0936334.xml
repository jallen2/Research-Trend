    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides support to graduate students to attend IEEE DySPAN 2010, a premier international venue where technical and policy researchers in the area of dynamic spectrum access gather together in order to examine the state-of-the-art and identify future directions in software defined radio (SDR) and cognitive radio (CR) networking and policy that will lead to creative, original, and transformative concepts. The conference provides not only technical and policy paper presentations but also a wide range of other educational formats, including panels, tutorials, industry presentations, posters and keynote talks. For students who are presenting papers, posters or demos, this gives them the opportunity to present their work to the rest of the dynamic spectrum access research community, which would enable timely feedback to be received that could influence their future activities in this area. Moreover, the attendance of these students at other presentations during this conference would provide them with valuable insights on the current state-of-the-art in cognitive radio, which would help provide a solid foundation for future research efforts. The interactions of the students with other cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access researchers will help foster new ideas, as well as facilitate the integration of new students into the greater research community. Consequently, this provides students with a wider understanding of the research field and also allows for opportunities to interact with peer graduate students from other institutions, to meet with leading researchers and to grasp the state-of-the-art in dynamic spectrum access. Participation from women and other under-represented groups is particularly sought.</AbstractNarration>
