    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative/multi-disciplinary research project is to develop a cyberinfrastructure system that will both adapt to and control changing needs in data, models, computer resources and management choices facilitated by a dynamic workflow design. Using virtual simulation and a field study, this cyberinfrastructure will be tested on illustrative scenarios for adaptive management of contamination events in water distribution systems. Contamination threat management in drinking water distribution systems involves real-time characterization of the contaminant source and plume, identification of control strategies, and design of incremental data sampling schedules. This requires dynamic integration of time-varying measurements of flow, pressure and contaminant concentration with analytical modules including models to simulate the state of the system, statistical methods for adaptive sampling, and optimization methods to search for efficient control strategies. For realistic distribution systems, the analytical modules are highly compute-intensive, requiring multi-level parallel processing via computer clusters. While data often drive the analytical modules, data needs for improving the accuracy and certainty of the solutions generated by these modules dynamically change when a contamination event unfolds. Since such time-sensitive threat events require real-time responses, the computational needs must also be adaptively matched with available resources. Thus, a software system is needed to facilitate this integration via a high-performance computing architecture (e.g., the TeraGrid) such that the measurement system, the analytical modules and the computing resources can mutually adapt and steer each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban water distribution systems are vulnerable to accidental and intentional contamination incidents that could result in adverse human health and safety impacts. The pipe network in a typical municipal distribution system includes redundant flow paths to ensure service when parts of the network are unavailable, and is designed with significant storage to deliver water during daily peak demand periods. Thus, a typical network is highly interconnected and experiences significant and frequent fluctuations in flows and transport paths. These design features unintentionally enable contamination at a single point in the system to spread rapidly via different pathways through the network, unbeknown to consumers and operators. When a contamination event is detected via the first line of defense, e.g., data from a water quality surveillance sensor network and reports from consumers, the municipal authorities are faced with several critical questions as the contamination event unfolds: Where is the source of contamination? When and for how long did this contamination occur? Where additional hydraulic or water quality measurements should be taken to pinpoint the source more accurately? What is the current and near future extent of contamination? What response action, such as shutting down portions of the network, implementing hydraulic control strategies, or introducing decontaminants, should be taken to minimize the impact of the contamination event? What would be the impact on consumers by these actions? Real-time answers to such complex questions will present significant computational challenges. This project will address these challenges by developing an adaptive cyberinfrastucture that will enable real-time processing and control through dynamic integration of computational components and real-time sensor data. This system will be evaluated using contamination scenarios based on field-scale data from a large metropolitan area.</AbstractNarration>
