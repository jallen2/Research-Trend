    <AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) on Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis is jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE). The PASI is organized by Dr. Peter Bates from Michigan State University and it will take place October, 2009 at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in Mexico City. The Institute will bring together graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty members and researchers from the Americas for a fruitful scientific exchange in the areas of differential equations, dynamical systems and nonlinear analysis. The program will consist of five intensive mini-courses with discussions periods. Presentations will cover non-linear analysis and incorporate new tools such as computations, hard and harmonic analysis and the interaction with geometry. Lecturers will also present some reasonably realistic and sophisticated models arising in the physical and biological sciences. This PASI will be a continuation and an extension of the bi-annual Americas conference and workshop series on Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis which started in 1994 and has had seven meetings throughout the Americas. The Coordinating Committee will establish a website www.fenomec.unam.mx/c4k3/gfg/americas conference/index.html to attract a wide net of graduate student and postdoctoral participants and publicize the PASI results.</AbstractNarration>
