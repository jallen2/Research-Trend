    <AbstractNarration>This award is to support a US-Egypt workshop on ?Intelligent Decision Support Tools for Prognostics and Health Management? to be held in Cairo, Egypt in October 2009. The US coPIs, Jay Lee and Masoud Ghaffari, are from the NSF Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati. The Egyptian organizer, Dr. Mohamed Saleh, is from the Department of Decision Support, College of Computers and Information, Cairo University. In addition to the PI and four doctoral researchers, US workshop participants will include 2 junior scientists, 3 graduate students, 3 undergraduate students. Egyptian graduate and undergraduate students from the Decision Support department at Cairo University and invited industry representatives will also participate. The two main goals for holding this workshop are: (1) to conduct an international forum for information and knowledge exchange with focus on education and research in the field of prognostics and health management; (2) to lay the foundation for a long-term strategic research collaboration on the advances of intelligent decision support tools for prognostics. The expected outcome of this workshop will be a comprehensive plan of the steps required to accomplish the collaboration between students and researchers of the two countries. This affiliation will be building on the eight-year history of frontiers research and collaboration at the NSF I/UCRC for Intelligent maintenance systems (IMS) which is a multi-campus center consisting of three US research sites at the University of Cincinnati, University of Michigan, and the Missouri University for Science &amp; Technology. Moreover, the IMS center has partnerships with over 40 global companies. Such international collaboration would be highly beneficial for researchers from both countries as it will facilitate the exchange of educational, research, and cultural knowledge.</AbstractNarration>
