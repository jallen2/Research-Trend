    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the paleo-geological history of Ocean Anoxic Event II (OAEII, ~94 Ma) by iron isotopic analyses (d56Fe) of total iron in archived sediment cores from the proto North Atlantic and bordering Western Interior Seaway, including several from DSDP and ODP. OAEII sediments are characterized by concentrations of high organic carbon (OC) which might have resulted either from 1) increased preservation of OC resulting from more anoxic conditions globally, or 2) increased surface ocean productivity. The effects of iron on ocean productivity and the overall carbon cycle during OAEII is a major aim of this research. To this end, the research will investigate the relative inputs of Fe to euxinic sediments from hydrothermal inputs versus that remobilized from shelf sediments that should carry a distinctly lower d56Fe value than the hydrothermal source. The d56Fe values and FeT/Al ratios of sedimentary iron in euxinic sediments of OAEII will reflect the relative contribution from hydrothermal sources. This research will try to constrain the overall mass balance of iron in the ocean during OAEII and thus expand the use of Fe isotopic analyses for paleo-environmental assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The research supports an undergraduate student, a postdoc, and an early career female scientist. As part of the Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence at Rutgers University, the PI will work with the Center?s Director to incorporate the research results into online educational materials directed at K-12 teachers, K -16 students, and coastal managers.</AbstractNarration>
