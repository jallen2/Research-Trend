    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I proposal describes a heat spreader embedded with a nanolfuid oscillating heat pipe (OHP) that will meet the cooling needs of high power density electronics by utilizing: 1) the extra-high heat transfer coefficient of thin film evaporation; 2) the elevated thermal conductivities of nanofluids; and 3) the enhanced heat transfer of thermally-excited oscillating motions. Although the advantages of nanofluid OHPs have been proven in academic settings, commercial heat spreaders embedded with nanofluid OHPs have yet to be developed. The proposed research will: first develop a mathematical model of the heat transfer performance; then investigators will fabricate a commercial-scale prototype with a low-cost production process; and, finally, empirical results will be compared to company's modeled results and those of potential users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pressing need for high heat flux, low cost heat transfer innovations. Computer makers, chip manufacturers, telecommunications companies, and other high-tech electronics providers cannot develop high power density solutions without cost-effective, micro-scale coolers. Given the absence of such a technology, the proposed nanofluid cooling device will find immediate acceptance in the microelectronics industry. Its performance and low cost will facilitate the aggressive development of faster, smaller computer chips. In doing so, the proposed research benefits all fields impacted by more powerful (or smaller) microprocessors. Outside of microelectronics, there are other fields where high heat transfer rates are needed but not currently provided. For example, the proposed heat spreader embedded with nanofluid OHPs can facilitate an extra high cooling rate in the cellular cryopreservation process and faster cooling rates increase cell survival rates (Jiao et al., 2006).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."</AbstractNarration>
