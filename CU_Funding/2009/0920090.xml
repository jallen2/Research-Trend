    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: At the molecular level, new proteins have typically been thought to evolve by subtle tweaks of existing proteins, not by radical changes. New genomic data, however, are challenging this traditional view. Genomes are, in fact, dynamic and saltational; genes arise, evolve, and die much more rapidly than previously thought. Making sense of how and why genes are formed or destroyed is critical to understanding how and why organisms adapt to natural and man-made environmental change. Drosophila (fruit flies) are uniquely suited for studies to determine the biological processes shaping the functions and origins of new genes. Scientists have a deep understanding of Drosophila biology, sophisticated molecular genetic tools, and a wealth of Drosophila genomic data. Using these tools, these collaborators will determine how new genes are formed and the genetic mechanisms underlying their origination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of Study: Improving our understanding of what new genes do, how they arose, or why they emerged will give insight into how organisms genetically respond to environmental pressures. It is increasingly clear that man-made environmental change presents a challenge to all living things, including humans. New genes may be one type of solution to overcoming these challenges. As some of these new genes arise from DNA sequence that ancestrally did not code for a gene, this suggests that hidden within the genomes of all living things is an unanticipated wealth of genetic potential. This research will help science understand how this genetic potential has been and can be realized. Both investigators are actively involved in broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in science. Additionally, this project will support a program to both familiarize graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with the opportunities available to the faculty of community colleges, and to provide pedagogical training for such an endeavor.</AbstractNarration>
