    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide three years of support for the Midwest Dynamical Systems Seminar (MWDS). The MWDS is one of the country's longest running and most influential analysis conference series: it has been in existence for over thirty-five years, the last eighteen with NSF support. It would be a massive undertaking to establish precisely the huge number of mathematicians whose careers have been positively affected by participation in this seminar and the number of mathematical papers that have resulted from the interactions that the event has fostered. The MDWS meets three times each year at venues all around the country, but primarily at locations in the Midwest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the many long-standing, recurring mathematical conferences in the US, the MWDS stands out as a model of successful efforts to ensure diversity and broaden participation. From its inception the MWDS has displayed as one of its hallmarks the inclusion of women, young mathematicians, and members of underrepresented groups. This will not change with the current award: the bulk of the thirty individuals who will receive support for any meeting of the MWDS will be women and young mathematicians (graduate students, postdocs, untenured assistant professors).</AbstractNarration>
