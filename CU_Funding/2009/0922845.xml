    <AbstractNarration>PI: Sharyn Elaine Perry &lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: IOS-0922845&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Transcriptional Regulatory Networks Controlling Higher Plant Embryogenesis"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During higher plant embryogenesis, the single celled zygote proliferates and differentiates to form the mature embryo within the seed. During this phase of the life cycle, not only must the plant body form (called morphogenesis) but also storage products must accumulate to support early stages of seedling development, and programs to allow the embryo to undergo desiccation to give the "pause" in development that we recognize as the seed must occur (called maturation). Despite humans" reliance on seeds, little is understood about the mechanisms controlling development of seeds and the embryos that they contain. Several genes have been identified that encode proteins that control gene expression during embryogenesis, and when these proteins accumulate in plant cells outside of the context of the embryo, they can drive embryo-specific programs in these cells. One such gene is FUSCA3 (FUS3) that is also necessary for normal seed development. This project focuses on better understanding control of gene regulation by FUS3 with the long-term goal of understanding gene regulatory networks during embryogenesis. Biochemical and molecular approaches will be used to identify genes directly and indirectly controlled by FUS3. Genetic approaches will elucidate the roles select FUS3 targets play in embryogenesis. The project will also contribute to an understanding of interactions between FUS3 and other genes that are key regulators of embryo development. Basic knowledge about gene regulation during embryo development is important for any molecular approaches to improving seeds to meet current challenges in agriculture and could impact on aspects including yield, nutritional content, and viability. The project will provide training for a postdoctoral researcher including opportunities to assist the primary investigator in educational activities.</AbstractNarration>
