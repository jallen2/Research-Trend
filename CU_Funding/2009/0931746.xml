    <AbstractNarration>CPS:Small:Control Design for CyberPhysical Systems Using Slow Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop principles and tools for the&lt;br/&gt;design of control systems using highly distributed, but slow, computational&lt;br/&gt;elements. The approach of this research is to build an architecture that&lt;br/&gt;uses highly parallelized, simple computational elements incorporating&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearities, time delay and asynchronous computation as integral design&lt;br/&gt;elements. Tools for the design of non-deterministic protocols will be&lt;br/&gt;developed and demonstrated using an existing multi-vehicle testbed at&lt;br/&gt;Caltech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for using "slow computing" is to develop new feedback control&lt;br/&gt;architectures for applications where computational power is extremely&lt;br/&gt;limited. Examples of such systems are those where the energy usage of the&lt;br/&gt;system must remain small, either due to the source of power available&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. batteries or solar cells) or the physical size of the device&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. microscale and nanoscale robots). A longer term application area is&lt;br/&gt;in the design of control systems using novel computing substrates, such as&lt;br/&gt;biological circuits. A critical element in both cases is the tight coupling&lt;br/&gt;between the dynamics of the underlying process and the temporal properties&lt;br/&gt;of the algorithm that is controlling it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implementation plan for this project involves students from multiple&lt;br/&gt;disciplines (including bioengineering, computer science, electrical&lt;br/&gt;engineering and mechanical engineering) as well as at multiple experience&lt;br/&gt;levels (sophomores through PhD students) working together on a set of&lt;br/&gt;interlinked research problems. The project is centered in the Control and&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical Systems department at Caltech, which has a strong record of&lt;br/&gt;recruiting women and underrepresented minority students into its programs.</AbstractNarration>
