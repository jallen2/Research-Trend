    <AbstractNarration>The wireless industry has had a transformative impact on our society and has revolutionized almost all aspects of human interaction. These networks are intertwined with the fabric of both civilian and military societies, and their continued growth and well-being is critical to the success and health of our nation. Nonetheless, the technology is still very much in its infancy of the development, with the potential to grow and becoming orders-of-magnitude more sophisticated. &lt;br/&gt;To chart a broad vision for the future of wireless research, we have assembled a group of expert researchers from the wireless and applications community for a two-day workshop. At the workshop, attendees discuss and debate the critical challenges in wireless networking, and articulate a vision for conducting fundamental and inter-disciplinary research in the area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop attendees are invited from a broad spectrum of the community (theorists, practitioners, junior, mid-level, and senior researchers, core and application-oriented researchers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected Results: A report that identifies major issues affecting future wireless research; exposure of the research community to new and exciting inter-disciplinary problems; and generating far reaching future research initiatives and collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop aims to influence future research and development in wireless systems and fuel inter-disciplinary collaborations between members of varied communities. It serves to educate the general public on the importance, challenges, and enormous potential of wireless research. Women and under-represented members of the community are especially encouraged to attend and provide a diversity of opinion that shapes the future of wireless systems.</AbstractNarration>
