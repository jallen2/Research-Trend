    <AbstractNarration>0946014&lt;br/&gt;Raja&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this award is to support U.S. students and researchers to participate in the 2009 Gaseous Electronic Conference (GEC), which will be held Oct. 20 - Oct. 23, 2009 in Saratoga Springs, New York. Support is limited to students enrolled in a Ph.D. program offered by a U.S. university and researchers who are in need of financial support for attending the conference. Awards will be restricted to participants who will be presenting a paper at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEC is an annual topical meeting of the American Physical Society, combining aspects of atomic, molecular, and optical physics with electric gas discharge physics and chemistry, as well as various applications related to these themes. A detailed description of the GEC 2009 can be found at &lt;http://sites.google.com/site/2009gec/home-page&gt;. Fundamental physics themes include atomic and molecular cross section data, plasma diagnostics, measurement of ion and electron distribution functions, as well as kinetic, PIC and fluid plasma modeling. Applications include plasma processing of materials, plasma interaction with surfaces, gas-discharge lasers, and lighting. The GEC plays a key role in advancing research in these areas in a variety of ways. In particular, the GEC is the only US conference that brings together members of the atomic, molecular, and optical physics communities with researchers interested in applications of gas discharges and plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is intended to aid a range of technological advances, as described above. Educationally, the GEC has a strong tradition of encouraging student participation. For example, a student competition is held each year based on oral contributions given by students at the conference and the winner of the GEC Student Award for Excellence is given $500. The GEC also encourages student participation by providing partial support for students attending the meeting and presenting either an oral paper or poster.</AbstractNarration>
