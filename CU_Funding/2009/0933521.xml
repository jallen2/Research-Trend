    <AbstractNarration>0933521&lt;br/&gt;Avedisian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new reactor technology will be investigated that can potentially convert lower cost organic compounds into fuels, or other highly valued products. Specifically, the feasibility converting glycerine (a byproduct of biodiesel production) or ethylene glycol into a useful fuel such as syngas, will be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The intellectual merit of the research and the reactor concept is derived from the unique combination of heat transfer, mass transport, multiphase processes and chemical change. The principal technical challenge involves the study of high boiling point organic (e.g., glycerine) and water mixtures. An experimental approach will be taken to measure product yields associated with film boiling on a horizontal tube and to determine the influence of process variables such as wall temperature, tube diameter, subcooling and mixture composition. The results will guide development of a model to optimize and exploit the process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The emerging biofuels industry produces large quantities of low value byproducts. In the production of biodiesel, the byproduct glycerine might be converted to syngas with the proposed method. Hence, net fuel production could be increased while problems associated with disposal of excess glycerine could be ameliorated. The educational plan includes development of a minicamp that will bring students from five local schools in Washington, DC to Cornell. Simple experiments illustrating nucleate boiling and burnout phenomena will be developed allowing students a hands-on laboratory experience. In addition to the minicamp, an undergraduate student will be selected for participation in the NIST Summer Undergraduate Research (SURF) Program.</AbstractNarration>
