    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to advance knowledge and understanding of a new fast-neutron imaging technique which is capable of detecting and characterizing shielded highly-enriched uranium.&lt;br/&gt;This understanding will be applied to improving system performance parameters including angular and timing resolution. The research approach includes both experimental and simulation work related to the system as a whole and two associated position-sensitive detectors, one of which is coupled to an interrogating neutron source. The project leverages recent advances in the medical imaging community as well as infrastructure and expertise at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Deliverables include modeling and analysis tools, demonstration and validation via hardware, documentation of research results, graduate coursework development, and engineering student education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results will improve the confidence in detection and characterization of shielded nuclear threats in small to medium-sized containers (up to ~1 m per side). Multiple undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers will be involved in the proposed 5-year research and educational development effort. The results will be disseminated, and the research will be integrated into our graduate coursework, part of which is delivered by distance education. We will outreach to Prairie View A&amp;M University (a HBCU) and partner with them for research support in simulations. The work will deepen collaboration with ORNL, make use of their existing infrastructure, and build infrastructure for research and education at the university.</AbstractNarration>
