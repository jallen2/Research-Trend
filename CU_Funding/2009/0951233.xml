    <AbstractNarration>Phylogenetic comparisons enable identification of conserved functional elements within a genome and are essential for a complete analysis of any genome sequence. Despite years of prior experimentation, comparative sequence analyses of related species significantly altered our knowledge of the yeast genome. New genes were identified, dubious open reading frames (ORFs) were detected and tremendous amounts of sequence conservation were discovered in intergenic regions of the genome. Unfortunately, the function of most conserved intergenic sequences is still unknown because the early sequence comparisons moved far beyond our limited knowledge of gene expression and the experimental data upon which it is built. In this work, several highly conserved yeast promoter sequences will be characterized in greater detail than any yeast promoters have been analyzed. The sequences will be tested in hundreds of growth conditions to determine when they function. Additional assays will be developed to help determine which transcription factors interact with specific regulatory sequences on a genome-wide scale. This work is meant to encourage a large scale ENCODE-like project for yeast aimed at identifying all of the gene regulatory elements in this simple model organism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This project is focused on advancing our limited understanding of gene regulation and provides an excellent opportunity for training students to use computational tools for biological discovery. These skills are quickly becoming an essential part of biological research because of the vast amounts of data that are being generated. It is likely that the next generation of biologists will need to be as skilled with a computer as they are at the lab bench. A bioinformatics course has been developed to train both graduate and undergraduate students, including those with physical disabilities who would not be able to work at the lab bench, in the theory and use of computational tools.</AbstractNarration>
