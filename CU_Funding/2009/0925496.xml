    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a miniaturized detection system for real-time monitoring of vehicle emissions. The approach is to develop a novel hybrid sensor that maximizes the advantages of different sensing principles, and to integrate multi-scale technologies into a complete system, including an intelligent sampling scheme, hybrid sensing elements, integrated signal processing, and wireless data transmission. Each component uses innovative techniques to achieve its corresponding function, and all the components work together synergistically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of the many recent exciting enabling technologies, such as the demonstration of single molecule detection capability, detecting and analyzing trace chemicals in a complex environment containing thousands of interference chemicals and substances remains a challenge. Inspired by the olfactory system found in nature , this proposal aims to establish a new hybrid and integrative approach spanning multiple length scales and crossing multiple disciplines in order to develop the detection system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid and integrative approach will enable the construction of a detection system with a broad potential impact on maintaining a healthy population, a clean environment, a safe food industry, and a secure society. the project will provide students with the research opportunities in finding engineering solutions to urgent environmental problems, and will also provide the principal investigators with a unique opportunity to develop an interdisciplinary course on Integrated Sensors. As part of the outreach plan, industrial partnerships will be established with local companies to bring industrial device design and fabrication expertise to the project, and to provide the students with summer internships.</AbstractNarration>
