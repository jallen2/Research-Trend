    <AbstractNarration>0947467&lt;br/&gt;Wiesner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists and engineers from the US and France have been building collaborative linkages between young scientists over the last two years through a series of workshops and symposia sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the Office for Science and Technology of the Embassy of France, the CNRS and the CEA in France. The aim of this symposium is to bring together through a three day meeting, a select group of early career engineers and scientists from industry, academe, and government labs to discuss leading edge research and pioneering technical work in several fields related to nanotechnology and further develop collaborative relationships.&lt;br/&gt;The 2009 symposium will be devoted to three topics within the area of Nanotechnology:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Simulation and networking of phenomena at the nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;- Instrumentation, detection and applications at the nano bio interface&lt;br/&gt;- Environmental, health, and safety issues surrounding nanotechnology &lt;br/&gt; applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds requested for this workshop will support travel for an estimated twenty US participants, including overview and keynote speakers. Invitees to the workshop will be selected by the US co-Chairs from submissions solicited, where there is the possibility of follow through, from previous YESS participants who are developing collaborative relationships with their French counterparts and will benefit from additional interactions in this regard. Invitees from the initial workshop included a broad spectrum of universities (public/private/HBU) from geographically diverse regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on the applications of nanotechnology to molecular electronics, medicine and environmental protection as well as study of the impacts on human health and environment and societal implications of these technologies have received high priority in the US, France, Europe, and beyond. This workshop seeks to improve awareness of efforts in these areas among early career scientists and engineers with the goal of establishing collaborations and improving synergy in their respective research efforts. While the need for research in these areas has been recognized in both the US and France, coordination between groups has been limited. Invitees to the workshop will represent leading young researchers in their respective fields and the materials will provide a sample of top research efforts in electronics, medical applications and impacts on human health, environment and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impacts beyond the scientific merits of the workshop will include the establishment of personal contacts between researchers, an accelerated internationalization of US efforts in this area and the dissemination of information on applications and environmental impacts of nanomaterials. Selection of US participants for the workshop will include a strong consideration of participant diversity and the potential for accelerating collaborations ties that might not otherwise develop.</AbstractNarration>
