    <AbstractNarration>Standard processing of weather echo signals by Doppler radars routinely retrieves information on the "radial" wind component, i.e. that portion of the wind velocity directed toward or away from the radar antenna. While this information has proven quite valuable, especially in tracking severe weather, a full description of the horizontal wind in all directions (independent of radar viewing angle) has generally been restricted to situations where two Doppler radars are purposefully coordinated and sampling the same storm volume. New advances in radar antenna design based on "spaced antenna" (SA) techniques may allow measurement of the full two-dimensional horizontal wind field by a single Doppler radar. This work leverages previous research on phased array radar technology developed under the NSF-sponsored Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this effort rests in application of the spaced-antenna technique to a newly fabricated linear phased-array radar transmitter panel. Specific objectives of this work are to (1) analyze and develop techniques to configure X-band radar wavelength solid-state phased-arrays to obtain cross-beam wind estimates via SA techniques, and analysis of associated uncertainties, (2) implement an X-band phased-array spaced-antenna design, (3) perform validation studies to evaluate SA wind measurements by comparison with simultaneous dual-Doppler and/or Doppler beam-swinging techniques, and (4) collaboration with the University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology and other NSF-supported investigators working on the VORTEX2 project in analysis of observations from existing X-Pol and W-band mobile radar observations of severe thunderstorms from both 2009 and 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this effort include the education and training of engineering graduate students who will be involved in the design and testing of SA technology, and who will collaborate with established scientists in other fields of research. Undergraduate students will also be involved through CASA's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, and demonstrations of mobile radar technology will be used as a K-12 outreach tool. Successful application of this technique could represent a significant enhancement of future radar network capabilities, thus serving to improve severe weather monitoring and other meteorological applications.</AbstractNarration>
