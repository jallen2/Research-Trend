    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We increasingly rely on MAD Services, systems that span Multiple Administrative Domains. Examples include cloud computing, peer-to-peer streaming, Internet routing, and wireless mesh routing. Unfortunately, when different parties control a system's nodes, the nodes may undermine the desired service either by malfunctioning or by selfishly maximizing their own benefits to the detriment of the broader system (e.g., a tragedy of the commons.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central thesis of this research is that any approach to building robust MAD services must account for both selfish behaviors and Byzantine malfunctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research therefore brings together ideas from game theory and Byzantine fault tolerance to (1) develop the new theoretical framework for MAD distributed systems; (2) design techniques that rigorously address key practical issues in building MAD systems, such as heterogeneity, locality, and node churn; and (3) construct significant prototypes of dependable MAD systems that tolerate selfish and Byzantine behaviors and whose costs and performance are comparable to less robust systems deployed today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work seeks to have broader societal impact in at least two dimensions. First, it will develop the theory and practice of MAD systems at a time when crucial personal, business, and societal needs are increasingly met by MAD services. Second, we expect a significant educational impact from this work, as graduate and undergraduate students will participate in a research plan that will enhance skills in both practice and theory.</AbstractNarration>
