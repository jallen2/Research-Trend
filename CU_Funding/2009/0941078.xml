    <AbstractNarration>PI: Animesh Ray &lt;br/&gt; Real-time coupling of gene networks in single cells &lt;br/&gt;SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;The complex dynamics of gene regulatory networks underlie a host of fundamental biological questions including the maintenance of normal cellular states, response of cells to internal and external signals, handling of noise inherent in biological systems, and the evolutionary trajectory of organisms. Moreover, cells containing identical gene sets nearly always are heterogeneous in their epigenetic states, where the effects of stochastic fluctuation of a small number of key regulators (intrinsic noise) and general fluctuation in biochemical machinery (extrinsic noise) critically affect network dynamics. Mathematical methods for tackling these processes are not yet fully developed. In this proposal advantage is taken of a novel synthetic biology approach coupled with interaction modeling by stochastic evolutionary game theory. The latter is an ideal modeling framework for noisy interacting systems where the probability distribution of component states influence one another. Two synthetic genetic networks will be designed and implemented within two separate yeast cells that are otherwise genetically identical (except at the mating type locus). Each of these two networks takes as input a common metabolite and outputs one of two fluorescent proteins that will be measured in single cells by real time imaging techniques. The two networks will be coupled to each other by mating the cells and the coupled dynamics will be monitored. The networks are designed such that they have the opportunity to both cooperate and interfere with each other. The coupling coefficients are tunable. A stochastic evolutionary game theoretic model will be devised to determine agreement with experimental results. Both the theory and experiments proposed here are high-risk: 1) Real-time dynamics of coupling of two synthetic genetic circuits in single cells have never been studied before; 2) The particular gene networks proposed here have not been studied, so there is no guarantee that the observed dynamics will reflect simulated dynamics; 3) Imaging mating cells for single cell gene expression dynamics has not yet been attempted (to our knowledge); 4) Stochastic evolutionary game theory is a relatively new area of research in mathematical sciences and its applicability to gene regulatory network dynamics is uncertain. Given these uncertainties, and given the potential for advancing a new way of thinking about biological network dynamics if the project is successful, this project is deemed suitable for an EAGER submission. Insights learned from these studies will be valuable for understanding how networks communicate in a noisy environment and how modally rational entities with stochastic behavior cooperate or compete in communication networks.</AbstractNarration>
