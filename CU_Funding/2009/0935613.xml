    <AbstractNarration>The study of the absolute Galois group of a number field F or, from a &lt;br/&gt;Tannakian point of view, of its abelian category of continuous finite &lt;br/&gt;dimensional representations (let us say over a p-adic field) has long been &lt;br/&gt;recognized as one of important challenge in pure mathematics. Among &lt;br/&gt;those representations, the ones that are geometric, in the sense of Fontaine &lt;br/&gt;and Mazur, are especially of arithmetic significance, and their category&lt;br/&gt;should be equivalent to the (still conjectural) category of mixed motives &lt;br/&gt;over F. It is important to understand the first Ext groups in that category&lt;br/&gt;(higher Ext groups should be zero) and Bloch and Kato have made precise &lt;br/&gt;conjectures relating the dimension of those groups to the order of &lt;br/&gt;L-functions at integers values of the variable. The project aims to construct &lt;br/&gt;as much extensions as possible in those Ext groups (hopefully as much as &lt;br/&gt;predicted by the conjecture, in the case corresponding to the center of the &lt;br/&gt;functional equation of the L-function) using p-adic deformations of &lt;br/&gt;non-tempered automorphic forms. An important step should be the study of &lt;br/&gt;the local geometry of the "moduli space of p-adic automorphic forms" called &lt;br/&gt;Eigenvarieties around the non-tempered automorphic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many old problems in arithmetic, some of them going back as far as &lt;br/&gt;Diophantes, as well as some new ones, fit well in the framework of Galois &lt;br/&gt;theory: they often can be translated into questions about existence, or &lt;br/&gt;non-existence, of certain Galois representations (that is representations of the &lt;br/&gt;absolute Galois group G of the field Q of rational numbers, or of some open &lt;br/&gt;subgroups of G) with prescribed properties. And then, sometimes, they can &lt;br/&gt;be proven, as was Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles. The study of Galois &lt;br/&gt;representations splits up into two parts : finding irreducible Galois &lt;br/&gt;representations, and then determining extensions between them. Even if the &lt;br/&gt;first problem is far from being solved, precise conjectures about the second &lt;br/&gt;one were made by Bloch and Kato. The projects aims to give partial answers &lt;br/&gt;to those conjectures, by constructing some interesting extensions. The method &lt;br/&gt;uses the theory of automorphic forms, which was once quite a different topic, &lt;br/&gt;but which is now strongly tied to the theory of Galois representations by the&lt;br/&gt;Langland's program. The idea is that one can obtain interesting extensions of &lt;br/&gt;Galois representations by looking at (p-adic) deformations of some very &lt;br/&gt;special automorphic forms, the so-called non tempered forms. The more &lt;br/&gt;deformations there are, the more extensions one should be able to construct. &lt;br/&gt;Those deformations are encoded in the geometry of a (p-adic) variety, known &lt;br/&gt;as the Eigenvariety, and developing tools to study that geometry is an important &lt;br/&gt;part in the project.</AbstractNarration>
