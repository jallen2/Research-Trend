    <AbstractNarration>0934875 &lt;br/&gt;Coppens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Division of Materials Research at NSF to the State University of New York at Buffalo supports the participation of young scientists at the Sagamore XVI Conference. The Conference will be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, from August 2-7, 2009 supports. The Sagamore conference started in the US in 1964, has been held every three years in a number of countries, including the UK, France, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Portugal, Poland, Australia, Japan, and Canada. The meeting in 2009 will be the first in the United States in almost 40 years. NSF funds will support early career scientists including minority participants, students, postdocs and young scientists. Early career scientists will make up a significant fraction of the over 100 expected participants and are expected to interact extensively on an informal basis with the more senior scientists present. The conference will discuss a wide range of topics such as charge, spin and momentum Densities, but this time will include sessions on Modern Neutron Diffraction, electronic structure of nanoparticles and time-resolved diffraction, which are rapidly developing related fields. The conference is sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE), the International Union of Crystallography, and will be hosted by the Lujan Neutron Scattering Center at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
