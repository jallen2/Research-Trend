    <AbstractNarration>Great progress has been made in recent years in detecting massive planets orbiting other stars. These exciting discoveries are an important step toward understanding the evolution of other solar systems and whether or not they may harbor life. Tantalizing as these discoveries are, however, they are not conclusive. Astronomers have yet to find a planet in another solar system that could support life as we know it. To do so would require finding smaller solid (not gaseous) earth-like planets orbiting a star within the "habitable zone" where the distance of the planet from the star is such that the surface temperature of the planet can sustain liquid water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are at least four ways to detect a planet orbiting a star. By far the most successful means to date has been to very carefully monitor the velocity of the star. If the velocity tends to vary regularly about its average value, then it is possible that we are measuring the reflex velocity of the star as a planet moves around it in its orbit. This is a very exacting measurement to make and it relies on extremely accurate velocity measurements made with a spectrograph. Dr. Steve Osterman of the University Colorado is designing a very stable and accurate calibration mechanism to improve the radial velocity measurements for spectra taken not in visible light, but in the infrared. Infrared light is very useful in the study of cooler and smaller stars which are more numerous than hot stars. Finding planets around these stars will give us a much clearer picture than we currently have of how planets are actually formed and evolve. Dr. Osterman's wavelength calibration scheme uses a very rapidly pulsed laser to imprint a regularly spaced calibration "comb" of lines of precisely known wavelengths onto the spectrum of the star. This new technique is expected to improve the velocity determination from the current standard enough to detect earth-like planets in the habitable zone. Funding for this work is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>
