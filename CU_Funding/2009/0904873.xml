    <AbstractNarration>The 2009 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Mobile Ad hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS-2009) to be held at Macau SAR (Hongkong), PRC October 5- 8, 2009. MASS is a good quality annual meeting; it provides a venue for presenting new research results on ad-hoc and sensor networks. The conference fosters exchange of ideas among researchers and practitioners. In addition to technical paper presentation, the conference will also have keynote talks, panels, and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in MASS-2009 will be an important experience for US based graduate students; about 10 US based graduate students (including female and minority students) will participate in this conference using the provided support. It will not only provide them an opportunity to interact with peers and distinguished researchers, but also expose them to cutting edge research in the field of computer communications and networks. Such experience will be helpful to their education, career and professional growth.</AbstractNarration>
