    <AbstractNarration>Approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis often rely on&lt;br/&gt;manually or automatically constructed lexicons. Most such lexicons are&lt;br/&gt;compiled as lists of words, rather than word meanings ("senses").&lt;br/&gt;However, many words have both subjective and objective senses as well&lt;br/&gt;as senses of different polarities, which is a major source of&lt;br/&gt;ambiguity in subjectivity and sentiment analysis. The proposed work&lt;br/&gt;addresses this gap, by investigating novel methods for subjectivity&lt;br/&gt;sense labeling, and exploiting the results in sense-aware subjectivity&lt;br/&gt;and sentiment analysis. To achieve these goals, three research&lt;br/&gt;objectives are targeted. The first is developing methods for assigning&lt;br/&gt;subjectivity labels to word senses in a taxonomy. The second is&lt;br/&gt;developing contextual subjectivity disambiguation techniques to&lt;br/&gt;effectively make use of the word sense subjectivity annotations. The&lt;br/&gt;third is applying these techniques to multiple languages, including&lt;br/&gt;languages with fewer resources than English. The project will have&lt;br/&gt;broader impacts in both research and education. First, it will make&lt;br/&gt;subjectivity and sentiment resources and tools more widely available,&lt;br/&gt;in multiple languages, to the research community, which will help&lt;br/&gt;advance the state of the art in automatic subjectivity analysis, which&lt;br/&gt;in turn will benefit end applications. Second, several educational&lt;br/&gt;goals will be pursued: training graduate and undergraduate students in&lt;br/&gt;computational linguistics; augmenting artificial intelligence courses&lt;br/&gt;with projects based on the proposed research, which will offer&lt;br/&gt;students hands-on experience with natural language processing&lt;br/&gt;research; and reaching out to women and minorities to increase their&lt;br/&gt;exposure to text processing technologies and access to research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
