    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims at improving the reaction yield in synthesizing a new resin monomer material. The monomer was found to be processed to polymeric thermosetting resins useful for replacement of current urea-formaldehyde resins used as binders of various interior grade wood composite boards because of their excellent capability of reducing the formaldehyde emission levels of boards. Formaldehyde emission reduction or elimination from wood composite boards has been called for by general public as well as by various government regulations. There is currently no good commercial alternative binder resin system available to meet impending government regulations. For further development of the new resin system to the pilot plant and then to the commercial stage, the chemical synthesis method for the resin monomer material needs to be improved significantly in the laboratory. The proposed research aims to investigate the chemical synthesis method of the monomer by carrying out a series of reactions and measuring the yields of the product and byproducts to obtain the most optimum synthesis reaction parameters. The objective of research is to reach the chemical synthesis reaction yield of 95% or higher along with minimal associated costs of reaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims at expediting the commercialization of a new resin technology by optimizing the manufacturing process of monomer and thereby lowering the overall manufacturing cost. The new resin technology will enable the interior grade wood composite board industry to significantly reduce the formaldehyde emission levels of boards below the regulation levels. The industry will be able to continue the manufacturing of otherwise well-accepted wood composite boards, converting low value wood wastes into high-value wood composite boards. Further, the low formaldehyde emission of wood composite boards will directly result in significant health benefits to the public as well as lowering of environmental pollution. The proposed research and resultant implementation of the resin technology will enhance the technological understanding on the chemical and physical mechanisms of formaldehyde emission generally occurring in the hot press manufacturing of wood composite boards using UF resins. Relationship of the mole ratio of formaldehyde vs. functionality of base monomer of resins and resultant strength properties of boards and formaldehyde emission levels will be more clearly understood, which may lead to improvements in technologies that further reduce the formaldehyde emission levels of wood composite boards in the future.</AbstractNarration>
