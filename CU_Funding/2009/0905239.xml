    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this study is to develop a communication interface that &lt;br/&gt;will enable older people to effectively communicate with robotic &lt;br/&gt;assistants, allowing them in this way to remain living safely in their &lt;br/&gt;homes. The proposed communication interface will be: (1) multimodal, &lt;br/&gt;that is supporting spoken, gestural and physical interactions, as all &lt;br/&gt;these typically occur simultaneously when people communicate with one &lt;br/&gt;another, and (2) adaptive so that the robotic assistant will adjust to &lt;br/&gt;the older person rather than the older person to the robotic &lt;br/&gt;assistant. The combination of speech, gestures and physical &lt;br/&gt;interactions (haptics) has received only limited attention, but it &lt;br/&gt;will be critical for successful deployment of assistive robots for &lt;br/&gt;many elderly individuals. The transformative component of this &lt;br/&gt;research is to view haptics as one of the drivers of the dialogue &lt;br/&gt;between the user and the robot, and to study its relation to speech &lt;br/&gt;and gestures through language processing methods. To adapt to each &lt;br/&gt;user, the interpretation of the speech, gestures and haptic signals &lt;br/&gt;will be performed by means of RISq (Recognition by Indexing and &lt;br/&gt;Sequencing), a novel, adaptive and reliable recognition &lt;br/&gt;methodology. Finally, a formal and modular control design methodology &lt;br/&gt;will be developed, that guarantees that the robot responds safely and &lt;br/&gt;reliably to the interpretation of the user intent provided by dialogue &lt;br/&gt;processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot assistive technology holds immense promise for the &lt;br/&gt;future. Supporting the independent functioning of older people so that &lt;br/&gt;they can safely remain living in the community is of paramount &lt;br/&gt;importance, especially since the world's population is aging at an &lt;br/&gt;ever increasing pace. However, one of the main obstacles to the &lt;br/&gt;widespread use of robot assistants is the lack of interfaces that are &lt;br/&gt;easy to use for the elderly and allow the robot to be used in complex &lt;br/&gt;real-world environments such as a typical apartment. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;research aims to develop new tools that will enable robot developers &lt;br/&gt;to fill this void. The research could also have significant &lt;br/&gt;implications for the delivery of institutionally based health &lt;br/&gt;care. The deployment of robots to assist nursing personnel in &lt;br/&gt;hospitals and long-term care facilities, as well as at home, has &lt;br/&gt;enormous implications for improved health outcomes and quality of life &lt;br/&gt;for older patients while minimizing costs of care. Furthermore, the &lt;br/&gt;reduction of the nursing workload by such robot assistants promises to &lt;br/&gt;alleviate the critical shortage of nursing personnel in the USA that &lt;br/&gt;is only expected to worsen.</AbstractNarration>
