    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 08927921&lt;br/&gt;PI: Austin, Martha&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Dartmouth College&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Secure Systems Engineering Grand Challenge &lt;br/&gt; Problem Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to run a workshop that will set the stage for a competition in secure systems design. &lt;br/&gt;Drawing on the very successful DARPA Vehicle Grand Challenges, which enabled significant advances in artificial intelligence applied to autonomous vehicle control in a setting replete with road hazards and then in a urban setting, the PI wants so set up a competition where system designs will be tested against attempts to show that they contain vulnerabilities that threaten their security.&lt;br/&gt;Through the workshop, new paths leading towards sustainable improvement in information assurance practices will investigated. The primary results from the workshop will be the definition of one or more open multidisciplinary competitions to identify and demonstrate practical, effective approaches to improving the overall level of information assurance for the public and private sectors in specific application domains. &lt;br/&gt;Since these kind of competitions are new to the field of computer security, it is necessary to hold a workshop to energize the community and to define just what would constitute effective competitions.</AbstractNarration>
