    <AbstractNarration>Most of our direct knowledge of how hot the Earth can be comes from the study of such modern lavas such as those erupted in Hawaii and Iceland. But the Earth has an older record of melting and crystallization, locked in rocks that we can see and sample. One such occurrence on the coast of Labrador represents an intrusion of magma into the crust of the Earth from the mantle 1.3-billion years ago. This magma crystallized into olivine-bearing plagioclase rocks called troctolite. A recent experimental study by a UMass graduate student in the Five-College Experimental Petrology Laboratory housed at Smith College has shown high melting temperatures for these rocks at crustal pressures. Extrapolation to higher pressure suggests that the melted material may have separated from a mantle source more than a hundred degrees hotter than our familiar ocean basalts. We will test this inference through further melting experiments. Whatever the outcome, the results can help us understand the thermal structure of the Precambrian Earth at this location. In turn it will illuminate the origin of valuable nickel-cobalt ore deposits from the nearby Labrador coast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will capitalize on previous NSF support for the study of this remarkable occurrence of well-preserved rocks called the Kiglapait Intrusion and its associated anorthosites. Its results will lead to a better understanding of the origin of the troctolite-related Ni-Co sulfide ores at the Voisey's Bay mine some 70 km south of the Kiglapait intrusion. Using the model bulk composition of the intrusion, they have traced the plagioclase - olivine equilibrium to 15 kbar and found multiple saturation with spinel and two Al-pyroxenes at 13 kb, 1296 degrees C. It is proposed to extend the study by adding appropriate olivine to the mix until it saturates. It is expected that the experiments will lead to the appropriate conditions where a multi-saturated source temperature is in equilibrium with olivine ~Fo84, which may exceed 1300 degrees C. If proven correct, it would indicate that the source regions of the Labrador massif anorthosites, and their world-wide companions that are associated with troctolites, were typically at much high temperatures than currently thought. It is also planned to perform additional petrologic and geochemical work using a Cameca Ultra-Chron electron microprobe, including exploring the partitioning of Sr in plagioclase and apatite in the Kiglapait and Skaergaard intrusions, determing the Ba content in plagioclase, a study of phosphorus in olivine as an indicator of crystallization history, and the completion of the study of the Upper Border Zone of the Kiglapait Intrusion, and its record of liquid compositions throughout the 1-million-year crystallization history. Finally, a full sample catalog will be prepared for inclusion with the Kiglapait sample collection as it is eventually transferred to the American Museum of Natural History for curation and posting on its web site.</AbstractNarration>
