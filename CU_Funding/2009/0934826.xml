    <AbstractNarration>The project is disseminating educational innovations that have the potential to transform engineering education in a dedicated track at the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA) annual conference. The track is comprised of a series of workshops presented by faculty who have received NSF funding for educational innovations in engineering. The NCIIA is broadly soliciting and selecting workshop proposals to identify the most innovative educational practices. These efforts are reaching the NCIIA community of educators, which is known for leading curricular change and program development. The workshops target "early adopters" in the engineering education community who are most likely to implement emerging methods and tools for instruction and assessment. To engage a diverse constituency in this work, the NCIIA recruits workshop presenters and participants through focused outreach to underrepresented groups in engineering. The investigators are evaluating the impact of the workshops on the attendees: a) knowledge of educational innovations, b) intentions to implement workshop ideas, and c) actual implementation of the innovations presented at the workshops.</AbstractNarration>
