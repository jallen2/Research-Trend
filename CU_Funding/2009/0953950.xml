    <AbstractNarration>The long-term research goal is to develop novel data mining&lt;br/&gt;technologies to elucidate the structures and dynamics of complex&lt;br/&gt;but ubiquitous networks. A complex network is a large system&lt;br/&gt;of elements (vertices) that are joined by non-trivial relationships&lt;br/&gt;(edges). Examples of such complex networks include the WWW,&lt;br/&gt;metabolic and protein networks, social networks, and economic&lt;br/&gt;and financial markets. The underlying principles and laws of these&lt;br/&gt;network systems can help us construct more effective&lt;br/&gt;communication mechanisms, find cures for fatal diseases, and&lt;br/&gt;deal with economic crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of the significant advances that have been made towards&lt;br/&gt;understanding the fundamental laws that govern the structure and&lt;br/&gt;behavior of complex networks, there is still a disconnect between&lt;br/&gt; current analytical techniques and their applicability to real-world&lt;br/&gt;complex networks. A principled approach is lacking to systematically&lt;br/&gt;analyze a single large complex network and link system behaviors to&lt;br/&gt; network structure. There is also immediate and crucial need for a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical framework to understand the relationships between&lt;br/&gt;multiple networks, which is the key for comparative network analysis. &lt;br/&gt;How to integrate and leverage the rich system data, such as&lt;br/&gt;measurement time series, associated with network topology to study&lt;br/&gt;complex systems is still an open question. This project addresses&lt;br/&gt;these issues by: 1) developing novel graph and information&lt;br/&gt;theoretical approaches to extracting network backbones which both&lt;br/&gt;simplify and highlight network structures; 2) developing information&lt;br/&gt;theoretical network distance measures and clustering algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;comparative network analysis; 3) applying causality inference and&lt;br/&gt;network modularity to integrate time series with network topology.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed mining methodologies build upon an innovative blend&lt;br/&gt;of graph theoretical, information theoretical, and statistical learning&lt;br/&gt;concepts and techniques, and can greatly expand the reach of&lt;br/&gt;data mining. This project will also help us better analyze the&lt;br/&gt;emerging complexity, heterogeneity, and large scale of real-world&lt;br/&gt;complex network data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a close collaboration with domain experts from social and political&lt;br/&gt;sciences, software engineering, and bioinformatics, the proposed&lt;br/&gt;techniques have the potential to help understand how human society is&lt;br/&gt;organized at the individual level (social networks) and organizational&lt;br/&gt;level (political science); illuminate how large scale software systems&lt;br/&gt;form and evolve; reveal the organizational principles of biocellular&lt;br/&gt;systems in a dynamic environment; and identify therapeutic or drug&lt;br/&gt;targets. Using the popular online social networks, such as MySpace&lt;br/&gt;and Facebook, as ``hooks'', this project will attract, recruit, and&lt;br/&gt;prepare students from underrepresented groups including women&lt;br/&gt;and minorities to computer science and involve underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;students in the cutting-edge research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page at:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jin/NSFCAREER/</AbstractNarration>
