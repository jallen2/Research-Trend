    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the CAREER development plan of Prof. Ling Zang of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Southern Illinois. Prof. Zang and his students will synthesize organic nanowires and characterize their optoelectronic properties using near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) and conductivity measurements. The study will result in increasing understanding of the behavior of adsorbates on organic nanowires and the electronic response of organic nanowires due to adsorption of molecules on their surface. The study will facilitate the development of improved nanowire-based sensors that can find use in many applications including environmental analysis, bioanalytical measurements and defense and national security applications. The project will provide excellent educational training opportunities to students in the area of nanomaterials synthesis and will address growing workforce needs. Particular emphasis will be placed on recruiting high school students to this new field.</AbstractNarration>
