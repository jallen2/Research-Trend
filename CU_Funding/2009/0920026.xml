    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) and Norfolk State University (NSU) is developing a total of eight learning modules covering topics in software defined radio (SDR). Software defined radio is an emerging design paradigm in which many system components are implemented in software rather than hardware. This enables a single radio to adapt to different communication protocols, bandwidth constraints and channel conditions which can significantly improve the utility and efficiency of the device. Two modules are being developed for each year in a typical four-year electrical engineering degree program so that software defined radio can be vertically integrated into the curriculum. The modules are being developed with an inclusive pedagogy utilizing a combination of teaching strategies and learning activities that have been documented to be compatible with gender, ethnic and generational diversity in both formal and informal learning environments. The completed modules are being vertically integrated into the curriculum at both VT and NSU. The learning modules and project results are being disseminated through workshops held at VPI and at the SDR Forum. The project includes a comprehensive assessment and evaluation plan coordinated by an independent evaluator that utilizes both quantitative and qualitative methods.</AbstractNarration>
