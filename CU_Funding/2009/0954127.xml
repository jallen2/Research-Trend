    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this CAREER research study is to determine how undergraduate students conceptualize and explain complex biological phenomena, including: (1) cancer, and (2) genetic modification of organisms. In addition, this study explores the psychological basis for how these students learn about these subjects. Four study/survey groups are being compared: (1) entering biology majors; (2) graduating biology majors; (3) non-biology majors; and (4) expert research biologists, all located at San Francisco State University (SFSU). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching research hypothesis is that entering university biology majors and graduating biology majors hold multiple explanatory frameworks for their understanding of these complex biological phenomena. If this is the case, then biology majors may employ different explanations for a biological phenomenon, like cancer, depending on whether or not they are cued to apply their basic biology knowledge learned in school. A specific aim of this proposal is to investigate what conceptual changes biology majors undergo as a result of their undergraduate training and to what extent do they develop biological expertise during their university education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research includes three approaches to gaining insight into biology learning during the proposed five-year funding period: (1) a comparative, cross-sectional survey of a large number (~1800) of university students; (2) more detailed videotaped survey interviews with a subset (~120) of the above-referenced university students; and (3) a longitudinal study over the entire funding period of 20 non-biology majors as compared to 20 biology majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research study is being carried out by Tanner and her graduate students in the SFSU biology department. This represents a unique opportunity for STEM-content-based (biology) graduate students to receive training and experience in science educational research. Furthermore, the PI is developing a new concentration in biology education research as part of the Masters degree in biology. As an urban-serving institution, this project includes a broad representation and diversity of the target undergraduate population. This study is being enhanced by input received from an advisory committee composed of cognitive scientists and science education researchers, as well as through ongoing formative assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will inform both the science education and biological content communities. Research findings will be widely disseminated via presentations at national meetings and articles published in peer-reviewed professional journals. It is anticipated that these research results will contribute to understanding how undergraduate students learn complex biological phenomena and lead to insights that could influence how these ideas are taught in higher education throughout the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
