    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0905891&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kevin E. Wortman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator intends to study four basic problems&lt;br/&gt;about the large-scale geometry of arithmetic groups: "classical&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic groups" such as SL(n,Z), "S-arithmetic groups" such as&lt;br/&gt;SL(n,Z[1/p]), and "function-field-arithmetic groups" such as&lt;br/&gt;SL(n,F[t]) where F is a finite field. The first problem is to&lt;br/&gt;identify the Dehn function for SL(n,Z) if n &gt; 3. Second, to&lt;br/&gt;determine for which m a given function-field-arithmetic group is&lt;br/&gt;of type FPm. Third, to develop a theory of fillings for&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic groups that is inclusive of all types of arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;groups, and that includes the first and second problems stated&lt;br/&gt;above. Fourth, to verify what is conjectured to be the first&lt;br/&gt;dimension of the cohomology of a function-field-arithmetic group&lt;br/&gt;that is infinitely generated. In addition, the PI intends to use&lt;br/&gt;the knowledge learned from the problems above to further&lt;br/&gt;investigate the finiteness properties and word metrics of&lt;br/&gt;"universal lattices", such as SL(n,Z[t]).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What all of the problems above include is the study of arrays of&lt;br/&gt;numbers, called matrices. Being able to understand the arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;of matrices is a fundamental problem in mathematics that has&lt;br/&gt;applications to most fields of science and economics. As&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians have done in the past with great success, the PI&lt;br/&gt;intends to study the arithmetic associated with matrices by&lt;br/&gt;bundling the equations they represent into a single geometric&lt;br/&gt;theory.</AbstractNarration>
