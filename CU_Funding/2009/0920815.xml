    <AbstractNarration>Disciplines: Mathematical Sciences (21) and Interdisciplinary/Multidisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "DIYModeling -- Do It Yourself Modeling and Simulation for STEM Learning" CCLI Phase 2 collaborative research project is developing 1) the Do-It-Yourself Modeling (DIYModeling) software which enables users to create models using the ordinary language of mathematics and then to enter a game quality simulation; 2) the DIYModeling Component Libraries which can be added to a simulation to enable users to focus on modeling and the underlying science and mathematics; and 3) a library of educational resources that are centered on the models and modeling supported by DIYModeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project includes using simulation and gaming software to construct an environment in which students hypothesize solutions to problems, construct models to simulate their hypotheses, and then compare the results of those models to observations. The students are using modern mathematical notation instead of special, software-specific notation for their modeling tasks. Using space exploration as a theme, this professionally-developed software is a powerful tool for exploring challenging and realistic problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborative DIYModeling project team includes six universities which represent diversity in type of institution and in geographical location. The PI-team is teaching and is field-testing the software and corresponding learning resources in mathematics, business, physics, and biology courses. Furthermore, this project is building a large community of users to expand and enhance the component library. Both formative and summative evaluations are included. The software and the lessons are being disseminated through workshops, presentations, and NSDL.</AbstractNarration>
