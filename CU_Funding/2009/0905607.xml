    <AbstractNarration>Distributed Concurrent Maude ( DCMaude ) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rewriting model of computation is simple , yet general and flexible . A system &lt;br/&gt;of any kind , for example , an algorithm , a database , a hardware system , a &lt;br/&gt;programming language , a network protocol , a sensor network , or the molecular &lt;br/&gt;biology dynamics of a cell , can be modeled by a set of rewrite rules that &lt;br/&gt;describe the systems behavior . The rewriting model of computation is &lt;br/&gt;intrinsically concurrent , without any need for explicit concurrency constructs . &lt;br/&gt;Any set of rules that apply to nonoverlapping system components can execute &lt;br/&gt;concurrently . For a large distributed system such as a network or a cell , this &lt;br/&gt;means that at any given time thousands or millions of concurrent transitions may &lt;br/&gt;be happening in parallel . &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maude is a language based on rewriting logic . The current Maude implementation &lt;br/&gt;provides a high performance rewrite engine , as well as builtin search , &lt;br/&gt;unification , and model checking tools to support execution and analysis of &lt;br/&gt;systems specified in Maude . To realize inherent concurrency of rewriting , the &lt;br/&gt;proposed project will develop an implementation of Maude called Distributed and &lt;br/&gt;Concurrent Maude ( DCMaude ) that will exploit the concurrency available in &lt;br/&gt;multicore/multiprocessor machines , and support distributed computing and systems &lt;br/&gt;programming . The rewriting semantics of Maude supports seamless transition &lt;br/&gt;between concurrent and distributed execution of a system : execution in one &lt;br/&gt;process , multiple processes/cores , or multiple machines . In addition to built in &lt;br/&gt;strategies for concurrency , the design of DCMaude will include a means for the &lt;br/&gt;programmer to control concurrency at a high level of abstraction in a &lt;br/&gt;declarative way . &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DC Maude will provide new methods and tools that can significantly improve both &lt;br/&gt;the design and the implementation of open distributed systems , including &lt;br/&gt;web-based systems and next-generation networks .</AbstractNarration>
