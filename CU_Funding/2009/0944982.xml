    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will expand the knowledge of high-temperature material formulations for 3-D printing, rapid prototyping, and rapid manufacturing. Significant amounts of energy can be saved in systems such as solid oxide fuel cells, nuclear reactors, industrial furnaces, chemical processing plants and steam generators if a low cost material method can be developed. This project will investigate making fiber-reinforced ceramic-metal composites that provide superior strength and endurance and are capable of operating in high-temperature harsh environments. A novel 3-D printing process that lends itself to mass-customization will be used to generate these new compositions. A successful research outcome will establish the feasibility of producing low cost high performance components for energy systems that cannot be cost effectively manufactured with traditional methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable significant next generation advances in energy systems. The ability to 3-D print new high-temperature material formulations will support research at universities and corporations and initiate a new paradigm in the way designers view component integration for energy intensive systems. The U.S. energy market will save a potential 2,670 trillion BTUs of energy and 26.82 million tons of green house gas reductions through the successful commercialization of this technology. The reduction in fossil fuels will have a positive impact on our energy security, environmental quality, and the economic well-being of our country. This research will expand the body of knowledge of 3-D formed ceramic-metal based materials and components with the expectation of spreading this technology into the developing renewable energy applications in the wind, solar and nuclear arenas.</AbstractNarration>
