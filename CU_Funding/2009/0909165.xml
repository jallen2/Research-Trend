    <AbstractNarration>Calderer&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0909165&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project deals with modeling and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;ferroelectric liquid crystals and hydrogels, with the goal of&lt;br/&gt;studying switching and hysteresis of devices made of such&lt;br/&gt;materials. The project on liquid crystals focuses on newly&lt;br/&gt;discovered bent core ferroelectric phases that are capable of&lt;br/&gt;sustaining polarization fields of just one order of magnitude&lt;br/&gt;below that of traditional solid ferroelectric compounds. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of the work on hydrogels is to model a cyclic membrane&lt;br/&gt;appropriate for application to the design of pulsating drug&lt;br/&gt;delivery devices. Such types of elastic membranes are also very&lt;br/&gt;relevant to the study of fuel cells and filtrating devices. Both&lt;br/&gt;problems share distinctive phenomenology and mathematical issues,&lt;br/&gt;such as presenting a first order phase transition behavior&lt;br/&gt;between two distinguished states. In ferroelectric liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals, they correspond to the oppositely polarized states with&lt;br/&gt;distinct optical properties; a main goal is to optimize the&lt;br/&gt;switching speed between them. Understanding and controlling&lt;br/&gt;hysteresis may help achieve optimal switching. This also&lt;br/&gt;requires a good understanding of the rheology of bent core liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystal flow. Mathematical issues involve non-convexity,&lt;br/&gt;metastability, and coupling of Maxwell's equations with fluid&lt;br/&gt;flow and elasticity. Overall, ferroelectricity is an area of&lt;br/&gt;liquid crystals rich in phenomenology, modeling, and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;challenges that remain largely unexplored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It is often the case that seemingly disparate problems of&lt;br/&gt;science and technology have common mathematical underpinnings. &lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigator addresses two of these&lt;br/&gt;problems, with applications in pharmacology and fuel cells as&lt;br/&gt;well as in optical devices, such as video and high speed Internet&lt;br/&gt;switching. The underlying idea is the modeling and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;study of "switching," with the goal of designing faster and more&lt;br/&gt;efficient devices. In pharmaceutical applications, a switch&lt;br/&gt;connects the two relevant states: release and non-release of the&lt;br/&gt;drug to be administered. A goal of the investigator is to model&lt;br/&gt;a cyclic drug delivery membrane. Such periodically releasing&lt;br/&gt;devices are believed to be especially relevant in hormone&lt;br/&gt;therapies, where matching the natural body hormone cycle is&lt;br/&gt;perhaps as important as the replacement hormone itself. In&lt;br/&gt;proton exchange membrane fuel cells, positive hydrogen ions&lt;br/&gt;produced at the anode travel through the membrane, separating&lt;br/&gt;from the fuel and yielding electrons. A ferroelectric switch&lt;br/&gt;connects optically distinct states. In these examples, energy&lt;br/&gt;loss is a common feature of switching dynamics, together with&lt;br/&gt;cycle lengthening in periodic devices. This phenomenon, known as&lt;br/&gt;hysteresis, occurs in many mechanical and magnetic systems. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator harnesses the mathematical knowledge of hysteresis&lt;br/&gt;in other fields as an approach to understanding pharmacological&lt;br/&gt;and liquid crystal devices. Mentoring of graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students as well as other educational activities is&lt;br/&gt;intertwined and integrated with the research aspects of the work.</AbstractNarration>
