    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this effort is to provide partial support to the Micro and Nano Systems Horizon 2040 Workshop, which will be held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Solid State Sensors, Actuators, and Microsystems (Transducers 2009), in Denver, Colorado. The workshop will bring together researchers, scientists, and engineers who are interested in micro and nano systems for panel discussions on how to prioritize research in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will cover emerging research themes relevant to micro and nano systems interests in the ECCS division, including four topics to be addressed in break-out sessions: environmental monitoring; infrastructure monitoring and homeland security; health care; and energy/power. The Transducers 2009 Conference also covers these topics, and includes many papers supported by ENG and ECCS awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop and conference will involve a range of participants from industrial representatives to academic researchers and students. Representatives of other government agencies have also been invited as observers.</AbstractNarration>
