    <AbstractNarration>Twenty undergraduate students are receiving S-STEM scholarships in the pursuit of either an Associate or Baccalaureate degree in Chemistry or Biochemistry in the Department of Chemistry at Idaho State University (ISU). Of these scholarships, eight are four years and are designed for in-coming freshman; twelve are for an average of two years, targeting previously enrolled students and transfer students. This project focuses on undergraduates from a region of the country with a disproportionate number of economically-disadvantaged students. This effort links with other ISU assets, including both an American Chemical Society-supported Project SEED program and specialized on-campus recruiting staff that works with under-represented students and facilitates their academic success after receiving a scholarship. With proper financial and academic support, student retention and placement of students upon graduation will be enhanced. The project's objectives are to provide support services to ensure a retention rate of at least 70% among scholarship holders; and that after obtaining a degree, to have at least 90% of scholarship recipients either continue their education or enter into STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>
