    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to establish a link between key macroscopic material properties and the underlying micro-structure in granular soils via a multi-scale probing framework, thereby bypassing phenomenological material evolution laws. We focus on establishing a bridge between the well-established continuum mechanics framework and discrete mechanics at the granular scale, while capturing the real micro-structure (e.g., grain shape and kinematics) by combining advanced experimental and X-ray techniques with contact mechanics based on parametric surfaces. Ingrained to the research objective, the educational objective of this project is to increase the accessibility of fundamental concepts in geomechanics (e.g., permeability) to yield deeper learning. High school and undergraduate students will work on the development of hands-on experiences that will lead others to the observation and theoretical synthetization of important concepts used in teaching and research. The experiences will then be used as part of outreach initiatives and inductive teaching in the undergraduate curriculum. The experiences will be made widely available via the Internet and will leverage recent developments in instrumentation and visualization to make them accessible and affordable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic research connecting multiple scales accurately in geomaterials will transform our understanding of these materials, resulting in the development of predictive models and improved educational methods in engineering and science. This multi-scale framework could be used to formulate more durable greener concrete by manipulating the nano (micro) structure, more reliable pore-scale models for granular rocks in deep oil reservoirs, and physics-based models for soils during landslides, thus having a potentially deep societal impact. Collaboration with industry and academia will enhance the infrastructure for research and education. The inclusion of American undergraduate and high school students will contribute to broader participation of underrepresented groups. The work will allow significant steps towards addressing societal challenges: recruitment and retention of a talented workforce in science and engineering capable of addressing our pressing needs in energy, infrastructure, and sustainability.</AbstractNarration>
