    <AbstractNarration>The Departments of Mathematics, Science, and Education at three California State University (CSU) campuses that have strong undergraduate programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and a significant commitment to teacher preparation, have come together in a project aimed at increasing preparation of 43 math teachers for high-need schools in underserved regions. The project establishes the California Coast Noyce Scholarship (CCNS) partnership among these three CSU campuses - Humboldt State University (HSU), CSU Channel Islands (CSUCI), and CSU Monterey Bay (CSUMB) - in order to double the number of outstanding math teachers prepared to teach in high needs schools. The strategies of this Noyce partnership address the fact that the lead campus, HSU, has many undergraduates in STEM majors interested in teaching careers, but is located in the north coast region of the state, with limited demand for new teachers. The other two institutions, in two of the highest-growth regions in the state, are not able to meet the large local demand for mathematics teachers. Through this partnership, undergraduate Noyce Scholars are able to complete a STEM degree at any of the three campuses, transfer seamlessly to one of the other partner campuses for their teaching credential, and continue as a Noyce Scholar during their post-baccalaureate teacher certification (credential) program. The pathway is typically from HSU to CSUCI and CSUMB to prepare Noyce Scholars for the teacher-shortage regions the campuses serve. Noyce Scholars on each campus complete a rigorous undergraduate mathematics program and teacher certification program. The CCNS project is an integral part of the mathematics major on each campus and includes significant support for Scholars as undergraduates and during their teacher credential program. The project also provides scholarships to STEM professional career changers seeking math teaching certification. The three campuses collaborate in an ongoing basis on common projects and through continuous interaction in an online Noyce Scholars Teaching Commons. In addition, they jointly host an annual conference for the Noyce Scholars on the three campuses to meet one another, learn together, share ideas and practices, and become part of a community that continues as they begin their teaching careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is implementing and evaluating a design for addressing the shortage of qualified mathematics and science teachers by facilitating movement from a campus with a large supply of STEM undergraduates and limited teaching opportunities to campuses in regions that have a large unmet need for new mathematics teachers that cannot be addressed by the local institutions that prepare new teachers. It is an innovative approach that is helping to document and report on the factors that make this type of transition a success and the challenges that must be overcome for it to work effectively. Its strategies are being disseminated through reports, publications, and presentations at state and national professional association meetings. The CSU Chancellor's Office considers the program to be a highly significant model and is sharing information about its leadership role within the National Association of State University and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC) Science and Mathematics Teacher Imperative.</AbstractNarration>
