    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing a collaborative infrastructure among academic, industry, and government stakeholders to deliver cutting-edge renewable energy education for the existing and future technician workforce. The project is building on CERET's unique renewable energy certificate prototype that includes both online and face to face courses taught by seasoned renewable energy experts. To satisfy a national need for flexible delivery courses in renewable energy technology disciplines, project staff are expanding the model to reach a much larger number of students and schools. Specifically, the project is developing a new 15-credit certificate option that can be completed totally online. The project is also developing a process by which other schools can adapt the model for their own individual needs. Project staff are encouraging other schools to create their own certificates, transferring in CERET certificate courses as needed. These schools are posting their certificates, courses, and programs on a national renewable energy directory, widening the number and diversity of nationwide renewable energy course options. A host of technologies and resources (e.g. webinars, Wiki pages, online discussions, curricular materials) are being used to support partner schools these efforts. Finally, resources are being shared with faculty in other disciplines so they can engage non-traditional and minority students in the renewable energies field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is also growing the next generation of renewable energy two-year college and high school educators through a series of Train the Trainer Academies. These Academies are giving educator participants from across the nation authentic hands-on renewable energy experiences taught by veteran energy industry professionals. The Academies are cultivating a learning community of renewable energy educators and providing a forum for sharing instructional innovations and exemplary teaching practices. Thus, participating instructors are being empowered with the academic background and technical skills to drive change in their home institutions.</AbstractNarration>
