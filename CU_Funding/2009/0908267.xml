    <AbstractNarration>Bourdin&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908267&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award is funded under the American Recovery and&lt;br/&gt;Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Enhanced geothermal systems represent a virtually untapped,&lt;br/&gt;clean, renewable, economically viable, and widely available&lt;br/&gt;source of energy. They rely on harvesting heat by circulating&lt;br/&gt;water through artificially stimulated fracture systems in deep&lt;br/&gt;hot dry rocks. This project provides a predictive understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the mechanisms commonly used to generate these systems:&lt;br/&gt;pressure- and temperature-driven fracture. The modeling and&lt;br/&gt;analysis are based on a variational fracture formulation, which&lt;br/&gt;has been developed over the last ten years or so and has strong&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and mechanical foundations. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;extends this formulation to dynamic fractures and improves its&lt;br/&gt;implementation on parallel supercomputers. He extends its scope&lt;br/&gt;by studying and implementing two approaches to the penalization&lt;br/&gt;of material interpenetration along crack lips. He develops&lt;br/&gt;variational models for the pressure- and temperature-driven&lt;br/&gt;fracture problems, approximates them using the idea of&lt;br/&gt;Gamma-convergence, implements the regularized models on parallel&lt;br/&gt;supercomputers, and conducts large scale realistic validation&lt;br/&gt;experiments that are compared with existing engineering&lt;br/&gt;literature. This project is a first step in a nascent&lt;br/&gt;multi-disciplinary initiative fostered through the Center for&lt;br/&gt;Computation and Technology at LSU, involving mathematicians,&lt;br/&gt;computational scientists, and engineers. It supports the&lt;br/&gt;participation of two undergraduates and one graduate student per&lt;br/&gt;year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As the Nation strives to reduce its carbon footprint,&lt;br/&gt;protect its economy from fluctuating oil prices, and increase its&lt;br/&gt;energy independence, Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) represent&lt;br/&gt;a virtually untapped, clean, renewable, economically viable and&lt;br/&gt;widely available source of energy. They rely on harvesting heat&lt;br/&gt;by circulating water through artificially stimulated, highly&lt;br/&gt;connected fracture systems in deep hot dry rocks. A recent&lt;br/&gt;MIT-led interdisciplinary assessment panel commissioned by the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Energy estimates that even without major technical&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs EGS could cover 20% of the estimated US electricity&lt;br/&gt;needs by 2050, in an economically viable way and with only&lt;br/&gt;marginal carbon emission and land use. A major technical issue&lt;br/&gt;identified in this report is the creation of sufficiently&lt;br/&gt;connected fracture systems. The investigator develops a&lt;br/&gt;predictive understanding of two mechanisms commonly used to&lt;br/&gt;generate these systems: pressure- and temperature-driven&lt;br/&gt;fracture, based on a mechanically faithful and mathematically&lt;br/&gt;sound variational formulation of fracture developed over the last&lt;br/&gt;decade. This model is extended to account for the specifics of&lt;br/&gt;EGS, then implemented on parallel supercomputers. Large scale&lt;br/&gt;numerical simulations are performed using the cyberinfrastructure&lt;br/&gt;provided by the TeraGrid, to allow EGS designers to devise&lt;br/&gt;stimulation patterns maximizing the efficiency and sustainability&lt;br/&gt;of new systems. This project is a first step in a nascent&lt;br/&gt;multi-disciplinary initiative fostered through the Center for&lt;br/&gt;Computation and Technology at LSU, involving mathematicians,&lt;br/&gt;computational scientists, and engineers. It supports each year&lt;br/&gt;the participation of two undergraduates and one graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
