    <AbstractNarration>Much of human perception is driven by the visual appearance of the&lt;br/&gt;world. People are captivated by the effects of natural lighting and&lt;br/&gt;shading patterns, such as the soft shadows from the leaves of a tree&lt;br/&gt;in skylight, the glints of sunlight in ocean waves, or the shiny&lt;br/&gt;reflections from a velvet cushion. In computer graphics, it is&lt;br/&gt;important to be able to accurately reproduce these appearance effects,&lt;br/&gt;to create realistic images for applications like video games, vehicle&lt;br/&gt;and flight simulators, or architectural design of interior spaces.&lt;br/&gt;However, it is still very difficult to accurately model complex&lt;br/&gt;illumination and reflection effects in interactive applications like&lt;br/&gt;games, in image-based rendering applications like e-commerce, or in&lt;br/&gt;computer vision applications like face recognition. In the past, the&lt;br/&gt;above applications have been addressed separately, by devising&lt;br/&gt;particular algorithms for specific problems. In this project, the&lt;br/&gt;research focuses on the mathematical and computational fundamentals of&lt;br/&gt;visual appearance, seeking to understand the intrinsic computational&lt;br/&gt;structure of illumination, reflection and shadowing, and develop a&lt;br/&gt;unified approach to many problems in graphics and vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrust of the research will be to develop appropriate&lt;br/&gt;mathematical representations for appearance, along with computational&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and signal-processing techniques such as Clebsch-Gordan&lt;br/&gt;expansions, wavelet methods with triple product expansions, and radial&lt;br/&gt;basis functions. A major advantage of this approach is that the same&lt;br/&gt;representations, analysis and computation tools can then be applied to&lt;br/&gt;many application domains, such as real-time and image-based rendering,&lt;br/&gt;Monte Carlo sampling and lighting-insensitive recognition. This&lt;br/&gt;research philosophy builds on the investigator's dissertation, where&lt;br/&gt;he developed a signal-processing framework for reflection, leading to&lt;br/&gt;new frequency domain algorithms for both forward and inverse rendering.</AbstractNarration>
