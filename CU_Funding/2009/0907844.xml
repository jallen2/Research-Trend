    <AbstractNarration>Pakzad&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0907844&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This work is a part of a long-term project of the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his collaborators to study the elasticity&lt;br/&gt;properties of materials through methods of calculus of&lt;br/&gt;variations. Here, the focus is on situations when the elastic&lt;br/&gt;bodies exhibit some sort of rigid behavior. In this manner, the&lt;br/&gt;study of geometric properties of structures, e.g. the properties&lt;br/&gt;of various spaces of isometries and infinitesimal isometries of&lt;br/&gt;2-dimensional surfaces, comes to the fore. This differs from&lt;br/&gt;classical differential geometry in the weaker regularity of the&lt;br/&gt;given surface or of the deformations. A first objective is to&lt;br/&gt;identify and rigorously derive variational theories for thin&lt;br/&gt;shells from the 3-dimensional theory of nonlinear elasticity&lt;br/&gt;through Gamma-convergence methods. The derived theories&lt;br/&gt;naturally depend on the scaling regimes of the elastic energy or&lt;br/&gt;body forces in terms of shell thickness. In this context, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator works on problems involving various spaces of weakly&lt;br/&gt;differentiable isometries. In parallel, properties of the&lt;br/&gt;derived theories, such as multiplicity and regularity of&lt;br/&gt;solutions, or their dependence on the geometry of the shell, are&lt;br/&gt;investigated. Another line of investigation is the study of&lt;br/&gt;non-stress-free configurations observed e.g. in the growth of&lt;br/&gt;leaves. A tangentially heterogeneous 3-dimensional nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;elastic model is studied and the Gamma-limit approach is used to&lt;br/&gt;reduce the dimension and analyze the model. Quantitative&lt;br/&gt;rigidity estimates also are studied as a strong analytical tool&lt;br/&gt;in tackling these variational problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies different mechanical phenomena&lt;br/&gt;under the unifying umbrella of the nonlinear elasticity theory. &lt;br/&gt;Elastic materials exhibit qualitatively different responses to&lt;br/&gt;different kinematic boundary conditions or body forces. This&lt;br/&gt;fact has given rise to many interesting questions in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory of elasticity. The main goal of this theory&lt;br/&gt;is to explain various, apparently different, phenomena in terms&lt;br/&gt;of some shared mathematical principles. The variational approach&lt;br/&gt;to the nonlinear theory has been very effective in dealing with&lt;br/&gt;these questions. It has also been helpful in rigorously deriving&lt;br/&gt;models for elastic shells or plates pertaining to different&lt;br/&gt;scaling regimes of the body forces. In the latter context, the&lt;br/&gt;strength of this approach lies in the fact that it can predict&lt;br/&gt;the appropriate model together with the response of the elastic&lt;br/&gt;plate for the given scaling of forces or kinematic boundary&lt;br/&gt;conditions without any a priori assumptions other than the&lt;br/&gt;general principles of the 3-dimensional nonlinear elasticity. &lt;br/&gt;Another feature of this approach is that it can lead to new&lt;br/&gt;models that were not previously considered.</AbstractNarration>
