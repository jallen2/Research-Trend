    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GLORIAD project will include cooperative partnerships with its longstanding partners in Russia (Kurchatov Institute), Korea (KISTI), China (Chinese Academy of Sciences), the Netherlands (SurFnet), the Nordic countries (NORDUnet and ICELINK), Canada (CANARIE), and Hong Kong (HKOEP). In addition, it develops new partnerships with Egypt (ENSTINet and TEGROUP), India (Tata and the National Knowledge Network), Singapore (SINGAREN), and Vietnam (VinAREN), and further cooperation with STARLight, TRANSPAC, National Lambda Rail (NLR), and Internet2. Numerous other research and education networks will be connected in Southeast Asia, Africa, Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus region through the development of open, optical network exchanges in these locations. Expanding the US-China network capacity and providing hybrid, dynamically provisioned services enables a new range of advanced applications, It furthers US-Nordic partnership in cyberinfrastructure development, connects scientifically vital polar parts of the globe that are not yet connected, and provides a new possibility for furtherance of US-Russia science collaboration. GLORIAD will also explore and create new opportunities for network development in Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLORIAD will demonstrate proactive US leadership in cyberinfrastructure by extending US reach to global scientific communities as it builds a more open, decentralized global network architecture for science and education. This project builds on network measurement, monitoring, and security tools that focus directly on secure networking and on improving individual user performance. It furthers GLORIADs program to create a standards-based, open-source, decentralized method of network operations, the distributed virtual network operations center (dvNOC), and to enable a new approach to governance and management of cyberinfrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The GLORIAD project advances cyberinfrastructure services and metrics, broadens the global community working on measuring and mitigating customer-based infrastructure performance, and furthers the model of distributed, decentralized management of cyberinfrastructure resources. Additional connectivity and bandwidth allows greater access to cutting edge research in the US, Egypt, South East Asia, Central Asia, Caucasus, Africa, and Muslim-majority countries. It advances research in pragmatic network deployments and operations. The extension of performance tools will have the potential to strongly impact research and education network deployments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;GLORIAD?s broadest impact lies in contributions as an infrastructure for research and education. The project will foster collaborations among disciplines and institutions. The network provides unprecedented bandwidth and dedicated services for US researchers to collaborate with counterparts in India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Egypt, Vietnam, South East Asia, Africa, and Central Asia/Caucasus region. GLORIAD has a long track record of fostering partnerships between public-private entities that address major science problems and can potentially reach tens of thousands of people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLORIAD is committed to diversity in all activities, and aims to support US national interests by providing network access to Muslim-majority countries and underserved regions of the world. GLORIAD?s broad dissemination of information will enhance scientific and technological understanding by offering tools and information for new users. GLORIAD will bring this information to a diverse group in various languages and levels of expertise, from expert to student to the policy community and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
