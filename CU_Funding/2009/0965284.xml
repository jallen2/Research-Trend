    <AbstractNarration>This project, "NSF Scholars: Training Tomorrow's Scientists Today", demonstrates the effectiveness of a scholarship program for students based on a cohort model, providing a combination of financial aid and integration into the academic and social environment of the university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The university has previous experience with a cohort model for urban minority and low income students though the Act Six program, which has had a 94% graduation rate. The NSF Scholar program utilizes existing student academic support and mentoring services, tested with six years of Act Six students, such as a bridge program, tutoring, and faculty and peer mentors. It adds two new elements: 1) peer facilitated Supplemental Instruction in the foundational sequences and 2) an interdisciplinary course entitled "Preparing for a STEM Career" designed to guide students toward learning and understanding their own specific strengths and values, so that they can see what kinds of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career opportunities are consistent with their own strengths and values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project impacts the national need for scientists by encouraging and mentoring undergraduates, particularly minority students, who will become tomorrow's scientists. The project is impacting the university itself by 1) advancing the 2005-2010 Strategic Plan, that calls for an intercultural campus and improved science education, 2) training a larger number of peer facilitators and faculty and peer mentors, resulting in a greater number of students and faculty with intercultural competence, 3) improving science education for all students, and 4) developing a career course for all science students, which provides the opportunity for them to explore different science careers that might be the best fit for the life they envision.</AbstractNarration>
