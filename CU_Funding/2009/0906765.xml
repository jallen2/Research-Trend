    <AbstractNarration>In this project the investigator focuses on linear representations of&lt;br/&gt;Gaussian random fields. He considers models that either avoid explicit&lt;br/&gt;computation of the covariance matrix or do so for relatively small&lt;br/&gt;dimensions. The correlation functions of the considered processes are&lt;br/&gt;very general, avoiding particular symmetries or stationarity. The PI&lt;br/&gt;considers models that work in domains of general dimension and, in&lt;br/&gt;particular, on the sphere, for gridded and non-gridded data. The PI uses&lt;br/&gt;hierarchical methods of inference to account for measurement errors and&lt;br/&gt;different sources of information. He develops statistically rigorous&lt;br/&gt;procedures to summarize the information of dynamically evolving random&lt;br/&gt;fields in a reduced number of time series and designs fast Monte Carlo&lt;br/&gt;methods that take advantage of parallel architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies statistical models for spatial and&lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal processes observed at a large number of locations and&lt;br/&gt;time steps. The PI's research addresses the need for increasingly&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated models that can deal with different sources of&lt;br/&gt;information, include expert opinion and handle effectively several&lt;br/&gt;sources of uncertainty. While operating on large datasets, the PI's&lt;br/&gt;models consider time evolving dynamics and spatial heterogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;This allows for the analysis of phenomena on global scales, making good&lt;br/&gt;use of state of the art inferential and computational methods. An&lt;br/&gt;example of a problem where unified inferences from a variety of data&lt;br/&gt;sources is needed is the prediction of future climate from different&lt;br/&gt;climate models. Climate change prediction currently has a large societal&lt;br/&gt;impact. This research provides tools to enhance our quantitative&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the uncertainties involved in such predictions. This&lt;br/&gt;will improve the ability of decision makers to make quality policy&lt;br/&gt;decisions.</AbstractNarration>
