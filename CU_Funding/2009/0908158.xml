    <AbstractNarration>Cummings&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908158&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project centers on developing new analytical models for&lt;br/&gt;nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) in two basic configurations. The&lt;br/&gt;first concerns NLCs "sandwiched" between two solid boundaries,&lt;br/&gt;subject to an applied electric field. This geometry is directly&lt;br/&gt;relevant to a number of liquid crystal display devices. By&lt;br/&gt;investigating the response of the NLC layer to an external&lt;br/&gt;electric field, the investigator and her colleage develop new&lt;br/&gt;models relevant to the design of bistable LCD devices. Advances&lt;br/&gt;here could lead to the development of new, easily-manufactured,&lt;br/&gt;energy-saving technologies. The second configuration considers&lt;br/&gt;free-surface dynamics of NLC films and drops, relevant to&lt;br/&gt;numerous manufacturing processes. Mathematically, the problem is&lt;br/&gt;complicated by the need to model carefully the liquid crystal&lt;br/&gt;behavior in the vicinity of any contact lines. This, in addition&lt;br/&gt;to the known unstable behavior, leads to a very complex problem,&lt;br/&gt;about which little is known theoretically. Systematic asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;reduction of the complex Ericksen-Leslie equations for nematic&lt;br/&gt;media, to the appropriate thin-film geometry, is made. The&lt;br/&gt;formulation includes the effects of finite anchoring strength of&lt;br/&gt;the liquid crystal director field at the boundaries, and the&lt;br/&gt;effects of liquid-solid interaction energy (via a disjoining&lt;br/&gt;pressure). The theoretical investigations are augmented by an&lt;br/&gt;experimental program, comprising simple table-top experiments&lt;br/&gt;carried out by summer students at NJIT, and more sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;investigations carried out by an experimental collaborator, Peter&lt;br/&gt;Palffy-Muhoray, at Kent State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project has two strands: A theoretical investigation&lt;br/&gt;into optimal design of low-energy (so-called "bistable") Liquid&lt;br/&gt;Crystal Display (LCD) devices, for use in applications such as&lt;br/&gt;e-paper; and an investigation into the dynamics of nematic liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystals spreading on surfaces, a process known to be unstable in&lt;br/&gt;certain situations. The development of a theoretical base for a&lt;br/&gt;workable, easily-manufactured, low-energy LCD device would have&lt;br/&gt;undeniable economic and environmental impact if it proved&lt;br/&gt;competitive, in terms of cost or performance, with the small&lt;br/&gt;number of such low-energy LCD microtechnologies presently&lt;br/&gt;available. The investigations into free-surface spreading lead&lt;br/&gt;to a better understanding of coating processes and, particularly&lt;br/&gt;with the inclusion of an electric field, offer potential for new&lt;br/&gt;ways of controlling the evolution of spreading films in&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing processes. This project is carried out in&lt;br/&gt;coordination with educational efforts that include invaluable&lt;br/&gt;research experiences for undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
