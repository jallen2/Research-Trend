    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to investigate representations of p-adic reductive groups (mainly general&lt;br/&gt;linear groups) and Galois groups which are (simultaneously) realized by the cohomology&lt;br/&gt;of deformation spaces of p-divisible groups. The proposed research naturally falls into two&lt;br/&gt;projects, according to the type of cohomology theory that is considered. The rst project&lt;br/&gt;is concerned with the de Rham cohomology of the p-adic symmetric spaces de ned by&lt;br/&gt;Drinfeld. These can be considered as the special bers of formal schemes, and these formal&lt;br/&gt;schemes represent deformation functors for certain p-divisible formal groups (with extra&lt;br/&gt;structures). It was shown by P. Schneider and U. Stuhler that the (compactly supported)&lt;br/&gt;de Rham cohomology groups of these spaces realize generalized Steinberg representations&lt;br/&gt;(of general linear groups). Torsion points on the universal formal group give rise to etale&lt;br/&gt;coverings of the symmetric spaces, and global arguments (relying on the use of Shimura&lt;br/&gt;varieties) show that their cohomology groups realize supercuspidal representations. Be-&lt;br/&gt;cause these spaces are Stein spaces, their cohomology groups can be computed by means&lt;br/&gt;of rigid-analytic di erential forms. Using the relation to di erential forms, the project&lt;br/&gt;aims at constructing lattices in these supercuspidal representations which then give rise&lt;br/&gt;to Banach space representations. Furthermore, the PI seeks to relate these Banach space&lt;br/&gt;representations to certain families of potentially crystalline Galois representations, at least&lt;br/&gt;when the spaces are one-dimensional (in which case the Galois representations are of di-&lt;br/&gt;mension two), and when the covering is 'tame'. The second project is concerned with the&lt;br/&gt;etale l-adic cohomology of deformation spaces of one-dimensional formal groups. These&lt;br/&gt;cohomology groups are known to realize the local Langlands correspondence between n-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional Weil group representations and representations of the p-adic GL(n). Again,&lt;br/&gt;the only known proofs for this fact, due to M. Harris and R. Taylor (respectively P. Boyer&lt;br/&gt;in the equal characteristic case) depend on global arguments. The PI proposes to investi-&lt;br/&gt;gate the equality between epsilon constants of representations which correspond to each&lt;br/&gt;other, in the case when the base eld is of positive characteristic, by using local methods&lt;br/&gt;from rigid-analytic geometry. For the Galois representation a formula due to G. Laumon&lt;br/&gt;describes the epsilon constant in terms of a local Fourier transform, and this Fourier&lt;br/&gt;transform in turn has a rigid-analytic description. Analyzing this description the PI seeks&lt;br/&gt;to relate Laumon's formula to a formula of Bushnell and Frohlich for the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;representation of GL(n).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is about investigating solutions of algebraic equations with special emphasis&lt;br/&gt;on methods involving congruences with respect to a xed prime number p. For instance,&lt;br/&gt;even though a polynomial in general may have no roots which are rational numbers, there&lt;br/&gt;may well be integers which are roots up to multiples of (arbitrary) high powers of p. This&lt;br/&gt;can be considered as an approximate solution with respect to p, and these approximate&lt;br/&gt;solutions give rise to a solution which is no longer an ordinary number, but a so-called p-&lt;br/&gt;adic number. The arithmetic of p-adic numbers is considerably easier than the arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;of rational numbers, yet complex enough to reveal lots of information about algebraic&lt;br/&gt;equations (with rational coefficients). Moreover, it is possible to do analysis with p-adic&lt;br/&gt;numbers. The local Langlands correspondence describes the arithmetic of p-adic numbers&lt;br/&gt;in terms of actions of certain groups of matrices on linear spaces. These linear spaces are&lt;br/&gt;derived from non-linear or 'curved' spaces by 'taking homology', which is a process of&lt;br/&gt;converting geometric information into linear spaces. The curved spaces in turn, which&lt;br/&gt;are like surfaces in spaces of p-adic numbers, are accessible to analytic methods, with&lt;br/&gt;functions depending on p-adic numbers as arguments. The PI proposes to use these&lt;br/&gt;available analytic methods to investigate the curved spaces (and subsequently the linear&lt;br/&gt;spaces they give rise to) with the goal of getting a better understanding of the local&lt;br/&gt;Langlands correspondence and extending it beyond its classical domain.</AbstractNarration>
