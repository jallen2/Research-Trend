    <AbstractNarration>The 17th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP) and associated events, including a workshop on network protocol security, will be held October 13-16, 2009, in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. ICNP has traditionally been a single-track 3-day meeting of around 30 paper presentations. The conference has typically attracted an attendance of about 120-125 international participants. ICNP ranks high in citation impact. The high impact is a consequence of the consistently high-quality research presented at the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant supports graduate students attending institutions in the United States as well as junior faculty belonging to or serving under-represented groups of computer science researchers. The travel grant program has two components: (1) Outreach to a wider graduate student population; and (2) Outreach to minority faculty or faculty serving minority students (e.g., EPSCOR institutions). A total of about ten awards to graduate students and faculty members will be supported. This grant also supports a Ph.D. forum this year. The PhD forum provides an environment for doctoral students to present and discuss their dissertation research with their peers and experienced researchers from academia and industry. The objective of the award is to widen the audience attending ICNP and, as a result, raise the level of interactions between attendees, and the potential for new collaboration, new investigations, and higher quality research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Conference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students and faculty-especially those from under represented groups-to attend a high-quality conference, this project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students and faculty themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from seeing research presented that may be related to what they are working on, or may inspire them to try a new direction. The research community benefits from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and the introduction of new researcher perspectives. All attendees benefit from increased diversity of participants attending the conference, through discussions and other interactions.</AbstractNarration>
