    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses a significant need facing video industry - how to monetize online video. There were over 11.5 billion online videos watched in USA only in July 2008. The online video consumption trend is increasing approximately 10% - to 13% monthly. The current approach to monetize online video is limited and does not scale. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to assess the feasibility of a new and unique approach to monetize online video through an Interactive video based "Contextual" and "Dynamic" Ad insertion technology platform. A new algorithm/methodology/framework will be designed and an alpha prototype of the Interactive video based dynamic Ad insertion technology will be proven feasible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key value proposition of this interactive video based contextual and dynamic Ad insertion technology is a new way to enhance end-user engagement with advanced business intelligence. The video publisher will have a new approach to monetize their online video assets with high scalability. The advertisers will have a unique tool to advertise and communicate about their products and services to target customers. The end users will have highly-engaging access to personalized and relevant information about a product or service. If proven successful, the technology would allow interactivity within the online video thus allowing end users quick call-to-action within the video in a novel way that will represent significant value for multiple stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
