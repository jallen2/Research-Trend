    <AbstractNarration>Probabilistic and decision-theoretic planning, which operates under conditions of uncertainty, has important applications in science and engineering, but such stochastic methods have been under-utilized because these planners do not scale to large, complicated problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast, the past decade has seen tremendous scale-up in deterministic planning techniques, which do not directly address the same challenges of uncertainty head on. This project provides a systematic framework for exploiting this progress in deterministic planning technology - be it classical, temporal or partial satisfaction planning problems - in stochastic planning as well, by novel adaptation of theory and/or methods of determinization, hindsight optimization, and machine learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is helping to bridge the traditional divide between deterministic and stochastic planning communities, and it is bringing stochastic planning technology to real-world applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
