    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the travel of students to participate in the 11th Americas Conference on Wind Engineering in San Juan, Puerto Rico on June 22 to 26, 2009. This is a major conference for the wind engineering community, held every four years. The student participation in this conference will provide them an excellent opportunity to interact with and learn from a large number of established researchers and practitioners working in the area of wind engineering and wind hazard mitigation. This will expose them to research and implementation issues in this field and, thus, enhance their scientific knowledge base to get involved more deeply in the topic to address the engineering problems of current interest. This will also provide excellent training to the next generation of workforce who will eventually be involved in the mitigation of the wind related hazards</AbstractNarration>
