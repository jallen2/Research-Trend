    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: Semiparametric and nonparametric models for correlated data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is aimed at developing statistical theory and&lt;br/&gt;practical methodology for complex high dimensional correlated data&lt;br/&gt;where the full parametric likelihood function of the model is difficult&lt;br/&gt;to specify or intractable, and partial data information is not accurate&lt;br/&gt;or is missing. The PI and her collaborators will develop&lt;br/&gt;efficient and robust estimation procedures by incorporating&lt;br/&gt;correlation structures into the models where high dimensional&lt;br/&gt;nuisance parameters are present, and develop inference functions&lt;br/&gt;for hypothesis testing with low computational intensity.&lt;br/&gt;Part of research goals for the 5-year plan are:&lt;br/&gt;to provide an explicit maximum number of contaminated&lt;br/&gt;clusters allowed to maintain the consistency of the estimator using&lt;br/&gt;quadratic inference functions; to develop unbiased and efficient&lt;br/&gt;estimating functions if missing responses are missing at random,&lt;br/&gt;and inference functions for testing the model assumption;&lt;br/&gt;to develop an efficient esimator using a nonparametric regression&lt;br/&gt;spline with relatively low demand on computation, and introduce a&lt;br/&gt;goodness-of-fit test with a chi-squared property for testing whether&lt;br/&gt;coefficients in nonparametric regression are time-varying or time&lt;br/&gt;invariant; and, to develop semi-nonparametric models for cell cycle&lt;br/&gt;microarray data to incorporate both temporal correlation within genes&lt;br/&gt;and correlation between biologically related genes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have significant impact and many applications in&lt;br/&gt;biomedical research, econometrics, environmental studies, oceanography,&lt;br/&gt;social science and public health where correlated data arise&lt;br/&gt;often. The outlined research projects help to tackle fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions in statistical science and will stimulate interest from a&lt;br/&gt;large group of scientists. It also makes connections between&lt;br/&gt;theory and methods developed in econometrics, statistics and&lt;br/&gt;biostatistics. The proposed research will benefit biomedical research&lt;br/&gt;to help combat life threatening diseases such as AIDS and cancer,&lt;br/&gt;and will make contributions to identifying cell cycle regulated genes&lt;br/&gt;more accurately. It will integrate current states of knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;proposed research areas substantially into educational activities&lt;br/&gt;through development of&lt;br/&gt;new courses on nonparametric methods and microarray data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;It will advance undergraduate and graduate students' learning and&lt;br/&gt;training in semiparametric and nonparametric methods. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;it will broaden opportunities and enable the&lt;br/&gt;participation of all citizens from various disciplines, including&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities and international partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
