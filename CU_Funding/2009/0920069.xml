    <AbstractNarration>The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism that senses and responds to sex pheromones in a gender-specific manner: males are attracted to female pheromones, but females avoid the pheromones. The goal of this project is to understand how molecules and nerve cells generate gender-specific behaviors. This species is very well-suited for studies of behavior since it is the only organism for which we know the complete wiring diagram of the nervous system. In this study the pheromones will be purified and their molecular structure determined. These pheromones bind to receptors on the surface of the olfactory cells and signal to the brain that females are present. In addition, the brain circuit required for male response to the pheromones will be determined. One of the eventual goals of this project is to test models for how brain activity generates behavior. The C. elegans nervous system is simple enough that it should be possible to reprogram behavior and thereby confirm models for nerve cell function and behavior. Part of this project will be carried out by undergraduates, thus the proposed research will train students in genetics and neurobiology, and give them a practical basis for understanding fundamental principles. The results of this proposal will be made available by publication in scientific journals and presented to the public by the PI in community and university presentations.</AbstractNarration>
