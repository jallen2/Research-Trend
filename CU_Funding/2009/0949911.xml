    <AbstractNarration>Computer graphics has been successfully used in a wide range of cultural heritage applications.&lt;br/&gt;It has been proven both in the context of study by subject specialists and in the preparation of exhibits for education of the general public. Each year hundreds more computer graphics based cultural heritage projects are initiated around he world. However, the use of digital material remains demanding and requires technologists as well as subject specialists. This research project will impact the development of exhibitions used to communicate historical and cultural information to the general public. Preparing such exhibits will be easier for subject specialists, and it will be possible to create more engaging interactive displays of information&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to change the methods for both authoring and using digital objects in communication. The research addresses the problem of generating compelling 3D displays of heritage sites, where large archival photographic documentation is available. Recent innovations in sketch-based modeling, in particular the ?Mental Canvas? framework that relies only on 3D strokes rather than full solids, will be exploited along with computer vision techniques. The Mental Canvas framework will allow user annotation in order to facilitate the application of recent improvements in image feature detection and bundle estimation to compute 3D points from archival images. Annotation is required since current methods often fail when all camera characteristics are unknown and photographs were not taken from views designed to facilitate 3D reconstruction. The output of the proposed system will be a 3D model that can be easily navigated by a casual user. The system will then be able to naturally navigate through space and browse solid models, archival imagery and textual data. An exhibit of artifacts and imagery from the Dura Europos site that is being prepared by the Yale Art Gallery is serving as the testbed for the research.</AbstractNarration>
