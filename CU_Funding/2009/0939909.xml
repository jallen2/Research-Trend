    <AbstractNarration>Three workshops are designed for women in cognitive science, especially women in the early stages of their academic career. Research and economic analyses expect the impact of the economic crisis to be more detrimental for females than for males. The workshops focus on strategies for maintaining visibility and productivity, including grant application writing for predoctoral, postdoctoral, and early career scientists, and will take place at the Psychonomic Society, the Cognitive Science Society, and the Association for Psychological Science. The workshops will take the form of a public forum with invited speaker-panelists to initiate discussion about best practices for the professional advancement of women in cognitive science at the individual and institutional level. By partnering with these established societies, the workshops will maximize the outreach potential to a group that continues to be underrepresented in senior academic positions in the cognitive sciences.</AbstractNarration>
