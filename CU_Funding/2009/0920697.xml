    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fusion genes are important markers of evolution and can also aid in identifying protein function and protein interactions. Despite their importance and potential applications in research, few studies focused on identifying and characterizing fusion genes in eukaryotic species. One objective of this project is to perform a survey of sequenced eukaryotic genomes to identify and characterize fusion genes. In order to achieve this goal, two software programs will be developed. Gene Fuser/Defuser will allow users to detect evolutionarily fused genes in eukaryotic genomes and EukGenomeBlast will allow researchers to determine the phylogenetic distribution of fusion genes and metabolic pathways among a phylogenetically diverse set of complete eukaryotic genomes. In addition, Gene Fuser/Defuser can be used to detect faulty gene predictions in genome projects. Several of the genes detected by the program are not truly fused, but are instead the result of faulty gene predictions. Detection of these faulty gene models makes Gene Fuser/Defuser a useful tool for the correction of genome annotation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:&lt;br/&gt;Both programs will be available online and will be easy to use even for non-specialists. EukGenomeBlast, in particular, has applications that will allow researchers with no programming experience to perform more detailed and focused BLAST searches using their genes or group of genes of interest. Another important factor in the design of these programs is their suitability for use in an undergraduate classroom setting. Many colleges do not have the resources to hire full-time bioinformaticians and many bioinformatics tools are complex and difficult to use making it a challenge for a non-specialist to incorporate them into undergraduate courses. This project will create simple modules, with detailed protocols and tutorials, that can be used in undergraduate courses as an introduction to genomic and bioinformatics research. The programs are also ideally suited for undergraduate research as they generate smaller research projects that can be undertaken by undergraduate students. Each fusion gene identified can become its own project, allowing a student or a small group of students to perform a complete analysis of a given fusion gene in a semester.</AbstractNarration>
