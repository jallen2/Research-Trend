    <AbstractNarration>0903936&lt;br/&gt;Kulinowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rice University will host an international workshop on environmental nanotechnology, to contribute towards a sound, science-based document that identifies the tools and practices needed to assess and mitigate the potential impacts of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in the environment and inform eco-responsible design and disposal. This workshop, tentatively scheduled for March 9-10, 2009, will be partially sponsored by the British Consulate General-Houston, the TX-UK Collaborative, and the International Council on Nanotechnology. The workshop will address issues of research &amp; education in a meaningful and focused dialogue through an integrated experience that will provide valuable mentorship and international networking opportunities to emerging leaders in this rapidly growing field. The goal of this workshop is to distill information on environmental impacts of NPs into a format that can&lt;br/&gt;direct research efforts toward the most critical issues in the next five to ten years and lead to methodologies to predict their environmental impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As governments overcome barriers to international collaboration, new funding streams are becoming available to researchers interested in engaging with their counterparts abroad. Therefore the workshop will have an explicit emphasis on stimulating trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific research collaboration and will recruit talented junior faculty to the workshop, both to benefit from their fresh perspectives and to connect them with potential collaborators here in the US and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extrinsic merit of this workshop emanates from its design and participation. This workshop will engage members of the environmental, toxicological, nanotechnology and legal communities in a meaningful and focused dialogue through a unique, integrated, and holistic experience. This experience will foster dialogue among diverse participants around the most pressing questions related to understanding the impacts of engineered NPs. The broader impacts will result from the active engagement of the workshop's participants. This engagement will enhance and strengthen the opportunities for and interest in international, interdisciplinary collaboration on NPs and the environment. In addition, the workshop will provide a solid foundation for the academic communitys future collaboration in research and education programs, projects, and activities at greater and closer levels than was previously possible. The proposed work will have substantial benefit to society by providing current, high quality information on environmental health and safety of nanomaterials which will enable the development and implementation of sound risk management practices.</AbstractNarration>
