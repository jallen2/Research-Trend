    <AbstractNarration>Two cohorts of 10 students each, who are academically talented with demonstrated financial need, are transferring from Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC) into the College of Computing and Informatics at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte (UNCC). The average award to each scholar is $8,700 per year for three years, allowing the scholars to complete a Bachelors in the first two years and then a Masters degree in the third year at UNCC. The establishment of a 2+3 transfer agreement will sustain this program and have an impact well beyond the existence of the S-STEM award. An effective student support program includes formal faculty mentorship, graduate student mentorship, peer community building activities, development of a leadership corps, and a robust employment placement program. The STARS Leadership Corps is impacting not only UNCC students but also high school and middle school students helping establish a pipeline of potential computer science students. A strong assessment team and an effective dissemination plan ensure that notable successes will be broadly shared with similar institutions.</AbstractNarration>
