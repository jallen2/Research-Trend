    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0906085&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Ralf Spatzier&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed lies between dynamical systems and&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Its principal goal is the investigation of the&lt;br/&gt;dynamical and geometric structures of "higher rank" systems in&lt;br/&gt;these areas. These systems also appear naturally in seemingly&lt;br/&gt;quite separate areas such as number theory. The investigator will&lt;br/&gt;study rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and&lt;br/&gt;semi-simple Lie groups and their lattices with the ultimate goal&lt;br/&gt;of classifying such systems under suitable geometric or dynamical&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses. In particular, he will study higher rank hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;abelian actions on tori and Cartan actions of rank 2. These&lt;br/&gt;special cases, important in their own right, will serve as&lt;br/&gt;testing ground for more general conjectures. Also, additional&lt;br/&gt;tools for classification are available in these cases. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator will also study actions by semi-simple groups and&lt;br/&gt;their lattices preserving affine and other geometric structures.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, he will analyze Riemannian manifolds (especially&lt;br/&gt;higher rank ones) and their geodesic flows. Geometric, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;and group theoretic tools will be used in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems and ergodic theory investigate the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;a physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in a&lt;br/&gt;fluid flow). New ideas and concepts such as chaos and fractals&lt;br/&gt;have changed our perception of the world fundamentally. Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;and ergodic theory provide the mathematical tools and analysis&lt;br/&gt;for these investigations. Dynamical systems have had a major&lt;br/&gt;impact on the sciences and engineering. Symbolic dynamics for&lt;br/&gt;instance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe&lt;br/&gt;codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics&lt;br/&gt;are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry&lt;br/&gt;is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally studies&lt;br/&gt;curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their&lt;br/&gt;shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now&lt;br/&gt;studied for its close ties with physics and other sciences and&lt;br/&gt;applied areas (computer vision e.g.) as well as internal&lt;br/&gt;aesthetic reasons. Geometry and dynamics are closely related as&lt;br/&gt;some important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and&lt;br/&gt;geometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems. One main&lt;br/&gt;goal of this project studies when two dynamical systems commute,&lt;br/&gt;i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by&lt;br/&gt;the other. Important examples of such systems arise from&lt;br/&gt;geometry.</AbstractNarration>
