    <AbstractNarration>Since 1994, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) has supported the implementation of the U.S. Global Change Research Program through three major activities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- U.S. Global Change Research Program Integration and Coordination Office (USGCRP ICO); &lt;br/&gt;- USCGRP International Program; &lt;br/&gt;- Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Technical Support Unit (TSU). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCAR will continue operation of the USGCRP ICO, the USGCRP International Program activity and the IPCC TSU. The USGCRP ICO fosters program integration, planning, and coordination. The USGCRP International activity will assist in coordination of global change research activities with other nations (bi- and multi-lateral). The IPCC TSU will prepare comprehensive and up-to-date assessments of policy-related scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant for understanding the scientific basis of climate change, potential impacts, and options for mitigation adaptation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: It is important for the scientific community to document and understand changes in our global environment and to predict its future evolution. This UCAR activity will play a critical role in the global state of awareness and acceptance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This set of activities will culminate in publications as well as decision support and communication tools and activities to inform a wide-range of climate-related discussions and decisions in the community. There is now increasing concern about how global change will affect the lives of the Earth's inhabitants and how the nations of the Earth can make decisions about how to reduce the future magnitude of, minimize the impacts of, and adapt to global change for the future. The reports, assessments, and interactions will help the nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentoring: UCAR provides students just out of high school or college, with the opportunity to work on its projects through short-term positions. These students interact with staff and visiting scientists and work on specific activities, including websites, reports to stakeholders, for periods of a few weeks to three months. Post-docs and early-career scientists are involved in workshops and meetings that provide them with the opportunity to interact one-on-one with senior scientists.</AbstractNarration>
