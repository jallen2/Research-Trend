    <AbstractNarration>In this conference funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, the 2009 Inorganic Chemistry Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) Committee will host a two day GRS whose location and ending will coincide with the start of the Inorganic Chemistry Gordon Research Conference. A total of 45 attendees will participate in a program that includes 15 speakers and discussion leaders chosen to represent a diverse cross section of the scientific community. An introductory session will include a keynote speaker, and there will be two poster sessions for all the attendees to participate as well as a career panel discussion. By bringing graduate students and postdoctoral researchers together in a comfortable setting to discuss and present research, the GRS Committee will aid future academic and industrial scientists in forming peer networks. Additionally, the participants may stay on at the site to attend the corresponding Gordon Conference and thereby boost the participation of young researchers in that conference.</AbstractNarration>
