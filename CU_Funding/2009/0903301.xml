    <AbstractNarration>0903301&lt;br/&gt;Kandlikar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seventh International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels and Minichannels organized under ASME sponsorship, will be held June 22-24, 2009, at the POSTECH - Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea. Over the years, since its inception in 2002, this conference series has attracted many leading researchers from diverse disciplines working in different countries becoming a premiere international forum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The conference is intended to provide a platform for researchers to exchange information and identify research needs in this emerging area that encompasses many engineering and bio-medical disciplines. The main objective is to provide a multi-disciplinary forum to promote and expedite progress on fundamental understanding and applications in many different fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The international nature of the meeting is highly beneficial to everyone for purposes of global interaction. This conference will support a number of students as well as emerging and key leaders who are attending the conference. Emphasis is given to solicit participation from underrepresented groups. Just as last year, the conference will also host a Special Student Forum that will be organized by students. The forum will present students' perspectives on the research needs and opportunities in this emerging field. This will be somewhat of a role reversal; researchers will ask the students questions and the students will answer from their perspectives. This will help develop research leadership skills of the students, as they prepare to lead efforts through research innovation.</AbstractNarration>
