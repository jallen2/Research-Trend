    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of&lt;br/&gt;2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a flexible computational technique that&lt;br/&gt;has proven very useful to many scientific disciplines and is the backbone&lt;br/&gt;of current implementations of Bayesian inference. Recent research&lt;br/&gt;developments suggest that the use of adaptive methods can make Monte Carlo&lt;br/&gt;algorithms considerably more effective. This research proposal has two&lt;br/&gt;major components. The first part will contribute to the development of a&lt;br/&gt;limit theory for adaptive MCMC algorithms. More Specifically, the PI will&lt;br/&gt;develop a resolvent-based martingale approximation technique to investigate&lt;br/&gt;the central limit theorem and the asymptotic variance estimation for&lt;br/&gt;various adaptive MCMC algorithms. The second part of this research activity&lt;br/&gt;will develop a new MCMC algorithm for the Bayesian analysis of statistical&lt;br/&gt;models with intractable normalizing constants, a topic that currently poses&lt;br/&gt;major computational challenges. This part of the research is driven by the&lt;br/&gt;protein design problem in computational biology but the same problem also&lt;br/&gt;frequently occurs in many other statistical models including Markov random&lt;br/&gt;fields, Markov point processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Markov Chain Monte Carlo is a well-established Monte Carlo technique for&lt;br/&gt;sampling probability distributions. The method is used widely to solve&lt;br/&gt;substantive problems in many areas of applications. It is especially useful&lt;br/&gt;in situations with high-dimensional data, which is increasingly common in&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering research as well as applications. Thus, the&lt;br/&gt;research developments from this project can have a significant impact on&lt;br/&gt;methods for doing statistical inference in these areas. Through its&lt;br/&gt;theoretical component, this research project will advance the general&lt;br/&gt;understanding and strengthen the use of adaptive Monte Carlo methods in&lt;br/&gt;practice. In the course of developing the asymptotic theory, the PI will&lt;br/&gt;develop original extensions to some well-established probabilistic tools.&lt;br/&gt;The research is also proposing a new algorithm to tackle one of the most&lt;br/&gt;challenging current problem in Monte Carlo simulation; sampling from the&lt;br/&gt;posterior distribution of statistical models with intractable normalizing&lt;br/&gt;constants.</AbstractNarration>
