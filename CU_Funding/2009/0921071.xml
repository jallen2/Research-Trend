    <AbstractNarration>Edgar P. Spalding&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0921071&lt;br/&gt;Integrated Studies of Auxin, Light, and Seedling Morphogenesis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A critical phase in the life cycle of a plant is the few days during which the embryo within a seed transforms (develops) into a seedling capable of fending for itself. In agricultural settings, much of crop success depends on seedling establishment progressing robustly. The current project continues a line of research aimed at understanding how growth and development in the Arabidopsis thaliana plant is responsive to the environmental conditions pertaining as the seedling emerges through the soil. The cryptochrome photoreceptor protein is known to be responsible for detecting the light environment into which the seedling is emerging, and the plant growth hormone auxin is known to play a role as a key internal regulator of the processes that light triggers through cryptochrome. The project will focus on the molecular mechanisms that link the cryptochrome functions to the auxin functions. What is learned will deepen our understanding of how seedlings become productive plants and increase our understanding of the basic biology underpinning the processes by which humans obtain food, fiber and, increasingly, fuels. Also, because the molecules to be studied in the project all have human counterparts, what is learned could impact cancer and immunology research. For example, the auxin-transporting multidrug resistance molecule to be studied here is the plant equivalent of the MDR1 protein that causes cancer tumors to become resistant to chemotherapy. Plant MDR1 binds to the immunophilin-like molecule TWD1 to perform its function. In humans, immunophilins are the target of transplant rejection drugs. The chance for human-health related discoveries is significant. The computational tools developed to make the measurements of growth and development will be adapted to create dynamic, engaging devices to teach students at all levels about seedling developmental responses to the environment. A postdoctoral scientist and a graduate student will be trained in a unique combination of biological and computational techniques.</AbstractNarration>
