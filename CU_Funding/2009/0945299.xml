    <AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC), sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and the Technical Committee on Computer Architecture, is dedicated to the understanding and characterization of workloads that run on all types of computing systems ranging from PDAs and embedded systems up through massively parallel supercomputers. Though computing workloads evolve and change with advances in micro-architecture, compilers, programming languages, and networking/communication technologies, real improvements in computing technology are often based on a solid understanding and analysis of existing commercial and research workloads. This award provides travel and lodging support for students to attend the conference and benefit from the keynote, panels, and talks, as well as interacting with the other attendees. Better understanding of computer system workloads is a critical component to identifying areas to improve computer systems. Improving student knowledge and awareness in this area could result in both better research and better real systems.</AbstractNarration>
