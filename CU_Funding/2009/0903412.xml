    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will take place at the 2009 Spring National ACS Meeting and will involve presentations by undergraduate researchers in polymer science and engineering. It will cover all forefront areas in the field and provide an opportunity for exchange of latest results. The theme of the ACS Meeting is ?Nanoscience: challenges for the future.? The talks will highlight all areas in this important and very broad field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity for undergraduate students to present their research results at a major scientific conference can be of great value to them in both gaining recognition and expertise, but especially in possibly stimulating them toward careers in science and technology. This symposium, focused entirely on undergraduate research in polymer science, will provide such an opportunity. These talks will also be an inspiration to other undergraduate students and help them develop their laboratory and research interests. Participation from primarily undergraduate institutions and underserved populations will be encouraged.</AbstractNarration>
