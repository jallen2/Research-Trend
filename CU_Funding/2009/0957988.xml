    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will be a gathering of approximately 30 academics and individuals from both the public and private sector. The discussion will focus on data needs to guide effective policies and firm strategies related to sustainability. Without such a workshop, this type of collaboration between academic researchers on corporate sustainability, government officials and corporate leaders would likely not take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The event will likely occur in January, 2010. An assessment of existing corporate sustainability-related data sets will be completed by a researcher and communicated to attendees prior to the workshop. A primary goal of the workshop will be to develop an action plan for collecting the data determined by the attendees to be essential. Subsequent to the event, the researcher will engage with partners to begin the data collection&lt;br/&gt;process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the Data Needs workshop are to:&lt;br/&gt;-Foster collaboration between academics and both and public and private organizations regarding data needs for rigorous academic research on corporate sustainability issues;&lt;br/&gt;-Identify specific data needs and the resources necessary to collect them;&lt;br/&gt;-Reduce redundancy and identify ways to maximize use of data collection resources.</AbstractNarration>
