    <AbstractNarration>Ecosystem responses to global change are strongly regulated by long-term processes such as soil carbon dynamics, species replacement, shifts in community structure, accrual of nitrogen capital in ecosystems, and primary and secondary succession. Scientists have developed a variety of complementary approaches to address these long-term issues. Each approach has its benefits, challenges, and limitations. This workshop will explore the breadth of existing approaches and activities to addressing this challenge. These approaches include space-for-time studies; studies along natural gradients of temperature and precipitation; and simulation modeling often combined with sophisticated data simulation approaches among others. It is critical to develop coordinated approaches to address long-term issues in global change research. Important topics that must be considered include: 1) key research questions; 2) appropriate research approaches including experiments and the required infrastructure; and 3) data analysis techniques especially suited for the study of long-term phenomena. The workshop participants will review extant long-term research efforts on climate change impacts, brainstorm on key long-term issues, examine effectiveness of long-term experiments, and develop coordinated approaches to investigate long-term processes. This workshop is vital to foster the ongoing scientific discussion and development of any future experimental approaches or designs for addressing the long-term processes associated with global change.</AbstractNarration>
