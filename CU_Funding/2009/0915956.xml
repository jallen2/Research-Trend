    <AbstractNarration>To take full advantage of the parallelism offered by a multicore&lt;br/&gt;machine, one must write parallel code. Writing parallel code is&lt;br/&gt;difficult. Even when one writes correct code, there are numerous&lt;br/&gt;performance pitfalls. For example, an unrecognized data hotspot could&lt;br/&gt;mean that all threads effectively serialize their access to the&lt;br/&gt;hotspot, and throughput is dramatically reduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to provide a generic framework for performing&lt;br/&gt;certain kinds of concurrent operations in parallel. Infrastructure is&lt;br/&gt;provided to perform those operations in a scalable way over the&lt;br/&gt;available threads in a multicore machine, automatically responding to&lt;br/&gt;hotspots and other performance hazards. The goal is not to squeeze&lt;br/&gt;the last drop of performance out of a particular platform. Rather,&lt;br/&gt;with the planned system a programmer can, without detailed knowledge&lt;br/&gt;of concurrent and parallel programming, develop code that efficiently&lt;br/&gt;utilizes a multicore machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves the development of algorithms and data structures&lt;br/&gt;designed for the efficient parallel execution of generic code&lt;br/&gt;fragments. The primary focus is on data intensive operations as would&lt;br/&gt;typically be found in an in-memory database engine. Critical research&lt;br/&gt;questions include how to design generic multi-threaded operators that&lt;br/&gt;can be applied to a range of computations, how to avoid cache&lt;br/&gt;thrashing, and how to implement the framework in a way that works on a&lt;br/&gt;variety of hardware platforms. Performance improvements in throughput&lt;br/&gt;of an order of magnitude are expected relative to naive solutions that&lt;br/&gt;suffer from contention. The project aims to achieve performance close&lt;br/&gt;to that of hand-tailored expert-written parallel code, with far less&lt;br/&gt;coding effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has immediate applications in both commercial and&lt;br/&gt;public-domain database systems where performance improvements would&lt;br/&gt;enhance the experience of database system users, and reduce hardware&lt;br/&gt;and energy requirements for a given level of performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programmability improvements would allow programmers without expertise&lt;br/&gt;in parallel programming to effectively use multicore machines. The&lt;br/&gt;project also provides the focus for an advanced-level course on&lt;br/&gt;database system implementation for multicore machines. The software&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure will be made available for research use by others.</AbstractNarration>
