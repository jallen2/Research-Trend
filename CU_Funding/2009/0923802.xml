    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability of an animal to maneuver can determine its success at avoiding predators, catching food, and other fundamental behaviors that define the margin between life and death. Most research on the biomechanics of animal motion has concerned the initiation or maintenance of ballistic, brief, or steady state movements because these can be studied most readily in the laboratory. Maneuverability is therefore one of the most important but least understood aspects of animal locomotion. Previous research has progressed along two independent tracks: 1) Studies of animal morphology have explained how the size and shape of the body and the limbs influence the efficiency and dynamics of maneuvering. 2) Studies of neuromuscular physiology have revealed the mechanisms that animals use to power particular maneuvers. However, animals with the ability to generate substantial muscle power, such as those that hover or fly slowly, may be able to overcome efficiency costs imposed by suboptimal morphology to generate rapid but inefficient maneuvers. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that the limitations imposed by morphology are strongest when muscle power-generating capacity is low. Research will focus on the remarkable maneuvering flight of hummingbirds because these animals inhabit broad elevational ranges, which provide natural experiments for varying muscle power capacity. Experiments with Anna?s hummingbirds (Calypte anna) in California will determine the effects of elevation and the independent influences of mechanical and metabolic constraints on maneuvering performance. Measurements from the diverse Andean hummingbird fauna will allow for determination of how vastly different morphologies influence maneuvering performance across elevations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A common requirement of diverse disciplines of biology is to have a means of quantitatively describing behavior. This project utilizes a custom-designed, automated analysis of movement to identify the fundamental building blocks of maneuverability. Developing this approach will provide tools that are broadly applicable for studying complex movement in animals. The educational training will foster the scientific development of a postdoctoral scholar, graduate students, and undergraduate students from under-represented groups. These participants will receive integrative training in computational biology and comparative biomechanics. The results of the research will be used to develop a teaching module for use in upper division undergraduate courses. In addition, results produced by the students and the PIs will be presented via scientific conferences, scholarly publications, and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>
