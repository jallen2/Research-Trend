    <AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project is a Type III (C: A) partnership between the College of Nanoscale Science &amp; Engineering (CNSE) at University of Albany, State University of New York (UAlbany), an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never been a PFI grantee), and Marist College (Poughkeepsie, NY), an NSF PFI graduated grantee (0438561). This Collaboration for Leveraging Energy and Nanotechnology (CLEAN) focuses on specific efforts that include: 1) fostering of extensive information exchange amongst industry, university, and government stakeholders; 2) expanding knowledge transfer through the Nanotech Innovation in Renewable Energy (NIRE) efforts; and 3) creating a workforce development program based on industry needs. These activities, managed by the Energy and Environmental Technology Application Center (E2TAC) at CNSE, accelerate the integration of nanotechnology in alternative energy technologies among businesses located in the Tech Valley Region of Upstate New York. Drawing on cutting edge research in nanotechnology and the capability of many of the nation's leading advanced energy technology businesses that utilize nanotechnology, the project provides increased organization and coordination that is needed to share and communicate the industry's most pressing needs to academia and to transfer the most appropriate technologies from academia to industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through its outreach and Energy Innovation Camp, the project will present to the public and key stakeholders from legislators to high school students the importance, challenges, and opportunities of developing clean energy technologies. Through its Energy Test Farm, the project will provide an opportunity for workforce training and education by facilitating competency to develop, install, maintain, and service high tech energy related equipment such as solar cells, fuel cells, and energy efficiency devices through established training programs. The ability to provide this expertise to manufacturing and end-user organizations will serve to accelerate deployment of these new technologies. The project leverages significant physical and research infrastructure that is in place at CNSE to grow the regional economy. By 2015, New York's target is to supply 45 percent of its electricity needs through improved energy efficiency and clean renewable energy. Within the rich context of nanotechnology education and outreach at CNSE, this project focuses on applying nanotechnology to "clean energy related applications" and in so doing, it has the potential to make major contributions to New York's "45 by 15" program, one of the most aggressive and ambitious clean energy goals in the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) at UAlbany (lead institution) and Marist College; Private Sector Organizations: New Energy New York (NENY), Arsenal Business and Technology Partnership, Center for Economic Growth; and State and Local Government Organizations: Empire State Development (ESD), New York State Foundation for Science Technology and Innovation (NYSTAR), New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), and Saratoga Technology + Energy Park (STEP).</AbstractNarration>
