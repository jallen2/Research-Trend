    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0906962&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Noel Brady&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term objective of this research agenda is to understand&lt;br/&gt;the large scale geometry of groups and complexes. Specific&lt;br/&gt;objectives include the analysis of higher dimensional filling&lt;br/&gt;invariants of groups, higher filling invariants at infinity&lt;br/&gt;(higher divergence), and investigating the structure of&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic cones of finitely presented groups. Other specific&lt;br/&gt;objectives include the use of combinatorial Morse theory in&lt;br/&gt;understanding virtual fibering in certain classes of groups, and&lt;br/&gt;in developing an approach to the relator gap problem. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator also intends to compare non-positive&lt;br/&gt;curvature methods and topological methods (using stable&lt;br/&gt;commutator length) for proving the existence of surface subgroups&lt;br/&gt;in various classes of hyperbolic groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are used by mathematicians to study symmetry. A group is&lt;br/&gt;just a collection of symmetries of an object. Examples include&lt;br/&gt;the geometric symmetries of a wallpaper pattern, or of a crystal&lt;br/&gt;structure, or of an Escher painting, or the algebraic symmetries&lt;br/&gt;associated to roots of polynomials. Mathematicians have studied&lt;br/&gt;groups intensively as abstract algebraic objects since the 19th&lt;br/&gt;century. In the 1980's M. Gromov proposed that we consider groups&lt;br/&gt;as geometric objects, and began to derive deep connections&lt;br/&gt;between the geometric and the algebraic properties of groups. One&lt;br/&gt;theme which emerged from Gromov's work is that the geometric&lt;br/&gt;properties which have deep algebraic consequences are not local&lt;br/&gt;properties, but rather coarse or "large scale". For example, and&lt;br/&gt;infinite ladder and an infinite straight line are not locally&lt;br/&gt;alike, but are large scale alike, and their symmetry groups will&lt;br/&gt;have many algebraic similarities. The PI investigates large scale&lt;br/&gt;versions of isoperimetric problems (area versus perimeter length&lt;br/&gt;problems) in groups, and also the geometry of coarsely negatively&lt;br/&gt;curved groups. These investigations help deepen our understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the nature of symmetry.</AbstractNarration>
