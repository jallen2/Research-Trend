    <AbstractNarration>Trainees are the future of science. Participation in conferences enhances trainees' scientific knowledge, professional development, and networking. Presenting at international conferences enables trainees' scientific contributions to be recognized and readily incorporated into the scientific community. Support will enable U.S. undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to present at the 5th International Meeting on Steroids and the Nervous System, February 14-18, 2009 (Torino, Italy). This conference is organized to update our knowledge on the relationships between steroid hormones synthesized in different organs and the nervous system, which spans areas from molecular biology to behavior. Topics to be covered at the 5th meeting are diverse and include sex differences in, and hormonal influences on, steroid receptor action in the brain; pain; vitamin D. These and other topics are comprehensively covered in half-day symposia. There is a Young Investigators Symposium, in which six trainees present their research, poster sessions, and roundtable discussions focused on "Androgens and androgen receptors", and "Neurosteroids and pregnancy". The conference committee seeks to maximize interactions between investigators and trainees across many levels of analyses in the study of steroid hormones. Funding from NSF will partially support a professional development workshop, meet the professor lunch, awards to recognize trainees, a young investigator symposium and other educational programs at this venue. Together, the program affords a training atmosphere that is vital to the success of new scholars and enhances their professional development, beyond what can be accomplished at local, regional, or national meetings. This is congruous with NSF's goals through supporting scientifically meritorious endeavors and support of trainees in order to foster their scientific and career development. With the support of NSF, the 5th International Meeting on Steroids and the Nervous System enhances education, recognizes research contributions of U.S. trainees, and includes them in the scientific community by allowing for increased interaction with senior and international investigators.</AbstractNarration>
