    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;de la Llave&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this proposal is to devise methods that &lt;br/&gt;allow to make predictions of the long term (or the long range) &lt;br/&gt;behavior of dynamical systems or PDE. We plan to &lt;br/&gt;develop a broad array of tools (invariant manifolds, &lt;br/&gt;variational methods, numerical analysis) in such a way that they &lt;br/&gt;can work together. We are particularly interested in applications &lt;br/&gt;to instability in dynamical systems and to global behavior in elliptic&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations and in coupled networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the laws of nature are formulated as local interactions. &lt;br/&gt;One point in space and time affects only its close neighborhood. &lt;br/&gt;It can happen that these local interactions cancel each other &lt;br/&gt;out so that the global &lt;br/&gt;effect is small and that the systems remain kind of unaffected or it can &lt;br/&gt;happen that the local interactions reinforce each other and&lt;br/&gt;lead to large scale effects. The two alternatives do &lt;br/&gt;happen and they depend on very subtle effects (e.g. rather&lt;br/&gt;deep and abstract number theory is the key to very measurable effects). &lt;br/&gt;Even if the importance of the &lt;br/&gt;has been recognized by applied mathematicians for centuries, it is &lt;br/&gt;only very recently that a rich enough toolkit has been developed by many &lt;br/&gt;start tackling it. Different people, &lt;br/&gt;have been making different techniques to &lt;br/&gt;work together, and they have started producing results. &lt;br/&gt;As a witness to the interest, the PI of this &lt;br/&gt;proposal has&lt;br/&gt;been co-organizer of special semesters in CRM (Barcelona) Fall 2008 &lt;br/&gt;and Fields institute (Spring 2011).</AbstractNarration>
