    <AbstractNarration>Objective: Detection and quantification of large numbers of proteins and determination of their functions is fundamental to our understanding of cellular physiology. Identification of interactions among large numbers of proteins is also crucial for diagnostics of complex diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's as well as for discovery of novel drugs. Although large-scale study of proteins is significant due to such far-reaching implications, its realization is challenging. The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate new bio-detection systems for complete profiling of proteins ranging from identification of their functions to multiplexed detection and kinetic analysis of proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the investigation of fundamentally new concepts in plasmonics and exploration of plasmonic interactions in coupled and multi-layered metallic nanostructures for the invention of powerful bio-detection platforms. To experimentally demonstrate the introduced concepts, PI will also develop innovative fabrication schemes; integrate nanophotonic detection systems with nanofluidics and bio-patterning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed methodologies can be adapted to detect other biological entities as well as chemicals and gases. Thus, the detection systems explored in this project could find applications not only in biological sciences but also in public health and national security. The proposed educational activities will disseminate the developments in nanotechnology and research results to the public and also increase the society's awareness on exciting new challenges in engineering. To make a broader impact on public education, PI will work with Boston?s Museum of Science. To reach women and underrepresented minorities, PI will continue to contribute to the local educational programs such as Boston Upward Bound Math and Science and Boston University?s Summer Challenge program on engineering. For undergraduate education, PI will add experimental modules to the new courses that she introduced for the recently implemented nanotechnology concentration in Boston University College of Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
