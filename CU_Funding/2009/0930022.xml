    <AbstractNarration>0930022&lt;br/&gt;Van Dam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." This award will provide support for a 400 electrode resistivity data collection system. It will be fitted with 2 control units (one field and one laboratory), electric addressing cards for the electrodes, field installation equipment and service, and control software. The equipment will be immediately used for the research outlined in the proposal. It is expected to have at least a five year "lifespan" in which it will be incorporated into future projects. A procedures document will be formulated for use and care of the instrumentation and disseminated to users and students. The instrumentation will be used to track water and solute movement through saturated and unsaturated soil horizons and zones. The equipment will allow the PIs to make measurements at various temporal and spatial scales (depending on how electrodes are installed). The equipment will allow accurate tracer tracking in groundwater and vadoze zone. Data will enhance studies on root-zone dynamics, biophysical aquifer processes, and the terrestrial water cycle. Studies will be conducted in natural and agricultural settings as well as arid environments (UAE). Data are relevant to land and water use issues facing humankind. Human impact issues are foremost in broader impacts. Water is and will increasingly be a contentious issue for humanity. Practitioners, stakeholders and relevant agencies will benefit from the increased resolution and relevance of collected data and use them for mitigation or best management practices. The instrumentation will be incorporated into student research and training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
