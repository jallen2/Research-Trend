    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop innovative mathematics to&lt;br/&gt;compare, optimize and visualize phylogenetic, or evolutionary,&lt;br/&gt;trees. We will analyze, via a combination of theoretical&lt;br/&gt;advances and computational experimentation, the metric space of&lt;br/&gt;trees. Our efforts will focus on better understanding of and&lt;br/&gt;improving algorithms for calculating biologically relevant tree&lt;br/&gt;metrics. We will focus on the interaction between these metrics&lt;br/&gt;and the canonical, but NP-hard, optimization criteria favored by&lt;br/&gt;biologists. Computationally expensive searches are currently&lt;br/&gt;used to estimate the optimum and can survey only a tiny fraction&lt;br/&gt;of treespace. Deeper understanding of treespace will improve&lt;br/&gt;searches and sampling methods by suggesting better starting&lt;br/&gt;points, identifying clustering of local optima and suggesting&lt;br/&gt;locations of global optima.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phylogenies, or evolutionary histories, play a central role in&lt;br/&gt;modern biology, illustrating the interrelationships between&lt;br/&gt;species, and also aiding the prediction of structural,&lt;br/&gt;physiological, and biochemical properties that can lead to the&lt;br/&gt;discovery of new drugs and vaccines. The reconstruction of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying evolutionary history from a set of morphological&lt;br/&gt;characters or biomolecular sequences is difficult since the&lt;br/&gt;optimality criteria favored by biologists are hard to compute,&lt;br/&gt;and the space of possible answers is huge. Due to this, clever&lt;br/&gt;searching techniques and heuristics are used to estimate the&lt;br/&gt;optimal tree. To improve these important, and computationally&lt;br/&gt;intensive, methods, we propose to step back and rigorously&lt;br/&gt;examine the underlying space of trees, along with different&lt;br/&gt;optimality criteria (often called the ?landscape? of trees), and&lt;br/&gt;provide a detailed understanding of the space of trees to improve&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic tree reconstruction.</AbstractNarration>
