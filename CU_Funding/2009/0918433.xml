    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT PI LUCAS Proposal IOS-0918433. &lt;br/&gt;During the process of evolution, cellular specialization required the development of a matrix of signaling pathways with inherent plasticity to provide organisms with the capacity to respond to a wide range of inputs. The resultant signaling systems can be divided into two categories. The first involves signaling agents whose actions are confined to the individual cells in which the specific signaling process was initiated; i.e., these molecules are cell-autonomous in behavior. The second group involves signals that act beyond their sites of production; i.e., these signaling agents function in a non-cell-autonomous manner and can involve hormones, metabolites, peptides and macromolecules. Such signals can move either via the extracellular pathway, which is common to all organisms, or, in the plant kingdom, they can traffic from cell to cell through highly unique structures, termed plasmodesmata (PD). It is now well established that PD mediate trafficking of proteins, such as transcription factors, and RNA molecules. However, little is known regarding the molecular constituents of PD. In this project, the investigators will use a combination of biochemical, molecular and genetic tools to isolated and characterize a set of PD proteins. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project will add significantly to our understanding of the molecular components involved in the cell-to-cell trafficking of proteins and RNA. Knowledge of this PD pathway will clearly contribute to our understanding of how plants coordinate developmental and physiological events at the cellular, tissue and organ level. The project will also yield additional insights into how viruses spread within plants; this should lead to the engineering of novel defense strategies, thereby leading to enhance food security. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will train underrepresented/minority undergraduate students and high school students. A high school science teacher will also work on the project. Finally, the investigators will disseminate the exciting discoveries resulting from this project by seminars and lectures given to local, national and international groups.</AbstractNarration>
