    <AbstractNarration>Objective: Optical injection locking has been actively researched for its potential to improve ultrahigh frequency performance of semiconductor lasers for both digital and analog applications. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research explores a new injection-locking scheme, based on unidirectional semiconductor ring lasers (USRLs) monolithically integrated with distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser masters, which is expected to result in low-cost ultrafast (over 100 GHz) functional chips that will be easy to use in practice. Both single-USRL as well as cascaded systems will be investigated. Experimental tests will be performed on ultrahigh frequency modulation of injection-locked microring USRLs. Both digital and analog modulation will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Semiconductor ring lasers have not yet been used for modulation bandwidth enhancement by injection-locking technique. The proposed research has the potential of revolutionizing the field of optical telecommunication by providing scientific basis for development of a novel class of ultra-high-speed integrated light sources based on micro-ring USRLs.&lt;br/&gt;The use of USRLs holds promise for development of ultra-high-speed chips suitable for use in optical transmission networks. The results will be important for both fundamental and applied physics of semiconductor lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: First demonstration of modulation bandwidth enhancement in monolithically integrated injection-locked USRLs will open up new opportunities for creation of high performance, small size, low cost, ultra-high-speed integrated light sources for all levels of telecommunication networks. Development of inexpensive ultrafast chips operating at speeds exceeding 100 GHz will have a huge societal impact by increasing the transmission capacity of fiber-based networks.</AbstractNarration>
