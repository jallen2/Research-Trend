    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is commonly understood that to achieve a desired level of security in wireless networks is a bigger challenge than in wired networks. The denial of service (DoS) attack is a prominent threat in wired networks, and is a more potent threat in the wireless domain. This project aims to explore enabling approaches for a novel beamforming framework with cross-layer interactions, referred to as xBeam, as a defense against DoS attacks in wireless networks. This project examines various DoS attacks, develops xBeam algorithms, evaluates the effectiveness of xBeam in deterring DoS attacks, and validates the algorithms using a wireless test bed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This project develops a novel defense approach against DoS attacks in wireless networks, which is based on adaptive beamforming with cross-layer interactions. The approach can deter DoS attacks across different networking layers, multiple DoS attacks mounting from different spatial directions, and attacks mounted by malicious attackers who are mobile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This research contributes to a substantial improvement in wireless network security and contributes to the advance of a networked mobile wireless information society. The project supports research oriented education, by providing opportunities for advanced study of wireless network security through coursework and hands-on experimentation. This research also provides quality research experiences for undergraduate students in the summer, particularly students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
