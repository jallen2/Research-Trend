    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of plant biology has advanced our understanding in areas not only related to agriculture and food quality, but also in the areas of human biology. Recent advances in technologies in the area of biochemistry, cell biology and genetics have enabled plant scientists to address biological questions previously unattainable. This award provides support for the acquisition of a laser capture microdissection (LCM) system and ancillary equipment for advanced histologic analysis of plant materials at Michigan State University. LCM is an advanced method for analyzing single cells in living multicellular organisms. Using this technique, cells from a target microscopic region can be selected, isolated, and analyzed. In short, this yields precise cellular snapshots of cell diversity and the mechanisms controlling processes as varied as development, stress, metabolism, pathogenesis, and senescence. As a world leader in the experimental plant sciences, MSU is extremely well placed to use and disseminate this powerful technology, and the addition of LCM will leverage existing technological strengths at MSU to catalyze breakthroughs in plant biology. In addition, through hands-on training and education, post-graduate, graduate, undergraduate and even high school students will receive specialized training using LCM, as well as downstream genomic and proteomic techniques at MSU.</AbstractNarration>
