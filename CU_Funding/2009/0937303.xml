    <AbstractNarration>With support from a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, Dr. Ryan Williams and Nicola Sharratt will complete an archaeological study on the collapse of the Tiwanaku state, one of the earliest states in the Andes. Following its emergence near the shores of Lake Titicaca, in Bolivia, around AD 600, the Tiwanaku held cultural and political sway over the south central Andes. It established colonies throughout the region. The largest of these colonies was 300km away from the state capital, in the Moquegua Valley, Peru. Around AD 1000, the state began a drawn out process of violent collapse. Inhabitants of Tiwanaku settlements destroyed symbols of state authority, burnt down temples, and fled from state administrative centers. Although considerable research has been undertaken on the emergence and expansion of the Tiwanaku state, and the causes of its violent disintegration, comparatively little work has been devoted to understanding how the collapse affected the way in which communities identified themselves and the individuals within them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using archaeological evidence from burials, this dissertation project addresses that issue. It examines the extent to which post-collapse communities continued to assert an identity that was rooted in their Tiwanaku ancestry. It also explores whether intra-community identities (such as gender, status, occupation and age) were maintained despite the collapse of the state. To do this, the project compares burials in Moquegua from before and after Tiwanaku state collapse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archaeological data from a cemetery dating to the height of state authority is compared with burials excavated by Williams and Sharratt at a cemetery that was used after political disintegration. The arid environment of the Moquegua Valley allows the analysis of wooden and textile grave inclusions that would normally perish. The excavation and analysis of skeletal remains as well as pottery, textiles, jewelry and carved wooden objects suggest that post-collapse communities largely continued to identify themselves as Tiwanaku, despite the absence of an overarching Tiwanaku state authority. However, it appears that other aspects of intra-community identity were increasingly significant after the collapse of the state. In particular, kin-groups within the community used funerary rituals and material goods to assert their particular group identity. NSF funding will support the final, important stages of this project. It will support radiocarbon dating of burials from both sites, enabling the project to determine the temporal framework of this shift in salient identity. It will also support chemical analysis of ceramic material, through which the project will establish whether crafting differences evident in pottery forms and decorative styles are evident also in unseen aspects of craft production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State collapse has been a topic of increased archaeological interest, but most of this research has concentrated on the causes and immediate political ramifications of political disintegration. Anthropological research on social identities has focused on the relationship between identities and the expansion of a colonial power or empire. The intellectual merit of this project is that it considers the opposite situation by drawing on these two important themes (collapse and identity) and asks how identities are affected when an overarching political authority collapses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State collapse continues to occur in the contemporary world, and recent ethnic conflicts suggest that identity and political fragmentation are intertwined in powerful, constructive and often destructive ways. Understanding how communities react to state collapse has relevance far beyond the Tiwanaku state. This project is being undertaken in close collaboration with the local archaeology museum in Moquegua, and Williams and Sharratt are involved in contributing to museum displays and producing informational leaflets for the community on the excavations and project findings.</AbstractNarration>
