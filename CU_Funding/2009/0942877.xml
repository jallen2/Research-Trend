    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0942877 PI: Zauscher, Stefan ORG: Duke University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: International Symposium Support for the Biomaterial Interfaces Division of the AVS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The goal of this project is to help support the program of the Biomaterial Interfaces (BI) Division at the American Vacuum Society?s 56th International Symposium in San Jose, Nov. 09-13, 2009. The AVS is an international society dedicated to all aspects of Surface Science and has 10 Divisions, of which the BI Division is one of the youngest and fastest growing. The BI Division was organized to redress the lack of an interdisciplinary scientific forum that focused on the intersection of biology with artificial surfaces from a fundamental scientific perspective. The BI program at the AVS International Symposium reflects this original mission, and is hence motivated by the rationale that there is an urgent need to increase the understanding of interactions between biomolecules and surfaces, the behavior of complex macromolecular systems at materials interfaces, driven by the rapid growth in biomedical research and the role these interactions play in the fields of biology, biotechnology, diagnostics, dentistry and medicine. The general theme of this year's BID technical conference is centered on progress and innovations in characterization and control of biological interactions with materials, surfaces, and structures, across several scaling regimes from the macroscopic to the nanoscopic. The program design maintains its highly regarded tradition of bringing together world renowned scientists, bioengineers, and clinicians all seeking to understand materials-centered issues in the context of bio-interfacial research and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: An important objective of the symposium is to gather a group of presenters and participants comprising widely acknowledged thought-leaders as well as younger, aggressive, and vibrant investigators already notable for the novelty and quality of their work. Speakers and session chairs will represent both academic and commercial research efforts, comprising diagnostic and imaging experts, bioengineers, and basic surface and materials scientists all working in the broad field of biomaterial interface science. This group will similarly represent the gender diversity characteristic of researchers working in these areas. In support of the effort to provide an international and diverse forum this project provides support for travel and registration for four invited young investigators and three women in the early stages of their careers in the field of Biointerface Science. Furthermore, NSF funding will provide registration support for eight graduate student research poster participants. Another objective for the symposium is to facilitate interactions between junior scientists/faculty with prominent senior and international investigators in the field. One mechanism to engage students and postdoctoral researchers is through the poster competition. Here, a panel of senior investigators will be recruited to engage students/postdocs in discussion, and to judge the scientific merit and originality of their research</AbstractNarration>
