    <AbstractNarration>The proposal is for funding to help defray the expenses of participants, especially minorities, women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, at Southwest Conference on Integrated Mathematical Methods in Medical Imaging that will take place February 6 and 7, 2010, at Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of the conference is to enhance the mathematical understanding of the consequences of modern data collection strategies used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with respect to generating high fidelity images. &lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together researchers from the mathematical sciences and engineering as well as practitioners from the biomedical community. It will engage researchers from all career stages, including undergraduates from ASU and other Southwestern institutions who will be invited to fully participate in the conference. Graduate and undergraduate students from ASU, the University of Arizona and other Southwestern institutions will also be encouraged to give poster presentations and attend talks. The organizers anticipate representation from some of the many Arizona medical research hospitals, Mayo Clinic, BNI, and Banner Health, who are actively engaged in brain imaging research, as well with researchers from the University of Arizona.</AbstractNarration>
