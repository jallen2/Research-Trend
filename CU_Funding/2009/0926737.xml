    <AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary undergraduate research project builds on and strengthens a successful program. It continues the program of extended interdisciplinary undergraduate research experiences. Each year the program engages a minimum of eight talented sophomores, juniors, and seniors in the entire research enterprise. Projects represent a wide array of biological and mathematical sub-disciplines and expose all participants to a broad spectrum of research modes and techniques (i.e., molecular-, cellular-, organismal-, and population/community-level questions within biology; and analytic, modeling, visualization, and statistical questions within mathematics). Undergraduate researchers participate in cross-disciplinary teams of two undergraduates (one biology major and one mathematics major), and each team is mentored by a pair of faculty members consisting of a biologist and mathematical scientist. For an entire year, each student-faculty team pursues an interdisciplinary research question and engage in a series of programmatic activities designed to meet the needs of holistic, multi-disciplinary research problems of the 21st century. The proposed program enhances Truman State's efforts to redesign introductory coursework in biology and mathematics to be more interdisciplinary. Data generated by current and past projects will be used to develop interdisciplinary course modules for these courses. This will lead to significant and deep course redesign that will increase the number of students who graduate ready to work at the intersection of the life and mathematical sciences. The program includes summer workshops for module generation, interim faculty development mini-workshops where faculty are taught how to employ the material in their courses, and plans for sharing modules with the broader mathematical biology education community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program advances discovery and understanding in the biological and mathematical sciences. By creating resources for and promoting the integration of research and teaching in mathematics and biology, it provides an invaluable opportunity for faculty to practice the pedagogy of research and develop their skills mentoring interdisciplinary student inquiry. The faculty will be the core supporters for students pursuing a new and innovative interdisciplinary minor in mathematical biology. Students who participate in the program or learn biology&lt;br/&gt;and mathematics through the interdisciplinary modules will be more able to pursue careers at the interface of the life and mathematical sciences. By making an exciting area of study available to more students, the program has great potential to increase enrollment in mathematics and biology (and perhaps all STEM disciplines). The program diversity has been greater than that of the Truman population, and continued partnering with existing Truman programs will insure that underrepresented groups will participate in the program in the future.</AbstractNarration>
