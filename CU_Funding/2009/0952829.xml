    <AbstractNarration>This award, under the auspices of the NSF program for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grants, uses funds to conduct field work at the site of the Mt. Kilimanjaro glacier to better understand the ablation (loss) of glacial ice. The glacier atop Mt. Kilimanjaro has been cited by climatologists as a bellwether from the Tropics of accelerating global climatic warming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of ice cores were drilled through Kilimanjaro's glaciers in 2000, when aerial photographs were obtained and an automated weather station (AWS) began operating on the Northern Ice Field (NIF). The ice cores indicate that the NIF has persisted throughout the Holocene, and that it contains a record of environmental conditions spanning nearly 12,000 years. In October 2007, as the most positive mass balance year of the decade was ending (i.e., snowiest), air photos were flown again. These revealed that 26 percent of the area covered by ice in 2000 was gone, with a 39% area decrease in the only glacier wholly within the summit crater (Furtwängler). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By October 2009, two years after the second set of air photos, ice loss from horizontal glacier surfaces is expected to equal or exceed that lost through the first ~8 years. The Kilimanjaro glacier has been losing ice nearly continuously since June 2008 due to a prolonged interval with little snowfall and increasingly low albedo (reflectivity) of the ice surface. It is hypothesized by the researcher that ablation will likely accelerate until at least October 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, it is timely to collect samples and make measurements to place the loss of the glacier in the context of natural and anthropogenic change. To test his theory, the researcher will conduct a series of experiments and install monitoring equipment over a period of 6-7 days at the summit of Kilimanjaro in September 2009. This timing precedes the next wet season and is the most effective and safest time for fieldwork. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal meets the requirements of the RAPID program because it identifies an important science question (i.e., anonymously rapid loss of ice) that must be addressed in a timely manner (i.e., during the brief interlude between wet and dry seasons on the mountain).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the data resulting from this project will contribute to a better understanding of both paleoclimate and modern climate variability in Africa and will help decrease uncertainty about the glacier-climate relationship on this well-known mountain.</AbstractNarration>
