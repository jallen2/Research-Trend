    <AbstractNarration>In this project, based on applications in protein structure alignment&lt;br/&gt;and its visualization, we will investigate several fundamental problems&lt;br/&gt;regarding the discrete Frechet distance. These include improving the&lt;br/&gt;computation time for protein structure alignment by taking into account&lt;br/&gt;practical conditions (e.g. the lengths of the segments connecting neighboring&lt;br/&gt;alpha-carbon atoms are almost uniform), and simultaneously simplifying a pair&lt;br/&gt;of chains for realistic visualization, etc. Based on these theoretical&lt;br/&gt;investigations, we also plan to build a prototype software system, available&lt;br/&gt;in the public domain, for these applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protein structure alignment is an important and fundamental technique used to&lt;br/&gt;understand the evolution of proteins and to predict their functionality.&lt;br/&gt;This understanding is crucial for the identification of the cause of certain&lt;br/&gt;diseases and for the development of new drugs. Here we propose a new approach&lt;br/&gt;based on the discrete Frechet distance to improve the quality and speed of&lt;br/&gt;protein structure alignment. Our proposal will consider fundamental questions&lt;br/&gt;with regard to this technique. The resulting software tools will be accessed&lt;br/&gt;by the public for education and research. This project will help support&lt;br/&gt;and train several graduate students at Montana State University.</AbstractNarration>
