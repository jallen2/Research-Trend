    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: CPS:Medium:Collaborative Research: The Foundations of Implicit&lt;br/&gt;and Explicit Communication in Cyberphysical Systems&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 07/30/09&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;foundations for understanding implicit and explicit&lt;br/&gt;communication within cyber-physical systems. The approach is&lt;br/&gt;two-fold: (a) developing new information-theoretic tools to&lt;br/&gt;reveal the essential nature of implicit communication in a&lt;br/&gt;manner analogous to (and compatible with) classical network&lt;br/&gt;information theory; (b) viewing the wireless ecosystem itself&lt;br/&gt;as a cyber-physical system in which spectrum is the physical&lt;br/&gt;substrate that is manipulated by heterogeneous interacting&lt;br/&gt;cyber-systems that must be certified to meet safety and&lt;br/&gt;performance objectives.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project comes from the&lt;br/&gt;transformative technical approaches being developed. The key to&lt;br/&gt;understanding implicit communication is a conceptual&lt;br/&gt;breakthrough in attacking the unsolved 40-year-old Witsenhausen&lt;br/&gt;counterexample by using an approximate-optimality paradigm&lt;br/&gt;combined with new ideas from sphere-packing and cognitive radio&lt;br/&gt;channels. These techniques open up radically new mathematical&lt;br/&gt;avenues to attack distributed-control problems that have long&lt;br/&gt;been considered fundamentally intractable. They guide the&lt;br/&gt;development of nonlinear control strategies that are provably&lt;br/&gt;orders-of-magnitude better than the best linear strategies. The&lt;br/&gt;keys to understanding explicit communication in cyber-physical&lt;br/&gt;systems are new approaches to active learning, detection, and&lt;br/&gt;estimation in distributed environments that combine worst-case&lt;br/&gt;and probabilistic elements.&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the many diverse applications (the Internet, the smart&lt;br/&gt;grid, intelligent transportation, etc.) of heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;cyber-physical systems themselves, this research reaches out to&lt;br/&gt;wireless policy: allowing the principled formulation of&lt;br/&gt;government regulations for next-generation networks. Graduate&lt;br/&gt;students (including female ones) and postdoctoral scholars will&lt;br/&gt;be trained and research results incorporated into both the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate curricula.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0932410 PI Name:Sahai, Anant&lt;br/&gt;Printed from</AbstractNarration>
