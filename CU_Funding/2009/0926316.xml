    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of the proposed research is to employ electrodeposition techniques in the design of a manufacturing route for creation of fully dense metal-nonmetallic selective laser sintered parts. The approach will be to adapt and modify conventional electrochemical deposition/coating techniques to apply to internal deposition on porous preforms to fill in interconnected porosity. A significant part of the research involves establishment of a sound scientific understanding for electrochemical infiltration/deposition of metal within porous selective laser sintered preforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this work will include the development of a truly novel method to effectively achieve infiltration. This will facilitate transition of selective laser sintering from a rapid prototyping method to a rapid/additive manufacturing technique. Porosity removal represents the major scientific barrier to development and maturation of a new manufacturing route for creating low-cost, metal-infiltrated composites with complex geometry at room temperature. One of the major advantages of electrochemical infiltration is the lower processing temperature. Low temperature reduces both energy consumption and associated carbon-footprint and also minimizes undesirable structural changes. The results of the proposed research will also impact domestic competition for a variety of parts in manufacture by providing a vehicle for low-cost production. The proposed process would significantly reduce tooling and manufacturing costs.</AbstractNarration>
