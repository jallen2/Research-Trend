    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0905802&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Michael Kapovich &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is a continuation of Kapovich's research of&lt;br/&gt;previous years in the areas of geometry, topology and geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory. Most subjects of the planned research revolve&lt;br/&gt;around geometry of group actions on various spaces and geometric&lt;br/&gt;structures on manifolds, as well as geometry of buildings. The&lt;br/&gt;research planned by Kapovich covers geometry of buildings with&lt;br/&gt;applications to representation theory, in particular, Kapovich&lt;br/&gt;intends to continue his study of the geometry of the moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces of polygonal linkages in symmetric spaces and buildings in&lt;br/&gt;relation to the algebraic groups. Other topics of research&lt;br/&gt;include discrete groups in algebraic groups (in particular, the&lt;br/&gt;coherence problem for arithmetic lattices), real-projective and&lt;br/&gt;complex-projective structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups appear naturally as symmetries of mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;physical objects, like wall-patterns, minerals, snowflakes and,&lt;br/&gt;ultimately, the entire universe. This project studies relation&lt;br/&gt;between algebraic properties of groups and geometry of spaces for&lt;br/&gt;which groups appear as symmetries. This two-way relation is&lt;br/&gt;beneficial for both group theory (which is a part of algebra) and&lt;br/&gt;geometry. An example of such relation is provided by the theory&lt;br/&gt;of "buildings." Comparing various ways to navigate in buildings&lt;br/&gt;can be mathematically described in terms of certain inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;Such inequalities in turn provide answers to various questions&lt;br/&gt;about symmetry groups of buildings.</AbstractNarration>
