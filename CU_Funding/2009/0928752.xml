    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to develop a universal manufacturing method to fabricate composite functional structures/materials on three dimensional surfaces using laser dynamic forming. This research will enable an innovative and potentially transformative means for three dimensional manufacturing on the micro or even nanoscale with high throughput, low cost and high yield capabilities. The approaches include: a) studying the processing mechanism of three dimensional laser dynamic forming for multilayer laminated structures; (b) developing controlled fabrication of laminated structures on uneven surfaces; (c) fabricating functional laminated composite structures, such as a microelectromechanical system for biomedical applications; (d) characterizing the physical properties of formed multilayer structures, and; (e) investigating the manufacturability of the three dimensional laser dynamic forming process and optimizing the process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will have significant impact on the general area of flexible and stretchable microelectromechanical system devices, such as flexible displays, smart textiles, various clinical and healthcare applications, low-cost and flexible solar cells for portable electronics and communications. The research is interdisciplinary, investigating gaps in research currently performed in manufacturing, mechanics and device engineering. Graduate and undergraduate students will engage in multidisciplinary research opportunities and benefit through classroom instruction. Innovative outreach efforts will be established, which include: a)engaging the general public through exhibiting at the public science centers; b) collaborating with engineering societies, such as Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, to create a general awareness of science and engineering principles and demonstrating how these innovative concepts can benefit our well-being, and; c)emphasizing the education of underrepresented and minority groups.</AbstractNarration>
