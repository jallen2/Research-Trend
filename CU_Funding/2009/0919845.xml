    <AbstractNarration>The consequences of decision-making can change personal fate, influence social interactions and ultimately affect whole societies. Gaining a better understanding of decision-making processes and behavioral choice, and especially the underlying neural mechanisms, is of great interest to ethologists, neuroscientists, psychologists and the general public. One of the most important decisions all organisms have to make is how to respond to a life-threatening event, because failure to respond appropriately could be fatal. This project investigates the behavioral and neural basis of anti-predator behavior in crayfish. Crayfish make discrete and easily quantifiable choices when exposed to simulated predator attacks (they either freeze or quickly swim away), and their decisions are controlled by nerve cells that are large, identifiable and accessible. They therefore provide an excellent model system to study both the behavioral and the neural aspects of decision-making in the laboratory. This project combines behavioral analysis, neurophysiological and neuropharmacological methods, and a novel neuroimaging technique to determine (a) how the crayfish's behavioral response to a potential predator attack is influenced by its developmental stage, motivational state and social history, (b) how neural circuits in the nervous system of crayfish are anatomically and physiologically organized to produce different forms of anti-predator behavior, and (c) how neuromodulators like octopamine (a biogenic substance related to adrenaline) affect the activity patterns of "decision-making neurons" that control behavioral output. The project provides opportunities for students at different stages of their careers (from high school to the postdoctoral level) to learn and apply a variety of established and recently developed scientific techniques.</AbstractNarration>
