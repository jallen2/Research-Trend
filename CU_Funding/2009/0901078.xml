    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide support for attendance of US researchers at the event "Conference on Algebraic Topology, Group Theory, and Representation Theory," which will be held June 9-15 2009. The conference is based on the observation that recent years have seen ever-increasing activity in the area common to the mathematical fields of algebraic topology on one hand, and group and representation theory on the other hand. Topics where these areas have converged include the study of the homotopy theory classifying spaces of compact Lie groups, fusion systems, and local-global themes in group theory. The conference will bring together researchers in these fields of mathematics to share and discuss current developments, in order to stimulate activity and enhance interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New approaches and solutions to existing problems are often developed by such interactions between different but related fields. The "Conference on Algebraic Topology, Group Theory, and Representation Theory" in June 2009 will bring together researchers in these three areas, which have experienced exciting and sometimes unexpected common threads. The organizers expect around 100 participants at the conference, a significant number of whom will be early in their careers. As the interaction between the disciplines represented in the conference is relatively new, it should be very attractive to young researchers, who will be exposed to a variety of approaches by their attendance.</AbstractNarration>
