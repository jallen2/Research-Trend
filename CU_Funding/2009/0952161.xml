    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to conduct the fifth U.S.-Japan workshop on wind engineering as part of the UJNR (U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program on Natural Resources) Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects that will be held for three days at Minneapolis on July 26-28, 2010. This project will mainly support the travel cost of the US participants while encouraging participation of young researchers. This workshop is held every three to four years alternately in the U.S. and in Japan. It is an ongoing effort of the UJNR Panel to bring together U.S. and Japanese researchers from academic institutions, government laboratories and industry to develop collaborative efforts that will benefit both the countries. Specific objectives of this workshop are to (a) assess the recently completed collaborative research efforts such as long-span-bridge flutter, stay-cable vibration, tornado loads on low-rise buildings and storm damage survey, (b) continue mutual exchange of information on ongoing research and practice, and (c) identify new projects for collaborative research. This workshop like those in the past will facilitate exchanging of technical information, meteorological data and structural response data from strong winds, and sharing of unique research facilities in both the countries.</AbstractNarration>
