    <AbstractNarration>0946620&lt;br/&gt;Kim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds for graduate students to attend the Fourteenth International Heat Transfer Conference in Washington D.C. on August 8-13, 2010. Over 1000 participants are expected to attend, and up to 46 students, who are co-authors of conference papers, will be supported. The financial support will be used to establish a reduced student registration fee at the conference, relative to the regular registration fee.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The International Heat Transfer Conference includes a broad range of topics, from biological heat transfer to turbulence. Emerging areas such as novel energy conversion devices, environmental heat transfer, and nanomaterials will also be included. The co-sponsors of the conference include the American Nuclear Society, the American Institute of Chemical Engineering, the Canadian Society of Mechanical Engineering, and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Active participation of a diverse cadre of students from a variety of backgrounds will be enabled. Students eligible for the reduced registration fee will primarily be co-authors of papers or posters presented at the conference. Students from underrepresented groups will be actively recruited to attend the conference. The venue will provide a unique opportunity for students to interact with researchers from the global heat transfer community.</AbstractNarration>
