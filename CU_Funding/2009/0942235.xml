    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99) A model that integrates interdisciplinary experiences relating to sustainability across the science curriculum and throughout all four of a student's college years is being developed and tested. Interdisciplinary learning across the sciences is advanced through laboratory experiences in sustainability for four different audiences: 1) first-year non-science students; 2) science students in introductory courses; 3) science majors in intermediate level courses; and, 4) junior and senior level students majoring in the sciences. The goal for the introductory and non-science students is an initiation to the science and technology of sustainability, drawing connections between multiple disciplines and enhancing quantitative, thermodynamic, and sustainability literacy. At the intermediate level, concepts of sustainability are integrated within existing science laboratories to heighten interest and student awareness of energy issues and to make interdisciplinary connections. Finally, the project encourages synthesis of the science and technology by science majors as they approach graduation with interdisciplinary sustainability projects and service learning projects. Seminars with a sustainability focus enhance the effectiveness of the program by highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the topic, as well as helping to build a cohort of students interested in it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating sustainability across the science curriculum is a means to educate students about this important area while teaching quantitative skills and increasing interest and enthusiasm for science. Studies suggest that students retain more knowledge and develop better logical and analytical skills if they have a more active role in the learning process. It is clear that students have a better attitude toward learning science and learn more when the scientific material is connected to real world issues affecting their lives.</AbstractNarration>
