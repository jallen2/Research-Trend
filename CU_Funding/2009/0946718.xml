    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will provide leading figures in computer science and economics a chance to explore and further develop emerging research opportunities at the interface of the two disciplines. There is strong interest in both communities in pursuing a joint research agenda. The workshop will explore a range of issues where there is opportunity for research interaction. These include models of learning by computational agents in economic settings; research on the role of complex networks in economic systems; the welfare properties and stability of equilibria; the computational tractability of basic economic problems and the design of computationally feasible mechanisms; and the role of information, trust, and reputation in markets. The workshop will be structured to facilitate discussions among people working in different disciplines, who may have different perspectives that can be usefully synthesized in approaching these problems. The workshop will help frame the preparation of a subsequent report articulating significant research directions and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics covered by the workshop have the potential to inform design and policy questions on topics of fundamental societal importance. One fundamental application will be to problems of trust, risk, and contagion in financial markets, offering insights into the interconnectedness and fragility of large financial systems. Other fundamental applications will be to problems in emerging online markets; to systems supporting innovation and knowledge creation, including social, economic, and technological aspects; and to markets in the developing world.</AbstractNarration>
