    <AbstractNarration>Krishtal&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908239&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project is dedicated to creation, development, and&lt;br/&gt;application of a unified theory of matrix-like representations&lt;br/&gt;for frames, fusion frames, and fuzzy fusion frames; and causality&lt;br/&gt;theory and regular factorizations of pseudodifferential&lt;br/&gt;operators. These topics touch upon a large variety of areas of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental and applied analysis, including frame theory,&lt;br/&gt;pseudodifferential operator theory, Banach modules and&lt;br/&gt;representations of locally compact Abelian groups, non-standard&lt;br/&gt;multiresolution analysis, and signal processing. The problems&lt;br/&gt;studied in this project address interesting and important&lt;br/&gt;questions regarding certain mathematical tools on which modern&lt;br/&gt;signal processing is based. The project is also expected to lead&lt;br/&gt;to new questions in more fundamental analysis, thus promoting&lt;br/&gt;cross-fertilization of the fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleagues develop a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;framework aimed to address various problems posed by the deluge&lt;br/&gt;of data in the modern world. Potential applications include&lt;br/&gt;image processing, wireless communications, and others. &lt;br/&gt;Particular attention is given to an application for proton&lt;br/&gt;computed tomography. Broader impact of the proposed activities&lt;br/&gt;includes integration of research and education, dissemination of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge, and enhancement of interdisciplinary collaboration,&lt;br/&gt;both domestic and international.</AbstractNarration>
