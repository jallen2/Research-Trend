    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: OISE-0936670&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Boyd Edwards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: West Virginia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: US-Israel DDEP: Asymptotic Methods at Nano/Microfluidic Interfaces in Electrokinetically Driven Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project (DDEP) project involves collaboration between two research groups working on different technological applications of a common phenomenology. While at the Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Research, which is part of the Ben Gurion University, the student will undertake a focused study of a mathematical analysis of electrokinetic problems related to a study of transport phenomena at the interface between an ion exchange membrane and a two-species bulk electrolyte. This work is to be done by the student with the host research group acting in a mentorship capacity, introducing student to methods, and providing an opportunity for discussions and feedback. The student has corresponded with the lead professor in Israel, Isaak Rubinstein, and will be working with him and his group for one month while abroad. The Rubinstein group has expertise in theoretical approaches to electro-diffusion and electro-convection near ion exchange membranes. In terms of the broader impacts, the opportunities presented by this work are valuable to the improvement of the infrastructure for nanoscale science and engineering research and education at the student?s home institution. Beyond aiding in graduate student training, the activity will provide basic knowledge essential to the development of an integrated microfluidic sample concentrators. Such a device would be beneficial for applications involving complex chemical and biochemical analyses like proteomics, genomics or chemical analyses in remote environments. Environmental applications such as water desalination and biomedical applications like electrodialysis, which depend on electrokinetic transport through nanoporous membranes, may benefit from this work as well.</AbstractNarration>
