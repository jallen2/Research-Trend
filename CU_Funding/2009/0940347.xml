    <AbstractNarration>Considerable advances have been made over the years in understanding wave propagation and energy transport mechanisms within structures. In particular, new methods emerged to estimate vibratory energy absorption by components attached within a complex structure, such as pipes, pumps, and such, within a submarine or building. In recent years, several studies started to appear on methods to design systems such that vibratory energy can be channeled to specific parts of the structure where it can be trapped and dissipated, as desired. It is observed that the underlying fundamentals of some of these approaches are common to nano-materials and physics communities, where applications such as designing materials to trap energy or change the direction of light are considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to hold a workshop to bring together experts from different communities working on wave energy transport in structures to review advances, exchange views, and discuss research needs, directions and opportunities. Of particular interest are advances in wave propagation across scales in complex structures, design of advanced materials, and development of new methodologies for wave propagation in complex structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be hosted by the University of Rome La Sapienza where the co-organizer has an appointment. The workshop will be preceded by advanced preparation including preparation of specific written material, which will be compiled in a book form to be published for dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
