    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate complex dynamic interactions between the musculoskeletal, circulatory and nervous systems involved in common, yet poorly understood, muscle disorders. The approach is to develop novel dynamic ultrasound imaging modes for quantifying anisotropic muscle kinematics, viscoelastic tissue properties and blood flow, and integrate these novel measures with conventional measures of tissue oxygenation, electrical activation, strength, and range of motion to characterize the underlying physiological systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Real-time ultrasound imaging is uniquely suited for dynamic muscle function studies because it is cost-effective, portable and can be integrated with other measurements. However, lack of quantitative dynamic measures and challenges due to anisotropy of muscle have been barriers to widespread use of ultrasound. The proposed research is designed to overcome these barriers. The technical contributions are the theoretical and experimental investigation of novel ultrasound beam configurations, imaging modes and signal and image processing algorithms for quantitative imaging of anisotropic tissue motion and viscoelastic tissue properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research will provide enabling tools for understanding functional limitations in musculoskeletal disorders and measuring treatment efficacy, potentially leading to more effective therapies for this significant public health problem. Research and educational objectives are integrated to engage graduate, undergraduate and high school students as part of a new bioengineering curriculum. Outreach efforts include summer research programs for high school students, a bioengineering demonstration kit encouraging students to pursue careers in science and engineering, and engaging the local K-12 community by presenting state-of-the-art research on muscle disorders affecting school-age children.</AbstractNarration>
