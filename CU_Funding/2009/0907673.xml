    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This program is designed to acquaint more minority students with the field of Materials Science and Engineering by introducing faculty and educators from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU?s) to materials science and engineering. The program to introduce these academics to the materials discipline consists of coupling traditional and non-traditional classes during the mornings with a combination of laboratory experiments and visits to industrial materials plants during the afternoons in a Gordon Conference style program setting. A typical day might begin with a traditional lecture in the morning, followed by a group cooperative learning session with computer involvement to develop computer assisted learning skills. Afternoons will alternate between hands-on laboratory activities and industrial facility visits. For example, within a few minutes by car of the University of Alabama campus are Nucor Steel (metals), Radici Spandex (polymers) and Lafarge Cement (ceramics). Approximately 30 faculty from the nation?s 114 HBCU?s will be invited to participate in the program each year. To further develop a long-term relationship with some of the institutions, a research component was developed. This research component consists of inviting two former participants who participated in one of the previous programs for a 6-10 week summer research opportunity. The HBCU faculty will be teamed with a University of Alabama faculty member to work on a materials-related research project. This program will provide faculty members and educators from HBCU?s with a thorough introduction to the materials science and engineering discipline and the instruments needed to develop materials science based examples and/or experiments to convey the importance of materials and their relationship to the basic principles in mathematics and the physical sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, astronomy, etc.). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Although almost everything we encounter on a daily basis is composed of either glass, ceramics, metals, polymers (plastics), or a composite structure, the well established discipline of Materials Science and Engineering is relatively unknown compared to other engineering disciplines. The field of Materials Science and Engineering remains a hidden opportunity for many of today?s students. This situation exists at many major universities which do not have a focused materials department and even at some institutions where minor materials activities exist within other departments. Only at those institutions where strong materials departments exist are the students cognizant of the field of materials and its career opportunities. At most Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU?s), the discipline of Materials Science and Engineering is practically unknown at the undergraduate level. To address this void, a program was developed at The University of Alabama by Drs. Viola L. Acoff and Mark L. Weaver to introduce science faculty from HBCU?s to the field of Materials Science and Engineering. The 3-week program consists of coupling traditional and non-traditional classes during the mornings with a combination of laboratory experiments and visits to industrial materials plants during the afternoons. To further develop a long-term relationship with some of the institutions, two former participants who participated in one of the previous 3-week programs will be invited back for a 6-10 week summer research opportunity. The HBCU faculty will be teamed with a University of Alabama faculty member to work on a materials-related research project. The attending HBCU faculty will gain knowledge of materials, obtain an appreciation for the materials discipline and leave with the ?tools? to familiarize their students with the discipline of materials. This study has the potential to impact the field of materials science by increasing the diversity of the discipline.</AbstractNarration>
