    <AbstractNarration>In this project the PI will quantify and understand the non-equilibrium behavior of biological membranes and membrane coupled processes in the context of dynamical systems. The objective will be met by employing physically reconstituted systems that are driven out of equilibrium in a controlled manner. This approach will allow the systematic and quantitative study of the bidirectional interrelations between dynamic membrane organization and the function of membrane associated proteins that arise in non-equilibrium situations. The following aims will be undertaken: Aim 1: The driving mechanisms based on simulated ion flux will be characterized and the concentration profile of multivalent ions at charged membranes will be studied. Aim 2 will focus on the aggregation dynamics of multivalent lipid species under ionic forcing. Aim 3: Study the modulation of protein action on multiply charged lipids in spatially heterogeneous membranes and the resulting structural response of membranes. Aim 4: Will address the question how combined systems of membranes and proteins organize in time and space under simultaneous forcing. In addition the following outreach activities will be undertaken: (1) Initiation of a pre-college level outreach program that will use biophysics based tools to improve physical science education in local schools and connect students to people and academic research on campus. It includes class demonstrations and lecture units led by graduate students, development of experiment based class modules involving high school teachers and a lab- internship program for high school students. (2) Development of biophysics and soft condensed matter based laboratory modules for physics classes for non-majors. In addition, the PI will develop a biophysics course for upper-division physics majors and entry levels graduate students. The course will provide a basic foundation for students and enable them to understand physics in its relationship to other scientific fields. It will also equip the students for active interdisciplinary research at the intersection of the physical and life sciences. (3) By engaging in the research aims of this program, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in biophysical methods and techniques and they will advance their knowledge and communication skills beyond the traditional boundaries of scientific disciplines. Detailed documents and assessments related to all of these endeavors will be made available to the broader community</AbstractNarration>
