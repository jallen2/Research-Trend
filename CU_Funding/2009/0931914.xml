    <AbstractNarration>CPS:Small:Collaborative Research: Establishing Integrity in Dynamic Networks of Cyber Physical Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop energy-efficient integrity&lt;br/&gt;establishment techniques for dynamic networks of cyber physical devices. &lt;br/&gt;In such dynamic networks, devices connect opportunistically and perform&lt;br/&gt;general-purpose computations on behalf of other devices. However, some &lt;br/&gt;devices may be malicious in intent and affect the integrity of computation. &lt;br/&gt;The approach is to develop new trust establishment mechanisms for dynamic &lt;br/&gt;networks. Existing trusted computing mechanisms are not directly applicable &lt;br/&gt;to cyber physical devices because they are resource-intensive and require &lt;br/&gt;devices to have special-purpose hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is addressing these problems along three research prongs. &lt;br/&gt;The first is a comprehensive study of the resource bottlenecks in current &lt;br/&gt;trust establishment protocols. Second, the insights from this study are &lt;br/&gt;being used to develop resource-aware attestation protocols for cyber &lt;br/&gt;physical devices that are equipped with trusted hardware. Third, the&lt;br/&gt;project is developing new trust establishment protocols for cyber physical&lt;br/&gt;devices that may lack trusted hardware. A key outcome of the project is &lt;br/&gt;an improved understanding of the tradeoffs needed to balance the concerns &lt;br/&gt;of security and resource-awareness in dynamic networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic networks allow cyber physical devices to form a highly-distributed,&lt;br/&gt;cloud-like infrastructure for computations involving the physical world. The&lt;br/&gt;trust-establishment mechanisms developed in this project encourage devices to&lt;br/&gt;participate in dynamic networks, thereby unleashing the full potential of&lt;br/&gt;dynamic networks. This project includes development of dynamic networking&lt;br/&gt;applications, such as distributed gaming and social networking, in&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate curricula and course projects, thereby fostering the&lt;br/&gt;participation of this key demographic.</AbstractNarration>
