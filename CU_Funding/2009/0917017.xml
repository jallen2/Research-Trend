    <AbstractNarration>Technological advances in positioning, sensor and monitoring&lt;br/&gt;technology drive data acquisition devices to generate massive streams&lt;br/&gt;of data. The goal of this research is to develop a new class of&lt;br/&gt;high-performance stream data management systems capable of coping with&lt;br/&gt;scenarios with infinite data arriving in large volumes, and with&lt;br/&gt;near-real time response requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed query processing paradigm, &lt;br/&gt;termed the multi-route query mesh model (QM), overcomes a&lt;br/&gt;major limitation in current query optimizers, both static and stream&lt;br/&gt;ones alike, namely the assignment of a single `best' query execution&lt;br/&gt;plan for all input data. This approach, being based on the strong&lt;br/&gt;assumption of data uniformity, results in substandard performance for&lt;br/&gt;possibly all data items. Instead, query mesh adopts a processing&lt;br/&gt;structure composed of a data classifier and a multiple route plan&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure. Different learning models can be plugged as&lt;br/&gt;classifier logic into the QM model. Given the complexity of the QM&lt;br/&gt;solution space, cost-based search heuristics are designed to&lt;br/&gt;efficiently find high-quality query meshes. QM is adaptive supporting&lt;br/&gt;the detection and incremental modification of the QM classifier and&lt;br/&gt;its routes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the design, development and&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of a novel multi-route paradigm for stream query&lt;br/&gt;processing, -- a perfect middle ground between the two current&lt;br/&gt;extremes of single-plan versus route-less solutions. Experimental&lt;br/&gt;studies compare query mesh to state-of-the-art solutions. QM impacts&lt;br/&gt;society by facilitating a wide range of stream-centric applications,&lt;br/&gt;including medical out-patient monitoring, emergency management, and&lt;br/&gt;business intelligence processing, and by integrating project&lt;br/&gt;activities with education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on this project can be found at the project&lt;br/&gt;web page: http://dsrgweb.cs.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/</AbstractNarration>
