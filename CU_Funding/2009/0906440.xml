    <AbstractNarration>Temam&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0906440&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award is funded under the American Recovery and&lt;br/&gt;Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleagues study nonlinear problems&lt;br/&gt;from meteorology, oceanography, and fluid mechanics, using the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools offered by analysis, the theory of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, dynamical systems theory, and&lt;br/&gt;computation. Besides improving the understanding of some&lt;br/&gt;important problems, an aim of the project is to help improve the&lt;br/&gt;numerical simulations of phenomena which bear many societal and&lt;br/&gt;industrial applications. The parts of this project related to&lt;br/&gt;meteorology and oceanography focus on the issue of open boundary&lt;br/&gt;conditions for limited domain simulations, and well-posedness&lt;br/&gt;issues for meteorology and oceanography in the absence of&lt;br/&gt;viscosity. Other parts of the project relate to the study of&lt;br/&gt;singular perturbations, that is, calculations in the presence of&lt;br/&gt;small coefficients strongly affecting the equations, and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical issues in turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Numerical simulations for weather forecasts are usually done&lt;br/&gt;in a limited area around the region of interest; such&lt;br/&gt;computations include the usual weather forecasts, or forecasts in&lt;br/&gt;extreme situations, like a hurricane, or the study of&lt;br/&gt;desertification. Similar geographically local questions arise in&lt;br/&gt;oceanography, for example, the study of an estuary. An important&lt;br/&gt;issue for limited areas is the choice of the boundary conditions&lt;br/&gt;on the nonphysical parts of the boundary that are artificially&lt;br/&gt;created for the sake of the computations. This issue becomes&lt;br/&gt;more crucial as better computers allow more refined (more&lt;br/&gt;precise) calculations. Inappropriate boundary conditions may&lt;br/&gt;create incorrect waves (or winds), which may result for instance&lt;br/&gt;in incorrect precipitation forecasts. The investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;colleagues tackle this problem by theoretical and computational&lt;br/&gt;approaches. They work in close collaboration with geoscientists&lt;br/&gt;to ensure the practical relevance of the project. The project&lt;br/&gt;also includes strong cross-training of students and postdocs in&lt;br/&gt;geosciences and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
