    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61). The Virtual Cell development team is expanding its existing collection of high-quality, animation-based educational modules that feature molecular and cellular processes (http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations). These animations are freely accessible from the VCell download site (http://vcell.ndsu.nodak.edu/animations/downloads/), and are widely used by teachers as stand-alone videos or incorporated into personal learning tools. The publicly available NDSU Virtual Cell Channel on YouTube is used by learners at all levels (http://www.youtube.com/user/ndsuvirtualcell) to better understand these cellular and molecular processes. This project is expanding the VCell collection by 1) developing additional animations for widespread (including international) distribution; 2) creating Biology-in-the-Hand applications, pioneering WWW-delivered learning modules for use with portable media players; 3) broadening the utility of the animations by offering the narration in other languages; and 4) utilizing a recently developed National Educational Media research framework to better understand those aspects of animations that aid learning. In accomplishing these goals, the sponsoring institution is collaborating with three partner institutions that have previously developed or used animations for biology education: East Carolina University, the University of Colorado, Denver, and the University of Toronto. These institutions are also serving as tests sites to measure the impact of specific animation designs on student learning. The major product from this project is a suite of high quality animations that can be accessed as stand-alone learning tools or embedded in learning applications that can be downloaded and accessed anytime/anywhere by a diversity of teachers and learners. Development of the animations is being guided by learning research that provides for better understanding of those components of an animation that aid student learning and that allow for effective delivery on mobile devices. The multiple-design concepts being incorporated by the project are making the animations attractive to a larger learner base, and allowing teachers to reconsider how complex processes may be taught.</AbstractNarration>
