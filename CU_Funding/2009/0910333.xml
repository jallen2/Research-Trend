    <AbstractNarration>The efficiency with which plants use water during photosynthesis is a critical physiological trait that determines where plants can survive and how well they grow and reproduce. This research integrates genetic and ecological approaches to understand the evolution of water use and related physiological traits in Ipomopsis aggregata, a wildflower native to the United States. This project will investigate 1) the number of genes that control water use and related physiological traits; 2) patterns of natural selection in environments that differ in water availability; and 3) how the environment has shaped differences among populations in traits that affect water use. Genotype and physiological trait data from large field experiments will be used for genetic mapping of traits and measurements of selection. To assess population genetic variation, genotype and climatic data will be collected from natural populations across the range of I. aggregata.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will elucidate the genetic basis of important physiological traits in plants, and show how differences in these traits may evolve. This work will also provide data on the stresses plants experience in different climates and environments. Therefore, results will be useful for predicting the effects of climate change on plants. Additionally, this project will provide research opportunities for undergraduates including minorities, and stimulate collaborations among institutions and researchers in different fields of biology.</AbstractNarration>
