    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to alleviate issues related to infant lactation, which impact the health of infants and breast-feeding women, as well as the ability of the latter to contribute at high levels of productivity in activities ranging from work to household chores. In the United States, approximately 85% of mothers with healthy newborn infants express milk within the first four months post-birth, and the majority do so using a breast pump. Yet, the CDC reports that compliance with recommended breastfeeding guidelines is less than 20%. Currently 62% of pump users report problems ranging from insufficient milk extraction to infections. By providing an easier and more comfortable means for pumping neonatal human milk, this project will assist reaching recommended CDC guidelines thereby reducing risks of ear infection, diabetes and intestinal and respiratory viruses in lactating infants and risks of infection in breast-feeding women. By providing means for hands-free milk extraction the technology enables women using breast pumps to remain high levels productivity at home and at work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops a compression based breast pump that improves efficiency and effectiveness compared to current technologies. Pumps for extracting neonatal human milk currently on the market only operate based on suction, leading to discomfort and lower levels of production. The exclusive use of suction is one of the biggest pitfalls of these pumps. In contrast, the technology being proposed uses compression patterns focused on specific areas of the breast that have been shown to be effective in scientific research. This is achieved by closely mimicking motions recommended by lactation experts. The current prototype can actuate to produce a rhythmic compression on a woman?s breast as she pumps using a typical breast pump. The technology combines advances in the fields of robotics, mechatronics, controls, software engineering, materials and user-centered design with a focus on usability, comfort and ergonomics.</AbstractNarration>
