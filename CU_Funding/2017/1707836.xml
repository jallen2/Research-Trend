    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is on advanced porous nanostructures made from specialized plastic materials ("block copolymers") using novel non-equilibrium processes. It will promote scientific understanding of the fundamental principles of how to controllably push polymer-based materials systems away from equilibrium towards the successful generation of porous asymmetric membranes or highly ordered ("single-crystal") nanostructures. The project may offer profound impact in a range of technologically important areas. For example, if successful, the project will provide advanced membrane materials for applications in high-resolution biopharmaceutical separations and will allow use of porous polymer molds to structure higher-melting materials like metals or semiconductors into periodically ordered porous single-crystal nanostructures of interest in the microelectronic industry. Besides expected benefits for society in a number of areas of technology development, the project will also support education and diversity by promoting interest of a diverse range of students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to investigate the synthesis and preparation, characterization, and formation mechanisms of porous block copolymer directed nanostructures obtained using non-equilibrium formation processes. Two distinct approaches will be pursued employing ABC triblock terpolymer self-assembly: One submits the terpolymers to non-solvent induced phase separation enabling asymmetric membrane formation, the other to transient laser heating to access temperature processing regimes hitherto unexplored for polymers. The aim of the proposed program is to understand the underlying fundamental chemical, physical and kinetic formation principles enabling generalization of results to other classes of materials. The proposed research includes synthesis of all components, preparation of porous nanostructured materials using the two non-equilibrium formation principles, and characterization of the final assembly structures using various scattering and electron microscopy techniques. Interdisciplinarity will be a central feature of the effort. The program will further involve training and development of human resources, including the participation of underrepresented groups, and industrial outreach.</AbstractNarration>
