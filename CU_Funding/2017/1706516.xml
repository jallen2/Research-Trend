    <AbstractNarration>The International Workshop on Spoken Dialog Systems (IWSDS) is one of the major annual workshops that assembles the Spoken Dialog research community. This year, the workshop will address major issues that are of interest to both the research community and the public at large such as the intelligent agent (Siri, Echo, Home, etc), the ethics in dealing with these agents, intelligent agents and emotions, and how to assess the performance of an agent. Many students attend IWSDS to both present their own findings and to learn from others in the field. They meet colleagues, with whom they can collaborate, exchanging ideas and data. The grant will provide travel funding to enable students from American universities who are working in this area to present their work at this event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2017, the International Workshop on Spoken Dialog Systems (IWSDS) will see presentations on multi-domain systems, the ethics of intelligent agents, intelligent agents and emotion, assessment, and a variety of other topics of interest to the Spoken Dialog research community. The three day event will welcome researchers from around the world for a combination of oral and poster presentations as well as demonstrations of state-of-the-art systems. This grant will enable students from American universities to attend the Workshop to present their work and to learn about the work taking place elsewhere. They will meet colleagues and have the opportunity to discuss their work and to exchange information and perhaps begin collaborations with other attendees.</AbstractNarration>
