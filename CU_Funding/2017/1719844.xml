    <AbstractNarration>This award will support a two-and-one-half day workshop celebrating the 20th anniversary of the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering. In the 20 years that the Partnership has existed, it has funded over 200 Principal Investigators for research on a wide range of topics including high energy density plasmas, low temperature plasmas, astrophysical and space plasmas, plasma based accelerators, etc. The Partnership has funded the research of many students and postdocs, some of whom have gone on to become Principal Investigators of NSF and DOE awards in their own right. All current and former Principal Investigators, as well as several current and former program officers at NSF and DOE who have had significant roles in creating, organizing, and managing the Partnership were invited to attend. The expected attendance is about 100 researchers as well as representatives of NSF, DOE, and other federal government agencies involved in supporting plasma science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop attendees will discuss the scientific achievements supported by the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering over the past 20 years, as well as the future of the field of basic plasma physics and its applications. The workshop will include a session discussing the history of the Partnership, 26 invited scientific talks, a poster session with 28 poster presentations, and two panel discussions. This award is being co-funded by the Division of Physics, the Division of Astronomical Sciences, the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.</AbstractNarration>
