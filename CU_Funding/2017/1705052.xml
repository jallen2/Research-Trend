    <AbstractNarration>CBET - 1705052 - PI: Theis, Thomas L. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is in partial support of the Fifth Symposium on Industrial Ecology for Young Professionals (SIEYP V). SIEYP V is organized by the Student Community Board of the International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE), and focuses on communication and networking among young professionals (graduate students and post-doctoral researchers). The main goal of the symposium is to provide an opportunity for young professionals who perform research in industrial ecology (IE) to present and discuss their novel research ideas and experiences, receive constructive feedback, and network with senior professionals in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of SIEYP V is "Communicating your research to a broader audience." To move the scientific discussion beyond the academic realm, and make a difference in the real world, there is a need to engage a broader public. SIEYP V focuses on developing communication skills, in order to better deliver scientific findings to different group targets: peers, policy makers, industrialists, and the general public. SIEYP V will be held in conjunction with the joint conference of ISIE and the International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISSST) to be held in Chicago in June, 2017. The theme of ISIE/ISSST 2017 is "Science in Support of Sustainable and Resilient Communities" and will bring together engineers, environmental and social scientists, industry representatives, and policy and decision makers from the public and private sectors to discuss how their findings can be used to advance the development of more sustainable and resilient societies. Attending both SIEYP V and ISIE/ISSST 2017 provides an excellent opportunity for young IE professionals to present their ideas to the international community, be updated on the latest scientific findings, and establish a network of researchers for future collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
