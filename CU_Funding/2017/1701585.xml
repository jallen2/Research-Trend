    <AbstractNarration>The 31st Annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics (AFW) will take place March 6-9, 2017 at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, Tennessee. The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics. Continuing a three-decade long tradition, the AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. In addition to the research talks, the AFW will - like in past years - have two professional development panels on topics such as good mathematical writing, early career development, and transitioning from one career stage to the next. Furthermore, for the first time at AFW, there will be a "speed" session in which participants (primarily junior mathematicians) present short talks about current research projects which may still be in preliminary stages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms constitute a major area of study in number theory and related areas. One of the goals of the AFW is to promote new interactions and collaborations between researchers working in different areas concerning automorphic forms. Thus, the workshop will highlight a wide range of developments in areas including the analytic, algebraic, combinatorial, and p-adic theory of automorphic forms and related topics such as L-functions. Automorphic forms have played a key role in many breakthroughs in mathematics, including the proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent),the Monstrous Moonshine Conjecture (for which Borcherds was awarded the Fields Medal), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal). The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include Bianchi, elliptic, Jacobi, Hilbert, and Siegel modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, and additional related areas of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Website:http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/</AbstractNarration>
