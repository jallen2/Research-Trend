    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is the development of a new class of semiconductor laser based on intersublevel transitions in engineered quantum nanostructures. Both self-assembled and nanolithographically defined quantum dots will be investigated for their potential as mid-infrared gain media and for integration into semiconductor laser structures. The intellectual merit of the program lies in the development of a new type of gain media which can be incorporated either mid-infrared lasers for sensing and lab-on-a-chip applications, or into cutting edge mid-infrared metamaterial and plasmonic structures. The investigation of optically efficient nanolithographically defined quantum heterostructures will, in addition, prove to be an enabling technology, not only for mid-infrared frequencies, but in other, technologically important frequency ranges such as the terahertz and telecom frequencies. The broader impacts of the proposed work lie in the societal benefits associated with the potential integration of this new gain medium into medical diagnostic, environmental sensing, and security and defense technologies. Furthermore, the development of optical gain will be mirrored by an educational plan designed to integrate academic gain into the local K12 and university community, with an emphasis on developing core competencies among young undergraduate and high-school science students. In summary, the program will develop a transformative technology to demonstrate intersublevel gain in engineered semiconductor quantum nanostructures, and integrate this new gain media into devices and structures for mid-infrared photonics applications. The technical proposal to develop optical gain is mirrored closely by an educational plan to demonstrate academic gain among local K12 and undergraduate science students.</AbstractNarration>
