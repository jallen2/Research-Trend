    <AbstractNarration>Bacteria provide many useful functions in nature and in industrial sector ranging from degradation of wastes to production of methane to synthesis of pharmaceuticals. Some photo-active bacteria with proper food source and light activation can synthesize high-energy content fuel, such as, hydrogen. In addition, nanoparticles have lot of beneficial uses which range from transparent sunscreens to self-cleaning windows to smarter surfaces. This high risk-high payoff research project integrates nanotechnology, photoactive bacteria, and appropriate light source to convert waste organic acids to highly valuable clean energy. The transformative approach localizes light with enhanced intensity to maximize the production of hydrogen from waste organic acids. This EAGER award, with high impact in energy, environment and global economy involves the integration of photonics, biology, and nanostructured materials for clean fuel production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical aspects of the project involve the combination of photoresponsive bacteria, plasmonic nanoparticles, and selective membranes to produce hydrogen from waste materials. The approach will involve the understanding of hydrogen production from purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNS) illuminated by light sources matched with bacteria's absorption spectrum. More specifically, it is expected that narrowband illumination of R. Palustris in the near-IR will enhance both hydrogen production and light conversion efficiency. The innovative approach employs nanoparticles with localized surface plasmon resonances immobilized on a polymer membrane surface to enhance the intensity and scattering of light. The research will establish that if the bacteria on top of the nanoparticles are immobilized with a thin dielectric layer in between, it will highly enhance the overall process efficiency. There is clearly a need for a "high risk-high reward" approach to dramatically increase light-conversion while maintaining high substrate- conversion efficiency with the goal of combined waste remediation and renewable energy generation.</AbstractNarration>
