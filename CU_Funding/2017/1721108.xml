    <AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by early career researchers at the 19th Rust Belt RNA Meeting to be held at the Sheraton Indianapolis City Centre Hotel in Indianapolis, Indiana on October 13-14, 2017. The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. A number of activities are aimed at professional development and mentoring for early career scientists. There will be ample opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ever-increasing impact of RNA science has been fueled by its immense potential to shed light on a wide array of important problems ranging from the origin of life to the molecular basis of inter-cellular communication. Some of these advances will be among the topics featured in the scientific sessions, which will include: RNA-protein complexes, mRNA maturation, ribosome assembly and translation, and RNA-dependent regulation. In addition, some of the sessions will focus on emerging areas of RNA research such as RNA nanotechnology, and bioinformatics and systems biology of RNA. The results will be disseminated by publication of abstracts on the meeting website.</AbstractNarration>
