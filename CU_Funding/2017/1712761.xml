    <AbstractNarration>This project will host the 2017 AGU-SEG Hydrogeophysics conference that will be coorganized&lt;br/&gt;by the Society for Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The meeting will be held at Stanford University July 24-27, 2017 and will focus on geophysics as a tool in critical zone science. The Critical Zone is the region of Earth from that reaches from the top of the vegetation down through the soil, weathered rock, and fractured bedrock to the base of the water table. Near surface geophysical methods have been used to image shallow root zones, quantify the architecture and depth of the Critical Zone, determine subsurface water content and the depth to the water table, measure groundwater/surface water interactions, and measure gas exchange between soils and the atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the utility of using geophysical methods to address Critical Zone, there are minimal studies in which geophysical measurements are fully integrated within scientific studies of the Critical Zone.&lt;br/&gt;The conference goals are to: (1) Bring together and foster multidisciplinary collaborations between a diverse set of Critical Zone scientists and near surface geophysicists. (2) Identify areas in Critical Zone science where near surface geophysics is under-utilized. (3) Identify future research focus/funding areas for Critical Zone geophysics. (4)Produce a white paper highlighting future research opportunities. The organizing committee for the workshop consists of members from the communities of researchers engaged in near surface geophysics, hydrogeophysics and Critical Zone science and includes a broad range of career stages.</AbstractNarration>
