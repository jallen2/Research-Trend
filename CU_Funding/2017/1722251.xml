    <AbstractNarration>Life operates on a hardware that is composed of cells enclosing molecular components and a software encoded by information and programs written in molecules. With the vision of understanding the natural molecular programs and further establishing novel molecular programming rules for engineering and developing synthetic systems, the annual International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming has been one of the premier interdisciplinary forums where scientists with diverse backgrounds (e.g.; experts in computer science, physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics) come together to present their highest quality research and discuss new ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for 12,000 USD to support student travel expenses for the 23rd of the conference series (DNA23), to be held at The University of Texas at Austin on September 24-28, 2017. The primary purpose of these funds is to provide assistance to students who are delivering oral or poster presentations at the conference. The process of selecting the travel award recipients is intended to give priority to women and underrepresented minorities, in addition to supporting quality research presentations. Approximately 24 successful student applicants from institutions (excluding The University of Texas at Austin) will be funded for travel and accommodation, with an expected average award of 500 USD per student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to encourage and incentivize a new generation of researchers to attend the conference. The travel awards will help to foster the development of the next generation of molecular programmers, by encouraging students to attend, present their work, and interact with other important players in the field. Students who attend the conference will get exposure to early versions of work that are expected to be published in top venues and, furthermore, they will have the opportunity to interact with, and potentially collaborate with, researchers who are producing work of the highest quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of topics includes algorithms and models of computation for biomolecular systems; control of molecular folding and self-assembly to construct nanostructures; demonstration of switches, gates, devices, and circuits; molecular motors and molecular robotics; computational processes in vitro and in vivo; studies of fault-tolerance and error correction; synthetic biology and in vitro evolution; software tools for analysis, simulation, and design; as well as a range of applications in engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine and nanotechnology education. The first day of the conference will be devoted to tutorial on the use of nucleic acid nanotechnology in synthetic biology and talks from speakers on best practices in nanotechnology education. These latter talks and ensuing discussions will allow educators from around the world to share their approaches on how to effectively impart the interdisciplinary field of nanotechnology to students. The presentation sessions during the conference will be an excellent stage for discussing new results of highest quality and exchanging new ideas, which will contribute to advancing knowledge and developing new technologies.</AbstractNarration>
