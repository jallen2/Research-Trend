    <AbstractNarration>This NSF award provides partial support for the octennial Georgia International Topology Conference, to be held at the University of Georgia from May 22 to June 2, 2017. Topology studies the mathematical properties of "spaces," from the physical 3-dimensional space and 4-dimensional space-time in which we carry out our daily lives, to much more abstract spaces such as the space of all possible configurations of a robot or all possible solutions to an equation. This conference will bring together about two hundred topologists from around the world to share state of the art knowledge, hear talks from a select group of internationally renowned experts on the most important research results of the past eight years, and develop new collaborations. This conference has a history of showcasing groundbreaking work and inspiring many generations of topologists, and this year's iteration will continue that tradition. This grant will support travel expenses for graduate students, early career researchers and speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the 2017 conference is to have the most important results obtained during the last few years in geometric topology and related geometry presented to a wide topological audience,including a large number of students and recent PhD's, and to introduce young mathematicians to the techniques underlying these results. The topics will highlight exciting new developments including advances in hyperbolic three-manifolds, mapping class groups, symplectic rigidity and flexibility, contact topology, and invariants of knots, three-manifolds, and four-manifolds. Historically this meeting has generated tremendous interest among graduate students and recent PhD's. Special attention is given to inviting young researchers in topology to speak. The combination of speakers and topics to be presented will offer students and fresh Ph.D.s a great opportunity to listen to and interact with the leaders in the subject as well as with successful mathematicians at the beginning of their careers. To complement the research talks, a series of expository lectures are scheduled that will introduce young mathematicians to the major themes of the conference. Previous proceedings of the Georgia Topology Conference have been among the best of any conference proceedings. Continuing with the tradition, all of the speakers will be invited to submit articles and conference participants will be enlisted to help review submitted articles for the proceedings.The conference website is at: https://research.franklin.uga.edu/topology/content/2017-georgia-international-topology-conference</AbstractNarration>
