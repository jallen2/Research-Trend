    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Southwest Local Algebra Meeting 2017, held at University of New Mexico on March 4-5, 2017. This conference will facilitate interactions between students and faculty with interests in ring theory, broadly interpreted, from institutions in the Southwest. Algebraists in the Southwest region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of pure and applied ring theory. The geographical distances in the region are such that interactions between people at different institutions rarely happen spontaneously. The meeting will bring together students and faculty from a variety of institutions for inspiring talks, with ample time for scientific interaction, providing opportunities for participants to begin new collaborations and catalyzing new research projects. About 80 participants are expected, including students and both junior and senior faculty from throughout the Southwest and South. The participation of students from underrepresented minority groups, women, untenured faculty, and faculty at non-PhD granting institutions is particularly encouraged. Six experts will deliver hour-long talks on topics within their areas of specialty; the lectures will be accessible to graduate students. The meeting will also feature three hour-long poster sessions in which the participating students will present their research. More information can be found at the conference webpage: http://www.math.ttu.edu/~lchriste/slam2017.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of rings, in the broadest sense, is crucial to many branches of mathematics, including commutative and non-commutative geometry, group representations, number theory, coding theory, and cryptography. Our speakers are specialists in characteristics p techniques in commutative algebra and geometry, arithmetic geometry and number theory, numerical algebraic geometry, combinatorial commutative algebra, Lie Theory and Rees Algebras. This wide variety of interests among our speakers should bolster new algebraic interactions between all participants.</AbstractNarration>
