    <AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution's faculty and administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and expanding STEM instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bay Mills Community College (BMCC) serves the Bay Mills Indian Community in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. This project will determine the best use of their current infrastructure in advanced manufacturing technology to create sustainable STEM programs that can further support regional economic development and student learning. The Principal Investigators will deliver a comprehensive roadmap for subsequent implementation of both a certification and associate level degree program offering in STEM related fields through activities that include: 1) identifying community, regional and national workforce needs in strength areas at the college; 2) assessing existing related courses and programs at other institutions; 3) completing a state analysis at BMCC; 4) conducting secondary- and high-school level workshops about STEM careers in order to gauge interest and awareness; and 5) connecting needs to BMCC's courses and programs to identify areas and necessary resources for development.</AbstractNarration>
