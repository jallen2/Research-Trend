    <AbstractNarration>1338780 Wayne State University (WSU); Kim &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wayne State University (WSU) proposes to join the existing Center for e-Design that is currently comprised of Iowa State (lead), Virginia Tech, Brigham Young University, the University of Massachusetts, and the University of Buffalo. The mission of the center is to create new tools, processes, and methodologies that will assist in generating higher quality products at lower costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wayne States team complements the existing university partners' expertise in the four research thrust areas. The proposed sites relevant, fundamental research includes semantic product design and infrastructure, innovation tools for design fusion, virtual simulation, and human-machine interface tools. Furthermore, Wayne State's team has significant expertise in cultural and anthropological research in design, alternative and renewable energy technology design and optimization, and STEM education. Wayne State's participation can help grow the e-Design centers research to better meet both current and emerging industrial and social needs. Wayne State brings expertise from a diverse interdisciplinary team that draws from multiple departments across academic schools within the university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Site research from Wayne State's Center for e-Design will be integrated into its broader graduate and undergraduate educational endeavors to enhance students' development and preparation. Research will be integrated into existing educational curriculum, thereby enriching course content and student learning experiences in: design process and problem solving, decision making in engineering design, advanced design theory and computational issues, IT and knowledge engineering for design, and global product development. Wayne State provides excellent industry-driven internship opportunities to its graduate and undergraduate students. The proposed site plans to maintain a policy of strong diversity within the Center, including continued partnership and recruitment of minority and women graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
