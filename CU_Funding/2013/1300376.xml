    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to explore a novel automated optical method for precisely measuring three-dimensional (3D) structures at micrometer accuracy for shiny objects (e.g., metal parts) and simultaneously process 3D contents in real time for in-situ applications (e.g. sensing, monitoring, and inspection). The objective of the research is to test the hypothesis that better accuracy, higher speed, and more flexibility can be achieved with the binary defocusing technique for 3D optical metrology and for 3D information processing. The approach is 1) to theoretically and experimentally investigate binary defocusing technique for overcoming the limitations of existing 3D optical metrology methods; 2) to explore an automated 3D optical metrology framework for measuring shiny object surfaces, and 3) to further investigate novel methods to process 3D video contents in real time for in-situ applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will result in two major research outcomes: 1) a novel instrumentation for automatically measuring objects difficult to be measured (e.g., shiny objects), and 2) a novel computational framework for 3D video data processing. This proposed technique will transform many fields by providing quantitative measure of physical objects including monitoring, sensing, and control for advanced manufacturing (e.g., additive manufacturing) and in-situ inspection; and will also introduce new paradigms to scientific areas including medicine, computer science, as well as other engineering disciplines. Knowledge gained from this research will also have many benefits to the society. For example, the high-speed 3D sensing techniques will drastically strengthen the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry by providing a novel tool for in-situ inspection and sensing. The 3D camera/sensor manufacturing is a multi-billion dollar industry, and thus commercializing 3D camera/sensor could have great economic benefits to the United States.</AbstractNarration>
