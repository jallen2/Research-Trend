    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Warren Warren of Duke University and his post-doctoral and graduate student researchers are conducting experiments to develop very long-lived nuclear spin states in molecules for use in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results from these experiments are of fundamental interest to the scientific community, but they also open up new possibilities for use in clinical applications of MRI. Postdoctoral and graduate students working on this project will receive training. Prof. Warren also participates in significant scientific outreach to the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Warren and his research group are continuing work to develop long-lived (singlet) spin states for use in magnetic resonance applications. His group has developed pulse sequences to excite very long lived (minutes!) states in biologically interesting molecules. Prof. Warren and his group will continue a multi-pronged effort at: (1) using natural abundance (13C, 15N) species to identify long-lived states; (2) conduct basic theoretical extensions of the density matrix understanding of magnetic resonance; (3) conduct detailed quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics simulations in these systems; (4) synthesize macroscopic quantities of promising candidate compounds for further study; and (5) significantly expand the list of candidate molecular motifs (including strategies which completely avoid labeling). Young researchers working in the group of Prof. Warren will receive training in both experimental and theoretical magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>
