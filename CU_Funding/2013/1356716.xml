    <AbstractNarration>The LEAP (Leadership, Engagement, Academic Mentoring and Preparation) scholarship program aims to increase the graduation rate of students in Computer Science and Engineering at Utah Valley University (UVU) in order to better prepare them for continued education and success in the STEM workforce. The program is designed to meet the needs of talented students with financial need in a comprehensive, open-enrollment university. The student population pool includes high school students who starting their college education, college students who are just declaring majors, first-generation college students, and nontraditional students who may be returning after an absence from education. Twenty-one scholarships per year will be awarded to academically talented but financially needy students, including women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LEAP will be providing leadership training and opportunities for students within a student chapter of IEEE through multidisciplinary projects and peer-to-peer mentoring. The program will provide additional engaged learning opportunities through course projects at the freshman level and a required capstone project. Faculty mentors will receive training in effective student mentoring, and will be assigned to two or three scholarship recipients. Students will gain a sense of community, especially important in a commuter school, through LEAP monthly meetings, peer-to-peer mentoring, and team projects. The program will increase the graduation rates of participating students in Computer Science and Engineering (or the transfer rate of students in the 2-year Pre-Engineering program to accredited 4-year programs). LEAP has potential to increase the enrollment and completion of underrepresented populations, especially women who are greatly underrepresented in UVU's Computer Science and Engineering programs.</AbstractNarration>
