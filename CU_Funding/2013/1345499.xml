    <AbstractNarration>The PreBIG program will provide mathematical sciences faculty with tools and training to help them better prepare students for business, industry, and government (BIG) careers and will provide mathematical sciences students with an opportunity to conduct research on problems related to BIG. To accomplish this, the PIs will produce a set of training videos, conduct summer training workshops for faculty, organize a semester-long course and competition for undergraduate students, organize a summer recognition conference for participating undergraduate students, and secure support from BIG entities. The program includes a strong undergraduate research component since student participation in research has been shown to be effective in improving student success in graduating with a STEM (science, technology, engineering, or mathematics) degree. The undergraduate students will be mentored so that they develop skills that will help them to succeed in a career in STEM, including knowledge of career opportunities, experience in working on problems from BIG organizations, and experience in developing effective writing and oral presentation skills. The MAA's focus on supporting underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences will be reflected in this program as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In business, industry, and government, there is a tremendous demand for STEM graduates. Yet, in the mathematical sciences, many students and faculty are unaware of the numerous career opportunities in these sectors, and faculty may not know how to adequately prepare students for STEM careers outside academia. To help remedy this situation, we propose a program to better prepare students in the mathematical sciences to succeed in careers in business, industry, and government (BIG). This program will:&lt;br/&gt;a) Increase awareness among mathematical sciences faculty and undergraduate majors of non-academic career options and related internship opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;b) Facilitate connections among mathematical sciences faculty and people working in BIG in the same geographic region.&lt;br/&gt;c) Offer undergraduate students research opportunities focused on real-world BIG problems.&lt;br/&gt;d) Provide training for undergraduate students and faculty in successful approaches to BIG problems along with requisite technical and communications skills.&lt;br/&gt;e) Require less and less external funding as time goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
