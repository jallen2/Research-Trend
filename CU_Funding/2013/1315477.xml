    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project creates a commercial linear media handling system (LMHS) that automates the manufacturing of magnets made from new superconductor (SC) materials. SCs offer the promise of tremendous energy savings and innovative devices due to increased energy density compared to existing limitations of conventional conductors. To date the expense of manufacturing and operating SCs have limited them to use in little more than MRIs and particle accelerators. Conventional SCs require extreme environments for operation and remain prohibitively expensive to deploy. Recent advances in SC materials science, cryogenic refrigeration, and controls systems have created the possibility for modern SCs that allow higher magnetic fields at higher temperatures, to deploy in mainstream applications such as MRIs and wind turbine generators. The one remaining challenge is physically shaping these fragile new materials into wound magnets that can replace conventional magnets, for example in motors and generators that power our world. By combining unique controls and mechanical designs not in the market today, this machine improves industrial fabrication methods for magnets that exploit benefits found in fragile materials. The result is a production capability that offers economically attractive output rates while simultaneously delivering technical reliability for dependable devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that LMHS provides the remaining piece of technology that will initiate an industrial revolution. Given the achievement of a production line for reliable SC windings, devices will be shaped by existing manufacturers that take advantage of the efficiency and energy density possible with SCs. The reason for the phrase industrial revolution is the breadth of industries affected. The benefits of SCs will rapidly spread to devices that span scientific, military, industrial, and eventually even individual consumer applications. MRIs could even be made portable using new SCs. Winding precision will create magnetic fields with greater precision and increased controlled magnetic flux densities. This will impact research from medical to material science. Military applications range from more efficient and small profile yet high power motors and generators for defense to civilian applications. It cannot be stressed enough that without the achievement of technical reliability in SC windings, none of these applications will occur. Current winding machine manufacturers rely upon human intervention and mechanical means of control. These cannot deliver the accuracy needed for the precise control of handling fragile media. LMHS is the bold innovation required to bring on an industrial revolution.</AbstractNarration>
