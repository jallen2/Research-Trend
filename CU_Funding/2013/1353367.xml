    <AbstractNarration>Most flowering plants are capable of forming symbiotic associations (called arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis) with soil fungi. These associations develop in the plant root, where, in exchange for carbon, the fungus transfers phosphate from the soil to the root. Currently, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of symbiotic development. This project aims to determine the functions of two novel plant proteins that are essential for development of AM symbiosis. The project also focuses on symbiotic phosphate transport and aims to determine how plant cells sense phosphate delivery by the fungus. The investigators will use genetics, molecular and cell biology techniques to assess the sub-cellular locations and functions of these proteins in plant cells. It is expected that these studies will reveal new information about how plant root cells build symbiotic membranes and also how they sense phosphate. This fundamental knowledge will advance the current understanding of AM symbiosis and aspects of plant cell biology in general. The broader impacts of this work include the potential for future improvements in phosphate acquisition by plants. Phosphate is essential for plant growth and is often limiting for crop production. Phosphate fertilization costs are increasing and fertilizer runoff contaminates aquatic ecosystems, consequently, improvements in the efficiency of phosphate fertilizer use are needed. Fundamental knowledge of AM symbiosis and phosphate sensing by plant cells may provide the basis for new approaches to increase phosphate use efficiency in crop plants. This project will provide training for researchers at various stages of their careers from high school students to postdoctoral researchers. In particular, it will introduce high school students and minority undergraduate students to concepts of plant genetics and plant cell biology.</AbstractNarration>
