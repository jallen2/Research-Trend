    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to continue the Iowa State University's (ISU) participation in the CyberCorps®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to prepare highly-qualified Cybersecurity professionals for entry into the government workforce. Faculty from the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Political Science, Mathematics, and the School of Education lead the interdisciplinary CyberCorps® SFS program, designated by the National Security Agency as a charter Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education. The graduate students work closely with the faculty to receive Cybersecurity training, conduct research, and develop as leaders and team members. All students participate two full years in the unique and critical component of the ISU CyberCorps® SFS program: leadership, teamwork and professionalism development. The NSF's CyberCorps® SFS program funds projects that address cybersecurity education and workforce development. The Scholarship Track provides funding to award scholarships to students in cybersecurity. In return for their scholarships, recipients will work after graduation for a Federal, State, Local, or Tribal Government organization in a position related to cybersecurity for a period equal to the length of the scholarship. The Capacity Track seeks innovative proposals leading to an increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce cybersecurity professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, the project has produced and placed with the federal government close to 60 CyberCorps® SFS students. ISU is known for a wide dissemination of hands-on, lab-oriented courses and educational materials that emphasize problem solving in a variety of contexts; engagement with state agencies and local industry, and multiple opportunities to practice professionalism within service learning projects. Students contribute to Cybersecurity knowledge base by participating in ISU research programs that address important issues including intrusion detection systems, network security, data privacy and security, dependable systems and networks, and security policy and commerce. The program has an outstanding record of supporting students to complete their programs within the required two years. ISU CyberCorps® SFS program allows students to have a broader impact on society before they leave the university. For the culmination of the leadership program, students give back to the community through an extensive service learning project designed to require the direct application of all the skills they have been developing throughout the program: technical, research, interpersonal, team, and leadership. In addition, the project will provide interactions with high schools and community colleges to increase Cybersecurity awareness and the number of students interested in Cybersecurity.</AbstractNarration>
