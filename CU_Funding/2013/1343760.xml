    <AbstractNarration>This is an era when access to information and data is often less of a problem than the ability&lt;br/&gt;to efficiently process and use it. In some cases, these problems are caused by massive, monolithic&lt;br/&gt;datasets that are difficult to store, transfer, and/or analyze. In other cases, the first-order&lt;br/&gt;problem is discovering and then aggregating relevant data that are widely disseminated in&lt;br/&gt;many different locations and formats, such as in the tables, text, and figures of published&lt;br/&gt;papers, government agency reports, spreadsheets, and websites. Geosciences currently lacks&lt;br/&gt;a cyberinfrastructure that can efficiently, cheaply, and with high precision and accuracy&lt;br/&gt;find, extract, and organize many different types of data that are critical to advancing science&lt;br/&gt;and leveraging current and past investments in data acquisition. Instead, there are dozens&lt;br/&gt;of isolated, sometimes redundant, geosciences data mining efforts that use humans as the primary&lt;br/&gt;mechanism for finding data and then keystroking them into structured databases. This mode&lt;br/&gt;of operation is not only costly and slow, but it is also an inefficient use of human resources&lt;br/&gt;and scientific expertise. This project develops a geoscience-oriented trained computing&lt;br/&gt;system that can serve as a cross-disciplinary tool for rapidly finding, extracting, and organizing&lt;br/&gt;geosciences data. Unlike traditional data processing systems, trained systems use statistical, or machine learning, techniques to provide rich answers to complex queries of data that are much less structured. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The longer-term vision is to establish an EarthCube trained computing system that can aid in finding, extracting, and aggregating data, as well as in processing, summarizing, and synthesizing them in a way that helps geoscientists to tackle new problems&lt;br/&gt;and better understand and model Earth systems. This project brings together a unique interdisciplinary team that is committed to building, testing, and operating an EarthCube Building Block that will bring the power of trained computing systems&lt;br/&gt;technologies to the broader geoscience community. Trained computing systems offer an entirely new breed of tools for data processing.</AbstractNarration>
