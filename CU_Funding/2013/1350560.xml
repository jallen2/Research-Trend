    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research aims to develop innovative wearable, self-powered textile biosystems for in situ health monitoring and disease detection. This technology will be integrated directly onto fabrics and garments to provide lightweight, unobtrusive wearable sensing systems that do not compromise wearer mobility, comfort or attention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The current capabilities of wearable senosr technology are limited to measuring physiological parameters (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) and little attention has been directed toward wearable sensors for biomolecular detection. This proposed research will realize new wearable, self-powered textile biosensors offering innovative paradigms in BioMEMS, wearable sensing and point-of-care diagnostics. Textile batteries activated by body fluids for on-demand electricity generation is a fundamentally innovative concept which will provide new scientific insights into the design and operation of novel batteries based on nontraditional materials (i.e. fabric, urine, sweat). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: The proposed project has a broad impact and will potentially transform healthcare and improve human well-being by (1) providing an economical means for continuous health monitoring, (2) supporting preventive medicine through early disease detection, (3) reducing healthcare costs and its burden on world economies, and (4) offering low cost diagnostics suitable for use in resource-limited countries. The PI will develop new educational and outreach activities that will enhance BioMEMS research at MSU, promote STEM disciplines to K-12 students and teachers, and increase participation by women and unrepresented minority students. Activities will include: 1) Developing a new undergraduate/graduate course (ME 491: BioMEMS Sensing and Integration) that will strengthen the existing MEMS curriculum at MSU; 2) Recruiting and mentoring engineering students, particular women and underrepresented minorities, in biomedical research; and 3) Developing new outreach programs for middle/high school teachers and students to promote STEM fields to future generations of K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
