    <AbstractNarration>The GALSAMP is comprised of nine institutions. The program plans to significantly increase the number or underrepresented minorities in STEM receiving baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. An important element of the plan is an early and sustained exposure of undergraduates to research training throughout the undergraduate experience. The alliance expects to significantly contribute to GALSAMP schools of increasing the quantity and quality of minority students in STEM disciplines and to ensuring their entry into graduate programs. The program also seeks to improved recruitment, retention, community college student transfer, and graduation for underrepresented students in STEM. The project has the following goals:&lt;br/&gt;- Increase the number of students recruited into STEM majors by 50% over five-years.&lt;br/&gt;- Increase persistence and progression of STEM students in the expanded alliance to 85% over five-years.&lt;br/&gt;- Increase the number of STEM students transferring from alliance two-year community colleges to four-year baccalaureate alliance institutions from 31% to 50% over five years.&lt;br/&gt;- Increase the number of STEM baccalaureate graduates from the 2012 baseline total by 100% from 380 to 760 over five years.&lt;br/&gt;- Increase the number of STEM Baccalaureate graduates who compete successfully for entry into graduate degree programs from 40% to 80% over five-years.</AbstractNarration>
