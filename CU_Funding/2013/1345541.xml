    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop the technical feasibility of a high throughput label-free electrical field potential marker-based characterization of stem cells. This patent-pending technology of Spatial Domain Stimulus Response (SDSR) records stimulus response from individual cells from an array of spatial electrodes and reconstruct time domain signals. This proposed high throughput characterization of stem cells using SDSR will address the unmet need of derivation of patient-specific reprogrammed somatic cells for use in studying disease development, creating therapies for diseases or disorders and developing perfect models for the cells of the human system that are harmed in the diseases. This will contribute to the goals in regenerative medicine in sorting stem cells in order to avoid the obstacles due to teratoma formation, aberrant reprogramming, and the presence of transgenes. This proposed project will be the basis for the isolation of differentiated cells from the cells that hinder graft performance without exogenous labeling or genetic modification for clinical applications. In this project, the electrical field potential recordings of differentiated cells will be compared and correlated with gene expression markers to assess the characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the development of a powerful, automated, rapid, cost-effective label-free cell sorter, and overcome the barriers that prevent successful translation of stem cell biology into clinical therapy. This cell sorting can produce an unlimited supply of viable cells with improved control, portability, and reduced cost for clinical applications. This may have a significant impact for the improvement of human health and control of human diseases. For example, the system may be a potential tool for the replacement of lost progenies, remyelination and support of adjacent cells at risk in neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's diseases, Huntington's disease, stroke, traumatic lesions such as spinal cord injury, and for studying development and progression of such diseases. The global market for tissue engineering and cell therapy products for these diseases is set to more than quadruple from 2009 to 2018. Specifically, the market for stem cell research products is estimated to be $872M, and expanding through double digit growth each year, representing a significant financial opportunity.</AbstractNarration>
