    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, J. Fraser Stoddart of Northwestern University will develop the chemistry of artificial molecular machines (AMMs) that (1) are capable of moving away from thermal equilibrium under the influence of a stimulus and (2) can perform work. Initial investigations will focus on devising a prototypical supramolecular system that can consume fuel, resulting in the relative unidirectional motion of its constituent parts. Some of the energy output of such a system may be captured by developing a way to trap the components in a high energy state. The approach to this objective involves capturing a ring component around a molecular thread and then using the stimulus to move the ring along the thread. By embedding such a "molecular pump" into a membrane, an artificial transmembrane ion pump potentially could be developed, which would perform a function reminiscent of the cellular membrane transport of nature's molecular machines. The broader impacts involve giving the project participants an opportunity to work on highly interdisciplinary research that enables the pursuit of grand scientific challenges. Undergraduate students will benefit from exposure to the interdisciplinary science under the tutelage of experienced researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to produce molecular scale systems that can perform work on their surroundings, or rather, "artificial molecular machines." Outside of biological systems, which can perform very sophisticated functions, there are presently few examples of such molecular machinery. This project will increase our knowledge about how to design complex molecules that can use chemical energy to perform useful functions. Such research holds the key to devising new types of molecules that can behave like muscle fibers or enzymes, addressable nanomaterials, nanorobots, and possibly more.</AbstractNarration>
