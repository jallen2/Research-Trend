    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this project is to develop an integrated research and educational program on high frequency thermally actuated nano-electromechanical resonant devices and systems. This includes experimental demonstration and characterization of VHF and UHF thermal-piezoresistive resonators and self-sustained oscillators and developing solutions to major technological barriers such as nanoscale batch fabrication, and temperature and process compensation of such devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Micro/nanomechanical resonant devices hold the promise of unprecedented opportunities in sensory and electronic frequency referencing/filtering applications. Almost all the existing research on high frequency electromechanical resonators has been focused on piezoelectric and electrostatic transduction mechanisms. Thermal actuation, despite having several advantages, has generally been considered a slow mechanism only suitable for low-frequency applications. However, recent theoretical analysis and preliminary results have demonstrated not only the viability, but also superiority and uniqueness of thermal actuation for high frequency applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: At the fundamental level this effort could open-up a number of new unexplored research avenues in nanoscience and technology. At the practical level, the developed technologies can provide new opportunities in wireless communications and sensory applications.&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to training of the next generation of M/NEMS experts by involving and educating graduate and undergraduate researchers. Major educational activities that will be integrated along with the research activities include graduate/undergraduate lab module developments, K-12 outreach through nano boot-camps and teacher workshops, and dissemination of results to the technical community and general public. Special efforts will be undertaken to encourage participation of students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
