    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to establish theoretical foundations for aggregated load modeling under various demand response strategies. A hybrid system model with general nonlinear subsystem dynamics will be developed to characterize individual load dynamics. The main research thrust is to obtain a unified abstraction for different types of responsive loads under a variety of demand response scenarios. In addition, the project will also develop a general modeling framework to capture the aggregated dynamics of a large population of heterogeneous hybrid systems. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is among the first that tries to develop a holistic aggregated modeling framework that can deal with various responsive loads and demand response strategies. It can address many important realistic challenges in a unified manner. Such a framework is the key to identify and address fundamental research challenges in aggregated load modeling, and will enable formal analysis and design of demand response strategies. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Demand response is a key technology to enable high penetration of renewable generations of the future power grid. This project will yield fundamental tools for reliable large-scale deployment of demand response programs. In addition, the project will also impact a number of education and outreach activities such as participation of undergraduate and under-represented students in research, inclusion of research results into courses, involvement of high school students. Close partnership with the Metro Early College High School at Columbus, OH will also be established during this project.</AbstractNarration>
