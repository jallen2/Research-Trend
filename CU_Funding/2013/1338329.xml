    <AbstractNarration>Atmospheric CO2 rise is one of the most pressing societal and scientific issues, but future projections of&lt;br/&gt;system behavior often rely heavily on models rather than data. Earth underwent a very relevant analog&lt;br/&gt;experiment 200 million years ago, and this project seeks to learn and abstract from that experiment. The&lt;br/&gt;CO2 release associated with the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary is estimated to have risen at a rate&lt;br/&gt;comparable to the present-day (as a result of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province volcanism, CAMP),&lt;br/&gt;and tellingly, it was associated with a mass extinction. Notably, representatives of the fauna that inhabits&lt;br/&gt;today's seas, the so-called modern fauna were preferentially negatively affected by the T-J event versus other mass extinctions, making the T-J perhaps the most relevant mass extinction with respect to the present-day impact of high CO2 levels on the biosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The T-J event is arguably the least studied of the mass extinctions that frame the Mesozoic, and it&lt;br/&gt;represents an underutilized opportunity to investigate a geologically rapid injection of CO2 into the Earth&lt;br/&gt;system. The results of this CO2 pulse are quantifiable, and will serve to establish new models of system&lt;br/&gt;response to punctuated perturbations. The PIs believe that using novel geochemical tracers for&lt;br/&gt;weathering and redox, coupled with biofacies analysis, will result in a paradigm shift in our knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;such an event. The proxies will inform a novel model that links a solid Earth model, carbon cycle model,&lt;br/&gt;and ecological model. This project will help to elucidate the details of the most significant mass extinction&lt;br/&gt;to affect the modern fauna. Moreover, the new models developed for the T-J event will have relevance for&lt;br/&gt;other mass extinctions, including the ongoing Anthropocene event.</AbstractNarration>
