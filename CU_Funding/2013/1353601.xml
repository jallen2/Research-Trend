    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to fabricate and commercialize Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) that are free from any wavelength limitations imposed by the choice of semiconductor substrate. These revolutionary VCSELs will operate in a single mode with high output power, narrow linewidth and a stable linear polarization for use in spectroscopy and communications. Using 2D photonic crystal structures and substrate-independent reflectors, it is possible to build efficient single mode VCSELs at any wavelength covering the near-infrared and approaching mid infrared (800nm to 2,500nm). High efficiency and high output power are achieved by very low electrical resistance and efficient heat sinking. The first prototype will have the ambitious goal of offering a preferred alternative to DFB lasers in long-haul fiber optic communications and near infrared spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes many societal, educational, scientific and commercial benefits. As a social benefit, the commercialization of this technology will enable faster and simpler air and water contamination measurements, and faster and lower-cost telecommunications. As an educational and scientific benefit, the next generation VCSEL development provides a robust and reliable method for fabricating 2D photonic crystals that are usable for optical signal processing and novel laser designs. Also, the resulting high-efficiency compact lasers with high mode quality can be used for pumping high power solid state lasers; and finally, the high speed versions of these advanced lasers can simplify data communication in fast computer systems used in scientific simulations. As a commercial impact, the additional functionalities of the next generation VCSELs will enable them to break out of their current niche datacom market into broader applications in communications and instrumentation. Their substrate independence will eventually make it possible to process them on silicon and other materials suitable for the final application. This will lead to a significant increase in demand for VCSELs due to the new markets that they will serve.</AbstractNarration>
