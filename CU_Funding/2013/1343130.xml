    <AbstractNarration>1343130 &lt;br/&gt;Singer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports a GEO EarthCube topical workshop with a focus on cyberinfrastructure issues germane to geological dating techniques and their digital publication. The workshop seeks to engage approximately 70 geochronologists and geoscientists with the intent to: 1) develop a set of unifying requirements for the organization of geochronology data; and 2) explore methods for developing and sustaining an interactive community of domain and cyber-scientists to pursue next-generation solutions to the identified challenges. The workshop will include invited talks followed by multiple breakout groups to discuss and produce draft documents focused on: 1) specific scientific challenges and opportunities in Geochronology over the next 5-15 years; 2) identification of the data and cyber-infrastructure obstacles to meeting those challenges; 3) a compilation of known community data and modeling resources; 4) description of data and cyber-capabilities required to meet challenges; and 5) development of ideas for at least two ?proof-of-concept? projects or test cases for scientifically transformative CI activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing is more fundamental to understanding Earth history and processes than geochronology and the expense incurred in producing robust and high resolution dates implores NSF to help find a modern digital solution(s) for maintaining the integrity of these data sets and promoting access as broadly as possible in support of the advancement of the geosciences. This workshop will help to address many of the issues that continue to hamper geochonological data curation, digital publication and community access.</AbstractNarration>
