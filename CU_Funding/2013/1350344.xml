    <AbstractNarration>Users of software are all too familiar with its shortcomings: software&lt;br/&gt;is slow, software is buggy and software is insecure. When a complex&lt;br/&gt;software system fails, it is unhelpfully simplistic to blame the&lt;br/&gt;implementors of the system as incompetent. The truth is that software&lt;br/&gt;engineers are uniquely disadvantaged among the traditional engineering&lt;br/&gt;disciplines because they lack a viable predictive model for the&lt;br/&gt;systems they design and build. That is, a software engineer cannot&lt;br/&gt;predict the behavior of software in practice in the same way that a&lt;br/&gt;civil engineer can predict the behavior of a bridge under load. The&lt;br/&gt;primary intellectual merit of this research is that it lays the&lt;br/&gt;critical, systematic foundations for the science of prediction for&lt;br/&gt;software. The broader impacts are to enable engineers to build better&lt;br/&gt;software with the aid of predictivity. Moreover, this research also&lt;br/&gt;seeks to develop courses and educational material to train the next&lt;br/&gt;generation of software engineers in the art of constructing fast,&lt;br/&gt;safe, reliable and secure software in this fashion. As this research&lt;br/&gt;transfers into practice and engineers adopt this methodology, it will&lt;br/&gt;significantly strengthen the foundation of national&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core technical thrust of this research is the development of a&lt;br/&gt;systematic method for the synthesis of static analyzers for complex,&lt;br/&gt;modern programming languages. It also explores whether or not this&lt;br/&gt;methodology can be automated in whole or in part. To motivate the&lt;br/&gt;development of this method, this research applies the method to the&lt;br/&gt;synthesis of intensional static analyzers for popular scripting&lt;br/&gt;languages such as JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Ruby and Python?many of which&lt;br/&gt;happen to be the languages powering modern, web-based software. The&lt;br/&gt;foundational technical concept of this research is the systematic&lt;br/&gt;transformation of small-step interpreters into static analyzers.&lt;br/&gt;Small-step analyzers promise unique advantages over traditional&lt;br/&gt;techniques, including more opportunities for optimizing speed and&lt;br/&gt;precision, and clearer, easier reasoning about the soundness of the&lt;br/&gt;results of the analysis.</AbstractNarration>
