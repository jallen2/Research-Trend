    <AbstractNarration>Integrated analyses of sedimentary basin evolution, structural timing, and geochronology of bedrock and basin fill will better define the history of erosional exhumation, thrust-fault propagation, tectonic subsidence, and structural partitioning of the Andean fold-thrust belt and proximal foreland basin in west-central Argentina. The project focuses on the delineation of north-south variations among three key regional transects along the transition from the central to southern Andes at 31-35 degrees south. Although available evidence suggests periods of rapid eastward advance of Cenozoic fold-thrust deformation toward the craton, the temporal and spatial relationships are not well resolved. Further unclear is the degree to which the structural and sedimentary processes have been influenced by major north-south contrasts in the geometry of the subducted Nazca slab, the magmatic history of the Andean volcanic arc, and the configuration of inherited pre-Cenozoic structures. This field-based investigation will generate sedimentary, structural, and chronological datasets to compare and contrast the detailed evolution of the distinct frontal tectonic zones in the eastern retro-arc region of the Andes Mountains in order to evaluate the advance of shortening and erosional recycling of foreland basin fill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transition from the central to southern Andes includes the best-understood example of modern flat-slab subduction and a key example of inversion tectonics by reactivation of preexisting rift structures. This active continental margin provides an excellent opportunity to examine the potential controls on rapid advance of crustal shortening and wholesale partitioning of adjacent foreland basins, a process suggested for other convergent orogenic systems. A detailed investigation of basin development and bedrock exhumation in the eastern retro-arc zones will allow us to explore the potential importance of structural inversion and magmatic pulses in the advance of the deformation front, as well as the dynamic upper lithospheric response and surface expression, or lack thereof, resulting from flat-slab subduction. This will further understanding of Andean tectonics and provide valuable insights that can be extrapolated to regions of current and past flat-slab subduction in other convergent systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support field and laboratory investigations by a faculty member, a postdoctoral scholar, and graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at Austin. These efforts will be integrated with those of regional experts from academic institutions and the hydrocarbon industry in Argentina. This project will promote new international academic-industry collaborations and establish the framework for academic exchange visits, in order to providing reciprocal international learning experiences and facilitating longer term research collaborations. The project will also support public outreach and education through existing programs in the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT-Austin, including the GEOFORCE program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds to support the international activities associated with this project are being provided by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
