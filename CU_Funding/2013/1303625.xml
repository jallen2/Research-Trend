    <AbstractNarration>SES-1303625&lt;br/&gt;John Levi Martin&lt;br/&gt;Jan Doering&lt;br/&gt;University of Chicago &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Safety is a desirable public good that gives residents of different backgrounds an incentive to collaborate. Yet, issues of crime and safety can also be divisive, as residents of color (particularly African Americans) may feel exposed to an unjust share of the community's scrutiny and suspicion. This study investigates the causes, processes, and consequences of conflict and collaboration in grassroots public safety organizations in two interracial Chicago neighborhoods. Since public safety work may rally diverse residents around a common cause, as well as alienate them from one another, the case of public safety organizations allows for an investigation of community in the context of local safety initiatives, from peace circles to neighborhood watch patrols. Through a comparative design, this study isolates the causes, processes, and outcomes of conflict and collaboration across a range of grassroots public safety organizations. Three complementary strategies of data collection are employed: participant observation, in-depth interviewing, and the gathering of secondary data, such as organizational minutes and Census data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study contributes to the public discourse on perceptions of crime, race relations, and everyday life in diverse urban environments. Results will be shared with the wider public. In particular, strategies will be proposed for maximizing the inclusivity of public safety work while minimizing its divisiveness. These recommendations will be presented to civic leaders, community organizers, and policy makers.</AbstractNarration>
