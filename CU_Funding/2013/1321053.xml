    <AbstractNarration>The ability to learn is essential to the survival and robustness of biological systems. There is also growing evidence that learning is essential to build robust artificial intelligent systems and solve complex problems in many application domains. However, solutions to complex problems ranging from recognizing faces to understanding speech, cannot be implemented in a single step. Instead they require multiple processing stages, for instance to extract increasingly more abstract and refined features from an input image. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus computers and brains are both faced with the problem of deep learning --- how to simultaneously optimize the parameters of a hierarchy of processing stages in order to solve complex tasks and display intelligent behavior. In the past few years there has been remarkable progress in computer science to address the deep learning problem, and deep learning methods now claim state-of-the-art performance in several application areas. The next generation of machine learning methods holds the promise to not only approach human performance in tasks previously impossible for computers, but also to exceed it. However, our theoretical understanding of deep learning remains limited and there are several important areas where deep learning has not yet been applied systematically. This project addresses these challenges and opportunities by furthering formal understanding of the theory and algorithms behind deep learning, and by applying deep learning methods to new problems in the life sciences. Because deep learning can be used in almost any domain, the results have the potential for broadly impacting science, engineering, and technology across multiple areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has educational and outreach components, ranging from courses to virtual 3D world interactions, for undergraduate and graduate students at UCI, as well as talented students from local high schools, and underrepresented minority students from local colleges. Scientific results, data, and software resulting from the project will be disseminated in scientific journals and over the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three main thrusts: theory, algorithms, and applications. From a theoretical standpoint, the project develops better mathematical understanding of deep architectures, including stacks of autoencoder networks, and their properties. These theoretical results will inform the design of deep-learning architectures. From an algorithmic standpoint, the project investigates, formally and through simulations, several deep learning algorithms, including the dropout algorithm and the PI's deep targets algorithm. From an application standpoint, the project uses the new theoretical and algorithmic knowledge in application to the life sciences, for instance for protein structure prediction, and in predicting chemical reactions. Advancing the state-of-the-art for any one of these thrusts will have a significant impact in computer science, artificial intelligence, statistical machine learning, and the corresponding application field.</AbstractNarration>
