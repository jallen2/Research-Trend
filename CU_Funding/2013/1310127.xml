    <AbstractNarration>The investigator will develop adaptive designs for the analysis of multiple sequential data streams, about which it is desired to test a set of statistical hypotheses. The designs will require minimal knowledge (none in some cases) of the dependence between these data streams -- since such dependence is often strong but difficult or impossible to model in practice -- and will provide sequential multiple hypothesis testing procedures which reach conclusions about each individual stream and hypothesis individually, as well as the set of hypotheses as a whole by controlling overall error rates, while being adaptively efficient by "dropping" a data stream once no additional information is needed to reach a confident conclusion. This will be done for the two most widely-used multiple testing error metrics, false-discovery rate and familywise error rate. For these two metrics, the investigator will: (1) develop sequential multiple testing procedures and a unified theory for existing procedures; (2) assess their performance and optimality through analysis and extensive numerical simulations; (3) find expressions or approximations for their operating characteristics including achieved error rates and expected total and maximum sample size; (4) apply the procedures to real data in genetics, genomics, and multi-arm biomedical trials and modify the procedures to aid practical implementation in these areas; and (5) develop free software packages to facilitate applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide new statistical methods to handle the analysis of multiple data streams arriving sequentially over time in a coherent fashion. The need to handle this type of data arises in a plethora of real-world situations including terrorist threat detection, quality control, finance, biomedical clinical trials for new treatments, disease monitoring in human and animal populations, genetics, and genomics. Despite this, there are few existing statistical procedures that one can use except in some special cases. The procedures developed in this project will therefore be widely applicable by scientists and workers in these areas. Methodologically, the work will be a breakthrough in a fundamental yet largely unexplored area of statistics, with many benefits and broader impacts to society.</AbstractNarration>
