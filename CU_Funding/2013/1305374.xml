    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will study the generation and evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz waves (KHW) at the dayside magnetopause and the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) of Earth's magnetosphere under variable solar wind conditions. The project includes studying the effects of the KHW on solar wind entry into the magnetosphere and their impact on the inner magnetosphere. The research will be based on a combination of global magnetosphere simulations and extensive and intensive analysis of KHW observations from spacecraft to explore the global distribution of the occurrence and characteristics of KHW over the surface of the magnetopause. Direct spatial and temporal observations of KHW under a variety of solar wind conditions are lacking, with the result that the generation, development, and impact of these magnetopause waves are far from being fully understood in geospace. Statistical studies of KHW including sufficient numbers of conjunctive observations using multiple spacecraft will provide direct spatial and temporal observations of the generation and evolution of KHW and the effect of KHW on plasma transport and the inner magnetosphere. The study will be enhanced by global magnetohydrodynamic simulations that are suitable for investigating large-scale physical processes and their evolution. The goal of the study is to better understand the physics of the Earth?s magnetopause and the response of the inner magnetosphere to solar wind inputs that reach the magnetopause. Understanding the generation and evolution of the KHW at the magnetopause will have a large impact not only on terrestrial magnetospheric physics, but also on other magnetized (Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn) and unmagnetized (Mars and Venus) planetary interactions with the solar wind. The relationship between the ultra-low frequency waves observed in the inner magnetosphere and the KHW on the magnetospause and the importance and effectiveness of plasma transport facilitated by KHW into the plasma sheet and inner magnetosphere are important for better space weather forecasting. It will also have relevance to on-going studies of the radiation belt and ring current based on observations currently being made by NASA's Van Allen Probes.</AbstractNarration>
