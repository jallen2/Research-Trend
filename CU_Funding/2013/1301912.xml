    <AbstractNarration>The University System of Maryland (USM) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program (cohort 8) is a collaborative effort between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the USM institutions to increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities (URM) matriculating and completing doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Since the first BD cohort matriculated at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in 2005, 79 BD Fellows have enrolled in STEM graduate programs at UMBC and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). Since the inception of the USM LSAMP in 1995, the USM has remained a driving force in increasing the number of URM baccalaureate degree recipients in STEM disciplines, and more than 8,500 STEM bachelor?s degrees have been awarded to underrepresented students. As a Senior-level Alliance, the USM LSAMP continues to work to increase the number of STEM bachelor?s degrees awarded to URM students and the number of undergraduate URM students conducting scientific research and going on to pursue STEM doctorates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD Program provides a cohort of 12 students who have participated in LSAMP Programs as undergraduates the opportunity to receive substantial funding and other critical support to successfully pursue graduate degrees in diverse STEM fields at UMBC and UMCP. The participants also have the opportunity, early in their academic careers, to conduct cutting-edge research with top research scientists on the campuses and at national laboratories located in close proximity to the campuses. An outcome of this training is evidenced by the careers and international contributions that are being made by USM?s BD Fellows. As an example, some of the careers for USM?s BD Fellows who have received the Ph.D. include, but are not limited to: Senior Aerospace Engineer (QuinetiQ North America ? Defense and Space Industry), Postdoctoral Fellow at the Buck Institute (Chemistry and Aging), Assistant Research Professor at the United States Naval Academy (Mechanical Engineering), and Postdoctoral Fellow at North Carolina State University (Biomedical Engineering). BD Fellows also have won awards for their research and have co-authored publications and conference proceedings for international meetings. In addition, UMBC?s BD Fellows have received subsequent funding after the first two years from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the National GEM Consortium, Google, as well as funding from the academic departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD Fellows at UMBC will participate in a number of activities that are specifically designed to facilitate retention, professional development, Ph.D. completion, and preparation for their STEM careers. Plans for the 2013-15 UMBC BD cohort include the following components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? Extensive orientation program, including mandatory participation in a two-day summer institute, the university-wide orientation for graduate students, and departmental orientations with faculty and peers&lt;br/&gt;? Bi-weekly cohort meetings, small group triad sessions, monthly individual consultations, and special peer mentoring sessions from BD Fellows in previous cohorts&lt;br/&gt;? Monthly professional development seminars (e.g., ?Marketing your Science?, Professors-in-Training?)&lt;br/&gt;? Multi-day ?Writing for Publication? conference, weekend M.S. thesis completion workshops, followed by access to and assigned mentor-coaches for Dissertation House&lt;br/&gt;? Conceptual research idea and hands-on Fastlane training sessions for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, and group preparation for external fellowships and competitive research opportunities&lt;br/&gt;? Connections to the BD Fellows at UMCP and connections to the USM?s BD alumni&lt;br/&gt;? Training in public speaking, and participation in the UMBC Graduate Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;? IRB and Responsible Conduct of Research Training, including CITI Certification, 50-page ?Preparation for Research? development plan that outlines and details the students? research goals&lt;br/&gt;? Opportunities to participate in short-term research and site visits at national labs, corporations, and UMBC strategic partner sites such as the Quality of Life Technology (QoLT) Center, and NSF Engineering Research Center and collaborative between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD Program serves new graduate students who were undergraduate researchers in LSAMP programs, many of whom are members of groups that traditionally have been underrepresented in STEM fields. The BD Program provides the next step for LSAMP?s graduates by providing layers of support at the graduate level that will facilitate completion of STEM doctoral degrees. The extensive suite of BD professional development and supportive activities for UMBC have been built upon proven methods for motivation, retention, research preparation, milestone achievement, degree completion, and transition to Ph.D.-level STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>
