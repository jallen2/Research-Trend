    <AbstractNarration>ID: 1358998 PI: Zainuddin, Shaik ORG: Tuskegee University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: REU Site: Tuskegee University Research Experience for Undergraduates in Nano-Bio Materials Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This REU site is focused on training undergraduate minority students for a 10-week period each summer in the fields of Nano-Bio Materials Science and Engineering under the mentorship of interdisciplinary research faculty and their Ph.D. students. Research activities will be focused on a wide range of important areas including synthesis of nanoparticles for biomedical applications and antimicrobial properties, nanosensors for detection of salmonella enterica, nanoscale drug delivery system for treatment of solid tumors, and structure-property relationships in nano-bio composites. Involvement of REU students in these challenging and meaningful research areas with minority Ph.D. students as mentors will have a significant impact on their decision to pursue graduate studies and STEM based careers. REU students will also participate in several unique activities including a two-credit hour Introduction to Research course and training for the Graduate Record Examination. Students will learn critical thinking, qualitative reasoning, mathematical, analytical, and research skills through these activities that will be integral in their transition toward graduate studies and STEM careers. Site activities will also support student professional development including professional seminars by role models, field trips to local industrial sites, summer presentations, and workshops. Finally, a comprehensive assessment program will be implemented to evaluate the impact of the program on students including interest in research, progress in education, and long-term professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Tuskegee University (TU) has, over the years with support from National Science Foundation (NSF) and other federal agencies, developed a program of research and education in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), which is not only very comprehensive but also very effective in recruiting, motivating, mentoring, and graduating students with advanced degrees in MSE. The program has produced the largest number of minority PhDs in MSE of which over 50 percent are females. Through this REU Site, Tuskegee University will establish a pipeline to expose undergraduates from four-year and community colleges in Alabama to a research environment. The research projects chosen for students are in Nano-Bio Materials Science and Engineering, an area of high national interest that is vital for the technological developments in engineering, science, and medicine. Involvement of REU students in these emerging research areas with faculty from various disciplines and existing on-campus multidisciplinary research and education centers will enable them to develop skills needed to excel in academia and STEM careers. Minority Ph.D. students as mentors, deans of various colleges at TU, and MSE minority Ph.D. alumni as seminar speakers will not only serve as role models, but also build confidence and motivate these students to pursue graduate studies in STEM areas. The planned workshops, summer presentations, and field trips give students a broader appreciation and an incentive for pursing graduate studies in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
