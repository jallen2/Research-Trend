    <AbstractNarration>Software has become a critical infrastructure in our society with its&lt;br/&gt;pervasive use in all kinds of products from home appliances to&lt;br/&gt;automobiles, from individual pacemakers and smart phones to air&lt;br/&gt;traffic control systems and high-end computers in large-scale power&lt;br/&gt;grids. During software development, the build process is vital to make&lt;br/&gt;sure that a software product is correctly and reliably constructed and&lt;br/&gt;configured in accordance with different users' operation environments,&lt;br/&gt;operating systems, platforms, and devices. To reliably build a&lt;br/&gt;software product, a build tool is used to execute build code to&lt;br/&gt;generate the executable and deliverable files according to the rules&lt;br/&gt;specified in the build files. As a software project evolves over time,&lt;br/&gt;build code continually evolves and is defect-prone due to the high&lt;br/&gt;rate of changes and complexity of the build files. The complexity of&lt;br/&gt;build code leads to two important issues. First, the maintenance of&lt;br/&gt;complex build code has imposed much extra effort on software&lt;br/&gt;developers. Second, its complexity is a source for configuration and&lt;br/&gt;build errors in software development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to improve software reliability with a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;approach to develop a scientific foundation for build code analysis to&lt;br/&gt;provide automatic supports for 1) build code maintenance and 2)&lt;br/&gt;detecting, testing, and locating configuration and build errors. We&lt;br/&gt;will first examine configuration and build code errors and related maintenance &lt;br/&gt;tasks in real-world projects. Second, we will develop a scientific foundation&lt;br/&gt;with novel concepts, techniques, and algorithms for build code static&lt;br/&gt;analysis, build code smell and configuration error detection,&lt;br/&gt;refactoring, and change analysis. Third, we will investigate a&lt;br/&gt;foundation for build code dynamic analysis and leverage it to support&lt;br/&gt;fault localization in build code given a reported build&lt;br/&gt;failure. Finally, a theoretical foundation and tool supports&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. semi-automatic test generation) for build code testing will be&lt;br/&gt;developed. Our research will fundamentally advance the body of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge in theoretical foundation for software building, build code&lt;br/&gt;analysis and maintenance. Our results will lead to more reliable&lt;br/&gt;software and improvement in code quality as well as in the developers'&lt;br/&gt;productivity. Our validation efforts involve students and&lt;br/&gt;professionals, promoting teaching and training in information&lt;br/&gt;assurance and software reliability.</AbstractNarration>
