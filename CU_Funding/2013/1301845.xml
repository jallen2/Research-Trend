    <AbstractNarration>The proposed meeting will take place over three days, August 1-3, 2013, at the Centre de recherches mathematiques in Montreal.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes plans for the 15th New Researchers Conference, a conference series organized &lt;br/&gt;by and held for junior researchers under the auspices of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS). &lt;br/&gt;The primary objective is to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new researchers in &lt;br/&gt;statistics and probability. The proposed meeting will take place over three days, August 1-3, 2013, at the &lt;br/&gt;Centre de recherches mathematiques in Montreal. The meeting will be held immediately preceding the &lt;br/&gt;Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM). Participants will be statisticians and probabilists who have received their &lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. within the past five years or are expecting to receive their degree within the same year. Each &lt;br/&gt;participant will present a short expository talk and a poster. Topics will cover a variety of areas in &lt;br/&gt;statistics and probability, from theory and methods to applications. Senior speakers will give plenary &lt;br/&gt;talks for inspiration and take part in four discussion panels covering topics of importance for young &lt;br/&gt;people embarking on an academic/research career: teaching, mentoring, publishing and funding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference series is explicitly aimed at training the future leaders and workers in statistics and &lt;br/&gt;probability. In helping to create networks of new researchers, it lays the groundwork for future &lt;br/&gt;collaboration and informal exchange of ideas and knowledge. It is also critical for building professional &lt;br/&gt;cohesion within the fields of statistics and probability and setting new frontiers for research. Meeting &lt;br/&gt;people outside of one's research specialty area, and learning about their research, favors a more &lt;br/&gt;comprehensive view of research, which is important when taking editor positions and other professional &lt;br/&gt;service activities. The conference attracts participants with different backgrounds and nationalities, and &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups (women, minorities and people with disabilities) are explicitly encouraged to &lt;br/&gt;attend.
