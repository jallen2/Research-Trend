    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A program, Mathias Weber of the University of Colorado at Boulder develops a new experimental approach to study chemical reactions that occur in a solar energy conversion reactor. The type of reactor being studied utilizes a catalyst molecule that contains either ruthenium or copper to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Energy from sunlight is, thus, used to extract a sustainable source of fuel from water, but the precise way it works is not fully understood. This lack of understanding hinders the design and improvement of catalysts and reactors for this important technological process. One of the complicating factors in studies of this system is the presence of the water itself. The current research is getting around this problem by removing the molecules produced in the solar reactor and putting them into a vacuum. Highly sophisticated pieces of equipment can then be used to study the detailed nature of these chemical species. The measurements made in vacuum will then provide signatures that can be used later to identify those species when water is present, in other words, in the reactor as it normally functions. The work addresses an important societal problem, the development of alternative sources of energy that do not rely on carbon-based fuels. Training the next generation of scientists is an integral part of this project. It includes budding researchers as young as grades five through nine through a Saturday morning science program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigators are studying the electronic and geometric structures of selected ruthenium- and copper-based catalysts for water oxidation, as well as certain reaction intermediates that arise in the catalytic conversion process. Ions of catalyst and reaction intermediates are transferred into the gas phase by electrospray ionization. The ions are then cooled in an ion trap, mass selected, and irradiated by pulsed light, which is tunable throughout the mid-IR, visible and near-UV spectrum. Photon absorption is monitored by photofragmentation of the target ions, allowing the measurement of their vibrational and electronic spectra. Cooling the ions to low temperatures is crucial to obtain the necessary spectroscopic detail. Vibrational spectra will result in structural information about the ions under study, which is particularly important for reaction intermediates. Measuring the electronic spectra of catalysts and reaction intermediates will aid clarification of speciation in reactive solutions. In addition, the excited state vibrational structure is assisting the investigators in computational modeling studies of the excited state dynamics and reactivity.</AbstractNarration>
