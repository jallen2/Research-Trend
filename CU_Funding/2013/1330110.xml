    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to improve the performance of autonomous systems &lt;br/&gt;in dynamic environments, such as disaster recovery, by integrating perception, planning&lt;br/&gt;paradigms, learning, and databases. For the next generation of autonomous systems to be&lt;br/&gt;truly effective in terms of tangible performance improvements (e.g., long-term operations,&lt;br/&gt;complex and rapidly changing environments), a new level of intelligence must be attained.&lt;br/&gt;This project improves the state of robotic systems by enhancing their ability to coordinate&lt;br/&gt;activities (such as searching a disaster zone), recognize objects or people, account for&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty, and "most important" learn, so the system's performance is continuously &lt;br/&gt;improving. To do this, the project takes an interdisciplinary approach to developing &lt;br/&gt;techniques in core areas and at the interface of perception, planning, learning, and databases &lt;br/&gt;to achieve robustness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to significantly improve the performance of cyber-physical systems &lt;br/&gt;for time-critical applications such as disaster monitoring, search and rescue, autonomous &lt;br/&gt;navigation, and security and surveillance. It enables the development of techniques and &lt;br/&gt;tools to augment all decision making processes and applications which are characterized&lt;br/&gt;by continuously changing operating conditions, missions and environments. The project&lt;br/&gt;contributes to education and a diverse engineering workforce by training students at the&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Riverside, one of the most diverse research institutions in US &lt;br/&gt;and an accredited Hispanic Serving Institution. Instruction and research opportunities&lt;br/&gt;cross traditional disciplinary boundaries, and the project serves as the basis for &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate capstone design projects and a new graduate course. The software and &lt;br/&gt;testbeds from this project will be shared with the cyber-physical system research community,&lt;br/&gt;industry, and end users. The project plans to present focused workshops/tutorials at major &lt;br/&gt;IEEE and ACM conferences. The results will be broadly disseminated through the &lt;br/&gt;project website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project website at: &lt;br/&gt;http://vislab.ucr.edu/RESEARCH/DSLC/DSLC.php</AbstractNarration>
