    <AbstractNarration>This research award supports fundamental research on additive manufacturing at the micro-scale that will improve the flexibility, cost and performance of high-resolution electronic device fabrication. Specifically, the research will exploit the unique drop-on-demand capabilities of jet-based micro-additive manufacturing processes to reduce fabrication costs and improve part fidelity of printed electronics. The research will develop a unique sensing strategy for monitoring critical process parameters in jet-based printing; establish a fundamental scientific understanding of the impact of environmental conditions on the physics that governs jet-based processes; derive systematic methodologies for modeling complex micro-additive manufacturing processes; and evaluate a new paradigm in process control that utilizes robust learning schemes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A globally competitive manufacturing industry will contribute to the nation's economy, sustainability, and position within a global market. To this end, additive manufacturing, in particular micro-additive manufacturing, has the potential to revolutionize the way the US manufactures goods. The research results from this award will provide an improved fundamental scientific understanding of the physics that govern jet-based micro-additive manufacturing processes and new tools at the intersection of process modeling, additive manufacturing, and learning control. This research will lead to the ability to fabricate smaller, faster, and cheaper devices with less material waste while encouraging the consumer market and driving product demand; leading to additional technological breakthroughs in engineering, computer science, and material science. A key enabler for advanced manufacturing is public awareness. To achieve awareness and inspire the next generation of engineers, this research project will work with local science and technology museums to reach thousands of students and parents each year. It will also positively influence engineering education for undergraduate and graduate students through hands-on research projects, and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering through university-based programs.</AbstractNarration>
