    <AbstractNarration>From key-value stores to distributed file systems to distributed &lt;br/&gt;databases, networked storage underpins modern Internet services. &lt;br/&gt;Networked storage allows programmers to separate logic and data, enables &lt;br/&gt;high throughput scale out, and takes advantage of increasingly fast &lt;br/&gt;datacenter networks. However, in the big data era, networked storage &lt;br/&gt;faces a new challenge: The amount of data accessed per user request is &lt;br/&gt;growing rapidly; outpacing processor speeds and DRAM capacity. &lt;br/&gt;Increasingly, user-perceived response times are dominated by the slowest &lt;br/&gt;storage accesses, i.e., the 99th percentile tails. Networked storage is &lt;br/&gt;notorious for fat tailed response times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are developing networked storage systems that are 1) always fast and 2) &lt;br/&gt;cost efficient. A key approach is to understand and selectively use &lt;br/&gt;replication for predictability (or cloning). In this approach, clients &lt;br/&gt;issue redundant storage accesses against independent hardware resources. &lt;br/&gt;The first to respond provides the result. Replication for predictability &lt;br/&gt;reduces client-perceived variability, leading to always fast response &lt;br/&gt;times. Our implementations are especially cost effective at scale. To &lt;br/&gt;lower costs, we study the root causes of slow response times, saving &lt;br/&gt;resources by focusing on common causes. We also trade quality---e.g., &lt;br/&gt;slightly degraded search engine results--- for lower hardware costs when &lt;br/&gt;appropriate. For broader impact, the PI will work to transfer the &lt;br/&gt;technology to national and local companies.</AbstractNarration>
