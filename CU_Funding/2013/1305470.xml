    <AbstractNarration>This project will concern the investigation of reactions of slow electrons with biomolecules. Such slow electrons are typically found in human tissue after irradiation with deep ultra-violet photons and X-rays. The processes concerned will be in the excitation of electron states in the biomolecule, a process which is complicated by the size of such molecules, and involves close collaboration between two established and advanced theoretical (Caltech) and experimental (Cal State Fullerton) groups. Recent success in work with water has provided impetus for this collaboration to look at more complex molecules - methanol and ethanol and has provided a good foundation for this direction of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this collaboration is its involvement of international experimental (U. Juiz de Fora) and theoretical groups (USP, U. Parana in Curitiba, Unicamp) in Brazil. It also provides involvement of US undergraduate students at Cal State Fullerton to go to Brazil to carry out summer research to do experimental work in developing projects there as well as taking electron-biomolecule collisions data to transfer US technology to Brazil and to foster scientific relations between the two countries. This also provides impetus for Brazilian faculty and students from these universities to come to the USA to CIT/CSUF and collaborate. The students who participate get international experience and are very likely to pursue graduate studies in physics or physical chemistry. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>
