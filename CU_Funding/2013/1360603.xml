    <AbstractNarration>1055599&lt;br/&gt;Su&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Biosensing in thermal space&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although numerous biomarkers with certain specificity to cancers have been identified, it is clear that no single biomarker is ideal to distinguish lethal cancers from indolent ones due to lack of tumor specificity. Parallel to efforts of finding more specific biomarkers, a feasible way of providing better predictive value is to detect multiple biomarkers. However, existing techniques cannot be used to detect a large number of biomarkers due to peak overlapping, lack of probe-specific property or complexity of readout systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project will study a new biosensing method, i.e., thermal biosensing, in which a series of composition-encoded nanoparticles of solid-liquid phase change materials (metals and eutectic alloys) that have sharp and discrete melting peaks will be designed, produced, modified with a series of ligands, and used for in vitro detection of multiple biomarkers. A one-to-one correspondence will be established between one type of biomarker and one type of nanoparticles. The presence and concentration of each biomarker will be derived from the melting peak and fusion enthalpy of according nanoparticle. The multiple results will be used to distinguish lethal cancers at early stages using pattern recognition method. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Thermal biosensing uses a well-known, but unexplored thermal phenomenon of solids: the temperature of a solid will not rise above its melting point until the entire solid is molten, and the fact that metal or eutectic alloy has composition-dependent melting point and sharp melting peak during linear thermal scan. By uniquely combining phase diagram knowledge gained in the past with size advantage of nanoparticles, thermal biosensing has distinct features for biomarker detection. By filling knowledge gap among biosensing, metallurgy and nanotechnology, thermal biosensing using phase change nanoparticles represents a paradigm shift from existing electric, electronic, magnetic, mechanical or photonic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Thermal biosensing could lead to technological breakthroughs in detection and treatment of lethal cancers. The early detections of lethal cancers will enhance survivability of patients, reduce costs of diagnosis and treatment, and improve quality of life by curing cancer and reducing anxiety associated with cancer. Thermal biosensing can also be extended to a variety of applications including biomedicine, food production and processing, and rapid detections of multiple bacteria, viruses, and biotoxins for bio-safety, bio-warfare defense and environmental applications. The educational plan is targeted to attract students into Bio-Nano engineering, and will generate lasting impacts on students by enlightening young minds, and to society by maintaining high-quality workforces.</AbstractNarration>
