    <AbstractNarration>The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is providing scholarships to 39 academically talented transfer students from the Alamo Community College District preparing to become science and mathematics teachers. The effort will involve a partnership of the College of Sciences, the College of Education and Human Development, schools within the Alamo Community College District and several local high needs school districts in and around San Antonio, Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program follows a previously established model at UTSA shown to be successful with students majoring in STEM within UTSA. The Generating Educational Excellence in Math and Science (GE2MS) program is providing pre-service teachers with mentoring and academic support to effectively integrate the students into the pre-service activities at UTSA (including a summer bridging institute) while providing the students the opportunity to participate in a rigorous science and mathematics preparation program. In addition, project personnel are offering continuing support for the new teachers including access to induction support services offered by the Academy for Teacher Excellence (ATE) and Career Transitioning Guidance (CTG), and conducting regular online sessions through an eCommunity of Practice to provide support, advice, mentoring and help with curricular challenges encountered by new teachers. The evaluation of the Noyce GE2MS program is also providing information on the efficacy of mentoring and academic support and to inform how these activities can be structured to increase the recruitment and retention of highly qualified secondary STEM teachers.</AbstractNarration>
