    <AbstractNarration>The American Mathematical Society (AMS) has created the Mathematics Research Communities (MRC) as a national program to support and guide young mathematicians as they begin their research careers. In 2014, there are four MRC conferences proposed, all to be held in Snowbird, Utah: Cluster Algebras, June 8 - 14, 2014; Algebraic and Geometric Combinatorics in Applied Mathematics, June 15 - 21, 2014; Mathematics of Quantum Phases of Matter and Quantum Information, June 25 - July 1, 2014; and Network Science, June 25 - July 1, 2014. The topics of the conferences to be held in 2015 and 2016 will be determined later by the MRC Advisory Board, which evaluates proposals submitted by senior mathematicians who wish to be organizers. Each of the MRC conferences will bring together a diverse group of young mathematicians. The organizing committee for each conference is composed of leaders in the field of the conference and includes individuals with previous experience in organizing successful workshops and conferences. The conferences will bring together senior and junior researchers in an ideal environment to establish connections, which often last for many years after the conference itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Mathematics Research Communities program is to create research cohorts of young mathematicians that will sustain themselves over time, fostering joint research and coherent research programs that will, eventually, reach all areas of mathematics. The Mathematics Research Communities program strives to achieve this goal through the following activities in addition to the summer research conferences: Special Sessions at the annual AMS-MAA Joint Mathematics Meetings, mentoring and a discussion network. It is the formation of research cohorts that sets this program apart from any other (national) professional development programs for mathematicians that currently exist. The creation of three to four new cohorts per year has the potential to lay a foundation for decades of research, and will have an extremely positive effect on mathematics research in the U.S. Most importantly, this program will focus on mathematicians who are beginning their research careers; all program components will help to train and connect the next generation of researchers in, eventually, all research areas of mathematics. This proposal is requesting support for an additional three years of this unique program. Conference topics will include both pure and applied mathematics areas of research.</AbstractNarration>
