    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on context-aware security and privacy for RFID systems and has yielded a number of security and privacy techniques for RFID systems. These techniques include: &lt;br/&gt;1) Context-aware selective unlocking techniques to prevent malicious reading of sensitive information stored on RFID tags; &lt;br/&gt;2) Context-aware transaction verification to secure authentication in NFC-based mobile payment system&lt;br/&gt;3) Context-aware malware protection to prevent malicious use of NFC chips and other valuable resources on smartphones. &lt;br/&gt;The research team has built prototypes on a wireless identification and sensing platform as well as a smartphone. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of these techniques which are ready for further development. The objective of this I-Corps project is to further develop contextaware security and privacy techniques developed by the research team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this project is derived from security mechanisms utilizing various contextual information to provide enhanced security and privacy for RFID systems. This technology is user-friendly, involving minimal user interruption. It applies to a wide range of RFID applications including e-identity cards (e-passport, e-driver license), payment cards (credit card), electronic toll collection systems, access cards, and medical implants. It has the potential, for both corporations and individuals, to drastically reduce financial loss from identity theft due to a compromised e-identity card (passport, driver license) or payment card. In addition the technology has been developed with ease of use in mind, and thus will be more attractive to end users.</AbstractNarration>
