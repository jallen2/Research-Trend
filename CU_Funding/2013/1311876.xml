    <AbstractNarration>Memphis Virtual STEM Academy at East High School&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Memphis Virtual STEM Academy at East High School project investigates the implementation of a virtual STEM curriculum that utilizes self-paced modules, face-to-face STEM laboratory projects, and field experiences designed to help students (grades 9-12) understand pre-engineering concepts and principles as well as develop an interest in and motivation to pursue STEM and ICT careers. The four project objectives are to: 1) increase Virtual STEM Academy students' use and integration of technology into their learning experiences; 2) increase Virtual STEM Academy students' STEM learning as compared to students in other district STEM-focused programs; 3) decrease gaps in achievement and technical skills among student populations by gender, racial/ethnic background, and economic level; and 4) increase the Virtual STEM Academy students' STEM career awareness and interest. The Academy establishes a single site, centrally located in the district, which provides a state-of-the-art laboratory facility and well-trained teachers with engineering degrees. Students from the district's more than 40 high schools are able to access high quality lab facilities and teachers not typically available to local high schools. Approximately 100 freshmen will enroll in the Academy each year, selected on the basis of qualifying scores on the ACT Explore assessment, completion of a statement of interest for engineering or engineering technology, and a letter of parental support. Primary partners in the project are Shelby County Schools (formerly Memphis City Schools) and the Herff College of Engineering at the University of Memphis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project design is a hybrid model that permits students to remain at their geographically assigned school for a program of study that incorporates Internet-based curriculum intended for flexible use based upon national best practice implementation and integration strategies. All students will take Introduction to Engineering and Principles of Engineering, providing students with the opportunity to link content and apply it to solve real-world problems. Students then choose an elective track from the focus areas of civil engineering &amp; architecture, biotechnology, manufacturing or energy and participate in corresponding laboratory exercises and projects as they attend the lab facility during the evenings or on Saturday. ITEST strategies to enhance student interest include student support, teacher support, STEM interest development, and partnership development. Capacity-building includes training of STEM teachers at home schools, tutoring from engineering undergraduates, and engagement of local industries for site visits and internships. The evaluation plan utilizes a quasi-experimental design with formative and summative analyses of data sources that include enrollment and retention figures, student performance (GPA, ACT, AP, End of Course Tests, observation, interest inventories, graduation rates), and professional development participation. The method of analysis will include both descriptive statistics and inferential tests, including associated effect sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project deliverables and products will include a detailed description of the model and the implementation plan as well as research articles, reports, and presentations regarding the effectiveness of the project model and its impact on improving student interest, identity, and persistence in STEM. Approximately, 400 students (in grades 9 - 12) and 70 STEM teachers will be directly targeted during the project period. However, the project will also reach and serve middle school students who express initial interest in STEM careers. The Virtual STEM Academy is designed to create broader impacts locally, regionally, and nationally in K-12 and higher education environments by addressing some of the challenges faced by large, urban school districts in their efforts to offer STEM programs of study with limited resources (human and fiscal) and/or student interest at one particular school. The model developed will demonstrate how an innovative approach that leverages existing resources can be used to create a unique learning opportunity for students without having them transfer to a magnet school. The findings from this project will not only support the efforts of large, urban districts but may also be relevant to small, rural school districts that face similar challenges.</AbstractNarration>
