    <AbstractNarration>The innovation for education is in the portable and interactive hardware that can be placed into the hands of every student, from the classroom to the dorm-room. This will enable personal and crucial connections linking theory to application in science and engineering. The portable laboratory design provides an integrated solution of experimental hardware and supporting software kits involving lessons designed around leading forefronts of technology at a cost no more than a typical university lab fee. Each kit is designed to offer multiple educational experiences increasing in complexity through the progression of learning. Internet technology continues to revolutionize the world by bringing experiences to remote locations. Education is an obvious beneficiary as distribution of written and illustrated knowledge can be readily transmitted to desktop and mobile displays. However a critical part of learning involves physical interaction which provides inspiration and solidifies understanding. From primary school through universities, experiments and laboratory exercises typically involve equipment that is too bulky and costly to facilitate portability of education. The portable laboratory innovation satisfies an identified need to develop a cost-effective, content-rich, integrative, interactive, and portable family of educational tools that demonstrate real world contexts, expose advanced and new technologies, and develop hands-on skills required for future innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this innovation should be an increase of graduates in Science, Technology, and Math (STEM). There is no shortage of concern for the state of STEM education in the U.S. today. Studies repeatedly identify need for a significant increase in the number of successful graduates. A large obstacle facing students discovering interest in STEM is enduring the daunting task of learning the foundation of theoretical concepts to solve closed-ended problems. Effective experimental interaction can provide invaluable motivation. Furthermore, it can provide a framework for learning the theoretical concepts and even introducing the challenge of solving open-ended real world problems. Currently, this experiential exposure often requires hardware systems that are not accessible for portable education. Currently, teachers, professors and self-guided students are faced with an educational tool market with offerings most often beyond budgets that can provide a personal experience. There is enormous opportunity to meet educational demand by providing hardware kits that demonstrate state-of-the-art technology while connecting students to the STEM behind the design. The portable laboratory innovation meets this demand and in doing so, provides a revolutionary approach to increasing success of STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
