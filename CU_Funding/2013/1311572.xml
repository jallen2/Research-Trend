    <AbstractNarration>This study seeks to use genetic data to elucidate mechanisms underlying host specificity in a group of fungi that are either pathogens of insects or other fungi. Through previous research, whole genome data was generated for two very closely related species, one beetle pathogen and one truffle pathogen. In this study, an experiment will be performed where the truffle pathogen will be grown in conditions containing the truffle and without, and the comparison of how the fungus responds to these conditions (measured using messenger RNA) will gives clues as to which genes and pathways are necessary for truffle pathogenesis. In addition, whole genome data will be produced for more species within this genus, including a cicada pathogen and another truffle pathogen. These additional genomes will allow larger generalizations to be made about species within this genus parasitizing different hosts, and to identify host-specific gene sets. Little is known about the infection of new hosts by fungal pathogens and is of increasing importance as the climate continues to change and communities become more global. Knowledge of the genomic differences of species parasitizing different hosts can inform how fungi are able to switch hosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this study include, but are not limited to, the following. First, a major impact of this proposal will be the production of an electronically available high school biology module on fungal pathogens of insects and other fungi. This will be created as a resource for both teachers and students, and include classroom, field, and laboratory exercises. An integral part of this module will be 5 lessons plans, complete with presentation slides, to comprise an entire insect pathogenic fungi unit. This will be made publically available at the Cordyceps Electronic Monograph at http://cordyceps.us. Second, it is of little doubt, based on all previously sequenced genomes of related species, that the study organisms will each have a significant repertoire of secondary metabolites, and a major impact of this project will be the identification of these gene clusters which could lead to the identification and development of novel natural products, with potential applications in medicine and biocontrol.</AbstractNarration>
