    <AbstractNarration>Geometric combinatorics is a rapidly developing field that has close connections to optimization, computer science, engineering, statistics, and even mathematical biology. A typical problem in optimization involves optimizing a function over the set of all solutions of a given linear system --- a system that usually contains hundreds or thousands of equations in many variables. Geometrically, the corresponding set of points is a high-dimensional object, called a polytope. Moreover, in recent years the study of polytopes with certain symmetry has led to surprising implications in statistics, probability, information theory, and signal processing, and is also expected to have impacts in such subjects as medical imaging and digital communications. In engineering and computer science, e.g., robotics, one often needs to describe a space of "allowed motions": this space can usually be approximated by a collection of points, segments, triangles, pyramids, and higher dimensional analogs of pyramids nicely glued together --- an object known as a simplicial complex. The problems aimed at deepening our understanding of polytopes and simplicial complexes are at the heart of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of this proposal is to attack several long-standing problems and conjectures in the theory of face numbers of various classes of simplicial and, more generally, CW complexes. Specifically, research on this project will involve the use of algebraic, geometric, topological, and combinatorial methods to attack fundamental enumerative questions related to (1) simplicial spheres and, more generally, complexes embeddable in a sphere of a given dimension, (2) balanced triangulations of spheres and manifolds, (3) flag and banner complexes, and (4) centrally symmetric polytopes. The main flavor of questions we are interested in is how the topology of the underlying space (e.g., being a triangulation of a certain manifold) or a certain combinatorial restriction, such as symmetry or balancedness, affects the possible face numbers of complexes in question. Although most of the problems proposed here are combinatorial in nature, recent advances are carried out by a subtle combination of algebraic and geometric arguments (among them Lefschetz algebras, generic and not-so-generic initial ideals, local cohomology, rigidity, etc.). Thus solutions to the proposed problems may impact not only combinatorics and discrete geometry but also such fields as combinatorial algebra, algebraic topology, and Riemannian geometry.</AbstractNarration>
