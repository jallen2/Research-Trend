    <AbstractNarration>The Schools of Education and of Science and Mathematics, and The STEM Center of Excellence at The Citadel, in collaboration with the following high-need school districts - Berkeley County, Charleston County, Colleton County, Dorchester 4 and Hampton 1- are establishing the RECON (Recruit, Educate, Certify and Obtain New-Teachers) program to provide high-quality mathematics and science teachers for high-need school districts in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. This Phase I program is preparing 30 new teachers of mathematics and science teachers for high needs schools. Each of these teachers graduate with a major in mathematics, engineering or one of physical or natural sciences. Ten of these teachers come from the ranks of juniors majoring in chemistry or biology. Twenty come from STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) career changers who progress through an Accelerated MAT (Master of Arts in Teaching) program in Biology or in Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Noyce scholarship recipients are benefitting from: scholarships to cover tuition cost and facilitate attendance by a diverse group of individuals; coursework aligned with the Common Core that provides the pedagogical skills and content knowledge necessary to effectively educate students in mathematics and science; individualized plans of study with ongoing advising and assistance; university/school system collaboration to ensure placement in appropriate teaching positions in high-need schools; support programs including individualized mentoring by school-system educators and university personnel; and professional development programs through the university's STEM Center of Excellence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is growing STEM-related capacity in South Carolina's Lowcountry as well as the state and nation. The scholarships are enabling potential educators from low socio-economic backgrounds and other diverse backgrounds to go to college to pursue their aspiration of making a difference through education. In addition, having partnerships across five school districts linked to The Citadel provides educators with the support they need to more effectively teach the STEM disciplines. The pedagogical content focus of the proposal enhances the teacher knowledge and ability of participants to assist K-12 students with diverse learning needs and backgrounds in pursuing Career Pathways (part of South Carolina's Education Economic Development Act) options. The project staff and evaluators are studying the marketing, recruitment, pedagogy and partnerships with K-12 schools and develop conference, presentations, publications, and other products to disseminate results of these studies within the scientific, educational and evaluation communities.</AbstractNarration>
