    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry Division, Prof. Theodore L. Einstein of University of Maryland and Prof. Ludwig Bartels of&lt;br/&gt;the University of California, Riverside, and their students will use a combination of scanning tunneling&lt;br/&gt;microscopy and methods of statistical mechanics, especially Monte Carlo simulations and lattice-gas&lt;br/&gt;modeling, to understand the formation of large regular self-organized networks of acene-related&lt;br/&gt;molecules on substrates with prominent metallic surface states and the role of the resulting nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;pores in providing boundaries that modify the arrangements and reactions of small adsorbates like CO&lt;br/&gt;therein. With international collaborators they will test theories of modification (from large surfaces) key&lt;br/&gt;reaction rates because of altered entropy of mixing in the confined pores and will study the relation of the&lt;br/&gt;superstructure to the surface state on the close-packed face of the copper substrate and investigate the&lt;br/&gt;corrections to a simple picture of dot-induced pore formation. They will also take advantage of research in&lt;br/&gt;two dimensional (2D) materials dominated by electronic states with many similarities to metallic surface&lt;br/&gt;states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide state of the art modeling and/or laboratory experiences for graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students who will be learning the techniques of scanning probe microscopy and&lt;br/&gt;complementary Monte Carlo simulations and calculations of correlation functions, as well as ab initio&lt;br/&gt;electronic structure calculations to help parameterize the statistical mechanical studies. The project&lt;br/&gt;consists of an exploration of the formation of regular porous superstructures by organic molecules on&lt;br/&gt;substrates with slowly decaying 2D electronic states. The validation of the novel explanation of pore&lt;br/&gt;stabilization by 2D quantum-dot-like states will be pursued. The impact of such states on the distribution&lt;br/&gt;of small adsorbates (especially carbon monoxide) within the pore will be scrutinized. Calculations of&lt;br/&gt;associated parameters will require use of the latest advances in incorporating van der Waals interactions&lt;br/&gt;into density functional theory computations. Through leadership by a theorist experienced in statistical&lt;br/&gt;physics, this project will foster systematic perspective, deeper understanding and faster testing of results&lt;br/&gt;for phase and pattern formation and predictions promising alternative substrates and adsorbates. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed work is expected to have impact on industrial methodologies and society at large by providing&lt;br/&gt;access to large arrays of identical nanoscale cells in which one can do the experimental equivalent of&lt;br/&gt;parallel computation. Control of such structures will allow tuning of cell sizes to select for favorable&lt;br/&gt;configurations and enhance particular reactions, as well as to explore natural fluctuations. The work will&lt;br/&gt;also provide opportunities for educational and outreach activities with proven broad national,&lt;br/&gt;international and societal impact.</AbstractNarration>
