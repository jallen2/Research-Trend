    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding to support travel of American mathematicians to attend a conference and short courses at the Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Barcelona and a workshop at Univ. de Granada. The workshop on minimal surfaces will be held at Mathematics Institute of Univ. de Granada, June 17-27, 2013. The conference in conformal geometry will take place July 1-5, 2013 at CRM. The workshop seeks to review the recent advances in conformal geometry and minimal surfaces in order to encourage interactions of researchers in related areas. In between the two conferences will be the short courses for graduate students and postdocs on conformal geometry and minimal surfaces June 25 to June 28 at CRM. To promote the interests of young mathematicians in these topics, more than half of the funding from this proposal will go to support the travel of graduate students and young postdocs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed workshops and short courses are intended to stimulate advances and collaborations in the reseach topics of conformal geometry and minimal surfaces. Conformal geometry studies the structure of spaces in which there is a well defined notion of lengths, but the emphasis is on related measurements of length where the notion of angles is preserved. Similarly minimal surface theory studies the placement of surfaces in an ambient space in which there is a well defined notion of length and hence notion of area. Common to both disciplines is the use of differential equations to study related geometric invariants. In recent years there is extensive developments in analytic techniques in differential equations that have direct applications in both conformal geometry and minimal surfaces. These possible applications will in turn generated new advances the the theory of differential equations.
