    <AbstractNarration>Humboldt State University's (HSU) Marine Lab (http://www.humboldt.edu/marinelab/ ) has been awarded a grant to modernize aging components of the running seawater system which will enhance research and training activities at the lab with a reliable, high-quality system. HSU is the northernmost California State University campus and has a well-deserved reputation for high quality natural resources and science programs. The marine lab offers outstanding undergraduate and graduate instruction and excellent opportunities to carry out research projects in the lab and provides access to a wide diversity of marine and coastal habitats. The new seawater system will include two underground water tanks that provide redundancy, improve temperature regulation, are safer in an earthquake-prone region, and provide more effective utilization of the lab's limited footprint by creating space for future expansion. The new system and future expansion will significantly advance or research and training capacity in intertidal ecology, invasive species, fisheries biology, chemical, biological and geological oceanography, and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new seawater facilities will have a positive impact on training at all levels, including K-12 classes, undergraduate and graduate fishery biology, marine biology and oceanography majors at Humboldt State University, community college faculty and students, visiting graduate students, visiting students from throughout the U.S. and the general public. Public outreach is accomplished through free public aquaria, open 6-7 days a week year-round, with guided tours, educational workshops, and high-quality displays; these facilities serve approximately 20,000-35,000 visitors/year. HSU is an Hispanic-serving institution and the only university campus along the northern California coast primarily dedicated to undergraduate education. The area is also home to a large number of Native American Tribes and Rancherias with tribal members actively collaborating in marine research and resource management projects with HSU and other institutions. The lab has a resident Marine Naturalist who leads informal marine science education efforts at the ML and other venues. In the last five years the lab has served over 5,000 K-12 students and offered 240 organized tours of the facility by multiple institutions.</AbstractNarration>
