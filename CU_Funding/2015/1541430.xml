    <AbstractNarration>After an eight year emphasis on the development of Cyberinfrastructure (CI) to support the advancement of research, the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is among the national leaders with large network pathways and Science DMZ resources. The need for leadership and technical support to extend these CI resources to the greater community is the next challenge. Consequently, UNH is building a CI Engineer as a permanent human resource to assist in the shift of responsibility from research individuals to the CI community services that extend the CI benefits campus-wide. The CI Engineer is a focused key technical leader to champion the UNH CI Plan and encourage the integration of CI resources with UNH researchers, academics and administrators. With a growing need to expand CI resources for collaboration on multi-party projects, the CI Engineer is defining the vision, model, and approach through the UNH CI Plan. Researchers see the CI Engineer as a technical resource that can be annexed to their own research team rather than have to duplicate the CI resources and personnel that exist institutionally. Beyond the technical expertise, the CI Engineer participates in statewide, regional and national CI organizations, including the New England Research and Education Network (NEREN), the Northern Crossroads (NoX) and Internet2. The CI Engineer maintains the pulse of the CI activity on the UNH campus, reporting to the community on the efforts achieved annually and reflecting back to the community the opportunities for future investment that will benefit all.</AbstractNarration>
