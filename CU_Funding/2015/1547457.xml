    <AbstractNarration>Modern scientific experiments have outgrown the capacity of a single lab. &lt;br/&gt;They require the storage and processing power of a datacenter, involve &lt;br/&gt;cross-institutional access to sensitive data, and span multiple domains of &lt;br/&gt;administrative trust. In such a setting, security is fragile. In the face of &lt;br/&gt;steady growth of sophisticated cyber-attack tools, modern server and desktop &lt;br/&gt;machines are fundamentally insecure. Over a hundred critical &lt;br/&gt;vulnerabilities that allow unrestricted access to the entire system are &lt;br/&gt;discovered in the Linux kernel each year. Lacking flexibility to express &lt;br/&gt;fine-grained access control policies, modern networks often give vulnerable &lt;br/&gt;hosts excessive or even unrestricted connectivity to the rest of the network. &lt;br/&gt;An exploit of any host enables attackers to explore, exploit and take control &lt;br/&gt;over an entire cyber facility. Without support from the network, scientific &lt;br/&gt;facilities will remain vulnerable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CapNet is a network architecture that enables secure, least privilege &lt;br/&gt;collaboration in the cross-institutional environment of a modern research &lt;br/&gt;facility. Building on the principles of capability access control, this &lt;br/&gt;research develops key elements needed to secure a network of a modern &lt;br/&gt;scientific infrastructure: 1) "off by default" behavior, with connectivity &lt;br/&gt;granted on as-needed basis; 2) mechanisms for decentralized, &lt;br/&gt;application-driven dynamic management of connectivity; and 3) a formal &lt;br/&gt;foundation enabling secure collaboration of fine-grained, dynamic, &lt;br/&gt;multi-institutional principals. The basis for CapNet's design is strong &lt;br/&gt;isolation of network activities with the mechanisms of software defined &lt;br/&gt;networks (SDN) and mediation of all communication between network hosts by &lt;br/&gt;a capability access control model. CapNet represents the network as an access &lt;br/&gt;control graph. Nodes are network hosts, edges (or "capabilities") are &lt;br/&gt;pointers to other hosts allowing communication and further exchange of rights. &lt;br/&gt;By controlling the initial distribution of capabilities and their flow, CapNet &lt;br/&gt;governs network interactions through fine-grained, application-driven policies &lt;br/&gt;that enable safe collaboration among multiple institutions and third-party &lt;br/&gt;services. Finally, while taking a holistic approach to network access control, &lt;br/&gt;CapNet remains practical: it retains compatibility with unmodified network &lt;br/&gt;network stacks, integrates with existing datacenter and cloud management &lt;br/&gt;stacks, enables incremental adoption, and is fast and scalable.</AbstractNarration>
