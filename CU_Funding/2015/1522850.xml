    <AbstractNarration>A conference on classical and quantum hyperbolic geometry and topology will be held at the Universite Paris-Sud (Orsay) from July 6 to July 10, 2015. The aim of the conference is to bring together experts from the disparate fields which are connected to low-dimensional topology and to foster interactions among them as well as with junior mathematicians in those fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is concerned with the interface of several fields:&lt;br/&gt;(1) low-dimensional topology;&lt;br/&gt;(2) geometric structures on manifolds, particularly hyperbolic geometry;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Teichmuller theory --- classical, quantum, and higher;&lt;br/&gt;(4) representation theory; and&lt;br/&gt;(5) topological quantum field theory (TQFT) and quantum groups.&lt;br/&gt;The last four decades have revealed many deep connections among these subjects. The aim of this conference is to further explore and strengthen these connections by bringing together a very distinguished group of researchers, both from the US and Europe, who are working in or at the interface of these subjects. We expect that strong research talks at the conference will help encourage the researchers working in these disparate subjects to explore common ground and develop new avenues of research. We also expect that the conference will expose graduate students and early career mathematicians to the important developments in these areas.
