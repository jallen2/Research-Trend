    <AbstractNarration>A matrix group is a set of invertible square matrices that contains all products and inverses of its members. Representation theory is a branch of algebra concerned with studying symmetries, especially symmetries arising from matrix groups. Modular representation theory is the branch of representation theory concerned with matrix groups whose entries come from a finite field. It has deep connections with number theory, combinatorics, and geometry. This research project aims to make advances in modular representation theory using geometric methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project aims to make advances in the representation theory of algebraic groups over a field of positive characteristic via the philosophy of local geometric Langlands duality. Specifically, the PI hopes to establish a collection of derived equivalences in positive characteristic modeled on characteristic zero results. This work will lead to explicit connections between between the following notions: (i) modular representations of algebraic groups; (ii) modular perverse sheaves and parity sheaves on the affine Grassmannian and the affine flag variety; and (iii) the phenomena of Koszul and Q-Koszul duality.</AbstractNarration>
