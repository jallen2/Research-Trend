    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of 100 undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral students at the 42nd Annual National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) conference, held in Orlando, FL on September 21 - 26, 2015. Selected participants are from underrepresented minority groups in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields who come from majority institutions, Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCUs), and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides opportunities for participants to engage in four major areas of focus: 1) technical and professional development; 2) networking and mentorship opportunities with professionals working in STEM fields; 3) exposure to high-profile minority role models in STEM; and 4) career advancement opportunities. Participants present their original research to a forum composed of industry, government, and academic peers while meeting colleagues from other HBCU, MSI, and majority institutions to develop research collaborations and to explore opportunities to pursue graduate degrees in the chemistry or chemical engineering disciplines. These opportunities may not only impact these specific participating individuals, but also benefit the larger community of STEM field practitioners as these activities are useful in recruiting and retaining individuals from underrepresented talent pools. NOBCChE seeks to increase the number of minorities in the STEM workforce. Results of this activity are submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals so that the indentified best practices can be more widely adopted.</AbstractNarration>
