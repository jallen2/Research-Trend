    <AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support the eighth annual Inter-Science of Learning Centers (i-SLC) Conference, organized by the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows of the 6 Science of Learning Centers (SLCs). This event has served as a vital venue for exchanging research findings across the SLCs, sharing resources and stimulating career development opportunities for Center trainees. This highly productive activity has resulted in cross-center collaborations, including cross-center student exchanges for additional training in other laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, the conference will be hosted by the NSF-funded Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center (TDLC) in San Diego, CA on May 31-June 2, 2015. The theme is "Research and Innovation: the intersection with Education ". Requested funds will be used to pay for conference facilities at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and to cover participants' costs of attending, including travel and per diem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2015 Conference will build upon the previous Conferences to facilitate intra-center and cross-Center collaborative through oral/signed presentations in symposia and methodology workshops, alumni panels, alumni presentations and the creation of an onllne research network which connects past, present and future SLC trainees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The i-SLC has been instrumental in catalyzing a large and robust network of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who will provide a firm foundation on which the future of Science of Learning will build upon, as it evolves into a full-bodied, interdisciplinary research field.</AbstractNarration>
