    <AbstractNarration>___________&lt;br/&gt;This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Christine Sprunger is "Belowground carbon: improving soil health in low carbon soils." The host institution for this fellowship is the Earth Institute at Columbia University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Cheryl Palm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increases in soil carbon can lead to enhanced soil structure, biological diversity, and nutrient retention, all of which lead to healthier soils and increased crop production for agriculture. Soils also store large amounts of carbon, meaning that agriculture can help mitigate elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by retaining carbon in the soil. However, the effect of plant roots, nutrient inputs and soil moisture on soil carbon is not well understood. Identifying the mechanisms that control soil carbon is especially important in many agricultural areas, for example, Sub Saharan Africa, where soil carbon levels are consistently inadequate, leading to soil erosion and food insecurity. The fellowship research draws on biogeochemistry and social science disciplines to determine carbon dynamics in small-holder farms in Kenya and Tanzania as the study system. Specific objectives are to determine the influence of crop rotations and legume incorporation within maize based systems on root production, root carbon inputs, and soil carbon pools; measure the influence of nitrogen fertilizer on plant biomass allocation, root productivity, and soil carbon pools in tropical soils; and determine the influence of rainfall variability on soil carbon in agriculture and forest ecosystems differing in soil fertility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include enhancing skills in both biogeochemistry and social science and the conduct of interdisciplinary and international research. To broaden participation in biology, the Fellow serves as a mentor and role model in the Summer Research Program at Columbia University, which specifically exposes underrepresented college students to graduate level independent research projects.</AbstractNarration>
