    <AbstractNarration>In this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site, funded by the Chemistry REU Program at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense's (DOD's) Awards to Stimulate and Support Undergraduate Research Experiences (ASSURE) Program, Professor Christine K. Luscombe at the University of Washington aims to accelerate the adoption of a clean energy future by training a new generation of scientists. This site has a focus on recruiting veterans and Native Americans. To this end, the Clean Energy to Bridge (CEBR) REU leverages strong relationships with community colleges, which are important pipelines for veteran and URM students, to recruit participants. CEBR engages six Pioneer students (freshmen at community colleges) and up to three community college instructors in a short 4-week Pioneer summer, while six Bridge students (sophomores at community colleges) participate in a full 10-week Bridge summer. The pioneer student pathway focuses on early stage students where research experience can have a career altering impact. The Bridge program consists of a 10-week research experience supplemented with professional development classes. The goal of the bridge summer program exposes students to research, but also eases the transition from community colleges to a 4-year schools by allowing them to arrive early on campus before the academic year starts. By having a two summer-long programs with community college instructor involvement, CEBR increases student recruitment and the retention of Native Americans and veterans in the science fields, specifically in the clean energy field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The energy sector is one of the fastest-growing components of the world economy. Continuing demand for energy and the creation of renewable energy resources necessitates the development of new materials and device technologies. With this in mind, the CEBR REU program is based around two main research areas: advanced materials for energy (AME) and energy systems and integration (ESI). Participants in the AME thrust focus on developing novel materials for solar energy conversion and electrical energy storage devices. The research includes organic and inorganic materials. The ESI thrust enables new energy technologies, such as solar energy production and massive battery storage. CEBR students work with ESI researchers to build innovative software and hardware tools that accelerate the integration of solar energy and electrical energy storage with the grid, enabling a scalable clean energy future. Students are exposed to activities spanning chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering.</AbstractNarration>
