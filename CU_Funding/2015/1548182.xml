    <AbstractNarration>Practitioners of the arts, humanities, and sciences all seek solutions to complex problems, suggesting that collaborations across these disciplines could yield new insights into societal challenges and needs. Deep cultural and practical divides limit these collaborations. This project will bring together ecologists, artists, musicians, neuroscientists, computer scientists, educators, and science communicators to design research using new visualization and sonification tools. Project goals are to stimulate creative thinking, to allow for advanced forms of pattern recognition, and to facilitate a diverse and cross-disciplinary approach to environmental research needs, questions, and results. The project has the potential to expand significantly the participation of diverse cultural, ethnic, and economic groups in scientific research by allowing these groups to co-develop research questions at the outset. Inclusion of educators and science communicators will provide opportunities for students and the public to interact with high frequency environmental data in novel ways, allowing them new ways to comprehend complex data and processes. These new ways of experiencing complex natural phenomena may be particularly beneficial for individuals who have special learning needs, who learn better visually or acoustically, or who are disaffected by traditional numerical presentations of data and results. The project is risky, but promises very high rewards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goal of this project is to encode high-volume and high-frequency ecological data in new ways in order to discover underlying patterns and processes. Online digital visualization and sonification tools will be developed to display multi-dimensional real-time ecological data generated from environmental sensor arrays at two Long Term Ecological Research sites. A novel partnership with neuroscientists will explore how stimulation of different neural circuitry in the human brain allows large datasets to be understood, perhaps in new ways. A current visualization tool, Waterviz, will be re-designed in collaboration with artists, neuroscientists, and computer scientists. Hydrologic data captured with sensors will drive a computer model that calculates all components of a water cycle in real time. These data in turn will drive artistic and musical simulations of the water cycle. The models will be used to test hypotheses that multi-sensory experiences simultaneously engage reasoning, visual, and acoustical brain centers such that large-scale patterns and processes are easier to apprehend; that neurological tools can provide a mechanistic understanding of improved comprehension; and that the engagement of artists directly in the research will stimulate new ideas and insights into complex problems. External evaluation of the project will determine whether artists and scientists are equitably engaged, whether new relationships result, and whether this process stimulates new ideas and insights.</AbstractNarration>
