    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in development of a new class of amorphous metal alloys that could benefit society as a whole. Theoretical calculations have shown that 90% weight reduction of components can be achieved with Iron-based amorphous and nano-composite alloys. By reducing the weight of components in automotive and aerospace, significant fuel savings can be achieved. Fuel savings will result in both reduced cost as well as reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. Another field of application for amorphous ferromagnetic alloys is electromagnetic cores in electrical motors, transformers and filters. Ferromagnetic amorphous alloys allows for reduced energy losses in these applications by up to 80%, which correspond globally to 50 Million tons of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants per year or 1/10 of the nuclear power production per year in the US. Amorphous metal could also have big impact on healthcare. Amorphous metals could address extremely costly metallosis issues currently experienced by the medical implant industry due to recalls and lawsuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of metal based additive manufacturing (AM) of Iron-based amorphous metal components. AM processes for alloys with superior mechanical and/or magnetic properties will be developed, and increased scientific understanding of the material mechanisms achieved. While preliminary research show promising results for fabricating larger components with amorphous bulk properties, there are still issues that need to be resolved. To address these challenges, it is important that proper process parameters for forming dense, crack-free, material are established by extensive experimental work using both Electron Beam Melting and Direct Metal Laser Sintering technologies. To support the experimental work, phenomenological Finite Element (FE) models will be developed. The FE models will first be validated through initial experiments and then be used to make informed choices regarding process parameters such as building temperature, part orientation and scanning strategy.</AbstractNarration>
