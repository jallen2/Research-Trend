    <AbstractNarration>Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines play an increasingly important role in the economic prosperity and civic dialog of the United States. The geosciences make fundamental contributions that underpin a number of societally-relevant issues, including energy and natural resource development, sustainability, and mitigation of natural hazards. This project is addressing an anticipated shortfall in the number of geoscientists in the STEM workforce, as well as increasing STEM literacy in the populace through improving geoscience teacher training in Nebraska. Given the diverse populations available in this EPSCoR-eligible state, the project is especially focused on engaging, recruiting, and retaining students from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, in order to broaden participation of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM education and career paths. Collaboration with smaller colleges in the region that do not have teacher-education programs in geoscience education is building capacity among the STEM teaching community in the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in collaboration with Concordia University, Midland University, Peru State College, Creighton University, and the Lincoln Public Schools, among other institutions, is undertaking a suite of activities aimed at improving geoscience student recruitment, retention, and career readiness, including undergraduate students who are pursuing careers as geoscience teachers. An immmersive 16-day inquiry-based geology field course for pre-service teachers from colleges that do not offer Earth Science endorsements provides authentic scientific experience and training. A summer bridge program for students between high school and freshman year, which includes both a shorter field-based activity and on-campus activities, exposes students at critical transition points in their education pathway to career opportunities in the geosciences. Targeted recruitment at public schools that have highly diverse student enrollments is supporting efforts to increase diversity in the geosciences and related STEM disciplines. Incoming freshman are recruited into the Geoscience Learning Community, which provides community support, mentoring, and networking opportunities. Students in the learning community are recruited and supported as "Learning Assistants" who help instruct introductory geoscience classes and engage as experts with other students; this activity has been adapted from a successful model established at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Support for students to engage in research and internship projects and professional development is geared towared preparing students for a range of STEM careers, including teaching. The project is also developing a toolkit of effective inquiry-based and discovery-learning teaching practices.</AbstractNarration>
