    <AbstractNarration>The aim of this study is to assess uncertainties in climate predictions due to intrinsic ocean variability, as well as explore modes of ocean variability that may feedback on the atmosphere. The analyses that will be conducted are essential for advancing our understanding of climate predictability, and for clarifying what forms of ocean dynamics coupled climate models must accurately capture to address the questions of decadal-scale climate variability. The findings will be disseminated in publications and in various meetings, workshops, summer schools as well as via the internet. International connections between Florida State University and European scientists will be strengthened. The project will support a young researcher and a graduate student. The investigators will also work with existing outreach and education programs at the University and state level to support K-12 science teachers with materials that assist them in teaching to the Florida Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad objective of this study is to dissect North Atlantic variability in the 1-to-10 year range with respect to its dynamics and origins. This variability will be simulated using a high-resolution ocean general circulation model of the North Atlantic and analyzed to categorize the variability as forced or intrinsic, and local or remote in origin. The contributions of these various kinds of variability to well-known observational indices, like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, will be estimated. This analysis using novel methods that emphasize potential vorticity diagnostics, ensemble averaging and data reduction, will provide quantitative information on the contribution of intrinsic variability to such critical measures of the ocean climate as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the mass transport of the Gulf Stream. The dynamics supporting the intrinsic variability will be diagnosed, and the projection of subsurface variability onto the surface, where the bulk of ocean observations are currently obtained, will be computed. Additionally, the extent to which remote mesoscale dynamics influence North Atlantic variability will be assessed; doing so will help understand the behavior of planned classes of eddy-permitting Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models.</AbstractNarration>
