    <AbstractNarration>1535824&lt;br/&gt;Wong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of two sample introduction systems, a Gas Bench II inlet and Hydrogen Cup, that will be mated to an extant gas source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) in Department of Earth and Environmental Science (EES) at Boston College (BC). The SIRMS and peripherals will support the research programs of two early career, tenure-track faculty whose research focuses on questions of past climate and require large numbers of isotopic analyses (several hundred, to a few thousand per study). Support will enable full utilization of analytical equipment that is at present underutilized as sample introduction equipment that allows for high throughput stable isotopic analysis to support high resolution paleoclimate studies is presently lacking. Specific research to be supported with the requested SIRMS includes studies of stable isotopic records of Holocene climate dynamics as recorded in speleothem carbonate from low and mid latitudes caves in the Americas to study regional climate dynamics and its relationship to ocean-atmospheric dynamic changes over decadal to millennial time scales and stable isotopic studies of marine sediments to investigate the linkages between global climate, ice sheet dynamics and Earth system sensitivity to greenhouse-gas forcing over longer time scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigator research that will be fostered by this equipment grant has implications for understanding the relationship between climate dynamics and ecosystem stability, the carbon cycle and sea level dynamics. The investigators will engage undergraduate and graduate students in experiential learning in methods of stable isotope geochemistry and applications to paleoenvironmental research. This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and may advance the national prosperity and welfare through advancing knowledge of Earth system climate dynamics and its forcing and feedbacks with the global and regional water cycles as well training students in analytical methods that are widely used in both academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
