    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this work is to speed-up the execution of the&lt;br/&gt;most popular programming languages of the internet, namely Scripting Languages&lt;br/&gt;such as JavaScript and Python. These languages are easy to use, because&lt;br/&gt;they do not require declaring all the variables. However, this makes them very&lt;br/&gt;hard to compile efficiently. In this work, the principal investigator will design&lt;br/&gt;processor hardware that is specifically equipped to help speed-up&lt;br/&gt;these languages. Given the importance of these languages for&lt;br/&gt;web development, effective techniques to speed-up their execution&lt;br/&gt;are fundamental for the continued development of the&lt;br/&gt;web infrastructure. Such development is crucial to our&lt;br/&gt;society's efficiency, competitiveness, and wellbeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will focus on several techniques.&lt;br/&gt;One of them is using speculation support to execute the most likely&lt;br/&gt;execution path of the codes, and undo the execution if another path&lt;br/&gt;was taken instead. The other technique is prediction, to predict which&lt;br/&gt;parts of the code will be executed. Finally, the third technique is reuse, where the&lt;br/&gt;processor will keep enough state in its structures to reuse&lt;br/&gt;it across invocations of the same functions.</AbstractNarration>
