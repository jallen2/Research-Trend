    <AbstractNarration>The proposal is for hosting the Second Polar Data Forum (PDF II) in Waterloo, Canada on October 2015. The PDF II will be building on the success of the first Polar Data Forum (PDF I) held in Tokyo, Japan, October 2013. The goal of the PDF II is to refine relevant themes and priorities and establish actions to address the target issues. This includes meeting the needs of society and science through promotion of open data and effective data stewardship, establishing sharing and interoperability of data at a variety of levels, developing trusted data management systems, and ensuring long-term data preservation. The workshop will provide a critically important venue for U.S.-based and funded polar data initiatives and to showcase polar data management systems funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other U.S. agencies, while learning from global partners and working collaboratively to continue developing an international vision and action plan. Beside providing a contribution to managing polar data on a global scale, making data available to future generations, the workshop will involve young researchers and underrepresented groups through the engagement of Indigenous organizations to ensure participation of Indigenous people of the Arctic. Moreover, a data management training workshop targeted at the needs of graduate students and researchers is being planned, co-organized by APECS and the ArcticNet Student Association.</AbstractNarration>
