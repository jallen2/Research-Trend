    <AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will enhance the Nation's knowledge of the impact of providing relevant STEM instruction on recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. For those students entering the workforce directly from the college, it is important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College in New Town, ND will develop a new AS degree in Sustainable Energy Technologies that incorporates culturally relevant concepts and uses constructivist methods. Additional work will be done to address recruitment and retention in STEM, expand undergraduate research opportunities in the energy field, and engage the community. This project addresses the need for a larger STEM-educated workforce in the energy field on the Fort Berthold reservation and in the state of North Dakota by expanding the STEM instructional capacity of a tribal college.</AbstractNarration>
