    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Robert E. Kambic is "How the avian neck got its twist: linking joint mobility and mechanics in an evolutionary context." The host institution for this fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientists are Stephanie E. Pierce and Andrew A. Biewener. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vertebrate joints are a result of complex interactions among tissues such as bone, ligament, and muscle. Current understanding of how these interactions result in the morphology and mobility observed at a joint is quite limited, particularly in non-humans. The vertebral column provides a compelling system to investigate joint function since it is under-studied and common to all vertebrates and has undergone significant evolution in anatomy and function. The avian neck is a fascinating example of the adaptable vertebral column given the innate ability of birds to twist their necks into a variety of unusual poses. The interdisciplinary research proposed here combines techniques from biology and paleontology to examine the evolution of this flexible neck by determining how soft tissues (muscle, ligament) and hard tissues (bone) contribute to neck joint mobility and how the mobile neck of birds evolved from non-avian theropod dinosaurs to birds. The paleontological and ornithological collections at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard are the source of data for the study and in turn will be enhanced with additional specimens and data generated during the research. Further, results promise to provide significant insights into the evolution of a complex musculoskeletal system with a focus on the roles of hard and soft tissue and the tradeoff between mobility and leverage for muscles crossing joints. Other outcomes include the timing of evolving novelties and validation of models of extinct species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives for the fellowship include learning to integrate experimental biological techniques with collections-based paleontological techniques, learning musculoskeletal computer modeling, and developing professional and museum skills as career advancement activities. Working with the Harvard Museum of Natural History, the Fellow aims to enhance science, technology, engineering, and math teacher professional development, facilitate public engagement with science, and increase understanding of science through talks to professional development programs for science teachers, adult classes open to the public on the evolution of dinosaurs and birds, and shared content for other museum programs including public outreach days and summer classes for K-8 students. The Fellow mentors undergraduate and graduate student as well as delivering a lecture on bird evolution in an upper-level undergraduate paleontology course.</AbstractNarration>
