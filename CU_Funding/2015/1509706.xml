    <AbstractNarration>Infrared Nanowire Heterostructures: Fundamentals and Emerging Detector Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This work is funded under the area of Grant Opportunties for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI). This project is to investigate the application of a class of infrared active semiconductor nanowire heterostructures for creation of unique infrared imaging detectors with enhanced sensitivity. This project is a collaboration between the basic science and engineering faculty and students at the University of Cincinnati and Australian National University with the research staff at L-3/Cincinnati Electronics which specializes in the design and manufacture of infrared detectors. These nanostructures may provide the basis for unique infrared detectors and infrared imaging systems spanning a wide wavelength range from 1.5 microns to 10 microns. The overarching goal of this research is to develop and understand new nanowire based materials which will allow broad tunability and high sensitivity over the mid-wave IR and thus provide a foundation to fabricate unique IR detectors and arrays. This proposal is strongly enhanced by an active collaboration among L3/Cincinnati Electronics, with experience in effective design, characterization and manufacture of complex infrared imaging systems, the world-class nanowire growth group at Australian National University, and the device and optical Physics group at the University of Cincinnati. Students and faculty at the academic institutions will be exposed to the dynamics and complexities involved in applied research at a corporate research facility, while the staff at L-3/Cincinnati Electronics will be exposed to the basic science and technological research at an academic institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project is to investigate the basic physics of a newly grown class of semiconductor nanowire heterostructures and their emerging applications as unique infrared detectors spanning the range from 1.5 microns to 10 microns. Such nanostructures have the potential to substantially enhance the capabilities of infrared focal plane arrays for imaging since the quasi one-dimensional geometry opens up new ways to tune the wavefunctions and the band gaps in these materials. This proposal is strongly enhanced by an active collaboration between L3/Cincinnati Electronics, with experience in effective design and manufacture of complex infrared imaging systems, the world-class nanowire growth group at Australian National University, and the research group at UC which has substantial experience in the imaging and spectroscopy of single semiconductor nanowires. The research described in this proposal is made compelling by two new developments: (1) the newly developed capability to grow III-Sb and InAs nanowires and nanowire heterostructures of very high quality, and (2) the very recent confirmation in our laboratories that it is possible to make single nanowire dynamical measurements of photoexcited carrier recombinations and relaxation with very high sensitivity out into the infrared. The specific goals of this research are to measure the band structure and dynamics in Zincblende GaAsSb, InAsSb and InGaAs ternary alloy heterostructures. This ability to tune the band structure to design new nanostructures will enable the design of new extremely sensitive detectors in the infrared. These nanostructures will be combined so as to make sensitive 1D and 2D IR detector arrays. Students and faculty at the academic institutions will be exposed to the dynamics and complexities involved in applied research at a corporate research facility, while the staff at L-3/Cincinnati Electronics will be exposed to the basic science and technological research at an academic institution.</AbstractNarration>
