    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of 8 doctoral students in the disciplines of computer science, informatics and library and information science in the Doctoral Consortium (June 21, 2015) of the 2015 ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2015), to be held in Knoxville, TN, June 21-25, 2015 (http://www.jcdl2015.org). The selected PhD students will be in the early stages of their dissertation work and will include several international students in order to provide breadth in exchanging ideas. The goal of the consortium is to help these students develop their dissertation proposals and research plans through feedback and guidance from prominent professors and experienced practitioners from the field of digital library research and development. The JCDL Doctoral Consortium provides a forum for Ph.D. students to interact with major figures in the digital library community. These leaders, who come from all over the world, exemplify a broad set of expertise, diversity of perspectives, and wealth of knowledge. The consortium provides students with an opportunity to have broad audience and interact intellectually with professionals who would otherwise be difficult to meet with. Participating students will be selected on the basis of a paper describing their research. At the consortium, participants will have approximately 40 minutes to present their research plans and receive feedback from the panel. After the consortium the students will revise their papers based on the consortium's feedback and then they will be published in the IEEE Technical Committee on Digital Libraries publication "TCDL Bulletin" (http://www.ieee-tcdl.org/mediawiki/TCDL/index.php/IEEE-TCDL).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The JCDL 2015 Doctoral Consortium will expose promising PhD students to a larger community, extend their opportunities for intellectual engagement, and encourage scholarly discourse and networking among new entrants into the field. An intended outcome of the workshop is to help shape ongoing and future teaching, research, and development projects in the field of digital libraries by providing wider exposure for the students to innovative ideas which may generate new research questions in the future, and to foster a sense of community among these young researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Funded participants will be provided with complimentary attendance at the main JCDL meeting to further strengthen the building of their personal research networks and collaborations. The organizers will also take special steps to solicit participation from institutions with underrepresented groups to extend the potential benefits and broaden the horizon of expertise in the field.</AbstractNarration>
