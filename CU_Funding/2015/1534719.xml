    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of electronic devices lies silicon, a semiconductor material that can be made&lt;br/&gt;pure enough for high performance and is amenable to mass production. While such&lt;br/&gt;circuitry is continually improving, silicon is unable to exhibit quantum phenomena&lt;br/&gt;required for complete solutions in weather prediction, genomics, and secure encryption.&lt;br/&gt;A new class of materials, the so-called topological insulators, holds the promise to&lt;br/&gt;realize such phenomena and revolutionize computing. Topological insulators are, in&lt;br/&gt;theory, non-metallic in the interior of the material but behave like a metal at the surface.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the quantum character of these metallic electrons can be switched, which is&lt;br/&gt;the basic information processing function. While known topological insulators&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate the metallic surface state, these materials have not been made pure enough&lt;br/&gt;for incorporating into electronic devices. Specifically, they are not yet insulating in the&lt;br/&gt;interior. This project will seek to find new topological insulators and to engineer them to&lt;br/&gt;levels of purity needed for an insulating interior and satisfy the performance demands of&lt;br/&gt;electronic circuits. The project will impact the electronics industry as well as train&lt;br/&gt;graduates skilled in the computational and experimental techniques of this new class of&lt;br/&gt;materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to create topological insulator materials that are pure enough in&lt;br/&gt;the bulk to exhibit true insulating behavior. Topological insulators are found among&lt;br/&gt;high-Z atom containing semiconductors with band gaps small enough that the spin-orbit&lt;br/&gt;coupling related to the large Z-number can invert the conduction and valence band.&lt;br/&gt;These materials must also possess spatial inversion symmetry for the relevant orbitals.&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore candidate materials classes among pseudo-binary and&lt;br/&gt;pyrochlore-related structures containing heavy metals such as Ir, Re, and Os. Materials&lt;br/&gt;synthesis by solid state chemistry techniques will be guided by simulations based on&lt;br/&gt;density functional theory. Promising candidate materials will be synthesized in single&lt;br/&gt;crystal form by appropriate methods including vapor transport, zone refinement, and&lt;br/&gt;growth from flux. Crystalline specimens will be studied with angle resolved&lt;br/&gt;photoemission spectroscopy and conventional charge transport techniques. Prototype&lt;br/&gt;transistor devices will be fabricated on a smaller subset of these systems. The results at&lt;br/&gt;each measurement stage will be fed back to the theory and synthesis efforts.</AbstractNarration>
