    <AbstractNarration>To test software, developers must perform two activities: test&lt;br/&gt;creation and test maintenance. The first activity, test creation,&lt;br/&gt;consists of developing and implementing a test suite---the set of&lt;br/&gt;tests that will be used to evaluate the software. The second&lt;br/&gt;activity, test maintenance, consists of both understanding existing&lt;br/&gt;test cases and evolving them in response to changes in the application&lt;br/&gt;that is being tested. Despite decades of work, both of these&lt;br/&gt;activities are still expensive and labor-intensive. In this project,&lt;br/&gt;we will address the need for useful developer support for both test&lt;br/&gt;creation and test maintenance by investigating and building&lt;br/&gt;cooperative approaches where automated tools and developers work&lt;br/&gt;together, each focusing on their respective strengths. Improving the&lt;br/&gt;efficiency and effectiveness of both testing activities will be&lt;br/&gt;beneficial in reducing the overall cost of software development and,&lt;br/&gt;at the same time, improving software quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the state of the art by (1) innovating&lt;br/&gt;in the areas of program analysis and natural-language program analysis&lt;br/&gt;and (2) synergistically integrating these two strands of innovations.&lt;br/&gt;First, the PIs will investigate cooperative approaches for generating unit&lt;br/&gt;tests based on developer intent to save developer's time and to lower&lt;br/&gt;the cognitive barrier for writing tests by automating the tedious&lt;br/&gt;aspects of test creation. Second, the PIs will investigate techniques for&lt;br/&gt;improving the comprehensibility of existing tests by automatically&lt;br/&gt;generating various forms of test documentation including descriptive&lt;br/&gt;test method names and both summary and explanatory comments. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;the PIs will quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate and refine the newly&lt;br/&gt;developed techniques to ensure that they are both useful and&lt;br/&gt;effective. The tools and experimental infrastructure developed within&lt;br/&gt;the project will be released, which will let researchers and&lt;br/&gt;practitioners build on the project's results.</AbstractNarration>
