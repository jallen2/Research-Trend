    <AbstractNarration>Nearly half of total annual construction costs are related to repair, replacement, and maintenance of existing infrastructure that have been deteriorated or damaged by environmental stress, structural loading, or other effects. The durability issues of structures can lead to a significantly higher life-cycle cost in comparison to the initial construction cost. The deficiencies of conventional concrete and subsequent impacts of the environment calls for a more durable material that will last longer under environmental stress, thereby contributing to the conservation of natural resources and the protection of ecosystem. Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (UHP-FRC) is the next generation of concrete material, which is six times stronger than conventional concrete, highly damage tolerant, fully ductile, and free of cracks under normal loadings. The very high compressive strength of UHP-FRC comes from its micro-mechanical design by the dense particle packing concept. The addition of discrete high-strength steel fibers considerably enhances its ductility and toughness. UHP-FRC is a green concrete, environmentally friendly, and has the ability to create a durable infrastructure that is resilient and sustainable for the future of our country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will accelerate the introduction of UHP-FRC to potential areas of design and construction in need of a futuristic material that allows sustainability, workability, strength, durability, and resilience. The potential economic impact in construction will be evidently clear with UHP-FRC, because the strength and ductility of the UHP-FRC product will reduce the cost of reinforcement placement and reinforcement materials. This material will impact the markets in challenging architectural projects and constructability. This new technology will also reduce cost in repairs and maintenance by approximately 25% in comparison with conventional concrete. UHP-FRC has board applications in blast/impact/earthquake resistant structures, challenging architectural members, bridges and highways, railroads, and airport runways.</AbstractNarration>
