    <AbstractNarration>This project by the Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM) focuses on fostering research collaborations and establishing research networks for women mathematicians in the early to mid-stages of their careers. Research collaborations have become an increasingly essential part of a successful career in mathematics. In theoretical sciences, unlike laboratory sciences, there is no structure in which collaborations and mentor relationships naturally arise. It is thus critical that women, beginning early in their career, attend research conferences in their area of specialization, interact productively with other participants, and have access to research-based networks. To facilitate such networks, AWM plans to organize a series of conferences and workshops aimed at fostering research collaborations and building sustainable networks. These networks will be established at Research Collaboration Conferences for Women (RCCWs), which are week-long conferences, held at mathematics institutes, where junior and senior women come together to work on pre-defined research problems. AWM will expand the number and scope of the RCCWs and organize a series of follow-up events to help sustain and grow the resulting networks. Expected outcomes of this project include more invitations to speak at conferences, more collaborative research, a higher level of productivity for the women involved, and decreased attrition. The networks created by this project will not be static and will welcome new researchers as they enter the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies conducted through this project will focus on understanding the effectiveness of research collaboration networks in helping to advance women's research careers to the highest levels of the profession. By promoting research collaborations and forming networks of women with related research interests, the proposed workshops will help both senior and junior women increase their visibility in and contributions to the research community. This project will also add to our understanding of the impact of networks and mentor relationships based on shared research interests in addition to shared demographic characteristics. The research and interactive seminars designed for this project have the potential to become models for future events of this kind and for other theoretical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF ADVANCE Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Networks (PLAN) program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers. PLAN projects also contribute to the knowledge base on gender equity in STEM academic careers.</AbstractNarration>
