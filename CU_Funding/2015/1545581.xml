    <AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Grants program of the Astronomical Sciences Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, by the Aeronomy program of the Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences Division in the Geosciences Directorate, and by the Office of Integrative Activities. The aim of this project is to bridge the gaps that separate scientific communities studying the complex atmospheres of Earth, other solar system planets, and planets around other stars ("exoplanets"). These different systems are united by the same physics and chemistry used by geo-scientists at Earth and by astronomers investigating other planets in our solar system and throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Common themes need common approaches, and results at one location can validate less certain findings elsewhere. This program will create pathways of communication that utilize resources more effectively, promote common modes of data analysis, create all-purpose ionospheric models, and foster student training that removes discipline barriers. The impact of ionospheric disturbances due to Space Weather experienced at Earth (e.g., GPS degradations) will enable parallel studies for Mars, where multiple satellites need reliable communication and navigation for land-based rovers and, ultimately, human exploration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the Sun's ultraviolet and x-ray light is the same for all of our planets, the gases present at each location are different, and this leads to a vast set of ions and electrons that comprise the ionosphere at each planet in our Solar System. Even more compartmentalized are studies of ionospheres at planets around other stars. The scientific communities that study them (geophysicists and astronomers) are isolated from each other - programmatically at funding agencies and at professional meetings and societies. This lack of cross-fertilization impedes progress. This award focuses upon the treatment of fundamental atmospheric and space plasma processes as universal - rather than as unique, planet-by-planet, phenomena. The team will develop the first comprehensive archive to host all of the parameters necessary to conduct comparative studies of ionospheres throughout the solar system and beyond, and provide a versatile user-friendly model to do so. The research tools developed will offer many opportunities to resolve important issues in one discipline by applying knowledge and expertise found in other disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
