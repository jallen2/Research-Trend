    <AbstractNarration>In an effort to address the national need to improve student learning in chemistry, this IUSE: EHR project will adapt the Emporium Learning model, which has led to increased retention for students through early mathematics courses and first-year chemistry courses. This pedagogy replaces the traditional classroom with a learning center featuring interactive software and on-site, personalized assistance from instructors. The project will expand on a pilot study that resulted in higher grades in the first semester of general chemistry for Emporium students (40% made a grade of A) compared to students in traditional courses (5% made a grade of A) at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&amp;T). The impact of this curriculum will also be studied at North Carolina Central University, another Historically Black institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an initial assessment, the PI team will identify core concepts and algorithmic skills in general chemistry that each student must master. The Emporium students will then be provided with the results of this assessment. During class time they will use an online system to consider examples and do practice problems in modules covering topics that they have not mastered, with immediate instructor feedback. This project will investigate whether or not the Emporium model will improve students' deeper learning in gateway chemistry courses. Student in Emporium courses and in traditional courses will take common exams, including standardized pre-and post-course tests, and provide feedback through surveys. Formative evaluation will serve to uncover unexpected barriers and identify changes and improvements that should be implemented. Summative evaluation will provide information about whether the intended outcomes have been achieved and what, if any, unintended outcomes have resulted from the project. The results of this work, including learning materials will be disseminated through a digital newsletter to other Historically Black institutions and propagated through annual Emporium Learning faculty workshops hosted at NC A&amp;T. Results will also be presented at national and regional meetings of the American Chemical Society and be submitted to the Journal of Chemical Education.</AbstractNarration>
