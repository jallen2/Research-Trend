    <AbstractNarration>This study aims to understand gamete recognition (chemical cues used by male and female gametes to recognize and attract each other) as a mechanism of sexual reproduction, and how it acts to prevent reproductive events between different species. This work uses the domesticated tomato and its twelve diverse wild species relatives, which vary in many reproductive and functional traits. The project will first identify the chemical signal derived from the female gamete that attracts the male gamete within species. Second, it will characterize variation in this signal across species and connect this variation to previously observed reduced gamete attraction between species. In addition to understanding molecular mechanisms of normal and attenuated reproductive function, these data could aid in overcoming breeding barriers between domesticated tomato and its genetically diverse wild relatives. This project will include research by undergraduates from underrepresented groups and potential insights of agricultural importance for crop breeding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To identify the female gamete-derived chemoattractant and its specific tissue of origin, this project will use high depth nucleotide sequencing technologies (RNA-seq) for tissue specific expression analysis. It will assess molecular divergence of this signaling protein via variation in sequence and/or expression across 13 closely related species. These combined approaches will explicitly link patterns of molecular expression and DNA variation to functional divergence in reproductive behaviors. Although many studies have demonstrated that species show reduced sexual compatibility, the underlying molecular mechanisms are generally unknown. Together, this research will provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine the patterns and consequences of evolutionary changes in a reproductive molecule, including for the development of new species.</AbstractNarration>
