    <AbstractNarration>Over the past two decades, technological developments have made huge leaps in the speed, scale, and diversity of human communications. However, changes in human behavior occur at a much slower pace. In some cases, this has created a disconnection between how someone might think about communications media and the potential implications of utilizing those media. There is perhaps no better example of communication technologies that have created an array of misconceptions about usage than online social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook and Twitter. The confusion surrounding potential or real risks to privacy, the intended audience receiving communication through these sites, and the extent to which ?online? relationships are bleeding into relationships ?offline? have created a perfect storm where individuals are confused about how to portray themselves on these sites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this study is to evaluate how conceptions of privacy and social media audiences affect portrayals of identity on social media platforms. In this study I will test a series of hypotheses related to conceptions of privacy, intended audience, and the potential overlap of offline/online contexts using survey data collected directly from two of the largest social networking sites, Facebook and Twitter. Paid advertisements will be used to disseminate links to the survey, giving all active users an opportunity to respond to the survey. This method avoids the shortcomings of existing studies of this topic, which tend to use convenience-sampling methods. The broader impact of this study lies in providing a better understanding of how individuals are navigating relationships between offline and online contexts. Further, this study can provide new insight to organizations such as Facebook and Twitter to motivate changes that would be beneficial to social media users.</AbstractNarration>
