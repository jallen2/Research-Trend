    <AbstractNarration>The 2015 Workshop on Sensing and Analysis of High-Dimensional Data (SAHD) will take place&lt;br/&gt;July 27-29 at the Washington Duke Inn, which is adjacent to Duke University. This award offers financial support for selected students and post-doctoral fellows from the United States. The awardees are chosen based on financial need and ability to benefit from attending the workshop by learning from senior colleagues, presenting their own research in poster sessions, and expanding their network within their community and with potential collaborators outside their immediate discipline. Each award covers the local expenses of the participant (registration &amp; accommodation) and reasonable travel expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop brings together world-class researchers from the fields of mathematics, statistics, engineering, and computer science. The workshop is focused on the dissemination of recent results to a diverse set of researchers from a broad range of academic backgrounds. The workshop is also designed to encourage interaction between researchers via innovative whiteboard presentation sessions. These sessions foster new collaborations between researchers, which can lead to new breakthroughs and innovations of value to the scientific community. For students, the workshop provides an opportunity to present in posters or whiteboard sessions and to meet and interact with senior researchers.</AbstractNarration>
