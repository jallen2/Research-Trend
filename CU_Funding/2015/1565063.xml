    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) will provide scholarships for low-income, talented students with demonstrated financial need pursuing bachelor's degrees in science and mathematics. The Achieve Career Success in Science through Excellence (ACSScellence) program will provide scholarships for low-income undergraduate students and engage them in a program designed for the type of challenges low-income students will face while in college and after attaining their degree. Participants will be students who are enrolling as freshmen in UTEP or who are transferring. The program will improve student success and persistence to degree completion and will prepare scholars to become innovative STEM professionals. In addition to financial support, the program implements a multi-level mentoring system that includes internal and external mentors and student engagement in multiple curricular and co-curricular activities. Scholarships and support for academically strong students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic vitality of the Texas and the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include a study of the impact that specific program activities will have on student success. The unique demographics of UTEP's undergraduate student population (82.5% Hispanic) offers an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on low-income minorities currently underrepresented in STEM, and thus contribute to the design of effective strategies to narrow the underrepresentation gap. Student support activities include faculty mentoring and monthly mentoring meetings with STEM professionals external to the institution. Students will be enrolled in research-intensive courses and in a course to foster innovative thinking. Career development support includes participation in professional skills development workshops, external internships, and engagement in a research project through a capstone course. These activities will help the low-income students to successfully complete a STEM degree in a timely manner while developing the professional competencies and mindset required for successful careers in the 21st century science and technology workforce. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community and help to increase understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs.</AbstractNarration>
