    <AbstractNarration>Patients visiting health care providers have to repeat their medical history several times and have to wait for extended periods of time before they get service even if their records are stored in electronic medical records (EMR). In the case of elderly or disabled patients, or trauma patients; unless they have their medication written, it is hard to know about all their prescriptions and preexisting conditions. For patients facing trauma the medical care providers do not know the existing conditions, allergies of the patient or other underline critical conditions e.g. diabetes, cancer etc. In current EMR, it is difficult to grasp all the crucial issues in a short time (3-5 minutes. While most states require electronic communication of this data to their state repositories, the communication between the pre-hospital environment remains a significant challenge. There are currently no other standard solutions in the market that provide effective integration of existing data within the hospital environment and different institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team has developed the proof of concept of the Cyber Infrastructure Medical Visual Interface (CI-MVI) technology that would directly reduce the response time during clinical visit, and save lives of trauma patients. The Cyber Infrastructure Medical Visual Interface (CI-MVI) is a tool that enables health care providers with rapidly comprehensible, easy to read/access (via touch screen), crucial health parameters so that treatment plans could be designed in a timely manner. Repetitive processes, especially with regards to information collection have been identified and tasked to the cyber infrastructure, while providing an interactive graphical visual interface (GUI) to the health care providers. Ultimately the goal is to form an extensive cloud database that is accessible from any smart phone, I-Pad or computers. The CI-MVI will be further augmented with the capability of communicating with various health monitoring systems including Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to give the instantaneous state of health including locations outside of the USA since information is stored and accessed on a cloud based computing system.</AbstractNarration>
