    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project is a proof-of-concept project to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate an innovative lidar (laser illuminated detection and ranging) remote sensing technique, called the INtrapulse PHAse Modification Induced by Scattering (INPHAMIS) technique, as a commercially viable product for detailed mapping of shallow marine environments. The INPHAMIS technique is a breakthrough technology in that it provides unprecedented, centimeter resolution to map submerged objects in shallow waters, seamlessly identifies land-to-water transitions, obtains high precision water depth measurements, and provides precise description of bottom surface topography, all from remote distances above the water. Submerged objects are the number one cause of insurance claims in watercraft and the ability to detect them in advance would take care of both a human safety concern and an economic concern. Market research indicates this type of lidar system would contribute to growing markets in the mapping of lakes, shallow glacial melt-ponds, mosquito habitat, coastal erosion, and flood basins, and provide navigation information through inlets and channels that is crucial in these ever evolving environments. The end commercial goal is to develop a mobile lidar bathymetric unit to be used for local surveys either by boat, handheld, or possibly on dirigibles or unmanned aerial systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The INPHAMIS technique has the following unique features: 1-cm resolution in resolving objects in shallow waters, simple lidar components, noninvasive/non-contact, remote sensing technique based on a differential measurement, continuous observing over land-water transitions, and scalability to support several types of observing platforms. INPHAMIS is a disruptive technology in that it achieves high resolution subsurface mapping in water while reducing complexity and cost. Other remote sensing techniques are limited to waters deeper than a meter or more, leaving a large portion of near-shore waters unmapped. Existing lidar bathymetry systems are all quite similar in terms of intended use and capabilities and all involve large, expensive airborne systems. The INPHAMIS technique's unique features provide advantages in performance, costs, mass, power, volume, and adaptability that opens a new market in shallow-water water bathymetry by enabling the near-future development of a hand-held system for underwater mapping and subsurface target identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) interactions of laser light with different surface water conditions, submerged objects, and bottom surface types; 2) performance factors and definition of system and measurement specifications; 3) trade analysis of critical lidar components. A lab demonstrator of the technique will be advanced to evaluate laser light interactions with water bodies and objects in real environmental shallow-water conditions. This will also provide data on establishing performance factors and component testing. A faculty member, graduate student, and an undergraduate student will be involved providing a unique learning environment in entrepreneurship and technology translation, with support from industry partner, ASTRA LLC, and their staff and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages industry partner, ASTRA LLC, which will contribute engineering experience and perform commercialization and marketing studies to assess market space, competitive environment, explore licensing opportunities and further commercialization of the technology. This strong partnership is poised to move this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>
