    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This grant is in partial support for the 13th World Conference on Titanium (Ti-2015), which is being held at the Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel in San Diego, California from August 16-20, 2015. It is the thirteenth conference in a series of meetings on titanium that have been held since 1968, with the purpose of bringing together the world?s titanium community to present and discuss progress in titanium science and technology. Titanium and its alloys are used in applications as varied as jewelry, airplanes, automobiles, bone implants, and surgical instruments and the technical areas covered at the conference are equally wide ranging. Participation of the seven major titanium countries (United Kingdom, United States, Commonwealth of Independent States, Japan, Germany, France, and China) in the International Organizing Committee guarantees extensive coverage of new areas in research, development and application of titanium, as well as broad impact and stimulation of new ideas and collaboration opportunities among attendees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Titanium and its alloys continue to receive significant attention as structural materials with desirable properties such as high specific strength, fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. These properties, along with its excellent high temperature performance, have enabled titanium and its alloys to become workhorse materials in numerous applications, further explored at the 13th World Conference on Titanium. The technical program covers a broad range of topics including: extraction and powder production, wrought processing and fabrication, melting and casting, intermetallics and metal matrix composites, additive and near net shape manufacturing, and integrated computational materials engineering, among others. The format includes 7 plenary speakers, 15 keynotes, more than 450 contributed presentations, and a post-event proceedings publication. In addition to learning about new research and advances, this conference helps attendees establish new international contacts and serve as a platform to catalyze opportunities for cooperation and collaboration among scientists and engineers working on titanium.</AbstractNarration>
