    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at the University of Washington (UW) involves elementary and middle school science and mathematics teachers from King County in south Seattle in intensive six-week summer multidisciplinary and cutting edge research experiences on environmental sustainabile and green advanced vehicle technology, professional development, and academic year collaborations. The RET Site involves a partnership between UW faculty in the College of Engineering (CoE) and the Institute for Systems Biology's Logan Center for Education (ISB LCE) in program development and implementation. Teachers participate in three research projects in of advanced vehicle technology (AVT) that include energy storage system design and integration, hardware and software-in-the-loop simulation and testing, Human-Machine Interfacing (HMI) for infotainment and displays, vehicle connectivity and embedded control systems, powertrain component bench testing, use of vehicle modeling and simulation tools, and improving aerodynamics. The RET participants gain first-hand experience in the use of experimental and Maker space tools, as well as create pedagogically appropriate curriculum enhancements that align with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) Engineering Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI), Practices, and Concepts. The program impacts two areas that are of direct interest to the United States and the world: increasing access for K-12 teachers and their students to a deeper understanding of the STEM disciplines, research, and career opportunities; and inspiring teachers and students to pursue engineering careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a three-year period this RET Site offers an intensive summer research and academic year program for a total of 30 upper elementary and middle school (grades 4-8) STEM teachers from the south Seattle area. The targeted school districts are in the Community Center for Educational Results Road Map Project region, which encompasses King County's most concentrated areas of resource challenged student population with a high need of STEM education opportunities. The RET Site leverages the ongoing multidisciplinary EcoCAR 3 program for the energy efficient design of vehicles. Key features of the program include: 1) Direct supervision of projects and course material development by UW College of Engineering and Institute for Systems Biology's Logan Center for Education faculty mentors and graduate students; 2)Involvement of RET teachers and their students in timely, cutting-edge research projects in green and sustainable advanced vehicle technology that are translated into engineering curriculum enhancements; 3) Academic year program in which teachers engage with UW CoE students and faculty, industry mentors, and ISB LCE education professionals through monthly teleconferences and quarterly meetings to implement curriculum enhancements in classrooms and disseminate enhancements via local, state, and national networks 4) Recruitment of STEM teachers from high needs school districts in the south Seattle area; and 5) Research and education activities to strengthen teachers' engineering design and computer science knowledge and provide them with effective pedagogical strategies that will help them translate their research experiences into course modules that will excite their students about engineering and align with NGSS Engineering Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI), Practices, and Concepts.</AbstractNarration>
