    <AbstractNarration>The instrument enables high performance data analysis, transfer, and sharing at a level that is not possible with current platforms, tools, and approaches. In the areas of genomics, genetics, breeding, and bioinformatics, access to the IDARTs3 platform offers the ability to dissect the genomic basis of diversity and answer questions that range from disentangling the evolutionary history of organisms to linking genomic changes to phenotypic changes with direct application in breeding. Moreover, improvements in transfer rates of large data afforded by the proposed IDARTs3 platform will advance the field of Big Data biology, by facilitating the development of sophisticated computational tools that not only are scalable to large data sizes, but are also capable of enabling new kinds of scientific inquiries only possible through the integration of the heterogeneous data sets. In the area of atmospheric and environmental research, the instrument enables researchers to expand the boundaries for the support of resource management science through efforts such as Earth System modeling and related decision support systems, and serves as the basis to launch modeling initiatives with high-density sensor network technology (for example in monitoring meteorological and atmospheric chemistry). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring and deploying a shared and integrated high performance data transfer platform instrument across two campuses, initially addresses areas of genomics, genetics, breeding, and bioinformatics, as well as atmospheric and environmental research. Given that these areas generate a significant amount of data and their need for a high performance data storage and transfer, they are most appropriate for the deployment of IDARTs3. Once operational, IDARTs3 will enhance other research areas and serve as a cyberinfrastructure platform to support existing collaborative networks and forge scientific partnerships. The design and operation of IDARTs3 represents a singular partnership between the WSU academic and research community and the Information Technology (IT) organizations - a partnership that fully integrates the needs of the WSU Pullman and Spokane campuses and is responsive to these needs by closing critical capabilities gaps.</AbstractNarration>
