    <AbstractNarration>This project, from Washington State University (WSU) creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WSU Site serves as mechanism for collaboration across campus, acting as a structure for providing experiential learning opportunities for students and faculty. By expanding the connectivity between related programs on and off campus, the Site realizes benefits that transcend the individual efforts and enhance WSU's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem as well as the geographical region around WSU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of WSU's I-Corps Site is to enhance and broaden access to existing entrepreneurship programs within their experiential entrepreneurship ecosystem. To accomplish this goal, 30 to 40 I-Corps Teams per year are supported, expanding startup generation activities to include an 8-week training and idea development process. Each supported Team produces a draft business model for a university technology or Site-generated business idea. Those Teams emerge ready to pursue funding or partnership opportunities through the Site network and national I-Corps Network. Ultimately, WSU will provide a core blueprint for student/faculty collaborative experiential entrepreneurship training which will provide additional pathways for STEM students to engage with faculty in the business assessment of new technology ideas. Bringing WSU into the I-Corps national network allows Site Leaders to accelerate the positive startup culture velocity achieved in the last few years.</AbstractNarration>
