    <AbstractNarration>Implantable passive mechanisms have never been developed for orthopedic surgery. This project seeks to create a paradigm shift in the domain of reconstructive orthopedic surgery through the exploration of the commercial market for a new class of implantable biomedical devices. The implants are passive mechanisms that take the form of tendon networks, levers, pulleys, and linkages. They will be surgically placed between muscles and tendons within the body with the goal of modifying the functional attachment of muscles to tendons and bone. Specifically, the implants will provide the ability to scale and distribute forces better between muscles and tendons when compared with the current practice of using sutures to make attachments. These implants will enable customizable and superior musculoskeletal function for the patient, thus improving quality of life in the long term. Since such implants have never been developed before, this project promotes the progress of science. If these implants make it to market, the work could lead to the creation of a new medical-device industry, thus advancing national health, prosperity and welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work currently focuses on two classes of implantable passive mechanisms as exemplar implants. The first class consists of 'differential' mechanisms, such as moving pulleys and levers, which distribute forces and movements from one muscle across multiple tendons. The second class of implants consists of 'force-scaling' mechanisms that increase the force transferred from one muscle to a tendon. Preliminary studies show that these implants enable customizable and superior musculoskeletal function for the patient, thus improving quality of life in the long term. During the I-Corps program, each member of the team will pursue activities every week that explore the commercialization potential of the proposed technology. Specifically, the team will bring together ideas regarding the need for such implant technology in the surgical domain by consulting with people from different backgrounds, such as companies that develop orthopedic implants, regulatory bodies, and medical care centers.</AbstractNarration>
