    <AbstractNarration>The research asks the question "What STEM career routes lead to more diverse and cosmopolitan research collaborations?" This question is important because previous research has found that greater collaborator diversity and cosmopolitanism (e.g. collaborators from different institutions, different fields, or different countries) is positively related to publishing productivity and development of research capabilities among STEM researchers. The contributes directly to the NSF mission to promote the progress of science by studying factors related to enhancing increased research and publishing productivity, as well as considering a variety of additional career success indicators important to the health and well-being of the nation's STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We examine race and gender as key dimensions in our study because previous work suggests that women and underrepresented minorities will tend to have less diverse and cosmopolitan collaboration patterns, due to diminished professionally relevant social capital and network contacts. The research uses the 2006 and 2010 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) and examines changes in collaboration patterns over time (2006-2010) for a wide variety of STEM workers, including doctoral level but also persons with bachelors and masters' degrees. The study focuses on six distinct measures of career success: team versus individual work organization, number of employees supervised, job satisfaction, promotion, salary, and skill augmentation. In each case, the research asks "how does research collaborator diversity and cosmopolitanism affect success?"</AbstractNarration>
