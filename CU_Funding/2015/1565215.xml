    <AbstractNarration>The Florida State University (FSU) proposes to add four new cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity with strong integration of education and research. The project will have an immediate impact on the information assurance and forensics capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with general computing and security skills. The program components are designed to have a broad and lasting impact. Existing efforts to engage members of underrepresented groups and non-traditional students will be intensified. CyberCorps(R) students will collaborate on real-world projects to gain practical experience and enhance internship and job placement prospects. The proposed project addresses the current personnel gap in cybersecurity for the national information infrastructure. Through a formal relationship with Florida A&amp;M University, the project is making a focused effort to recruit students from underrepresented groups into the program and has academic support programs to foster their success. The cybersecurity program is the most popular graduate program in FSU's computer science department and the prospect of a potential employment within the Federal Government has a significant impact on the number of applying students, including minority and female students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is graduating skilled information assurance and forensics professionals with strong leadership skills and a commitment to public service. The program integrates rigorous, hands-on learning with research, professional development and outreach activities. The students will serve as summer interns to gain practical experience and will join federal agencies or other eligible entities upon graduation. The program has a well-established infrastructure for retention and mentoring. It includes a flexible selection procedure, offering admission by exception and choices of alternative degree programs, for strong cybersecurity candidates who otherwise do not meet the minimum computer science degree requirements. It is intended to broaden the scope of the cybersecurity program and attract minority and female applicants. FSU has received the DHS/NSA designation as the National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance and Cyber Defense. The project includes an assessment and evaluation plan coordinated by an independent evaluator to ensure that the project achieves its objectives. The project's results are being disseminated through conference and professional presentations.</AbstractNarration>
