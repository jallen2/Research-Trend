    <AbstractNarration>Heat and mass transfer between the oceanic crust and the deep ocean has global implications for the cooling of the earth, the movement of critical biogeochemical species, and the maintenance of ocean bottom biological communities. Moreover, recent studies show that geothermal heating is an important driver of deep ocean circulation, which is a major component of the ocean-atmosphere system. As a part of a large multidisciplinary and international research program, this project will develop the first high-resolution models of how crustal heat and mass transfer impact deep ocean circulation. The proposed work will lead to a better understanding of deep ocean circulation and its connection with the global ocean-atmosphere system. The proposed work also will yield an important advance in understanding how crustal heat and mass transfer evolves as the oceanic crust ages. The project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research forms an integral component of the large multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional project led by the University of Durham, England. This research will use recently collected physical oceanographic, geophysical, and conductive heat flow data, together with existing data sets from the Panama Basin in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, to construct hydrothermal heat and mass flux models from the Costa Rica Rift (CRR) axis to sediment-covered, 6 million year old crust. The goals are: (1) to understand how hydrothermal heat transfer evolves with crustal structure as the lithospheric ages; and (2) to develop high resolution models that show how hydrothermal heat and mass transfer impacts deep ocean circulation on a regional scale. To achieve these goals, 85 new conductive heat flow measurements have been obtained in sediment-covered crust at ages between 1.3 and 5.3 Ma co-located with a multi-channel seismic line. These data will be used together with existing heat flow data, and the geophysical and oceanographic data from the British-led project, to construct mathematical and numerical models of hydrothermal heat transfer in young sediment-covered crust. In addition, other geophysical data on the distribution of melt and partial melt in axial and near-axial regions, coupled with water samples for helium analysis and oceanographic data characterizing the ocean bottom boundary layer and hydrothermal plume structure at the CRR, will constrain models of hydrothermal circulation at the ridge axis and in near-axial regions. These analyses will provide the first estimates of hydrothermal heat output at the CRR and near-axis region, and will guide future exploration of hydrothermal activity, geochemical transport, and the biological communities at the CRR. Finally, the hydrothermal models will serve as input to high-resolution models of ocean circulation using the detailed suite of oceanographic data collected during the British-led project.</AbstractNarration>
