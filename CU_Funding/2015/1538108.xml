    <AbstractNarration>The promise of polymer-based electronics is that energy harvesting, lighting and sensing applications can be achieved with cheap, flexible, lightweight and abundant plastics using faster, more efficient solution-based manufacturing. Current state-of-the-art processing for organic electronics employs toxic chlorinated organic solvents and relies on the uncontrolled self-assembly of the polymer as it solidifies from solution. Additional barriers to widespread adoption include reproducibility and lifetime issues associated with the scale-up of device manufacturing. This award aims to address these challenges through study of a novel nanomanufacturing paradigm. Water-based colloidal suspensions of electronic polymers will be assembled into hierarchical structures using external electric fields. This research will lead to cheaper, more reliable and sustainable solution-based processing of polymers for the manufacture of flexible electronics, photovoltaics and sensors. Integration of research into education will be an enduring impact of this project. Students will be involved at all levels, including undergraduates. Plans are to engage K-12 students, including minority and first-generation-to-college students, in the City of Lowell Public Schools by introducing the basics of nanotechnology and organic electronics with hands-on demonstrations and student mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research project are to investigate a novel dielectrophoresis (DEP) technique to manufacture hierarchically ordered conjugated polymer films from colloidal suspensions and to create a new processing paradigm for organic electronics applications. This research will provide a new nanomanufacturing method for directed assembly of multicomponent nanoparticles into well-defined structured thin films over a range of length scales. Specifically, the tasks are (i) investigate of a novel DEP technique for hierarchical patterned deposition of colloidal nanoparticles of semiconducting polymers, (ii) elucidate the role of polymer nanoparticle preparation variables on particle size, colloidal stability and internal polymer chain structures, and (iii) characterize the relationship between this new manufacturing paradigm and polymer film morphology and electronic properties. By controlling the morphology of conjugated polymer thin films, the award will study the hypothesis that films from aqueous colloidal nanoparticle assembles are more suitable for devices with improved electronic properties compared to films prepared using conventional film-casting from organic solvents. The principles learned from this fundamental research will establish design rules for conjugated polymer nanoparticle assembly and enable creation of a "colloidal process engineering tool-kit". This will serve as the underpinning of continuous nanoparticle assembly and deposition to control thin-film morphologies that can be translated into innovative and versatile manufacturing processes for electronic devices.</AbstractNarration>
