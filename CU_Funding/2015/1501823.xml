    <AbstractNarration>Agricultural land use change transforms landscapes from complex, natural habitat to simple, agricultural systems. These landscape changes negatively affect bats, and may result in the loss of agricultural pest suppression by insectivorous bats. In California's Central Coast, the fertile soil and temperate climate are ideal for growing high-value crops, such as fruits and vegetables, but the region is also important habitat for wildlife, including 16 species of bats. Bats are voracious insect predators and protecting bats in agricultural areas can help to control pests and reduce the need for pesticides. This research investigates which farm management practices are bat-friendly and could promote bat-mediated pest suppression, and which practices may deter bats from visiting certain farms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use meta-analysis, observational and experimental field methods, and new lab technologies to examine the multi-scalar effects of agricultural intensification on insectivorous bats and bat-insect interactions. Ultrasonic recorders will be used to reveal patterns of bat diversity, and a novel technique (removal of tethered moths) will be tested and described to document bat removal of pests in the field. Bats will be tracked using radio telemetry to map home ranges and understand foraging ecology. Fecal DNA analysis will be used to characterize bat diets and identify trophic linkages between bats and agriculturally important insect pests. Understanding spillover effects between natural and managed systems is relevant to conservation biologists, agroecologists, and land managers. This research will allow for relative valuation of entire bat communities, and the knowledge generated will promote conservation of these charismatic organisms. Research findings will be shared with scientists and the public through scientific journals, conferences, and outreach to local farming communities about bat conservation. In addition, the research will incorporate individual mentoring of women and minority students, and high-school curriculum development for students in a migrant, Latino community. Undergraduate assistants from UC Santa Cruz's diverse student body will be encouraged to develop synergies between this research and potential thesis projects.</AbstractNarration>
