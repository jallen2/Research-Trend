    <AbstractNarration>This project, developing CyberCANOE (Cyber-enabled Collaboration Analysis Navigation and Observation Environment), aims to serve as an eyepiece, providing researchers with powerful and easy-to-use information-rich instrumentation in support of cyberinfrastructure-enabled data-intensive scientific discovery. CyberCANOE will provide users with the ability to see both 2D and 3D stereoscopic content in a completely seamless display environment with almost 50 Megapixels of resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CyberCANOE provides a unique alternative approach to constructing ultra-resolution display environments by using new and completely seamless direct view Light Emitting Diode displays, rather than traditional projection technologies or Liquid Crystal Displays. The net effect is a visual instrument that exceeds the capabilities and overcomes the limitations of the current best-in-class systems such as the CAVE2 at EVL and the WAVE at CALIT2 at UC San Diego. Immediately 46 researchers, 28 postdocs, 833 undergraduates, 45 graduate students spanning disciplines that include Oceanography, Astrobiology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Research, Archeology, and Computational Media are poised to use the CyberCANOE for their large-scale data visualization needs. The instrument opens up new opportunities in computer science research at the intersection of data-intensive analysis and visualization, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. It enables the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization and Applications (LAVA) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), to provide an EPSCoR and Native Hawaiian Serving Institution, with state-of-the-art equipment, opportunities, and supervision to enhance undergraduate and graduate research and education; to provide scientific communities with highly integrated visually rich collaboration environments; to work with industry to facilitate the creation of new technologies for the advancement of science and engineering; and to continue ongoing partnerships with many of the worlds best domain scientists and computer scientists in academia and industry, who readily become early adopters of new instrumentation, and who provide students with summer internships and jobs upon graduation.</AbstractNarration>
