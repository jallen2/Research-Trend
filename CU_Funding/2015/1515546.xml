    <AbstractNarration>The premise behind Assistive Technology research is to enable people with disabilities to enjoy the same quality of life as people without disabilities, but despite advances in assistive technologies and technology in general, shopping still poses a barrier towards independence for blind people. Shopping can be a necessity as well as a recreational activity for many individuals, and for some it can even influence their sense of belonging and self-worth within society. Hence, there is a need for further research on making independent shopping accessible to blind people. This research will focus on designing and developing a shopping assistant system to facilitate blind people (from Japan and the U.S.) to independently explore shopping malls. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Prof. Muneo Kitajima, a noted expert in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Cognitive Science, at Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT) in Japan. This research will support the development of a shopping assistant system for blind people by identifying the system requirements for such a system and developing a prototype tool through participatory design, a user-centered design method that involves target users at every step of the design and development process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System requirements will be gathered through surveys and focus group discussions with blind persons and/or store managers from the U.S. and Japan. A system will be designed based on those requirements and tested with blind individuals from Japan through cognitive walkthroughs. With the feedback received, system requirements will be improved accordingly and a high-fidelity prototype of the system will be implemented on top of an iOS indoor navigation application. User evaluations of the prototype will be conducted with blind persons from Japan within a lab setting that mimics a shopping mall environment. Based on the evaluations, a finalized version of the system will be designed. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).</AbstractNarration>
