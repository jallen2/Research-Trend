    <AbstractNarration>1549736&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membrane filtration plays a critical role in advanced water and wastewater treatment practices. However, membrane fouling increases the operation and maintenance costs, and ultimately shortens membrane life. The main objective of this project is to explore the fundamental mechanisms of self-cleaning piezoelectric membrane systems and the application guidelines for fouling control. This project may greatly advance membrane filtration technology for water and wastewater treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study explores piezoelectric membranes to solve membrane fouling problems in filtration processes. Utilizing multi-functional piezoelectric membrane materials, the project will result in an innovative approach to control membrane fouling. This project is the first to systematically investigate the cleaning mechanisms of the piezoelectric membranes and the anti-fouling efficiency for common types of membrane foulants. Upon completion of this study, the project will reveal; 1) the fundamental cleaning mechanisms of the piezoelectric membranes; 2) the cleaning efficiency with respect to typical membrane foulants such as particles, organic matters and microorganism; 3) the cleaning effect with respect to cake layer formation vs. membrane pore blocking; 4) the technical guidelines of system optimization such as vibration frequency, waveform and amplitude; 5) surface modification of the piezoelectric membrane to be less prone to fouling and easier to clean; and, 6) potential side effects and how to avoid them. The fundamental research includes mechanics of vibration, sonochemistry, water chemistry, fluid mechanics, and disinfection. This research is potentially transformative as it may bring a revolutionary solution to membrane fouling and greatly advance the membrane filtration technology. The proposed membrane system has the advantages of being chemical-free, with cost-saving, a small footprint, productivity enhancement, extension of membrane life, and easy push-button operation. The proposed study is of great significance for both fundamental scientific research and industrial applications. In addition, this project will support the educational missions of the university as well, including courses development and support minority students in STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
