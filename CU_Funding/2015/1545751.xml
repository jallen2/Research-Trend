    <AbstractNarration>The challenges of the college years are often reflected in student health, including poor health habits, which offer an opportunity for preventive intervention. There are daunting technical, privacy, and practical challenges associated with sensing, integrating, analyzing, and conveying data on physical and mental health. Also, at an institutional level, universities that hope to use technologies to improve student health will need to surmount the obstacle that a lot of institutions have no integration that connects data or services on students' physical health with that on their mental health. This workshop could be the starting point of a coordinated effort to overcome such difficulties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very timely workshop on engaging the university student health community with computational sciences to provide for new approaches to deal with the physical and behavioral aspects of university student life. The PI and co-PI represent expertise in computing and preventative medicine. The plan for the workshop is thoughtful and generally provides enough time for discussion as well as presentation. The prospective invitee list is comprehensive, and should result is a lively discussion. The conference web site will provide access to the white papers and any additional materials, such as presentation materials or reports from breakout groups.</AbstractNarration>
