    <AbstractNarration>The global cycling of organic matter and elements is driven to a great extent by microorganisms with the ability to exchange electrons with extracellular substrates. Such abilities can be harnessed for the bioremediation of toxic metals and for bioenergy applications. Fe(III) and Mn(III, IV) oxides are among the most environmentally relevant substrates that microorganisms use as electron acceptors or donors. Due to insoluble nature of these minerals, microorganisms must establish an extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanism to access either the reducing or oxidizing power. EET also provides cells with a mechanism that prevents the permeation and reduction of toxic metals inside the cell. Therefore, EET mechanisms serve the double functions of supporting respiration and preventing the accumulation of the reduced water-insoluble products inside microbial cells. Despite its importance, EET mechanisms have been understudied in the past and deserve attention from scientists from diverse background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, funding is requested to promote US-China collaborative research on Microbial Extracellular Electron Transfer by organizing a joint workshop between US and China, which will be held in Beijing, China, in March 2015. The proposed workshop will focus on research programs that can make the best use of the strengths and opportunities in both US and China, such as unique resources, infrastructures and scientific expertise. The objectives of the workshop are to promote interdisciplinary research on Microbial Extracellular Electron Transfer and to create new opportunities for successful research collaborations between US and Chinese scientists by conducting joint research projects and sharing resources, databases and cyber-infrastructure. Extracellular electron transfer is an essential component in many sub-fields of Geobiology and Low Temperature Geochemistry, such as mineral-microbe interaction, biomineralization, and microbial geochemistry. The PIs will involve young scientists, post-doc researchers, and students in the workshop. A web site will be created to post the workshop announcement, faculty and student exchange opportunities, and workshop report. Efforts will be made to reach social media as well.</AbstractNarration>
