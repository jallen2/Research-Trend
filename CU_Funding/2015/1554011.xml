    <AbstractNarration>Spintronics makes explicit use of spin, an inherent quantum-mechanical property of electrons, to achieve novel functionalities. A unique advantage of spintronic devices is their nonvolatility: the information they store in spin is retained and remembered even after power is removed from the devices. Nonvolatility is particularly important for the nascent generation of digital devices in which transistor dimensions will be reduced to only a few nanometers. At this nanoscale the power consumption of traditional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors will be dominated by leakage current; whereas, for spintronic structures such energy waste can be completely eliminated. An important draw back for spintronics is the lowest recorded switching energy to flip electron spins between their up or down states to 1s and 0s in binary computer instructions, is still more than two orders of magnitude higher than a CMOS transistor, which severely limits the present applications of spintronic devices. This CAREER project is focused on exploring novel voltage effects to greatly reduce the switching energy of spin-based devices. By successfully demonstrating ultra-low energy switching, this project broadly impacts a wide range of spintronic devices as well as emergent technologies such as wearable computers and the Internet of Things, for which zero power consumption in the standby state is critical and highly desired. The multidisciplinary nature of the research impacts multiple levels of education, from high school to graduate students. The education activities build on a proven plan to encourage and inspire underrepresented minority students in local high schools to pursue STEM majors in college. Moreover, the PI will leverage this CAREER research to continue his outreach efforts to improve the general public's understanding of spintronics through activities such as 'Physics Open House' and 'Physics Phun Nite'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award explores energy-efficient switching mechanisms in spintronic structures. Three different, but complementary approaches will be studied: (1) switching based on voltage-controlled interlayer exchange coupling; (2) switching based on voltage-induced effective field; and (3) switching based on voltage-assisted spin transfer torque. These three switching scenarios are studied under the context of voltage-controlled anisotropy and voltage-controlled magnetism. Voltage-controlled anisotropy is an electronic effect where the magnetic anisotropy field can be substantially modified, but the saturation magnetization remains largely the same. Voltage-controlled magnetism is an ionic effect where both the magnetic anisotropy field and the saturation magnetization can be controlled by voltage. The dependence of these effects on the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction will investigated. Combined with the experiments that characterize the voltage-induced charge redistribution in ferromagnets, a complete understanding on different switching mechanisms will be achieved. Furthermore, these new approaches to dramatically decrease the switching energy will be directly implemented on high quality magnetic tunnel junctions with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which can not only perform as stand-alone spintronic memories or logic cells, but can serve also as the essential part of many other spintronic devices, such as lateral spin valves and spin-Hall memories. The results obtained in this project will transform our understanding of how magnetoelectric coupling is mediated by both electrons and ions in ultra-thin magnetic films. Success for this project paves a path to ultra-low switching energy spintronic devices that could be complementary, or even superior, to traditional CMOS devices.</AbstractNarration>
