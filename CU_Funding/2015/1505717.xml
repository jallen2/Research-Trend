    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project explores how molecular shape impacts the internal organization of crystalline solids. Because material properties intimately relate to the composition of the building-blocks and their alignment, a greater understanding of the factors that influence component interactions holds much importance to the development of advanced materials that exhibit a wide-variety of functional properties. The project is anchored by a research team at Eastern Illinois University and will prove useful for probing the structural boundaries of the recognition process by investigating the complementary shapes of molecular neighbors. The educational and service component of the activity focuses on training students (undergraduate and Master's level) as scientists for careers in STEM fields, developing teaching modules for the introductory organic laboratory, and providing X-ray instrument services to the greater academic community of small colleges and universities that support rigorous undergraduate research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Many functions of solid materials require exquisite control over the molecular architectures of their building blocks. The construction of structurally controlled supramolecular assemblies (e.g., bulk solids) is still at a primitive level despite great progress in the chemical synthesis of discrete molecules over the past few decades. This project explores the structural boundaries of molecular shape to the molecular recognition process by using the quasiracemate approach for constructing bimolecular compounds. Chiral building blocks formulated from known organic precursors will be synthesized via diarylamide and Pemoline templates. Since it is well known that a high propensity exists for organic molecules to arrange in centrosymmetric relationships, this activity explores the supramolecular behavior of these molecules to form quasicentrosymmetrically related aggregates. Video-supported thermomicroscopy and calorimetric techniques will be used to investigate the ability of pairs of materials to assemble. X-ray diffraction techniques will help determine the detailed structures of the materials obtained and assist with determining the topological contributions to these molecular assemblies.</AbstractNarration>
