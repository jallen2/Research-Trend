    <AbstractNarration>The central dogma of molecular biology states that the genetic code is housed in DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid), from which RNA (RiboNucleic Acid) transcripts are produced that are then translated into proteins that ultimately affect the function of an organism. Within the last decade, the role of RNA has dramatically expanded beyond that of an intermediary molecule, and small RNA (including microRNA, or miRNA) research has rapidly expanded, shedding light on the role non-coding RNAs play in many aspects of biology, including development and disease progression. The goal of this project is to better understand the roles of miRNAs in non-model systems, specifically fishes from the Southern Ocean, which will, at the same time, generate insight into the capacity of these fishes that are only found in Antarctica to respond to cellular stress. In addition to concerns about changing oceans (higher temperatures, lower pH, changing salinities), fishing within the Southern Ocean has increased significantly. Thus, a more clear understanding of the susceptibility of polar fish populations will lead to a greater understanding of how to better approach management of these unique marine ecosystems. This project will also provide cutting edge research opportunities for students at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI), helping the students build the tools necessary to succeed in an increasingly technical research field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate several molecular approaches to functionally characterize microRNAs (miRNAs) and the role they play in regulating the cellular stress response in notothenioid fish. Previous research efforts have provided evidence to support the loss of regulatory control for a portion of the cellular stress response in these fish. The team will undertake a transcriptome wide analysis of the expression of miRNAs in these fish and correlate those expression patterns with changes in mRNA (messenger RNA) abundance of stress response genes under elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the PI?s lab will perform functional characterization of the putative miRNAs by over-expression of these short, non-coding RNAs in cultured fish cells. These functional analyses will help determine if the miRNA displays regulatory control over the abundance of RNA transcripts for a key set of molecular chaperones that assist with protein folding. Ultimately, these studies will shed new light on the possible interruption of the classical heat shock response in these fish and provide critical insight into their capacity to adapt to the expected changes in the Southern Ocean. Although high risk in nature, (this work has rarely been performed in non-model species) this project will provide an unprecedented window into the regulatory mechanisms that link changes in gene expression and a suite of physiological changes, measured from the whole organism to the cell, in an individual, non-model fish.</AbstractNarration>
