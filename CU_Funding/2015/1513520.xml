    <AbstractNarration>The proposal requests travel funds enabling students to attend Career Workshop for Women and Minorities in Computer Architecture (CWWMCA-2014). The workshop will be held in Cambridge, United Kingdom, in conjunction with the 47th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO). The CWWMCA workshop focuses on the technical and career development of women and other minorities in the research field of computer architecture. The main workshop will be sponsored by ACM SIGMICRO as well as other industrial companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The support will go a long way towards including participation of women and minority students in a leading computer architecture workshop/conference and thereby enhancing the potential for their joining university faculty and/or the information technology workforce in the near future. Special funding will be provided for companion travel grants to support attendees with either disabilities, or a parent of an infant less than one year old, who cannot travel without the infant and a care provider for the infant. These efforts are anticipated to broaden the participation in the workshop and the main conference and, subsequently, the research field.</AbstractNarration>
