    <AbstractNarration>This National Academies study examines the tradeoffs associated with mechanisms to provide authorized government agencies with access to the plaintext version of encrypted information. The study describes the context in which decisions about such mechanisms would be made and identifies and characterizes possible mechanisms and alternative means of obtaining information sought by the government for law enforcement or intelligence investigations. It seeks to find ways to measure or otherwise characterize risks so that they can be weighed against the potential law enforcement or intelligence benefits. The study does not seek to answer the question of whether access mechanisms should be required but rather provides an authoritative analysis of options and tradeoffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project yields a more nuanced understanding of technical mechanisms for providing access to encrypted information, alternative means of obtaining needed information, and ways of characterizing associated risks and benefits. It provides a basis for policy discussion and debate and for further exploration of the topic including future research. The project, which is focused on a topic of current public discussion, provides an objective source of information on technical and policy options and thus provides information to all stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>
