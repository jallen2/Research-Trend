    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Sarah Larson of the University of Iowa develops a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) toolbox to investigate complex environmental mixtures. Studies include prediction of the fate and transport of very small particles (nanoparticles) in the environment and the preparation of nanomaterials with specific characteristics to minimize negative environmental and/or biological impacts. These results have broad implications for critical areas such as carbon cycling, sustainability, and remediation of pollutants. Undergraduate students, some of whom are underrepresented, are recruited and mentored to participate in this project through programs such as the Sloan Center for Exemplary Mentoring and the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The studies focus on validating nanoparticle nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods as an important and valuable tool for investigating complex mixtures of environmental relevance. The toolbox includes NMR methods such as solid state NMR, high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS), and pulse field gradient (PFG) NMR. The project demonstrates the utility of the nanoparticle NMR toolbox for studying environmental interfaces of engineered nanomaterials and natural colloids and establishes the use of nanoparticle-enabled NMR spectroscopy to selectively detect species in complex mixtures. The nanoparticle NMR toolbox is developed to elucidate molecular level details and to improve selectivity for studies of the interactions of complex mixtures, such as dissolved organic matter (DOM), with nanomaterials. The information obtained from the NMR toolbox may be used to predict the fate and transport of nanoparticles in natural systems and to engineer nanomaterials with desired properties. Further impact of this work is in developing an exhibit on environmental water research for the University of Iowa Mobile Museum and for Science, Technology, Education and Mathematics (STEM) career outreach including internships for high school students. Visitors will also be hosted at the laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
