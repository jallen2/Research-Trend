    <AbstractNarration>Crisis often creates opportunity. The ongoing US educational crisis has spawned a rapidly growing industry for out-of-school student "enrichment" programs. Parents across all economic strata want to invest in their children. While traditional tutoring programs are highly valued by parents, they are rarely considered fun and engaging by the students. This I-Corps team proposes to evaluate the feasibility of launching a national chain of retail 'Tinkering Lab" locations where girls and boys are challenged to invent exciting science and ?Maker? projects (e.g. planes, robots, catapults, automatic pet feeders, musical synthesizers, etc.) while learning to use 21st century fabrication tools such as 3D printers, and laser cutters, and incorporating electronics and servo actuators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Tinkering Labs, young people will learn by doing, inventing, and being challenged. They will learn STEM concepts compelled by curiosity while having fun. It reinforces a new paradigm of STEM learning by fostering 21st century skills such as design thinking, authentic problem solving, creativity, collaboration, and communication. The Tinkering experience, guided by skilled mentors, fosters STEM learning, and generates interest in pursuing STEM careers. The project will test the commercial potential of the Tinkering Labs concept, as an after-school and weekend destination for children and teens, ages 8 to 18. Tinkering Labs has the potential to increase the number of students enthusiastic about STEM careers, improve their understanding of STEM concepts and contribute to the transformation of the traditional STEM education process. Over the next decade Tinkering Labs has the potential to reach hundreds of thousands of children and to provide a much more engaging way for them to explore STEM while they develop critical thinking skills.</AbstractNarration>
