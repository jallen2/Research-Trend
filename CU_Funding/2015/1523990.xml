    <AbstractNarration>CBET 1523990&lt;br/&gt;Ferguson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ContaSed2015: Support for U.S. Participants in an International Conference on Environmental Chemistry, Toxicology, and Engineering of Contaminated Sediments, Switzerland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Conference aims at providing the most intellectually stimulating forum possible for top international experts as well as junior researchers from different scientific disciplines to discuss and present the most recent and topical results and novel approaches regarding the analysis, assessment and remediation of contaminated sediment. Recent sediments are major sinks for chemical contaminants in aquatic ecosystems and are extremely important in the fate of pollutants in the environment. The ecological relevance of sediment quality is widely acknowledged, but approached differently in various scientific fields. Sediments govern the biogeochemical cycle of pollutants and nutrients and play a key role for the bioavailability of hazardous pollutants and the resulting toxic effects. In addition, biodegradation of organic pollutants in aquatic sediments is of major relevance in risk assessment. As archives of contaminants, dated sediments represent historic records of trends in environmental pollution. The participation of U.S. researchers at the conference will be essential in order to ensure that the implications of contaminated sediments on U.S. environmental policy, health, and society are fully represented in this important forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics to be addressed at the 2015 Conference will include: a) sedimentary archives and historical trends; b) reconstruction of changing pollutant loads into aquatic ecosystems and identifying their drivers; c) transformation processes and degradation products of sediment contaminants; d) porewater partitioning of chemicals and bioavailability of hazardous substances and pathogens; e) role of sediment-water interface processes on biogeochemistry and pollutant dynamics; as well as, f) in-situ and ex-situ remediation techniques of contaminated sediments. The conference will cover studies about legacy and emerging organic micropollutants, heavy metals, virus and microbes, as well as engineered nanomaterials. Recent advances in environmental chemistry, ecotoxicology and engineering will be presented and discussed among participants from fundamental and applied scientific research, experts in risk assessment and regulators from public authorities. In particular, it is envisioned that the conference will include a discussion at the end wherein stakeholders (including international experts and conference attendees) will identify some "grand challenge" research questions for addressing contaminated sediments and their impacts on societies and economies both nationally and internationally.</AbstractNarration>
