    <AbstractNarration>Center for the Integrated Study of Coastal Ecosystem Processes and Dynamics in the Mid-Atlantic Region&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National Science Foundation support, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore will continue operations of the Center for the Integrated Study of Coastal Ecosystem Processes and Dynamics in the Mid-Atlantic Region. This Center brings together a team of scientists with expertise in geochemistry, phytoplankton and zooplankton ecology, fish ecology, environmental microbiology, biogeochemistry, and physical oceanography to conduct a collaborative study of the effects of climate variability on trophic interactions and food web dynamics, exchange of materials between Maryland Coastal Bays and the coastal ocean, and dynamics of heterotrophic bacteria. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastal lagoons such as Maryland Coastal Bays are very productive ecosystems that serve as nurseries for many economically and ecologically important species of finfish and shellfish. Coastal lagoons have restricted water exchanges with the coastal ocean. As a result, they are not well flushed, and are vulnerable to nutrient enrichment and pollutant accumulation. The Center for the Integrated Study of Coastal Ecosystem Processes and Dynamics in the Mid-Atlantic Region emphasis is on understanding the dynamics and processes within the Maryland coastal lagoon and estuarine ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hydrodynamic model will be developed and used to evaluate the magnitude of material transport between the Maryland Coastal Bays and the coastal ocean through the northern and southern inlets. A particle tracking model will be used to assess the dispersal and retention of gelatinous zooplankton and ichthyoplankton in the Maryland Coastal Bays. Additionally, information on the dynamics of heterotrophic bacteria including Vibrio species will be examined, and the possible role of Vibrio as a stressor leading to co-infection by other microbes in crabs will be investigated. Abiotic and biotic variables will be used to develop models for predicting the occurrence of Vibrio species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for the Integrated Study of Coastal Ecosystem Processes and Dynamics in the Mid-Atlantic Region will positively impact the number of minority students that obtain degrees in marine and environmental sciences. The Center will integrate research and education by recruiting and educating high school students, middle school and high school teachers, and undergraduate and graduate students, particularly members of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
