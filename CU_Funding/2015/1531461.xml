    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Temple University Graduate Student Conference in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology, taking place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 16-17, 2015. This conference will involve more than 90 graduate students from the East Coast and beyond, with a variety of backgrounds and research levels. The conference provides an opportunity for graduate students to develop their academic careers at an early stage by presenting mathematics in front of their peers. With thirty graduate student talks on a wide range of topics and a diversity of research interests among the plenary speakers, the conference also provides opportunities for graduate students to learn about areas of mathematical research that are not prevalent at their home universities. The conference provides unique opportunities for young mathematicians to initiate collaborative research projects and to make connections between their fields of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main topics of this conference are algebra, geometry, and topology broadly construed, with emphasis on interactions between these areas, including: knot theory, geometric group theory, geometric structures on 3-manifolds, algebraic homotopy theory, rational homotopy theory, representation theory, differential geometry, homological algebra, algebraic topology, quantum invariants of manifolds, and hyperbolic geometry. The conference will feature thirty talks by graduate students, both original research talks and expository presentations. It will also include four plenary speakers renowned for both their presentation skills and research work: Daniel Wise (McGill University) in geometric group theory, Chelsea Walton (MIT) in noncommutative algebra, Jessica Purcell (Brigham Young University) in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, and Julie Bergner (University of California Riverside) in algebraic topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web site: math.temple.edu/events/gscagt</AbstractNarration>
