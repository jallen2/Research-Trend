    <AbstractNarration>1541868&lt;br/&gt;Rezac&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Central Great Plains is an agricultural powerhouse fueled in part by the great tracks of aquifer water that provide irrigation in the otherwise semi-arid region. As the temperature in the region rises, rainfall declines or holds steady, and the aquifer resources are depleted, it will be necessary to develop new crop varietals, water and fertilizer technologies, and policies to ensure the continued production of food in this changing environment. Kansas State University has a strong history of research excellence in questions relating to the food/water and energy/water intersections. The objective of this project is to host a workshop that will develop research priorities related to water- and energy-efficient food production in the Central Great Plains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kansas State has partnered with researchers from industry and national laboratories to organize a workshop to examine the food/energy/water trilemma. The workshop will prioritize the research tasks to be completed to ensure food availability in the future and it will create opportunities to strengthen research team development to respond to these challenges. The workshop will address the following topical areas deemed critical for system success: (1) models to predict water availability and how it is utilized in crop growth; (2) technologies and practices that maximize residential, agricultural, and commercial water quality and utilization efficiency; (3) energy-efficient fertilizer production and application techniques; (4) technology for the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorous from swine and beef operations while producing clean water and/or energy; (5) genetic understanding for the development of drought tolerant crops; and, (6) socio-economic factors influencing consumer behavior. The workshop will be attended by researchers, government agencies, producer groups, consumers, and policy makers. Research leaders from other institutions inside and outside the Central Great Plains and other stakeholders will be invited to attend the conference and contribute to the development of the research priority statements. The project seeks funding to support the travel for 20 key researchers and the meeting costs for 70 total participants. The meeting will be held in Manhattan, Kansas and timed to complement the existing Kansas Governor's Conference on the Future of Water.</AbstractNarration>
