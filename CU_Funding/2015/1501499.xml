    <AbstractNarration>Success in basic algebra is a major stumbling block for students seeking technical careers. Although it is often assumed that STEM majors start with calculus as their first college math course, this is not the case for many urban and minority community college students. This project is addressing the national problem of mathematics remediation for STEM majors by creating a game- and simulation-based algebra and trigonometry curriculum. The curriculum features three to five video games that place math content within real-world GIS scenarios. The curriculum is used in a summer immersion program for in-coming Geographic Information Science (GIS) majors at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC). The project will impact STEM education at a national level by providing all materials free and open-source to secondary and post-secondary institutions via a project website with downloadable curricula, game software, video tutorials, professional development materials for faculty and staff, and support forums. The summer immersion program pairs MAT 056, the most common remedial math course for BMCC STEM majors, with GEO 100, the first course in the GIS sequence. Students in the program are recruited from NYC high school graduates participating in BMCC's Science Technology Entry Program. After completing the summer program, students will receive special support services and internships in GIS to advance them into an articulating baccalaureate program at CUNY or in related industries. This project targets BMCC's large population of minority students (over 90%) and women students (nearly 60%). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evidence-based research has shown gaming in the mathematics curriculum has the power to transform mathematics education from an intimidating and negative experience to one that is fun, engaging, and successful. While there are many promising NSF-funded science games that are engaging and promote deep learning, there are very few math games that do so, and even fewer that specifically cover algebra topics in a way that can be appreciated by adult learners. Success in basic algebra is a major stumbling block for students seeking technical careers. This project will build on: 1) a previous NSF grant award to develop a GIS major at BMCC and 2) a Department of Education Title V grant for Hispanic-serving institutions to enhance e-learning initiatives at BMCC, including game-based learning. Games and simulations will feature real-world applications that focus on skills and contexts necessary for a career in GIS. Results of this project will be disseminated through conference presentations and publications. Project outcomes will be assessed through in-game analytics, traditional quizzes and midterm exams, and the common department final exam for MAT 056. Department final exam scores and course retention rates will be compared with rates for the college as a whole, using a logistic regression analysis of statistically matched cohorts. In addition, differences by gender and ethnicity will be examined. Student opinion surveys and focus groups will further gauge the effectiveness of the games and simulations on student attitudes toward math and technical fields. Finally, the program will be examined using longitudinal data on student enrollment, two-year retention rates, and progress toward degree or transfer.</AbstractNarration>
