    <AbstractNarration>PI: Davis, James F.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 1523237&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In October 2014, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) released the report of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) 2.0 Committee entitled, "Advancing U.S. Advance Manufacturing". The report motivates next generation advanced manufacturing focusing on enabling innovation, securing the talent pipeline and improving the business climate for U.S. growth and competitiveness. The report further identifies and recommends the alignment of efforts and resources to address next generation advanced manufacturing IT infrastructure technologies critical to U.S. competitiveness, encompassing growth, dynamic performance, energy and material usage, environmental sustainability and zero incidents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Sensing, Control and Platforms for Manufacturing (ASCPM) and Visualization, Informatics and Digital Manufacturing Technologies (VIDM) were established as comprehensive technology priorities. This workshop will emphasize the real-time sensing, control, platform and human systems models and cyber technologies, i.e. ASCPM, important to the actual manufacturing process and how these are mutually linked with digital design and manufacturing, i.e. VIDM. The workshop will bring together research and industrial experts from a cross section of continuous, batch, discrete and hybrid manufacturing structure interests who are also involved in the application of real-time enterprise smart and digital manufacturing technologies including real-time process management and control, simulation and modeling and data analysis and supply chain management, product and production design and optimization, An important objective is to understand how these interlinked cyber technologies are appropriately balanced and integrated for process and discrete product industry applications with a view toward next generation manufacturing technology trends. Invited speakers with expertise in advanced sensor, control, platform, automation and design systems across manufacturing structures will set the stage for a workshop that will develop priorities about the intersection of these technologies from research, development and delivery viewpoints. The workshop will focus on ASCPM and VIDM modeling, and summarize SM Platform integration and scaling of modeling and operational deployment to stimulate thinking within and across the areas of Smart and Manufacturing. The workshop will motivate next generation advanced manufacturing that focuses on enabling innovation, securing the talent pipeline and improving the business climate for U.S. growth and competitiveness through uncovering how these interlinked cyber technologies are appropriately balanced and integrated for process and discrete product industry applications.</AbstractNarration>
