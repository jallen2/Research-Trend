    <AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will investigate a novel process to perform nanoscale patterning at high speed and low cost. Nanoscale patterning is the key process of defining critical dimensions and geometries mainly used to manufacture important semiconductor products such as microprocessors and data storage devices. Many studies have shown that nanoscale patterning has the potential to revolutionize the functions of a broad range of products that we use in our daily lives. However tools for mass production of these devices usually cost tens of millions of U.S. dollars each and are affordable only to the established semiconductor industry. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of a new low-cost process for nanoscale patterning, which will enable mass production of new kinds of nanotechnology-enabled products for a wide variety of applications in energy, healthcare, civil, defense and security. Nominally called "pattern-on-the-fly", the method involves scanning an array of electrical or optical probes at high speed to form nanostructures of various geometries on a substrate. The results of this research will provide economical access to untapped tiny length scales in many applications with significant impacts on U.S. economy and society. This research involves several disciplines including manufacturing, optics, chemistry, and materials science. This award will create a multi-disciplinary environment to help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscale fabrication using scanning probes has proliferated with diverse techniques and varying degrees of maturity. The capability of scanning probe arrays at high speed can transform the unique strength of scanning probe-based techniques into a scalable nanomanufacturing technology. However, several fundamental and technical barriers are yet to be overcome to achieve this transformation, including circumventing the optical diffraction limit, fast scanning of probe arrays and operating of probes at high power. Some of the barriers are also common to other nanoscale patterning processes as they need to overcome their throughput bottlenecks by utilizing a massive number of parallel patterning devices at high speed and high power. This research is to fill the knowledge gap on the mechanisms of nanoscale pattern generation using high-speed probe arrays. The optical coupling principle uses mismatched surface plasmons and lightning-rod effects to achieve efficient energy concentration at nanoscale. The research team will perform integrated numerical and experimental studies to understand the microscopic mechanisms driven by strong energy input at nanoscale, design and implement the high-speed scanning of probe arrays for high throughput and fine resolution patterning, and demonstrate the feasibility and compatibility of this new process for targeted applications.</AbstractNarration>
