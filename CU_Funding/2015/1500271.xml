    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a new magnetic field configuration used in physical vapor deposition to large-scale rectangular cathodes used for many applications. The TriPAC magnetic arrangement is important because it allows a new type of high-power pulsed magnetron sputtering (HPPMS) to achieve the same deposition rates as conventional sputtering sources. The project will result in a higher quality coatings (less stress, higher density, better adhesion) broadly impacting many different industries and research areas- from consumer items (razor blades) to energy production (photovoltaics) to semiconductors (displays) to decorative coatings (bathroom faucets). The advantage of the innovation is the way the new magnetic field is generated, using only permanent magnets, and the whole assembly can fit into the standard design of magnetrons where conventional magnet assemblies are positioned. These features will allow easy adoption in the market place and will allow HPPMS to be used in a cost-effective manner compared to the standard magnet packs currently in use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. This new magnetic field topology works better than current magnetic fields because it allows plasma to expand further from cathode and provides a less steep potential drop. With this new electric field orientation, ionized sputtered material is more directed towards substrate to be coated and utilized for film deposition in larger quantities than with the conventional magnetic field configuration. The average incident atom energy is also increased, further improving film densification and making the HPPMS technique more attractive for thin-film coatings. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, will receive technology translation experiences through seeing this invention turn into a commercial product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages Starfire Industries Inc., a small business specializing in bridging the "valley of death" to take the design which works in the research lab and turn it into a manufacturable product, and the Kurt J. Lesker Company - a large leading firm in this area. This partnership will enable the technology translation effort from a research discovery toward a commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>
