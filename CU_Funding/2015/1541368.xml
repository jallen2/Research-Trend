    <AbstractNarration>Science data transfers originating from various research labs to other collaborating labs and cloud resources have long been enabled by significant investments in research infrastructure at the university level. However, when a research lab transfers large scientific data sets, many hurdles still exist for research and Information Technology (IT) communities to work together in creating secure topologies for research collaboration. The University of Houston's vision is to enable the abstraction of circuit setup, traffic steering, and leveraging of network functionality for end-users to opt-in to connect their data with researcher labs in a customized fashion with relevant data sharing policies enforced on the topology. This project: (1) deploys network function instantiation (NFI) within main distribution frame (MDF) components at strategic buildings with research labs on university campuses; (2) implements an interdisciplinary data sharing isolated network customized for an air quality and healthcare research use case; and (3) deploys the NFI capability as a pilot on LEARN (Lonestar Education and Research Network) for future support of science data flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has a broad impact across many dimensions: isolated networks per research lab creates an environment for accelerated innovation, free of operational constraints. The proposed prototype research topology supports researchers in eliminating the data sharing problems, with concepts that extend to all research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
