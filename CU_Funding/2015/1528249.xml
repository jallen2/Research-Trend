    <AbstractNarration>Southern Africa is the world's largest emitter of biomass burning aerosols. Their westward transport over the remote southeast Atlantic ocean co-locates some of the largest planetary aerosol loadings with the least examined of the Earth's major stratocumulus decks. While much of the aerosol resides above the boundary layer cloud, free-tropospheric subsidence and marine boundary layer deepening as sea surface temperatures warm imply that absorbing aerosol can also be entrained into the boundary layer. Model representations of the solar-absorbing aerosol cloud- atmosphere-ocean system must consider not only the direct radiative effect, but also radiative changes arising from cloud adjustments to the atmospheric warming and from aerosol cloud microphysical interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ONFIRE (ObservatioNs of Fire's Impact on the southeast atlantic REgion) is a field campaign; the intensive five-week deployment of facilities in the southeast Atlantic is scheduled for September 2017. A coordinated set of hypotheses that improve understanding of biomass burning aerosol composition and absorption, their relationship to cloud-top entrainment, and impact on cloud microphysics, are being examined. The award that is being funded is considered a Scientific Planning Overview document and serves as the scientific basis for the campaign. Individual science proposals will be reviewed separately.</AbstractNarration>
