    <AbstractNarration>Variability is a major characteristic of the mesosphere lower thermosphere (MLT) system (the region between 80 to 120 km), and the sources of this variability are not very well understood. There are two types of atmospheric wave activity seen in this region: short wavelength waves called gravity waves (GW) and long wavelength waves called tidal waves. The science focus of this award work plan is to achieve improved understanding of the possible physical mechanisms that generate short-term tidal wave variability in the MLT region. Particular emphasis in this award research would be placed upon understanding the role of gravity wave variability producing the resulting variations in tidal propagation and tidal wave dissipation characteristics. The expected broader impacts on the space weather community along with the implications for space weather research and educational outreach including K12 and under-represented groups are excellent, especially because the research objective of delineating and understanding short-term tidal variability represents information that is much needed for predictive space weather modelers, an important task for a technological society, as emphasized in the Decadal Survey. The funded research would support a graduate student at Colorado University, Boulder, and second, the lead scientist has described a sound plan to enhance K-12 STEM education with the participation of under-represented groups through the University of Colorado (Boulder) BOLD program, which provides summer courses for high school students. The Principal Investigator has a successful history of mentoring students through similar programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award would analyze and quantify the short-term variability of the diurnal migrating tide in the MLT region using observations derived from the combined TIMED (Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) and Aura/NASA satellite databases combined with measurements of the observed ionospheric response determined from COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) data. Two questions would be addressed in this study: the first being the identification of the physical mechanisms that drive the short-term day-to-day variability of the migrating diurnal tide. The second question is concerned with the overall impact that the day-to-day variability of the migrating diurnal tide has upon the mesosphere-thermosphere-ionosphere system. These observational diagnostics would be supported by meteor radar winds that are in the CEDAR database.</AbstractNarration>
