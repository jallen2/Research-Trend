    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will model the magnetic field in our Milky Way Galaxy. The Galactic Magnetic Fields (GMF) were found to have much larger scale structures than previously thought. The magnetic field extends far above the Galactic plane, much as the magnetic field of the Earth extends far beyond the Earth's surface. These investigations will precisely determine the structure of the GMF, and better-constrain the distribution of cosmic rays (relativistic electrons and atomic nuclei), which are deflected from straight paths by the magnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will continue their work with "WINS", a program to foster women's participation in science, mentor high school students and expand their public lectures on astronomy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of the large scale structure of the GMF and cosmic rays is of fundamental importance for understanding the evolution of galaxies and has implications for understanding the structure and properties of the early universe. It is also of practical importance, for determining how the emission from our galaxy effects Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. This research will build on the groundbreaking work of investigators, who discovered the extended component of the GMF by using two complementary types of available astronomical data, namely 1) Rotation Measures (RMs) of polarized light from distant quasars, and 2) maps of polarized emission from distant clusters of galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the next phase of work the investigators will: 1) Incorporate the Planck Satellite polarized synchrotron emission maps, which will fill in a critical region. 2) Incorporate much more sophisticated and realistic modeling of the cosmic ray distribution. 3) Take advantage of greater computing power to accurately model the disturbed components of the GMF. Their work will be used by physicists studying Dark Matter, either through annihilation or decay, and for identifying the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.</AbstractNarration>
