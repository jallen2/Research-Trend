    <AbstractNarration>Undergraduate research is a high-impact practice that increases retention, fosters academic performance and scientific literacy, increases motivation to study science, and raises STEM graduation rates. This project will test an innovative, cost-effective method, Peer-Assisted Team Research (PATR) that will involve more students in undergraduate research experiences earlier in college, improving their scientific reasoning abilities and STEM self-efficacy. Trained peer leaders will supervise student teams as they design and conduct increasingly complex research studies on interdisciplinary topics. PATR students will master scientific reasoning and seeing themselves as "people who do science," becoming more motivated and taking more STEM courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PATR is an adaptable template useful in a variety of institutional settings: general education and introductory major's courses, STEM classes without labs, and co-curricular activities such as science clubs. Brooklyn College is collaborating with four other branches of City University of New York to evaluate the effectiveness of the PATR method in a variety of settings. The project's intellectual merit resides in the method's grounding in proven STEM pedagogy and current cognitive research. The project's broader impacts stem from enabling more students to participate in undergraduate research experiences, thus fostering a well-trained, diverse work-force. PATR is an adaptable, scalable and cost-effective method that prepares students for faculty-mentored research. The project will generate data using behavioral assessment and standardized test instruments to determine if students participating in PATR are developing the higher-level abstract reasoning abilities required to plan and carry out research, compared with control students.</AbstractNarration>
