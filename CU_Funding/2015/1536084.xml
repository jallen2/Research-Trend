    <AbstractNarration>The Doctoral Student Workshop, co-located with the Third Annual Conference in Cognitive Systems, to be held at Atlanta (GA) in May 2015 aims at encouraging, expanding and guiding the participation of young researchers starting their research in cognitive computing. The Cognitive Systems conference attempts to foster research carried out in the original spirit of AI, which aimed to design and implement computer programs that exhibited the breadth, generality, and flexibility often observed in human intelligence. Cognitive computing recently has major successes represented by well known systems like IBM Watson program and Apple Siri program among many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference sessions and workshops will help develop human research capital by enabling interactions between senior and junior researchers and catalyzing new collaborations. The doctoral student workshop will increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas, and train them by providing early input and feedback in the field in an interactive and constructive environment. The workshop is aimed at early- to mid-career PhDs, specifically those in their second and third year of their PhD.</AbstractNarration>
