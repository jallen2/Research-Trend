    <AbstractNarration>1516346 - Caretta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to provide travel support for students and faculty for the 24th International Symposium for Chemical Reaction Engineering (ISCRE-24) that will be held in Minneapolis, MN, on June 12-15, 2016. This international symposium aims to provide a biannual focus on the frontiers of reaction engineering and an opportunity for international networking in the reaction engineering community. The organizing committee, which consists of members with a broad range of skills in chemical reaction engineering will provide for a vibrant and diverse international symposium. Funds will be utilized in concert with privately raised funds to support the travel of junior faculty and post-docs students to attend the symposium. It is anticipated that approximately 300 attendees will participate based on previous conferences held in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific theme for ISCRE 24 is "Foundations and Vistas in Chemical Reaction Engineering". Meeting the world's demands for energy, food, water and medicine in a sustainable way, while protecting the environment requires development of new technologies and advanced materials. The theme of this symposium is to capture the essential role that chemical reaction engineering plays in addressing these challenges with both a focus on the fundamentals (foundations) and future directions (vistas). The symposium will feature communications of recent research on CRE fundamentals, enabling technologies, and advanced materials such as catalysts, membranes and solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting participants will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and presentations by leading experts, by exchanging the latest advances on frontier research subjects, and by debating controversial points with their peers in the CRE discipline. The meeting will also provide an opportunity for interaction and cooperation among industrial and academic researchers. This will be especially beneficial to the young industrial and academic researchers who attend. The award of travel funds and registration subsidy are expected to attract many graduate students, including women and minority, to the meeting that they may otherwise be unable to attend. These students will have an opportunity to interact with each other and with experienced researchers in the field, which could positively influence their professional development. In order to further attract to the meeting and develop our young colleagues, the PIs plan to increase the number of junior session chairs and have a number of junior keynote speakers.</AbstractNarration>
