    <AbstractNarration>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a clinically important diagnostic procedure, with about half of MRI scans using contrast agents in order to better image differences in tissue. This project will involve the development and initial steps towards commercialization of contrast agents based on iron and cobalt as inexpensive and earth abundant elements. These new contrast agents are unique in that they are designed to switch on in tissue which has characteristics of a disease state. The responsive properties of these contrast agents could be extremely useful for improved diagnostics and treatment. This project will explore the potential of these agents for use in different diseases including cancer and brain injury. The team of three (academic PI, entrepreneurial lead and business mentor) will interview radiologists, medical doctors, insurance company representatives, MRI scanner manufacturers and MRI technicians to determine the factors that go into the development and marketing of new contrast agents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the I-CORPS program, a team has been assembled to investigate the potential commercialization of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents based on iron(II)/iron(III) and cobalt(II). The contrast agents are paramagnetic metal ion complexes that produce signal through chemical exchange saturation transfer (paraCEST). The proposed paraCEST agents are coordination complexes that can be tuned for redox potential and spin state. Furthermore, paraCEST agents generally produce contrast which is pH and temperature responsive. The proposed project will explore the possibility of commercializing these new contrast agents for 1) diagnosis of extent of tumor hypoxia as well as extracellular pH and 2) mapping traumatic brain injury which is thought to involve the production of reactive oxygen species and to affect redox status of tissue. The team will study the factors that go into making decisions on the commercialization of contrast agents and new diagnostic procedures by interviewing medical doctors, radiologists, MRI company representatives, and insurance company representatives. Potential outcomes include a refined focus on the development of contrast agents for new diagnostic procedures, a business plan for proceeding with the commercialization of the agents, as well as new collaborations and networks. Commercialization of these contrast agents may create new jobs towards meeting the long term goal of substituting current technologies that use rare earth elements of limited supply.</AbstractNarration>
