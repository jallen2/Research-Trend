    <AbstractNarration>General Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State governments are commonly referred to as "laboratories of democracy?"because for many&lt;br/&gt;decades they have experimented with new policy solutions to society's most important problems.&lt;br/&gt;Public policy scholars and practitioners of politics often look to the states for innovative policies&lt;br/&gt;that can be emulated by other governments across the country; a process referred to as policy&lt;br/&gt;diffusion. However, the complex relationships between the states (that is, the patterns,&lt;br/&gt;pathways, and mechanisms underlying how policies actually diffuse from one state to another)&lt;br/&gt;are not well understood. In this research, the PIs develop innovative tools and&lt;br/&gt;data to facilitate the large-scale computational and data-intensive study of policy diffusion. They&lt;br/&gt;seek to develop and utilize the largest database on states' decisions to adopt policies to better&lt;br/&gt;understand which states are policy leaders, which are policy followers, and why. This will&lt;br/&gt;provide a novel, expansive, and systematic view of the policy diffusion process that covers the&lt;br/&gt;American states. As a result, policymakers and other interested stakeholders will have access to a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive look at the spread of innovation among state governments regarding financial,&lt;br/&gt;environmental, health, security, and other social problem domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Aspects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to make three central contributions to the study of public policy diffusion.&lt;br/&gt;First, it will produce a database on the adoption of hundreds of policies in the American states, at&lt;br/&gt;least tripling the size of the largest database currently available and yielding a sample of policies&lt;br/&gt;that is more representative of the universe of policies for which states make laws. It will also&lt;br/&gt;leverage these new data to map and analyze the network pathways according to which policies&lt;br/&gt;diffuse (i.e., establish states that are leaders and followers in the diffusion of policies). As&lt;br/&gt;recently published research by the principal investigators shows, cutting-edge computational&lt;br/&gt;methods can be applied to large databases containing information on when policies were adopted&lt;br/&gt;by which governments in order to identify underlying networks along which policies persistently&lt;br/&gt;diffuse. Another key contribution from this research is to improve upon the existing method for&lt;br/&gt;inferring network ties in ways that are most suitable for policy diffusion research (as well as&lt;br/&gt;social science more generally) and implement it in a user-friendly package in the R statistical&lt;br/&gt;environment. A final contribution, which is intended to maximize the potential user-base of these&lt;br/&gt;data and methods, will be to build an interactive online portal to the data, complete with&lt;br/&gt;visualizations and automated analytics.</AbstractNarration>
