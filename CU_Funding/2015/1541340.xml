    <AbstractNarration>The University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, and New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology are working together to deliver regional workshops in support of statewide planning for research networking. This collaborative effort by New Mexicoís research universities educates, encourages adoption, and provides on-site technical expertise to implement advanced networking and cyberinfrastructure (CI) to enhance and support STEM research and education at small, remote colleges and universities in New Mexico. Invitations to attend workshops are extended to institutions of higher education in adjacent regions of Arizona and Texas who share similar demographics, topography, and challenges; and to State of New Mexico Economic Development Department, the New Mexico regional Councils of Governments, the New Mexico Department of Information Technology, and other departments of city, county and state government because, in New Mexico's rural areas, municipal governments and tribal entities are instrumental in bringing broadband into underserved areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The essential partnership between educational entities, research entities, and state and local governments ensures the cost-effective build-out of advanced networking in this underserved region, enabling researchers located in remote communities to thrive, and improving education (including distance education) in a state where many students are the first in their families to attend college.</AbstractNarration>
