    <AbstractNarration>Non Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;Advanced materials for many applications ranging from superalloy turbine blades to microelectronics to new therapeutics for malaria depend on a fundamental understanding of crystal nucleation and growth. This conference seeks to gather leading scientists representing the major areas in the field of crystallization and to bring them into contact with each other and, more importantly, with the next generation of researchers in the field. This year, a particular focus of the conference will be on the development and application of high-resolution, in situ characterization techniques that can provide mechanistic insights, and how this unprecedented visualization of crystal nucleation and growth can lead to the development of important new materials with desired properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the organizers of the 2015 Gordon Research Conference on Crystal Growth &amp; Assembly will provide scholarships for students and postdoctoral to participate in the conference and join the "Crystal Growth" community. This conference is focused on developing an understanding of the fundamental atomic and nanoscale physics and chemistry that are central to the nucleation and growth of crystals for a wide array of technologies. This year, the conference will specifically address five specific areas: (1) The role of self-assembly and pattern formation in crystallization, (2) Vapor-liquid-solid growth of nanostructures, (3) Inorganic/organic interactions at interfaces that control shape and function, (4) In situ methods to observe nucleation and growth, and (5) Design of materials for use in energy and biomedical technologies. To this end, the conference brings together scientists from industry, national laboratories and academia to discuss the latest advances and challenges in Crystal Growth and Assembly.</AbstractNarration>
