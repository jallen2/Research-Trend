    <AbstractNarration>This proposal investigates properties of newly formed massive clusters of stars, which are thought to be analogs of the large star clusters (so-called "globular clusters") that formed very early in the history of our Milky Way Galaxy and many other galaxies. The team will acquire molecular-line and dust-continuum data, using the most advanced millimeter and submillimeter radio telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, to investigate the star formation efficiency in these young massive clusters. Characterizing this efficiency has important ramifications for a star cluster's survivability, as well as for how star formation will progress near the cluster and throughout its host galaxy. The team's low-resolution pilot study of a young massive cluster hints at a surprisingly efficient conversion of gas into stars. To make progress, that cluster and a similar one will be studied with the high angular resolution and sensitivity that have only recently become available for southerly clusters. A low-resolution study of a northerly cluster will also be undertaken to begin exploring this important topic in a third setting. The PI will continue her successful efforts to involve women and other underrepresented groups in her research. She will also continue to give public talks</AbstractNarration>
