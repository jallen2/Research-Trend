    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for participation in three conferences on number theory held at institutions in the Southeast in 2015 and 2016. The 24th Palmetto Number Theory Series meeting will be held at Emory University in Atlanta, GA in September 2015, and the 25th Palmetto Number Theory Series meeting will be held at Clemson University in Clemson, SC in December 2015. The 29th Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers will be held in the spring of 2016. These conferences are open and free to all participants, who include mathematicians of all levels: undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and junior and senior faculty. The meetings provide a valuable opportunity for regional graduate students and for faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions, who may have few or no other opportunities for professional travel. The meetings will continue to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and members of other groups underrepresented in mathematics. More details for the 2016 29th Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers, including exact dates, a list of speakers, the location, and registration information will be posted on the conference websites as it becomes available:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html &lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the conferences features several invited talks, given by number theorists based outside the region, ranging from prominent researchers to graduate students. Speakers will be chosen to represent a broad range of active research interests within number theory. Each meeting will also feature contributed talks given by participants from within the region. The primary goal of these meetings is to provide the number theory community in the Southeast the opportunity to hear about recent research in number theory. The meetings attract prominent number theorists based outside the region, and provide regional mathematicians, particularly graduate students and junior faculty, with an opportunity to speak about their research. The meetings inspire collaboration and broaden the scope of existing research interests within the general subject of number theory.</AbstractNarration>
