    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville entitled "Advanced Materials for Energy and Sensing Applications at the University of Tennessee" that is led by Professors Michael D. Best and Shawn R. Campagna. The site offers an intensive introductory research experience for undergraduate students which is designed to introduce and train participants in modern research techniques and also mentor them in the development of complementary professional skills that are critical for successful scientific careers. In this way, the program strengthens the scientific enterprise in the United States by recruiting students and developing them into skilled researchers at an early point in their education. Further, the program emphasizes the inclusion of a diverse group of participants to address the underrepresentation of various demographic groups in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this program, participating students have the opportunity to choose from a wide range of research projects that revolve around the common theme of advanced materials for energy and sensing applications. This allows students to contribute to important cutting-edge research projects that have a positive impact on the general public while simultaneously advancing their scientific training. The broader impacts of this project include the development of a well-trained and diverse set of talented students primed for future contributions to research as well as the publicizing of the achievements of participating students through the efforts of a journalist who is embedded within the program.</AbstractNarration>
