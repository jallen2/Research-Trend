    <AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge in the field of environmental science in regions that directly impact quality of life in Indian country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sitting Bull College (SBC) has begun the process of developing a Master of Science Degree (MS)in the Environmental Science (ENS) Program. Goal 1 of this project is to increase recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students by enhancing the quality of ENS student experiences in research at all academic levels through the development of a Master of Science Degree. This will be done by improving the research experience for all ENS students from the development of an MS degree. Goal 2 is to train a diversified work force in STEM fields for the Standing Rock community that has leadership skills and is trained in the use of state-of-the-art technology in diverse areas, such as water quality, pollution science, ecology, and climate change. A cohort model will be used for academic and research activities. Different cohorts will address different research topics. The result will be an educated work force trained in the latest technology in diverse areas of ENS. Goal 3 is to expand interest in STEM fields to a wider spectrum of students through innovative recruitment and retention programs, international research programs and culturally appropriate curricula. This will be accomplished by Middle School Science Academy programs, a research program in Costa Rica, and development of culturally relevant course and other materials.</AbstractNarration>
