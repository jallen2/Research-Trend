    <AbstractNarration>The user interfaces (UIs) of a web application serve an important role&lt;br/&gt;in the success of online companies. Studies have shown that the&lt;br/&gt;aesthetics of an application?s UIs can strongly influence users?&lt;br/&gt;overall evaluation of a company; in particular impressions of&lt;br/&gt;trustworthiness and usability. Presentation failures ? a discrepancy&lt;br/&gt;between the actual appearance of a web site and its intended&lt;br/&gt;appearance ? can undermine this effort and negatively impact end&lt;br/&gt;users? perception of the quality of the site, the services it&lt;br/&gt;delivers, and affect the branding a company is trying to achieve.&lt;br/&gt;Debugging presentation failures is typically a manual task where&lt;br/&gt;testers must identify when the layout and style of an app?s pages is&lt;br/&gt;incorrect and developers must carry out repairs. This process is both&lt;br/&gt;labor intensive and error prone: testers can easily miss presentation&lt;br/&gt;failures, since the process is based on the testers? visual comparison&lt;br/&gt;of a page and an oracle; and it can be difficult for developers to&lt;br/&gt;identify the responsible HTML elements or properties once a failure is&lt;br/&gt;detected, since HTML and CSS interact in complex ways. In this&lt;br/&gt;research effort the PIs will investigate automated techniques to help&lt;br/&gt;testers more accurately detect presentation failures and efficiently&lt;br/&gt;identify the faulty code. Given the widespread deployment of web&lt;br/&gt;applications, this work will impact both end users and software&lt;br/&gt;developers by reducing errors in these applications and making the&lt;br/&gt;debugging process more effective and efficient. The results of this&lt;br/&gt;research will also impact educational efforts through the training of&lt;br/&gt;future software engineering in new techniques to improve the quality&lt;br/&gt;of web applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical research will encompass two general areas. The first&lt;br/&gt;area of research will advance techniques for detecting presentation&lt;br/&gt;failures. The primary mechanism for doing this will be to apply&lt;br/&gt;computer vision techniques to automatically identify discrepancies&lt;br/&gt;between the actual rendered appearance of a UI and its intended&lt;br/&gt;appearance. The developed techniques will be widely applicable to a&lt;br/&gt;range of UIs, including those with dynamic content and those using&lt;br/&gt;different specification mechanisms for UI oracles. The second area of&lt;br/&gt;research will use the identified differences to identify the specific&lt;br/&gt;elements in the UI code that are responsible for the observed&lt;br/&gt;failures. The research efforts will focus on using artificial&lt;br/&gt;intelligence techniques, such as search-based and statistical-based&lt;br/&gt;learning, on the UI?s layout models to reason about the UI?s possible&lt;br/&gt;faults and guide the developers to identify the faulty HTML elements&lt;br/&gt;and CSS properties.</AbstractNarration>
