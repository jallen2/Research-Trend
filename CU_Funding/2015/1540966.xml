    <AbstractNarration>The ability to find, access, and visualize data is critical to many kinds of oceanographic research, as well as to teaching oceanography. Yet ocean data is held in multiple data facilities, in different formats, and is accessible through different pathways. This creates practical problems with integrating and working across different data sets. The SeaView project is building connections between the rich data resources in five major oceanographic data facilities - R2R, BCO-DMO, CCHDO, OBIS and OOI* - and an ocean data visualization and exploration tool, the Ocean Data View (ODV), having over 40,000 registered users. To do so, it is leveraging from NSF investments into two previous EarthCube projects: CINERGI, as the registry where users will find and access data they wish to use, and GeoLink, which is providing interconnections between existing data resources, allowing users to explore a knowledge base of related information. SeaView leverages existing resources to provide improved tools and data access in support of fundamental research in two areas of ocean sciences: deep water hydrography and marine community-environment interactions. Both feed directly into research identified by the 2015 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences as of the highest priority. It will also engage scientists from currently underrepresented communities in EarthCube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific oceanographic communities targeted are deep water hydrographers and marine ecologists, particularly those studying species interactions with the environment. Near the start of the project, a set of three focus groups and a Science Drivers workshop composed of end-user scientists from these communities will prioritize the specific datasets and develop science scenarios (use cases). They will meet again mid-stream for hands-on testing of the tool and feedback. The CINERGI registry will be used to expose ODV-supported formats from these repositories to ODV. The EarthCube GeoLink knowledge base will provide links to additional content (investigators, publications, etc.) for cruise-related datasets loaded in ODV.</AbstractNarration>
