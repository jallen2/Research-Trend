    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty presenters at the 5th International Conference on Self-Healing Materials (ICSHM), Durham, North Carolina, June 22-24, 2015. ICSHM is a biennial conference focusing on advances in self-healing materials science, engineering, and technological applications. The conference provides a forum for knowledge dissemination focused solely on self-healing materials, bringing together the representatives from different communities that share interests and challenges, but that would otherwise mix infrequently. This support will have a significant impact by encouraging broad participation of young scientists from traditionally disconnected science and engineering disciplines. All student and postdoctoral recipients will be expected to present at the meeting, supporting their professional development. The conference organizers will actively recruit participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences and engineering. Active participation is further encouraged by student poster awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of ICSHM2015 encompasses all classes of self-healing materials including polymers, ceramics, metals, and composites, while bio-inspiration serves to guide potential future research advances. A broad spectrum of industries are impacted and represented by the field including aerospace, automotive, transportation, microelectronics, architecture, electronics, medicine, and manufacturing. ICSHM2015 will introduce the community to the newly emerging field of self-healing biomaterials and biomedical implants. Expanding the range of length scales accessible by self-healing strategies is a new and emerging trend, and special symposia on the extreme ends of self-healing length scales will be featured: large-volume approaches and truly molecular approaches that address damage at the level of individual polymer sub-chains, interfaces, and grain boundaries. The following scientific areas are covered: Anticorrosion coatings and paints; Bio-inspired materials; Cementitious materials; Coatings &amp; paints; Fiber-reinforced composite materials; Functional applications; Materials characterization; Mechanochemistry; Metallic materials; Microvascular systems; Modeling &amp; numerical analysis; Supramolecular polymers; Thermoplastics/thermosets; Energy harvesting and storage; Self-reinforcing gels; 3D printing and self-healing systems; Expanding range of length scales; Large volume repair; Biomaterials; Self-healing at high temperatures.</AbstractNarration>
