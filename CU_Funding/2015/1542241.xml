    <AbstractNarration>Recent research indicates a nanofiber-based filtration system can potentially provide an effective, efficient, and easy-to-use water purification technology. Fundamentally, nanofiber-based materials make ideal filters due to inherent properties, such as: extremely high surface area to volume ratios, high levels of porosity, and high levels of surface interactions and cohesion. While the societal benefits of nanofibers are clear, the barrier to commercialization lies in the difficulty of shifting manufacturing from the laboratory setting to full-scale mass production. Currently the most popular method of nanofiber production is electrospinning, which is very difficult to scale-up. Recently, this team has developed a polymer processing system capable of producing nonwoven mats of composite polymer fibers. Unique to this process is the ability to strictly control the number and thickness of alternating layers within the fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this NSF I-Corps Team project is to identify a potential market to commercialize a new form of nonwoven polymer nano-composites. These new fiber materials are created using a novel melt-blowing process that offers a scalable and environmental friendly approach. The nature of the process allows for the processing of various types of polymers with multiple functionalities creating a large number of opportunities for the development of new products. With such a wide range of potential applications, and based on initial research, the team's initial focus has been directed to the liquid filtration industry. Initially, the team has identified the potential for these fibers to replace those used in ?plate and frame filters? utilized in the final steps of processing waste water in the micro-brewing industry.</AbstractNarration>
