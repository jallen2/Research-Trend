    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0846408&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Anna Wienhard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed project is to further develop the&lt;br/&gt;emerging field of higher Teichmueller theory. Higher Teichmueller&lt;br/&gt;spaces are connected components of the variety of representations&lt;br/&gt;of the fundamental group of a surface into semisimple Lie groups,&lt;br/&gt;which share essential properties with Teichmueller&lt;br/&gt;space. Classical Teichmueller space plays an important role in&lt;br/&gt;various fields of mathematics due to its rich structure and the&lt;br/&gt;fact that it is a smooth cover of the moduli space of Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. For higher Teichmueller spaces many potentially&lt;br/&gt;interesting structures are yet to be discovered and the relation&lt;br/&gt;to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces still needs to be&lt;br/&gt;clarified. The proposed research focusses on identifying the&lt;br/&gt;geometric objects (similar to hyperbolic surfaces in the case of&lt;br/&gt;classical Teichmueller space) which are parametrized by higher&lt;br/&gt;Teichmueller spaces. These objects will then be used to define&lt;br/&gt;algebraic, geometric and dynamical structures on higher&lt;br/&gt;Teichmueller spaces, and we expect that they will help to&lt;br/&gt;construct a natural map from higher Teichmueller spaces to&lt;br/&gt;classical Teichmueller space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teichmueller space is the space of all geometric surfaces with a&lt;br/&gt;fixed combinatorial type. Because it parametrizes all surfaces,&lt;br/&gt;Teichmueller space is a fundamental mathematical object which&lt;br/&gt;also plays an important role in theoretical physics. Every point&lt;br/&gt;in Teichmueller space corresponds to a tiling of the Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;plane, the two-dimensional sphere or in most cases the hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;plane by one polygon and its images under subsequent reflections&lt;br/&gt;in the sides. (Nice pictures inspired by such tilings appear in&lt;br/&gt;M.C. Escher's work.) The combinatorial type of the surface is&lt;br/&gt;determined by the number of vertices of the polygon and the&lt;br/&gt;gluing data, but the geometry of the surface depends on the&lt;br/&gt;length of the sides and the angles at the vertices of the&lt;br/&gt;polygon. Teichmueller space is the example of a moduli space of a&lt;br/&gt;pattern (the tiling) with rich symmetries (the reflections in the&lt;br/&gt;side of the polygon). Such moduli spaces can be efficiently&lt;br/&gt;studied via the group generated by the symmetries of the&lt;br/&gt;pattern. Higher Teichmueller spaces are moduli spaces of more&lt;br/&gt;complicated patterns in higher dimensional spaces. However, the&lt;br/&gt;symmetry group of these patterns is the same as the symmetry&lt;br/&gt;group of the tilings associated to classical Teichmueller&lt;br/&gt;space. Therefore one expects higher Teichmueller spaces to&lt;br/&gt;parametrize geometric objects which are not surfaces themselves,&lt;br/&gt;but closely related to surfaces. The proposed research focusses&lt;br/&gt;on identifying these geometric objects and studying their finer&lt;br/&gt;structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes various activities to involve graduate&lt;br/&gt;students in research and teaching, as for instance a yearly&lt;br/&gt;mathematical retreat for graduate students to study, explore and&lt;br/&gt;present a mathematical topic in a group, and small workshops with&lt;br/&gt;mini-courses which allow graduate students to get insight into&lt;br/&gt;the working of modern research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
