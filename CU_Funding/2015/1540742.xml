    <AbstractNarration>PI: Kaplan, David L. &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1540742&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for Travel Awards to Young Investigators, Graduate Students and Undergraduate Students to attend the 2015 Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society - World Congress (TERMIS-WC) Annual Meeting is to be held on September 8-11, 2015, in Boston, Massachusetts. A total of 58 participants will be supported through funds that will be used to partially cover registration fees and transportation expenses. The 2015 TERMIS-WC Meeting is co-chaired by Dr. David Kaplan at Tufts University and Dr. Kacey Marra at the University of Pittsburgh. The co-chairs are both established researchers in the areas of tissue engineering and biomaterials, and they are committed to supporting undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is an emerging interdisciplinary field with the potential to revolutionize clinical treatments and therapies for a variety of diseases. The TERMIS-WC Meeting is a key meeting of the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society, and it is estimated to bring together approximately 2000 international researchers, scientists, clinicians, trainees, and students from both academia and industry to present and discuss key developments in the field. The meeting therefore integrates and disseminates cutting edge research in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Keynote speakers are leaders in the field and technical and poster sessions include presentations on the latest advances. A strong role in the meeting planning and execution will be played by the TERMIS Student and Young Investigator Section (SYIS). The conference will provide ample opportunities for students, investigators and clinicians to learn the latest advances in the tissue engineering and regenerative medicine fields and incorporate them in their educational, research and development, and clinical activities. Special emphasis will be given to the participation of students, young investigators, investigators from underrepresented groups, and women investigators. Activities are planned that target these groups and aim to enhance their training, mentorship, career development, and job search. The findings from the workshop will be disseminated through the workshop website and the journal Tissue Engineering (the official journal of TERMIS) website. This proposal is co-funded by the Biomedical Engineering Program and by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program, both in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Division.</AbstractNarration>
