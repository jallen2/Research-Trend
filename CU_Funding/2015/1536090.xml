    <AbstractNarration>GENI, the Global Environment for Network Innovations, is a suite of research infrastructure that spans facilities across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large social-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for "at scale" experiments in future internets. Nationwide experiments began in Summer 2010. In the intervening five years, GENI has shown rapid growth in adoption by experimental researchers and is now expanding to over 50 GENI-enabled campuses. In addition, via programs such as Campus CyberInfrastructure and US Ignite, GENI technologies are being actively used to advance national science capabilities and to imagine and design next generation applications that address national priorities. Via commercialization of technologies such as Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization GENI has had a significant economic impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the transition of GENI from a building phase overseen by the GENI Program Office (GPO) to an operational status managed by community organizations. As part of the project, the GPO will broadly engage the U.S. computer systems research community to develop a community consensus-based plan for transition. In conjunction with NSF the organizational structure identified by this plan will be established and GENI operations transferred with the project supporting operational expenses during the transition period.</AbstractNarration>
