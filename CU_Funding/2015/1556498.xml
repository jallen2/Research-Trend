    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project could be very significant for the field of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other optoelectronics. This project is aimed at developing a solution based technology for depositing transparent conductive zinc oxide (ZnO) layers for use in LEDs and other optoelectronic devices. This ZnO deposition technology has potential to provide a lower cost and higher performance alternative to the physical vapor deposited indium tin oxide (PVD-ITO) layers that are currently used. The technology could be commercialized for LED manufacturing in only a few years. Lighting is one of the modern world's primary usages of energy and the adoption of high efficiency LED lighting has potential to significantly reduce lighting energy demand. By lowering manufacturing cost and improving performance, the technology developed in this project can help increase LED adoption and energy savings. In the longer term, this technology may also be used to lower manufacturing cost and improve performance of solar cells, impacting clean energy supply as well as demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at commercializing a technology which addresses the problem of Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) film performance and cost, in particular for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other Gallium Nitride based optoelectronics. This proposal aims to bring a solution based method for depositing Zinc Oxide (ZnO) based TCO films to the point of commercial competiveness, with the longer term goal of providing significantly lower materials, energy, and capital equipment costs than current deposition methods and TCO materials. The approach being taken in the proposal relies on well understood characterization techniques as methods of determining successfulness as well as direct feedback from device manufacturers. The small business has the support and validation of strategic partnerships with device manufacturers eager to support this development of this technology.</AbstractNarration>
