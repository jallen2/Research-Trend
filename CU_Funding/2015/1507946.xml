    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Kent Kirshenbaum at New York University to extend recent discoveries of synthetic polymers that mimic biological macromolecules. The underlying hypothesis is that synthetic polymer systems can be imbued with a "folding code" a predictable relationship between the sequence of the units in the polymer and a unique three-dimensional structure. The study will yield new families of functional folded molecules that can be used to create advanced materials and will lead to innovative strategies for drug discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus will be investigations of peptoids, which are sequence-specific polymers composed of diverse N-substituted glycine monomer units. Previous studies have demonstrated that certain peptoids exhibit a propensity to adopt discrete stable conformations, resembling the helical and turn motifs found in polypeptides. The goals for this renewal are to move beyond rudimentary peptoid secondary structures to create synthetic peptoid macromolecules that resemble the complex tertiary structures of proteins and consequently allow the design of new functional capabilities. The long-term objectives are to establish a predictable relationship between the sequence, the structure and the function of peptoid polymers. A collaboration with York College in New York City will provide research opportunities for students in under-represented groups. In addition, the project will continue science outreach programs by the "Experimental Cuisine Collective" at NYU, which introduces concepts in macromolecular sciences through the popular context of food and cooking. The broader impacts feature societal benefits attained through training the next generation of polymer scientists, along with addressing unmet needs in molecular pharmacology and synthetic biology.</AbstractNarration>
