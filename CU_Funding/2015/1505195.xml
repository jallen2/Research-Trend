    <AbstractNarration>Both public and private agencies have a need to identify psychological attributes that can lead to potentially undesired behavior or best-fit in the organization. Communities across the US and throughout the world are looking for new approaches to protect against&lt;br/&gt;potentially dangerous behaviors. Cyber threats specific to our military, privacy, personal safety, financial security, and national security are initiated by human factors. Language used reveals the tendency of a user's behavior, which provides a window into the potential stability, dependability, and trustworthiness of an individual. The ability to identify potentially harmful human behavior before it is acted out becomes increasingly viable. The need for increased intervention measures by appropriate authorities before undesired behavior surfaces must be addressed. By measuring trustworthiness, organizational insider threats can be mitigated. By screening military personnel, stress-related disorders can be identified early on. By understanding students' disposition, cyber-bullying behavior can be recognized in order to safeguard students. By paying attention to the disposition of law enforcement personnel, community interactions can be less contentious and more effective. This I-Corps team has developed a methodology to identify threatening human disposition and deceptive motivation through analysis of online communication behavior&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology has the ability to extract actors' language-action features based on their online communication to establish dyadic attribution models of trustworthiness. During interactive game playing, the technology analyzes online actors' choices based on their online conversations, to discern their communicative intent. The language-action features will feed a causality reasoning system where&lt;br/&gt;the trustworthiness of the social actor is analyzed and updated in a recursive Bayesian inference framework. The analysis from this dyadic attribution model has the potential for assessing threatening human disposition and intent (e.g., disgruntled) based on information behavior. The further utilization of this model is to apply in similar instances such as identifying actors with tendencies for suicide, murder,rage, and violence based on their online behavior. With this product, the authorities can analyze psychological stability and respond when necessary to provide counseling so that tragic consequences can</AbstractNarration>
