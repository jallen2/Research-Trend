    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this Noyce Teacher Scholarship and Stipend project is to increase the pool of highly qualified STEM teachers in central Maryland. Faculty from Montgomery College's STEM divisions as well as the School of Education will work with Montgomery County Public Schools to support two strands of development: the first will include the recruitment and support of 39 STEM professionals as they transition into STEM teaching positions, the second will expand outreach to encourage undergraduate STEM majors to transfer to STEM teacher preparation programs at regional four-year institutions. The alternative teacher preparation program for career changers involves intensive pre-service training and a teaching internship flowed by a year-long residency. The project will integrate a variety of elements to address challenges faced by students enrolled in this rigorous course of study, including (a) orientation materials that address the time commitment, (b) increased assessment and feedback to students designed to bolster their self-efficacy and personal confidence, and (c) assignment to field placements with peer partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key aspects of the project are designed to respond to an analysis of barriers for transfer students' enrollment in STEM majors after leaving Montgomery College and the retention of career changers in their alternative teacher preparation program, which was supported by a Noyce Capacity Building award. For community college transfers, a comprehensive plan has been designed to align coursework between Montgomery College and regional 4-year institutions; a strategy meant to strengthen the pool of STEM majors who will be attracted to teaching. For the scholarship recipients (career changers) everything from the selection process, during which applicants will be pre-screened using results of the Haberman Star Teacher Pre-Screener Assessment to determine if their mindsets are compatible with teaching in high-needs schools, to the training activities are designed to graduate STEM teachers who are both confident and resilient. Formative and summative evaluation will include the results of assessment of the surveys of program participants, internship supervisors, and mentor teachers and principals as well as teacher performance during the resident year. Surveys and interviews will also be used to assess self-efficacy of the participants and to identify their best-perceived supports. Program activities and outcomes will be disseminated through the meetings of the National Association of Community College Teacher Education Programs and the National Center for Education Information, among others. Manuscripts will be submitted to the Journal of STEM Education and the Journal of the National Association for Alternative Certification.</AbstractNarration>
