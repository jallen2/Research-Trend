    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical description:&lt;br/&gt;At temperatures near absolute zero, superconductors conduct electricity without any resistance. This property is a consequence of a particular interaction between electrons, which causes the electrons to organize themselves into a collective state that renders them immune to scattering. In nanoscale samples, the nature of this collective state is fragile and can be manipulated by controlling the physical properties of the samples and their environment. Using custom developed fabrication and measurement techniques with unprecedented capabilities, this project aims to design, manipulate and investigate collective quantum states of electrons in superconducting nanowires. While serving to train students on cutting edge nanofabrication and low-temperature measurement techniques, the research is focused on creating a model system for a fundamental study of collective quantum states of electrons that will bring about the possibilities of applications in novel logic, sensing and quantum computing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to tailor and tune the texture of the superconducting order parameter by controlling the texture, the underlying potentials and the boundary conditions. The research team has developed a dynamic stencil deposition and controlled etching techniques, which are used to achieve precise control over the size and physical texture of the nanowires, while graphene and topological insulator materials provide a tunable electrostatic environment and a spin texture, respectively. The tunability of this model system provides exciting opportunities to address unanswered questions, but also to create new quantum states of matter that have not been studied or even considered before, possibly bringing about a paradigm shift in the study of quantum phase transitions. The main goal is to create and control new quantum states, contribute to fundamental understanding of quantum matter, and harness the quantum degrees of freedom for a host of possible applications.</AbstractNarration>
