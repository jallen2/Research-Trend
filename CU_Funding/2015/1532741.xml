    <AbstractNarration>A three-day international meeting titled First Latin American International Statistical Institute Satellite Meeting on Small Area Estimation will take place in Santiago, Chile, during August 3-5, 2015. The meeting will serve as an official meeting of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) and International Association of Survey Statisticians (IASS) and will provide its members and a large international group of statisticians and social scientists a unique opportunity to meet and exchange ideas on small area estimation, a growing interdisciplinary field with a wide range of real life applications. The meeting will include a strong mentoring component for students and young researchers working on small area estimation and related areas. The meeting aims to provide a forum for leading experts and young researchers to discuss recent progress in small area estimation, thereby providing new directions for small area estimation in various fields. This award provides partial travel support and registration for graduate students from U.S. institutions to attend and participate in this meeting in order to disseminate their research and develop collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this meeting is to bring together both well-established and emerging young researchers from around the world who are actively pursuing theoretical and methodological research in small area estimation and their applications. The meeting will have an excellent slate of invited, special topic, contributed, and poster sessions covering a wide variety of topics in small area estimation. These include resampling methods, hierarchical modeling, time series, higher-order asymptotics, and different real life applications. In addition, a poster session will be held, which will provide an opportunity for junior faculty and students to showcase their research work. This should lead to acceleration and enhancement of research for participants. The meeting will also be a fitting promotion of the role of small area estimation methodology in science.
