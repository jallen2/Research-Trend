    <AbstractNarration>This project concerns efficient parallel algorithms and software for&lt;br/&gt;emerging and future data analysis and mining applications, based on an&lt;br/&gt;emerging class of techniques known as tensor networks. Tensors, which&lt;br/&gt;are higher-dimensional generalizations of matrices, are finding&lt;br/&gt;applications in signal and image processing, computer vision,&lt;br/&gt;healthcare analytics, and neuroscience, to name just a few. Yet&lt;br/&gt;despite this demand, there is no comprehensive, high-performance&lt;br/&gt;software infrastructure targeting server systems that may have many&lt;br/&gt;parallel processors. Thus, the overarching research goal of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to design the first such infrastructure. The resulting&lt;br/&gt;prototype will be an open-source package, called the Parallel Tensor&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure, or ParTI! The broader impact of the ParTI! project is&lt;br/&gt;to make the use of tensors, in a variety of data processing domains,&lt;br/&gt;much easier to do and more widespread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ParTI! project will focus specifically on algorithmic and software&lt;br/&gt;support for sparse tensors on single-node multi- and many-core&lt;br/&gt;accelerated platforms. The technical approach relies on a specific way&lt;br/&gt;of representing tensors, referred to as tensor networks. A tensor&lt;br/&gt;network is an efficient approach for representing the structure of a&lt;br/&gt;high-order tensor or tensor factorization. It can used by the data&lt;br/&gt;analyst as a simple, high-level way to express the specific structure&lt;br/&gt;or relationships he or she seeks in the data that the tensor&lt;br/&gt;represents. However, a tensor network is not just a tool for the&lt;br/&gt;analyst; it is also an abstract intermediate form, from which it is&lt;br/&gt;possible to derive algorithms, express and manage parallelism, and&lt;br/&gt;semi-automatically generate tensor processing software. This insight,&lt;br/&gt;combined with well-known data layout and communication-avoiding&lt;br/&gt;parallelization techniques from high-performance sparse linear&lt;br/&gt;algebra, is what will enable a ParTI! for tensor-based data&lt;br/&gt;analysis. The project will show the utility of this approach by&lt;br/&gt;evaluating the ParTI! prototype on real data sets and systems, through&lt;br/&gt;collaborations with government research laboratory and industry&lt;br/&gt;partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at: parti-project.org</AbstractNarration>
