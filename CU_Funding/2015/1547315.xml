    <AbstractNarration>Dr. David Chicoine and doctoral candidate Ms. Kimberly Munro, both of Louisiana State University, examine the long-term use of ceremonial landscapes and construction of religious buildings in the ancient Andes. Their research focuses on the persistence of sacred monuments as places of public gatherings, collective memory, social interactions, and political negotiation. Archaeology is particularly well positioned to provide longitudinal perspectives on religious and political movements and their role in shaping the trajectory of ancient civilizations, especially their material manifestations. Such traditions in many regions of the world continue up to the present day and play an important role in shaping peoples' behaviors. Thus studies such as this one have relevance in a modern day context. In the Central Andes, the unique mountainous terrain has shaped the development of subsistence strategies, trade and religious networks. Previous archaeological research has focused either on the Pacific coast or the high elevation plains, lagoons, and mountain peaks, leaving mid-elevation regions under studied. Yet, these regions provide unique geographic conditions, ecologies, and landscapes with significant potential to become valued and powerful agents of symbolic constructs and religious worship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers employ mapping and excavation methods to study successive episodes of monumental ceremonial constructions at the Cosma Archaeological Complex, a basin located 2600 meters above sea level in the upper reaches of the Nepeña Valley, north-central Peru. Data from architectural designs, visual arts, ritual objects, mortuary contexts, landscape features and occupation sequences are used to shed light on the development of local identities, their materialities, and relation to overarching political networks from the late Preceramic Period (3000-1800 BCE) to the Early Horizon (900-100 BCE). Ultimately, the project examines the rise to regional prominence of a ritual, and likely pilgrimage center with a long and persistent history of religious influence. Previous archaeological work has often focused on the collapse and regeneration of polities and associated ideologies. Instead, this project seeks to understand the stability of a place over time and the changing influences of trends that go in and out of favor. Data obtained may shed light on the plurality of identity in zones of dynamic cultural interactions. This project will produce comparative data of interest to broad sections of anthropology and archaeology. It will provide training to doctoral candidate Ms. Kimberly Munro, as well as generate primary data for her PhD dissertation. All primary data will be stored permanently and made publicly accessible. Results will be disseminated through various venues including official field reports, peer-review manuscripts and conference papers. Finally, the researchers will help train US and Peruvian students in archaeological field techniques. Such collaborations strengthen academic bonds between US and Peruvian institutions and have broader impacts for the development international relationships.</AbstractNarration>
