    <AbstractNarration>The uppermost soil layer that covers the Earth's surface controls important processes, including how rainfall turns into runoff that can cause flooding and how water that recharges aquifers or is stored in the soil to support plant growth. Because soil surface properties, including moisture and temperature are not uniform across the land and vary with time, it is difficult to measure them over large areas. Recently, satellite remote sensing has become a powerful tool for large-scale monitoring of near-surface soil properties. However, the near-surface processes sensed by the satellites are poorly understood because the top layer (about one inch) of soil has received little attention until now. We lack the ground-based measurement technology needed to calibrate satellite observations. To fill this knowledge gap and to provide crucial data for calibration of satellite measurements, this project will develop of novel sensor arrays and mathematical models capable of measuring and describing moisture and temperature variations within the top inch of soil. This technology will be tested and refined with large diameter precision-weighing soil columns instrumented with the new sensors and special remote sensing cameras. The project will provide invaluable information and tools for managing our precious water and environmental resources in view of climate variability, especially in arid and semiarid regions of the USA, and improve research in related scientific disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Earth's surface experiences extreme spatiotemporal moisture and temperature variations and controls important hydrological processes such as infiltration, runoff, and evaporation. Satellite remote-sensing (RS) is a powerful tool for characterization and monitoring of Earth surface processes, but near-surface (NS) dynamics within the penetration depth of electromagnetic waves are poorly understood due to a lack of high-resolution calibration techniques. This research addresses the crucial need for improved monitoring of NS soil property and process dynamics. The project objectives are to: 1) develop and employ novel in situ measurement techniques; 2) evaluate and advance RS theory for NS soil moisture estimation; and 3) develop and test creative RS algorithms for soil hydraulic property determination. To achieve the objectives, ground-based NS moisture content, temperature, thermal properties and soil heat and evaporative fluxes will be determined with instruments including a high-resolution time domain reflectometry array (TDRA) and a penta-needle heat pulse probe array (PHPPA). These NS measurements will be coupled with analytical solutions for soil moisture estimates. A scaling method and RS of the soil surface moisture and temperature will be used to estimate soil hydraulic properties from the duration of Stage 1 evaporation. The proposed concepts will be tested with a pair of 4-m deep x 2.4-m diameter precision weighing lysimeters at the University of Arizona, instrumented with thermal imaging- and shortwave IR-cameras. The proposed project will transform calibration and predictive capabilities of land-surface and hydrologic models and provide valuable information for the management of Earth's precious environmental resources in view of climate variability, especially in arid and semiarid regions of the US and globally. The development of high-resolution near-surface physical and hydrologic measurement capabilities (TDRA and PHPPA) will also enhance research capabilities of related scientific disciplines (e.g., ecohydrology and atmospheric science).</AbstractNarration>
