    <AbstractNarration>Current research indicates that 46% of the world's 7,000 languages are in danger of losing their last speakers by the end of this century. Communities are responding to this situation by accelerating their efforts to learn their languages. In situations of severe language endangerment, communities and educators are turning to archived language documentation to promote language learning. This workshop project will investigate the process of language acquisition in these unique learning situations, looking specifically at the role of documentary materials -- grammars, dictionary, and linguistically analyzed natural discourse -- in learning. A special focus will be on the long-term academic success and other benefits to learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Fall 2015, Ruth Rouvier of the Education Development Center will facilitate this workshop in Washington D.C. Rouvier will bring together a 10-member interdisciplinary team of specialists in language acquisition, early childhood development, educational linguistics, documentary linguistics, statistics, and public health. Participants will address topics relating to the role of language documentation in formal language-based activities and the impact of these activities on learners ages 0-5. The impacts to be addressed include linguistic benefits (language competence and use) and extra-linguistic benefits relating to academic success and social well-being. Workshop participants will examine both the resources and practices known or hypothesized to result in these positive outcomes, and the methods for evaluating these benefits. They will assess the state of collective (i.e., academic, professional and community) knowledge regarding these issues and make recommendations for addressing shortfalls, in order to encourage research on how language documentation research affects society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the workshop will be broadly disseminated for discussion and comment through listservs such as the Resource Network for Linguistic Diversity, the Foundation for Endangered Languages), and the Linguistlist.</AbstractNarration>
