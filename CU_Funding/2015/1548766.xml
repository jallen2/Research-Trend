    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be wearable technology and mobile health. While the platform being designed within this proposal is focused on the needs of the elderly, these algorithms developed by integrated multi-sensor biometrics will be useful in developing a broad range of wearables for mobile health, fitness, wellness, and military applications. Additionally, the two sensors being developed in this effort will open up new biometrics datasets that currently require blood collection or advanced imaging (blood flow). By developing noncontact and very small sensors that replace otherwise invasive technology, the door to including them in a variety of applications opens. We believe that true change in how people live will be achieved by combining multiple sensors and advanced predictive algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a sensing platform that measures of various important predictors of elderly health to avoid the over 30 billion dollars in health care costs and high mortality related to falls. The sensor platform will use an array of sensors to measure various important predictors of elderly health alerting, the wearer, clinician, or caretaker of changes in gait, hydration, heart rate, respiration, location, and overall motion. The proposed effort focuses on the development of two novel sensors. The first is a novel application of MEMS microphone technology that will listen to the sound of blood and air within the ear cavity enabling the tracking of respiration and blood flow to the head. The second is a novel hydration sensor based on transmission line theory. This sensor takes advantage of the inherent differences in water absorption across the RF frequency band, specifically tuning into dermal layers to obtain an accurate measure of body hydration. To use the data from these sensors and other, we will implement an advanced algorithm system to tract wearer health and their likelihood of fall. This novel combination of novel sensors and intelligent algorithms will enable elderly wearers to lead happy, healthy, and secure lives.</AbstractNarration>
