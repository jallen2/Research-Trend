    <AbstractNarration>It is estimated by the World Health Organization that 15% of the world's population has some form of disability; a number that is rising due to population growth and improvements in medical care leading to longer lifespans. While computing devices and the Internet have become essential for full participation in society, many of these technologies are not accessible for those who experience disability. Equal access to technology has been discussed as an issue in computing ethics, and many computing professionals report an ethical motivation for their decision to consider accessibility in their work. However, equal access is not typically addressed in ethics curricula for computing students. To address this gap, the PI and her team will provide evidence-based information as to the efficacy of various educational interventions for training future computing professionals about inclusive technology development. They also will provide the resources necessary to replicate these interventions at other universities. Students trained in the ethics of inclusive design will be motivated to meet global needs for inclusive technology. Such design has the potential to level the playing field for those who through age, accident, or medical circumstances experience disability. The materials to be made available through this project (including a video showcase of student projects, accessibility project ideas, and lecture slides) will provide faculty with the means to incorporate accessibility information into their computing curriculum. To ensure that these materials meet instructional needs, faculty at other universities will be surveyed to evaluate these resources. This work will be published in NSF-related ethics archive locations and on the team's website. Students with disabilities will be involved in the project as research assistants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While prior educators have implemented specific interventions to train computing degree students about accessibility, there is a need for a systematic comparison of alternative interventions for accessibility education. The PI and her team will investigate the efficacy of multiple interventions for accessibility education on a scale and with a level of experimental rigor not previously attempted. While accessibility and inclusion are key for professionals, these concepts have thus far had limited coverage in ethics curricula in computing degree programs. In another innovative aspect, this work will examine the extent to which participation of people with disabilities contributes to the educational interventions. The three investigators have each been involved in accessibility research and education throughout their careers. This research will build on that experience in developing educational interventions (e.g., lectures on accessibility, assignments having hands-on experience with accessibility technology, team projects on a topic related to accessibility or inclusion, involvement by users with a disability as either an end-user, or as a project team member). Interventions will be implemented within undergraduate programs as part of required courses on human-computer interaction. The team will contrast views about the need for inclusive design between students in these programs with, as a control, students in other computing undergraduate programs at the same institution who are not exposed to the interventions. Students' ethical perceptions of their role in promoting accessibility will be measured in their final year of study. Measurements will include standardized questionnaires of attitudes toward people with disabilities, scenario-based evaluation of accessibility considerations in design, and qualitative analysis of written student work.</AbstractNarration>
