    <AbstractNarration>Human life history is unique among living primates. Humans grow slowly and have long lifespans coupled with short inter-birth intervals, resulting in fast reproductive rates. Among primates, there is a strong relationship between life history and the age at which the first permanent molar emerges into the mouth. Paleoanthropologists use this relationship to probe the antiquity of the unique human life history profile, but exactly why molar emergence varies and is closely associated with life history remains unclear. This study will examine molar emergence as part of a developing, functionally integrated chewing system, to provide a model for contextualizing variation in the timing of molar emergence among primates. It will also contribute to understanding the close association between molar emergence and life history. The project will yield a rich public database of 3D primate skull growth with relevance to the study of craniofacial growth and molar impaction, and support public science outreach and training of graduate and undergraduate students in a STEM field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molars function with the jaws and chewing muscles to break down food. Developmental coordination among these parts of the chewing system is critical for food ingestion throughout life. In adult primates, the configuration of the chewing system constrains the position of molars to avoid damage to the temporomandibular joint during chewing. Using 3D coordinate data from cross-sectional ontogenetic samples of primate skulls (n = 18 species; 1,182 specimens) this study will determine if the position of molar emergence is constrained in the same manner, thereby regulating the timing of molar emergence. This research will examine how ontogenetic changes in the configuration of the chewing system drive variation in molar emergence schedules among primates, and may suggest that life history is closely associated with molar emergence ages through its influence on facial growth rates. It will further suggest that selection for shorter faces and a prolonged growth schedule in the lineage leading to humans would have had the concomitant effect of delaying molar emergence.</AbstractNarration>
