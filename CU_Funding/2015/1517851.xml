    <AbstractNarration>The Inca citadel of Machu Picchu is an iconic landmark of human social history and technical endeavor. Built in the 15th century, Machu Picchu integrates refined architecture with dramatic landscape, and provides an archeological case study in understanding social centers of ceremony, politics, astronomy and agriculture. Although the site is among the most outstanding examples of human interaction with the natural environment, we know relatively little about the human component. This project uses genetic analyses to examine the biology and population dynamics of the people who lived and worked at Machu Picchu, and in doing so addresses questions in disciplines ranging from anthropology and history to evolutionary biology and environmental science. The project will also generate a wealth of genomic data for ancestral human populations, which will be a public resource for new avenues in genetic research and training. Moreover, given the status of Machu Picchu as an internationally recognized landmark and UNESCO World Heritage site, this project provides an ideal opportunity to engage wide audiences in human genetic history and archeological conservation. The project participants will conduct bilingual public seminars in the US and Peru to promote public understanding of human history and diversity. The project will also be integrated into parallel bilingual museum exhibits, further promoting longer-term international educational and research collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses cutting-edge methods to sequence many types of ancient DNA (nuclear DNA, Y-chromosome, and mitochondrial DNA) to examine the genomes of people from throughout the Inca Empire. This includes the first comprehensive genetic analysis of the Machu Picchu skeletal remains from over 100 burials at the site. Genetic analyses of these individuals, and the biological relationships among them, will allow us to test many of the hypotheses surrounding this enigmatic site. These include questions regarding the functional role of Machu Picchu and its residents, and patterns of diversity, migration and labor diaspora in the Inca Empire. The investigators will compare the results of the genetic analysis with the previous archaeological, morphological and isotopic data from Machu Picchu, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the site and its socio-historical context. Understanding the population dynamics of the Inca Empire will in turn have broader impacts for understanding human genetic history and adaptation prior to European colonization.</AbstractNarration>
