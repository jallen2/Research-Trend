    <AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, "Using Reality-Based Learning Practicum and Mentoring Structures to Enhance STEM Teacher Preparation for High Need Schools" is recruiting undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics and preparing them to become 6-12th grade mathematics or science teachers. The project will fund 36 scholarships over five years. In this project, Lewis University is collaborating with Joliet Junior College, the College of DuPage, Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Three Rivers Manufacturers Association, Valley View Public School District U365, Joliet District 86, and Oak Lawn District 218. The program will equip candidates to provide the highest quality of mathematics and science instruction to at-risk student populations through rigorous coursework, extensive field experiences, and innovative approaches. Noyce scholars will attend workshops and work with STEM and education faculty as they learn student-centered best practices for the mathematics and science classroom. To further develop their expertise, scholars will participate in community outreach programs. The results of Lewis University's program strategies and accompanying research findings have the potential to address a fundamental challenge facing STEM education today: the success and retention of talented mathematics and science teachers in high-need secondary schools. By researching the impact of the program's emphasis in teacher mentoring and in translating teaching theory into effective practice, Lewis' Noyce program is poised to contribute to advances in the preparation of mathematics and science teachers, help address the shortage of highly qualified STEM teachers in high-need schools, and lead to stronger mathematics and science outcomes among at-risk 6-12th grade students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lewis University's Noyce project team will examine three research questions: (1) Does Noyce scholars' participation in a Reality-Based Learning Practicum (RBLP) influence the content and methods of their teaching towards a more student-centered, engaging STEM curriculum, (2) How can mathematics and science teacher preparation programs better define the role of the cooperating teacher, as both a clinical supervisor and a mentor, from the perspective of teacher candidates, and (3) How can programs apply the findings of this research to better prepare practicing teachers? To answer question 1, the researchers will establish a baseline of the candidates' teaching approaches in their first field experience. Following the Reality-Based Learning Practicum RBLP, focus groups will explore scholars' engagement and challenges in creating student-centered lessons, and the researchers will examine lesson plans and observation evaluation from two additional field experiences to determine the impact of the practicum. To address questions 2 and 3, the researchers will utilize (1) entrance and exit interviews from teacher candidates, (2) surveys, (3) evaluation and observation instruments, and (4) debriefing notes by mentor teachers and university supervisors of the teacher candidates. The results of this evaluation will be analyzed to gain an understanding of the impact of RBLP on instructional practice and develop a new model of mentorship that will engage teacher candidates, mentors, and university supervisors in the effective preparation of teacher candidates. The results of the research will be shared with the education and STEM communities via publications, presentations, and the project website.</AbstractNarration>
