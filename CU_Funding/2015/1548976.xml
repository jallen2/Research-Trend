    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving the performance of the back-end of a display system that delivers personalized information in public spaces. Currently, the primary method for an individual to receive customized information in public spaces is through personal devices. The heavy use of personal devices in public often leads to heads-down, isolating, and even hazardous situations. The delivery of personalized information through infrastructure can significantly improve these issues. However, the bandwidth requirements in doing so have been prohibitively high using standard computational architectures. This project aims to improve the performance of such a system, allowing practical applications that will broadly enhance safety, accessibility, transportation, and other areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on creating a scalable computational pipeline and architecture that will allow a display system to direct personalized visual information in real-time to large numbers of people. Technically, this involves computing, transmitting, and displaying image data for large crowds in parallel. The architecture takes advantage of the inherent redundancies in this application to provide a cost-effective solution. The goal of the project is to create a computational back-end capable of driving, in real-time, a system equivalent to thousands of displays.</AbstractNarration>
