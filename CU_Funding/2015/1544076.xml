    <AbstractNarration>The transition from a research-intensive environment to a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI) such as a small liberal arts college can make it difficult for scientists to maintain connections with the broader science community, and ASPB is an important resource for those connections. This pre-annual meeting extended workshop is designed to enhance the participation of PUI scientists at the national meeting and to introduce them to research resources and opportunities that will help them connect to the broader plant biology research community year round. These connections are critical for PUI scientists seeking to build and maintain successful research programs. A second goal is to help graduate students and postdocs become more acquainted with the expectations for a successful career at a PUI so that they are better prepared to enter the job market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) is a leader in supporting career development opportunities for a wide variety of scientists. In an effort to boost research engagement at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) for current and prospective faculty, ASPB is offering an extended workshop prior to the annual meeting (PB2015) in Minneapolis, MN in July 2015. The workshop is designed to help current faculty share best practices in experimental design, collaboration, grant writing, and time management for conducting research in the undergraduate setting. Numerous national studies have shown that undergraduate research promotes intellectual development and preparation for science careers. PUI faculty are often removed from the rich research environment of research-intensive schools and need connections through societies, such as ASPB, to develop and maintain robust research programs. This workshop will help PUI faculty develop connections that can be maintained through year-round networking opportunities in the online ASPB community. This award will facilitate recruitment of PUI faculty that most need assistance connecting with the broader plant biology research community to help them better engage the undergraduates at their institutions in research. The workshop will also expose graduate students and postdoctoral associates to resources needed for planning a research career at a PUI. Travel to the annual meeting and attendance at the workshop poses a financial hardship to many PUI faculty members without extensive research&lt;br/&gt;support. To offset this hardship and encourage attendance among faculty who do not already have research support, this proposal will allow travel awards for participants who need assistance.</AbstractNarration>
