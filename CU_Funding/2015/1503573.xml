    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;New materials (chemical compounds) are at the core of new technologies, such as fuel cells, blue-ray DVD players, smart phones, and lasers. The challenge lies in not only discovering a new material, but also understanding its technological properties. If technologies are to be advanced, the discovery and understanding of new materials are critical. This research project involves the design, discovery, and crystal growth of new materials for advanced technologies. Specifically, the research team is focused on laser applications and magnetic-electronic phenomena. With the former, the aim is to discover materials that enable lasing technologies in the ultraviolet - critically needed for advanced technologies and devices. With the latter the team is designing materials wherein magnetic and electronic properties may be tuned to create fundamentally new devices and technologies. Thus, the research project involves the synthesis and discovery of new materials, their crystal growth, and an understanding of their technological properties through advanced laboratory characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this research project involves the design, synthesis, structure, functional property characterization, and structure-property relationships of new functional inorganic materials: fluoride-carbonates for deep-ultraviolet non-linear optical applications and multi-ferroic fluorides. An ongoing challenge in inorganic solid-state chemistry is the 'rational design' of new materials - to design and synthesize precise stoichiometries that will exhibit specific, and ideally, technologically important properties. Meeting this challenge not only requires synthetic expertise, but also a deep understanding of the various bonding and crystal chemistry requirements for the desired physical property. An aim of the proposed research is to further this understanding by not only synthesizing new materials, but also developing structure-property relationships. The research team aims to synthesize new acentric fluoride-carbonates for deep-ultraviolet non-linear optical applications and multiferroic fluoride materials. In addition to bulk phase synthesis, the growth of large, centimeter size, crystals is planned. Crystal growth methods include top-seeded solution growth and Bridgman. The materials will be characterized structurally by X-ray diffraction (powder and single crystal), and physical property measurements will include, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, second-harmonic generation and magnetoelectric measurements.</AbstractNarration>
