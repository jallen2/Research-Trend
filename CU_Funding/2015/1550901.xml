    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG) to build and sustain essential cyberinfrastructure and computational capacity for geodynamics and seismology. Over the past decade, CIG has developed and disseminated widely-used, open-source codes for research and education in computational seismology, mantle convection, magma dynamics, short- and long-term lithospheric and crustal deformation, and geodynamo modeling. CIG has changed the culture in computational geophysics research by improving scientific software development practices and has influenced the education of hundreds of geodynamicists. CIG?s approach towards writing and disseminating scientific software has become indispensable to its community and has established and sustained deep ties to computational sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific computation is integral to solid Earth geosciences, allowing us to understand and quantify the processes that shape Earth. Computational models link observations and quantitative models describing the Earth?s interior and evolution. This project will continue the development and dissemination of high quality scientific software to enable cutting edge geodynamics modeling, and to prepare a diverse workforce to address fundamental science questions. While CIG?s primary mission is development of high-quality open-source software, a growing role is the education and development of geoscientists who are prepared to effectively use and advance computation in research and teaching. Workshops, hackathons, meeting special sessions, and tutorials foster emerging computational geoscientists who represent the long-term legacy of the project.</AbstractNarration>
