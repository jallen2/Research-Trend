    <AbstractNarration>The University of Tulsa proposes to add four new cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity with a strong background in computer science, engineering, business and law. The program integrates rigorous, hands-on learning with research, professional development and outreach activities. The students will serve as summer interns to gain practical experience and will join federal agencies or other eligible entities upon graduation. The Tulsa Program offers multiple technical and interdisciplinary tracks, each characterized by a focused, yet flexible, program of study. The intense "MacGyver Track" imparts reverse engineering and cyber operations skills geared for the intelligence community. Other tracks prepare students for research, operations and project management. The interdisciplinary M.B.A. and Law Tracks combine business and law classes, respectively, with six cyber security and systems courses. The common thread is the "Teaching Hospital Model" -- hands-on courses involving real-world projects with law enforcement, the intelligence community and critical infrastructure owners and operators, and strong collaboration with embedded government personnel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program components are designed to have a broad and lasting impact. Existing efforts to engage members of underrepresented groups and non-traditional students will be intensified, and arrangements to accept community college graduates will be expanded. CyberCorps(R) students will collaborate on real-world projects with federal agency personnel to gain practical experience and enhance internship and job placement prospects. Other innovative aspects of the proposal are (1) diverse studies, ranging from computer science and chemical engineering to business and law, all built around a strong cybersecurity core; (2) flexible program components that prepare students for careers in intelligence, research, operations, project management, enterprise security, and law and policy; and (3) integration of traditional, non-traditional and underrepresented students in an inclusive and collaborative learning culture. The project will also offer sustained mentoring and student involvement in community service and outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
