    <AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;Offshore delivery of fine sediment on the continental shelf via wave supported gravity currents (WSGC) is a key component of sediment transport fromsource to sink, yet it remains poorly understood. Current models of this process focus on suspension and transport of silt and clay sized particles. However, recent laboratory experiments show that even a small amount of sand in the sediment layer may exert a dominant control on the dynamics of the transport layer. The proposed effort will investigate the effect of sand fraction on sediment transport in WSGC, particularly, the transition between transport modes, the downslope transport and the depositional signatures. The objectives will be addressed using a comprehensive series of laboratory experiments, 3D turbulence-resolving numerical simulations, and re-analysis of existing field data from WSGC on active continental margins. The work is relevant to a broad range of fields, from fluid mechanics and water resource engineering, to studies of biogeochemical cycles. Outreach include introduction of the relevance of sedimentary processes to K-12 students with hand-on experiments in the university labs, and invited presentations to local schools. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved. In addition to journal papers and conference presentations, open-source codes will be disseminated through Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;Offshore delivery of fine sediment on the continental shelf via wave supported gravity currents (WSGC) is a key component of sediment source to sink, yet it remains poorly understood.

The proposed effort investigates the effect of sand fraction on sediment transport in WSGC, particularly, the transition between transport modes, the downslope transport and the depositional signatures. The project is formed around two main objectives: 1) Determine the role of the sand fraction in controlling dynamics and transport within WSGC and the bed deposits associated with them. 2) Evaluate impacts of event evolution (surging and waning of a storm) on the sediment and flow dynamics within a gravity flow and the resulting depositional signatures These will be addressed using a comprehensive series of laboratory experiments, 3D turbulence-resolving numerical simulations, and re-analysis of existing field data from WSGC on active continental margins.
