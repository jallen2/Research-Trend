    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to undertake an institutional self-analysis in preparation for a Broadening Participation Research Center. Broadening Participation Research Centers are expected to serve as national hubs for the rigorous study and broad dissemination of the critical pedagogies and culturally sensitive interventions that contribute to the success of HBCUs in educating African American STEM undergraduates. This project is a collaborative effort between the initial members of an education research consortium: Tennessee State University, Prairie View A&amp;M University, Morgan State University, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The consortium of schools and team of researchers will work to plan research activities that will lead to the formation of a research center that delineates which individual factors, environmental factors, institutional practices, procedures, and policies are most effective in ensuring that students successfully complete STEM degrees at HBCUs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities of this project include: implementating a strategic planning framework built upon the broadening participation education research expertise of the collaborating institutions involved in the development of an expanded education research consortium of HBCUs; using evidence-based strategies to generate a high-quality plan for the research thrusts and research methodologies of the resulting center; and addressing the gap in the literature regarding STEM education research results, practices and policies pertinent to student persistence and graduation at HBCUs. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation and an external advisory committee.</AbstractNarration>
