    <AbstractNarration>Interacting galaxies are a major part of the history, evolution, and dynamics of galaxies. Projects are now beginning to measure the internal structure and motions in these fascinating systems, and so the time is right to carry out theoretical work capable of understanding these observations. This project will produce a comprehensive suite of galaxy merger simulations and turn them into simulated images and velocity maps to guide the interpretation of forthcoming data. The research connects a primarily undergraduate institution with cutting edge, world class theorists and observers, providing valuable experiences for under-represented college and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will employ state-of-the-art numerical simulations to investigate the internal structure and kinematics of interacting galaxies. For the first time, observations in the Local Universe are measuring these characteristics with exquisite detail, and for a large number of systems, using deep imaging and integral-field spectroscopy. The PI and collaborators will use the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) model to construct a comprehensive suite of galaxy merger simulations, resolving Giant Molecular Clouds and the Interstellar Medium, and directly implementing star-formation and feedback physics. Post-processing by radiative-transfer codes will create synthetic images resembling real galaxies, which will be classified both visually and with automated schemes. Along with kinematic maps, these will support planned observational projects. This three-pronged design of visual, automated and kinematic classification will help to overcome any obstacles. All theoretical tools have been fully tested, and undergraduate mentoring plans already exist using two postdocs and a graduate student. Considerable efforts are being made to recruit under-represented students from local state universities and community colleges, using two existing frameworks, and allowing them to work with a world-class team of theorists and observers. The project also involves high school teachers and students from the local under-served Hispanic community, aided by the PI's native language being Spanish.</AbstractNarration>
