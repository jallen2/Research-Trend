    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide affordable, three-dimensional (3D) microscopic imaging through the use of an electronically-controlled, focusing element. Scientists desire to observe biological phenomena in intact, living cells or animals that occur on fast time scales. Recent advances in fluorescent markers have significantly improved tracking of drug delivery and observation of dynamic events in cell membranes. However, laboratories often need expensive scanning microscopes, such as confocal or two-photon, with 3D fluorescent imaging capability to observe such events. The proposed technology will increase accessibility of 3D, high-resolution imaging, thereby enabling advancements in science. It will also improve the speed of image acquisition, reduce photobleaching and photodamage of specimens, extend longitudinal studies capabilities, and reduce agitation and damage of sensitive samples. It is expected to lead to new discoveries with regard to biological phenomena, physical phenomena, and novel fluorescent imaging modalities. The value of the immediate addressable market is $50 million. The technology also promises to benefit 3D imaging systems for manufacturing or machine vision, miniaturized optical disk pick-ups, confocal and two-photon microscopes, optical coherence tomography, and endoscopic imaging systems by providing high speed and agile focus control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project centers on the demonstration of the feasibility of a novel 3D, high-resolution imaging technology. The project includes development of microelectromechanical mirrors and a novel optomechanical design. Gross electronic focus control capability has only recently become available. As such, standard optical design practices to best utilize these elements do not exist. The goals of this project are three fold: 1) to advance optical design methods for varifocus elements, 2) to develop a novel optomechanical design, and 3) to further microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror technology. The research and development to be undertaken in Phase I will determine feasibility of the optomechanical design and of the MEMS mirror performance to meet 3D biological imaging needs at a cost less than one quarter of currently available technology. Technical results will include analysis of the new optomechanical design and characterization of the MEMS mirrors.</AbstractNarration>
