    <AbstractNarration>This study will use a database of very high-resolution model simulations of the lowest layers of the atmosphere to compare with known output from various models of the turbulent layer near the earth's surface. The goal of this research is to improve the way in which air flow is modeled in the very lowest layers of the atmosphere, near the ground. This study will add valuable insight into the success of various numerical prediction schemes and may ultimately lead to improvements in these schemes used in weather models. One undergraduate student will participate in this study and gain valuable research experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use a large-eddy simulation (LES) dataset, consisting of two hours of 0.39m resolution data, archived at one-minute intervals. The LES data are free of non-turbulent structures typically present in the real boundary layer. The proposed LES uses a two-part sub-grid scale model to span between LES and Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes (RANS) regimes. New insights will be gained through the development of improved turbulence closure schemes, from gradient-based scaling, for single-column models.</AbstractNarration>
