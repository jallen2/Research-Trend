    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Arizona State University IUCRC site of the Net-centric and Cloud Software and Systems (NCSS) I/UCRC will transition to a Phase 2 Site. The NCSS involves University of North Texas (Lead Site), Southern Methodist University, University of Texas at Dallas, Missouri University of S&amp;T and Arizona State University. The site has already established the necessary intellectual base and marketing infrastructure to attract and retain industry partners for Phase 2, and has an excellent track record of industry membership and engagement within the NCSS. Networked sensing systems are important in homeland security, Net Centric defense systems, industry applications, health monitoring and other areas. The Phase 2 center will enable the creation of new capabilities in sensor signal processing and will bridge the gap between sensor development and large scale sensor deployment. The center is uniquely positioned to promote fundamental research, education, scholarship, and industry activities in an innovative manner that will continue integrating well in the existing Net-Centric umbrella. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the NCSS, this Site focuses on research areas such as digital signal and image processing, sensor networks, information technologies and algorithm and cloud software development for wireless communications. Specific areas of planned research advances and contributions include: a) Advances in radar direction of arrival estimation using virtual sensor arrays, b) development of networked sensor monitoring algorithms and cloud software which predict process failures, c) fault detection in sensors monitoring networked PV arrays, d) networked imaging sensors for activity detection, and e) net centric approaches with camera arrays for image understanding.</AbstractNarration>
