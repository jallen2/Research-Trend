    <AbstractNarration>This award is for the partial support of the International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication (EIPBN) to be held in May 26-29, 2015 in San Diego, California. This major international meeting will provide a single forum for discussion of the latest developments in directed energy-enabled synthesis, fabrication, imaging and characterization of small-scale structures and multi-layered devices. Regular meetings of the key researchers, developers and users in this field are necessary for the exchange of ideas, information, and state-of-the-art technologies in order to enable and accelerate advances and breakthroughs the fields of nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing. This international conference is a key mechanism for linking basic science with engineering towards the development of nano-enabled products, which are of significant importance to the US economy. This conference offers a forum for the open exchange of new and previously unpublished scientific ideas. The conference includes presentations, free exchange of ideas, and extended discussions and interactions among international participants. This forum has been instrumental in the generation and incubation of breakthrough and transformative ideas in many scientific areas including nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will partially support the participation of graduate students. Appropriate plans are in place to advertise the availability of support for students to attend the conference and participate in discussions and workshops. Student selection plans are also in place. Students will be selected for support based on needs and interests. The funds will support the attendance at the conference of a total of 30 students.</AbstractNarration>
