    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to Montana State University to purchase a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a sensitivity-enhanced Prodigy TM broadband cryoprobe. The new instrument will enhance research and education at all levels. It will strongly benefit student education at both the graduate and the undergraduate level by enabling student training in new, powerful small molecule NMR analytical techniques. MSU provides direct, hands-on training to students in state-of-the-art instrumentation, which is taught in venues ranging from summer undergraduate research programs to sophomore organic laboratory courses to graduate level instructional programs. The new AVANCE III 500 NMR with its enhanced capabilities will also enable them to enhance participation of minority Native American students through remote instrument access that will provide NMR spectra to students enrolled in sciences classes at remote Montana Tribal Colleges and at other small colleges across the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cryoprobe-equipped AVANCE III 500 NMR will allow researchers to use NMR for chemical structure elucidation and the global analysis of small molecule metabolites (e.g. metabolomics) research, will enhance usage by permitting higher throughput data collection, and will facilitate studies in applications with inherently low selectivity. In addition, the new instrument will be the workhorse NMR spectrometer for the university and will greatly expand Montana State University's NMR research capabilities for acquisition of multidimensional (1D, 2D, 3D/nD) heteronuclear (1H, 13C, 15N, 31P) NMR spectra of small molecules. The new instrumentation, which will replace MSU's aged 500 NMR spectrometer, will boost research productivity and student education. The new instrument is absolutely essential to maintain the university's research productivity, educational quality, and outreach mission, and for successful recruitment of new faculty.</AbstractNarration>
