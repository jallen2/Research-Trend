    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the REU Sites Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation Professor Stefan A. France recruits undergraduates to participate in a diverse array of projects spanning five interdisciplinary thematic research areas under the programmatic title "Chemistry FAST", or Chemistry Function, Application, Structure, and Theory. In keeping with the nation's interests in creating a highly trained workforce that reflects the growing diversity of the U.S. population, a primary focus of the Georgia Tech FAST Program targets the enrollment of substantial numbers of undergraduate women and students from underrepresented groups to provide them with skills and motivation to embark on careers in the sciences. Undergraduates participate in a diverse array of projects spanning five interdisciplinary thematic research areas. These themes encompass the breadth of research in the chemical sciences that contribute to the well-being (health, wealth, and security) of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each participant works with an individual faculty member who has an active research group in a thematic area of interest to the student. The Chemistry FAST Program encompasses five interdisciplinary themes: (i) Biological Systems and Medicinal Application (BSMA); (ii) Catalysis, Energy and Sustainability (CES); (iii) Materials Design and Application (MDA); (iv) Nano- and Quantum- Scale Technologies (NQST); and (v) Sensing, Imaging and Diagnostics (SID). Each theme is specifically grouped to encompass faculty, science and technologies that represent function, application, structure and theory (FAST). Other components of the program include team-building activities, regular group meetings, a seminar/workshop series (ethics, presentation skills, graduate opportunities, and research frontiers), research symposia, and field trips to industrial and/or government laboratories. These activities serve to acquaint participants with a broad array of projects, provide them with the opportunity to enhance their presentation skills, and provide a perspective of chemical research in a scholarly, entrepreneurial, economic, and ethical framework. The program includes extensive joint activities with other summer research programs on campus.</AbstractNarration>
