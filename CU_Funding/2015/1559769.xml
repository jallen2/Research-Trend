    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, located in Millbrook, NY, will support the training of 10 students for 12 weeks during the summers of 2016-2020. Students join the unique Cary community of 100 scientists and staff to gain first-hand experience in ecological research with a focus on Translational Ecology. The program interweaves: 1) Cutting Edge Independent Research - working closely with a mentor scientist students identify questions, design and carry out research, and then analyze and present results. 2) Reflective Practice and Training - students attend Scientific Writing and Statistics/R Workshops, as well as a course in Responsible Conduct of Research training. 3) Translation -- students participate in a Communication Workshop, and write "elevator speeches" and lay-friendly research summaries. The Forum on Translational Ecology showcases a diversity of careers and approaches to applying and translating ecology. In the Sharing Science Program, students teach ecology to youngsters and reflect on translation through education. Undergraduate freshmen, sophomores, juniors or first semester seniors apply on-line, and are selected by project directors with input from the mentor of their preferred project. Preference is given to students who stand to benefit most from participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 50 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program over the 5-year period. Cary REU students contribute to the field of ecology through publications, presentations, and bringing new insights to the field. The program has significant impact on students' education and career. Nearly three quarters of past participants attended graduate school and 90% now work in science, education or an environment-related job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students complete other program surveys and respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system, and alumni are contacted every year to document longer-term outcomes.
