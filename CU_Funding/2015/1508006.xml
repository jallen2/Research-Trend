    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3D printing is a fast-growing field that aims to create intricate three-dimensional structures of very precise specifications for a broad range of applications. Currently, 3D printing of plastic is a relatively common process and is often available in public libraries or service centers for a nominal fee. 3D printing has tremendous potential for applications in biology and medicine. For example, with a 3D printer, one could create structures of multiple cell types placed together with a precise geometry in a single Petri dish to replicate the types of cell interactions that are present in human organs. These engineered tissues could be used outside of the body to predict how different types of drugs may interact with humans or could be used inside the body to replace damaged tissues. However, the use of this technique to print cell-containing materials remains a difficult challenge. This is in part due to the unavailability of bio-inks that are both cell-compatible and have the physical and chemical properties required to be printable. Here, the PIs plan to develop a family of bio-inks with the properties required for printing as well as the ability to protect cells and maintain their viability during and after the printing process. This project has the potential to develop a novel, sophisticated family of bio-ink materials that may have great therapeutic impact. Additionally, women and under-represented minority (URM) graduate and undergraduate students will be introduced to a variety of scientific careers as well as the skills that may be required for these careers. This award will also facilitate the establishment of a 3D bio-printing facility at Stanford University, which will introduce students at the undergraduate and graduate level to novel processes in the field of engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While 3D printing of thermoplastics is now routine, the rapid prototyping of cell-laden, polymeric constructs for biotechnology and medical applications is still restricted to specialized research laboratories. A key limitation preventing the widespread use of cell-based 3D printing is the lack of suitable bio-inks that are cell-compatible and have the required physico-chemical properties for printing. Here, the PIs plan (1) the design of a novel family of biomaterials with tunable biochemical and mechanical properties with the appropriate physico-chemical properties for use as cell-laden bio-inks, (2) the exploration of a two-stage crosslinking strategy to provide mechanical shielding during flow and to improve the resolution of printed structures, and (3) the spatial patterning of multiple biochemical and mechanical cues within an open-channel construct to guide cell behavior. During the course of this project, women and under-represented minority (URM) graduate and undergraduate students will be introduced to a variety of STEM careers as well as the skills that they may require through visits to local high schools, preparation of a 3D printing module for high school science teachers, and a summer intern research experience. Additionally, through the establishment of a 3D bio-printing facility at Stanford University, students at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be trained in the process of 3D bio-printing and the design and production of novel materials, preparing them for entry into engineering career paths in the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
