    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Recent Methods in Operator Theory" that will be held on October 15 and 16, 2015, on the campus of the University of Memphis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is a satellite event to the meeting of the American Mathematical Society's Southeastern Section that will take place in October 2015. The conference will focus attention on recent methods and advances in operator theory via a series of expository lectures on long-standing open problems in operator theory, state-of-the-art techniques, and important recent contributions to the field. The goals of the workshop are the following: (1) to disseminate mainstream trends, state-of-the-art techniques, and recent advances in operator theory to a large group of female and underrepresented graduate students and early career mathematicians; (2) to create a social environment among a diverse level of participants encouraging fruitful discussions of mathematical ideas and sharing of promising research; and (3) to initiate a network of support among participants for future research interaction.The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
