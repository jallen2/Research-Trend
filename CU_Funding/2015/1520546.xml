    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in terms of the reduction of emissions and the fuel savings on any motorcycle with this cylinder head design, and possibly also any internal combustion engine with this cylinder head design. A vast majority of the world's internal combustion engine-driven fleet today are operated without requiring any emission-improving devices such as catalytic converters or fuel injection. The proposed technology reduces emissions and increases gas mileage without requiring any emission-improving equipment. The proposed cylinder head design could also increase the engine performance as an added benefit. This project has the potential for producing progressively local, national, and even global impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is in the whole new way of thinking about how fuel burns inside the internal combustion engine. Additionally, there are new ideas about the flow of air and the combustion process of the cylinder head. This project is a newly designed, divided combustion chamber cylinder head, in which more of the fuel is burned inside the chamber, resulting in significantly lower output of emissions gases; namely hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide greenhouse gases. The objective of this research is to prove these results on a 500cc motorcycle with the newly designed cylinder head installed. The motorcycle will be taken to an emissions lab to be tested for emissions as well as for gas mileage. It will be tested with catalytic converters installed, and again without catalytic converters, to show results using emission-improving devices as well as results of its stand-alone merit.</AbstractNarration>
