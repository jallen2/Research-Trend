    <AbstractNarration>This award is for a workshop to take place just prior to the Science of Team Science annual meeting in 2015. The workshop, led by a team from the University of Central Florida, is to serve as a high-level review of the state of this interdisciplinary area of study. A synthesis of the field especially important given the advances currently being made. The interdisciplinary nature of the field is both an advantage and a challenge, for work is currently being conducted in a range of different literatures. The workshop will provide a means by which researchers can get a better, more nuanced sense of other literatures, methods, and findings. This is especially important when the attendees are drawn from so many different research traditions and cannot be expect to be familiar with all of the work that is relevant to their questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is organized around a series of panel discussions, presentations by major figures in the field, and discussions of current and future topics for research of importance to the nation. The workshop should have a broader impact even beyond attendees, for the workshop itself could serve as a template for future interdisciplinary meetings. Finally, as part of the workshop, the organizers will pull together a reading list of seminal findings on the topic as well as sample syllabi for undergraduate and graduate courses on the topic from a range of orientations.</AbstractNarration>
