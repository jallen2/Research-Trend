    <AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings and research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the research literature on environmental science in several key areas of interest to and relevance to Indian country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;United Tribes Technical College (UTTC) will revolutionize the environmental science program it offers to students by increasing the research capacity of the faculty and the institution, including project-based learning opportunities in the revised curriculum, focusing on faculty professional development, developing a BS in environmental science with an emphasis on ecology and molecular biology, and providing a bridge program that will both recruit students to the program and increase their college readiness for the program.</AbstractNarration>
