    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this grant is to support the attendance of U.S. graduate and undergraduate students at the Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, from May 30-June 2, 2015. The conference is part of the IIE Annual Conference &amp; Expo, which is the leading conference in the field of industrial and systems engineering, and is sponsored by the Institute of Industrial Engineers, which is the leading professional society for industrial and systems engineers. This project seeks to stimulate broader student attendance and participation in this conference. By attending the conference, students have the opportunity to present their research, attend tutorial sessions to learn advanced research methods, participate in panel discussions and scholarship award functions, and interact with scholars and students from other universities and around the world. Attendance at the conference provides an opportunity for students to network with peers, mentors, potential employers, and future collaborators. Thus, attendance at the conference can enable the exploration of industrial engineering research frontiers and may encourage participating students to consider academia as a career path. The conference also provides students with the opportunity to publish their work in high-quality conference proceedings. Furthermore, this grant will support the broader participation of students from underrepresented groups at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative grant will subsidize the travel expenses of approximately 40 students who plan to attend the conference. These travel grants will be awarded through a competitive process and thus receipt of a travel grant will be viewed as an honor by selected students. Applications will be evaluated by an evaluation committee consisting of the conference program chairs, along with one additional member nominated by the Council of Industrial Engineering Academic Department Heads. Selected students will have the opportunity to attend the conference and to participate in activities specifically designed for students. For undergraduate students, the conference provides the IIE/Arena Student Simulation Competition, as well as the Undergraduate Student Technical Paper Competition. For graduate students, the conference provides a doctoral colloquium, pre-conference workshops, networking receptions, best student paper awards, and a best dissertation award. In addition, the Applied Solutions Conference, which focuses on industrial engineering solutions to real-world industrial problems, is being held concurrently with the Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference. This joint conference provides an excellent opportunity for students to network with potential employers, to explore collaborations and to develop applications for their future research.</AbstractNarration>
