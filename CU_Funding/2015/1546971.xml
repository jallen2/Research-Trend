    <AbstractNarration>The Capital Regional Network Workshop at the University of the District of Columbia (UCD) aims to bring together UDC and its partners, Morgan State University, Hampton University, and Bowie State University, with Project Kaleidoscope of the Association of American Colleges and Universities to enhance professional development opportunities for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty and expand the national discourse on broadening participation in undergraduate STEM education by involving Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This workshop presents an opportunity to capture the best practices of HBCUs, which are known to result in positive outcomes for African American STEM students, and transfer them to a broader range of institution types. Two-hundred faculty and administrators are expected to attend the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This initiative will help STEM faculty and institutions in the Capital Regional Network to build their knowledge of how students learn; develop their capacity for and use of best practices in STEM pedagogy; facilitate their use of effective inside- and outside-the-classroom STEM learning experiences; help to integrate research into the undergraduate courses and curriculum; and promote collaboration among faculty across the institutions in improving learning outcomes in STEM for majors and non-majors alike. It is expected that this regional network will sustain itself and will grow because of the infusion of a broader audience of STEM faculty and its track record in enhancing STEM faculty self-efficacy.</AbstractNarration>
