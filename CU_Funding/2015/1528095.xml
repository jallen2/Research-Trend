    <AbstractNarration>Power line communications (PLC) is becoming popular for home automation and indoor communications with data rates of up to 1 Gbps. It can offer an immediate means of providing high bandwidth connectivity where there is no in-built network infrastructure. Combined with high speed wireless radio frequency (RF) access which can be provided by either connecting wireless routers to power outlets or via Visible Light LED based Communications (VLC), one can envision an alternate high bandwidth infrastructure for ubiquitous wired/wireless connectivity indoors. However, PLC research has not received much attention and is yet to mature. This project will have an immediate impact in realizing Internet connectivity in homes and enterprises that do not have an in-built wired network infrastructure. It can be especially useful in business segments such as healthcare, industrial automation and warehousing. PLC can also find application in supporting the Internet of Things. A new course on emerging network technologies will be developed. A close working relationship with NEC laboratories is expected to result in successful transition of the research into practice. In this project, the objectives are to: (a) develop a fundamental understanding of various factors that influence power line communications (such as turning on/off electrical devices) and (b) based on the understanding developed, realize the vision of building an integrated PLC/RF/VLC framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, a comprehensive measurement study will be undertaken to understand (a) the factors that hinder achieving high data rates in PLC and (b) the interactions between PLC and the wireless RF/VLC interface. Specifically, the measurements are expected to yield an understanding of: (i) the dynamics of the PLC channel, (ii) the impact of active electrical devices on the achievable PLC throughput and (iii) the conditions under which either the PLC or the wireless link become a bottleneck in achieving high throughputs. Based on the understanding gained, the PIs will design and implement the integrated framework, towards effectively managing the PLC network by itself, and the integrated PLC/RF or PLC/VLC network towards realizing high data rates in practice. This framework will be fully implemented on a integrated PLC/RF testbed at UC Riverside with additional VLC experimentation as well.</AbstractNarration>
