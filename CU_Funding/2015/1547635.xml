    <AbstractNarration>The study of global change biology in the oceans has emerged as a major area of focus for marine sciences. This area of research is multidisciplinary, encompassing biological, chemical and physical oceanography, along with marine ecology and evolutionary biology. This research community has previously been challenged in meeting to share data and advances made in this rapidly developing field of study. However, the inaugural Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Ocean Global Change Biology in July 2014 created an opportunity for the U.S. science community to discussion and share cutting edge results in the retreat-like atmosphere of a Gordon Conference. The meeting was very successful, with excellent attendance, particularly from early career scientists. This proposal is a request for funding to support the second and upcoming 2016 GRC on Ocean Global Change on to be held at the Waterville Valley Conference Center in Waterville Valley, NH on July 17-22, 2016. Funding to the 2016 GRC on Ocean Global Change Biology will support U.S. researchers in attending a meeting where ideas can be exchanged and research directions can be improved and advanced. These meetings are highly attended by scientists from other countries, thus creating an opportunity for U.S. marine scientists to develop international collaborations in this globally important field. During the GRC itself and in the Gordon Research Seminar preceding it, awards will support interdisciplinary training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The project will advance the science communication skills and insights of the U.S. scientists via a special theme designed to address communicating the results of scientific research to policymakers and managers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will facilitate the sharing of new results, often times unpublished material, from investigators in Ocean Global Change Biology. The fist meeting served to highlight exciting new areas of research in the field and the second GRC on Ocean Global Change Biology will build upon these important emerging directions in 9 themes that comprise the actual 5-day conference. These include the need to focus on adaptation and evolutionary rescue as a possible response to climate change and multistressors, the use of genomics tools and next generation sequencing to facilitate the study of evolutionary response, the need to examine species interactions in the context of environmental change, to continue to explore the interaction of physical factors such as OA, temperature and deoxygenation of coastal waters, and finally to also examine ecosystem-level consequences where possible. Notably, in reviews of the first GRC, conferees noted there a session on science communication. Such a session will be included to discuss how the results of research in ocean global change research can be made more accessible to policymakers and managers. In designing the new themes, the Chair (Dr. Philip Boyd) and Vice Chair (Dr. Gretchen Hofmann) have attempted to take into consideration a venue that will focus on these identified areas, and to also report on progress in this rapidly advancing field of ocean global change biology.&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>
