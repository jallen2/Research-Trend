    <AbstractNarration>Systems in diverse domains such as transportation, medicine, aviation and space exploration, increasingly rely on third-party components with embedded software. Due to the lack of visibility into the components' implementation and design, traditional techniques for verifying that the components perform as advertised are not feasible; novel alternatives are needed. This research addresses the assurance of such "black-box" components by developing and evaluating (1) techniques to discover and capture contracts - the do's and the don'ts - that the component must satisfy to operate safely in its intended environment, and (2) rigorous metric-driven criteria that can be used to guide as well as to assess the thoroughness of the component testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypotheses are that (1) novel test coverage adequacy criteria can be defined over the component's contracts as well as its object code; criteria that when satisfied will ensure the level of confidence needed for a critical system, and (2) object-code symbolic execution techniques can be developed for both automatic discovery of component behaviors as well as for verifying conformance to contracts. The expected advances from this research are: (a) new contract definition and discovery techniques suitable for contract-based testing, (b) coverage criteria for contracts and object-code of software, (c) enhanced object-code symbolic execution techniques, and (d) empirical evaluation of the approach on realistic systems. The anticipated broader impacts of this work are that: (a) observations from the empirical studies conducted provide guidance for regulatory agencies and standards organizations in their efforts; (b) commercial tool vendors adopt these techniques in their software development tools and thus help reduce the very high costs of testing critical systems; (c) extensive automation of the costly manual testing processes enabled by these new techniques provide a powerful incentive to formally specify and model requirements, thereby greatly improving quality in all aspects of software development projects; and (d) open-access to tools, case examples, experimental infrastructure, data, and curricular materials developed, advances the state of software engineering research, education and industrial practice.</AbstractNarration>
