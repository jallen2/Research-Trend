    <AbstractNarration>South Carolina (SC) is rapidly expanding into aviation, automotive, and advanced manufacturing, and regional employers are increasingly in need of well-educated technicians who are familiar with the specialized demands of a new generation of manufacturing jobs. The Center for Aviation and Automotive Technological Education Using Virtual E-Schools (CA2VES) and the state's 2-year institutions are creating opportunities to improve technician and STEM education and increase workforce preparedness for a large and diverse population of SC students. CA2VES brings together global and regional industry and educational partners to develop and disseminate such Digital Learning Tools (DLTs) as digital curricula, e-learning, simulations and virtual reality (VR) modules. DLTs have already given students greater academic control over time, place, path and pace, and provided students with the skills required by the rapidly expanding automotive and aerospace industries in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CA2VES team will continue to lead the design and development of DLTs working with industries and employers, and collaborate with Co-PIs (Florence-Darlington Technical College, Greenville Technical College, Spartanburg Community College and the SCATE Center) and additional ATE Centers to evaluate the effectiveness of DLTs in technician education programs. CA2VES and partners will design and execute recruitment campaigns to attract and engage underserved populations (specifically women, minorities and students from rural areas). CA2VES will also partner with 2-year institutions and high schools to customize and modularize DLTs, field test new modules and conduct ongoing research evaluating how others replicate and use CA2VES DLTs. The team will assess the improved pedagogical effectiveness of its work in the areas of innovations in teaching and learning, technology integration and workforce development. Additionally, the Center will provide rigorous evidence-based research in VR development for technician education and become a sustainable resource.</AbstractNarration>
