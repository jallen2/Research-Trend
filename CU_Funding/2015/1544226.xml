    <AbstractNarration>This project partially supports the travel of 16 US-based graduate students to the 11th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (CoNEXT), which will take place from December 1 to December 4, 2015 in Heidelberg, Germany. CoNEXT is a highly selective, high-quality conference sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM). The conference is a major forum for presentation and discussion of novel networking protocols and technologies. This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. Special emphasis will be placed on encouraging the participation of women and under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The support amount provided to each student will be $1,250 or the actual documented amount of expenses, whichever amounts to less. Each student will need to cover expenses in excess of the fixed amount from other funds. Preference in the award of the travel grants will be given to students who have their work accepted to the CoNEXT student workshop which will take place the first day of the conference. Other criteria will include evidence of a serious interest in networking, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience.</AbstractNarration>
