    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Stochastic Analysis and Related Topics" to be held May 20-22, 2015 at Purdue University. The primary goal of the conference is to provide a venue for researchers in probability theory to share recent advances in the field. The conference will consist primarily of talks by 17 invited speakers. This grant will help to cover the expenses of the invited speakers and also provide travel and local expenses for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other junior researchers attending the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the research in probability theory can be classified into one of two classes: 1) discrete probability models (random walks, interacting particle systems, models in statistical physics), and 2) stochastic analysis (stochastic PDE, diffusion processes, Malliavin calculus). The speakers in the conference are distinguished researchers whose work covers a wide array of topics in both discrete probability and stochastic analysis. The broad array of topics covered should provide a wonderful overview of the field of probability to the younger participants in attendance, and will also offer opportunities for researchers to form connections between different areas of research within probability theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The website for the conference is http://stochasticconference.wordpress.com/.</AbstractNarration>
