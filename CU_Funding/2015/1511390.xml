    <AbstractNarration>Previous work by the principal investigator (PI) has identified a promising catalyst formulation for the production of hydrogen via the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in highly-acidic electrocatalytic environments. The catalyst partially substitutes lower-cost tin (Sn) for the expensive noble metals iridium (Ir) and ruthenium (Ru). The goal of the present study is to further understand the reasons for the high performance and stability of the the Sn-containing catalysts as a guide for developing even better catalysts. The proposed work will contribute to improved, lower cost, electrocatalysts for a variety of energy applications and will develop creative educational tools for high school students in addition to undergraduate and graduate opportunities for underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal expands the PI's previous work with fluorine-doped mixed oxide SnIr catalysts to gain fundamental understanding of the reasons for their high performance with reduced noble metal loading. Both theoretical and experimental approaches will be employed focusing on a range of SnIr catalysts with varying Sn-to-Ir ratio, and with various levels of F-doping. By combining surface and bulk experimental probes with Density Functional Theory (VASP code)computational methods, they will obtain fundamental understanding of both the geometric and electronic structures responsible for the stability and performance attributes of the F-doped mixed oxide catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work has the potential to broadly impact our understanding of water electrolysis as promoted by catalysts containing reduced amounts of expensive precious metals compared to current catalyst technology, thereby aiding progress in areas related to fuel cells, hydrogen production, and overall energy sustainability. The research will also provide education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including recruiting minority students from North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University. In addition, the PI will undertake an ambitious program to engage high school students in the challenges and opportunities around water hydrolysis including audio-visual animation and hands-on demonstrations.</AbstractNarration>
