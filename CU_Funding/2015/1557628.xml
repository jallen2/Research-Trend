    <AbstractNarration>Astronomers have studied the radio waves that come to us from the universe since the 1930s. One &lt;br/&gt;fascinating phenomenon that has been measured in radio light is a faint, diffuse glow which covers the &lt;br/&gt;entire sky. This glow is best described as the "Radio Synchrotron Background", where the term &lt;br/&gt;"synchrotron" refers to particles making radio waves when they spin around magnetic fields. Interest in the "Radio &lt;br/&gt;Synchrotron Background" has been rekindled recently because of new measurements. This radio glow &lt;br/&gt;presents a mystery because it is difficult to explain how it came to be there with known astrophysical &lt;br/&gt;processes. It represents one of the mysteries of contemporary astrophysics. While there have been &lt;br/&gt;many publications in the literature on this topic, there has not yet been a scientific workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will hold the first scientific workshop on the radio synchrotron background, which will bring &lt;br/&gt;together scientists working in these overlapping fields to discuss the radio synchrotron background in &lt;br/&gt;person for the first time. There are implications for many areas of active research in contemporary &lt;br/&gt;astrophysics. The workshop will inspire new collaborations and new lines of inquiry, and may spur &lt;br/&gt;future meetings on the topic. This project funds travel support toward allowing scientists to attend the &lt;br/&gt;workshop as well as for a talk for the public and for a report for the scientific community on the &lt;br/&gt;outcome of the meeting. The workshop will be held at the University of Richmond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Radio Synchrotron Background is a newly re-appreciated astrophysical phenomenon which has been &lt;br/&gt;a subject of great interest to many in the community. Combining the ARCADE 2 balloon-based absolute &lt;br/&gt;spectrum data from 3-90 GHz with absolutely calibrated single-dish diffuse radio surveys at lower &lt;br/&gt;frequencies reveals a radio synchrotron excess that is several times brighter than was expected by &lt;br/&gt;many. The origin of the radio synchrotron background is one of the mysteries of contemporary &lt;br/&gt;astrophysics. It is difficult to produce the observed level of surface brightness by known processes &lt;br/&gt;without violating constraints. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existence of the radio background at the observed levels presents profound challenges for our &lt;br/&gt;current understanding of radio emission in the Galaxy and the universe. As demonstrated in many &lt;br/&gt;recent publications, there are implications for many areas of astrophysics, including cosmic ray &lt;br/&gt;propagation, galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, the radio to far-infrared correlation, radio source &lt;br/&gt;counts, X-ray source counts, quasar luminosity functions, dark matter annihilation, polarization of &lt;br/&gt;foregrounds in microwave background maps, population III stars, mergers of clusters, and many more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will feature plenary sessions made up of multiple presentations by attendees &lt;br/&gt;interspersed with and question and discussion periods centered around different topics that study of &lt;br/&gt;the radio synchrotron background touches. The visual component of individual presentations, in the &lt;br/&gt;form of PDF, PowerPoint, or similar files will be made available on the Web. Additionally, a report will &lt;br/&gt;be prepared for the scientific community on the outcome of the meeting. The priorities identified in the &lt;br/&gt;report will be determined by consensus of the meeting attendees as synthesized by the organizing &lt;br/&gt;committee. Finally, new collaborations and working relationships will be established.</AbstractNarration>
