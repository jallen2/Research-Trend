    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Ayres Freitas and Adam Leibovich at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This purpose of this project is to develop improved theoretical tools and calculational methods for the robust, model-independent interpretation of results from current and future particle-physics experiments, both at the highest-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider, and for lower-energy precision measurements. The identification of a potentially small signal of new physics requires an excellent understanding of known particles and interactions. Furthermore, we will investigate techniques for model-independent descriptions of the effects of new physics, using a framework called "effective field theories". As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. In conjunction with this effort, the PI's will also teach a special-topics course on effective field theories and precision physics. Both are topics that are often neglected in typical particle-physics textbooks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, the research program can be divided into three main parts: (1) The development of calculational techniques for three-loop corrections to electroweak precision observables, and the integration of existing and new theoretical results for these observables into a flexible, object-oriented computer program; (2) The application of effective field theories, in particular Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, to unresolved questions at hadron colliders, such as processes involving jets, quarkonium production, and low-x physics; and (3) A comprehensive study of the use of effective field theories for new physics in Higgs, electroweak and flavor physics, with a focus on investigating correlations between operators, the role of different mass scales in the new-physics sector, and complications that arise in models of dark matter. This research plan is guided by ongoing and planned experimental high-energy physics efforts, and results will be made available to the experimental community in a suitable form.</AbstractNarration>
