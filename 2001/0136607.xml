    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues organize the third&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Foundations of Computational Mathematics at the&lt;br/&gt;Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), University&lt;br/&gt;of Minnesota on 5-14 August 2002. Deepening the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical processes that underlie fast computation and&lt;br/&gt;computer simulation is the principal goal of the meeting. The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical content covers fields of research at the interface&lt;br/&gt;of engineering, computer science, and pure mathematics, but&lt;br/&gt;focused on computation. The program includes 18 3-day workshops&lt;br/&gt;and 18 plenary speakers. The plenary talks and workshops span&lt;br/&gt;subjects of vital interest to the nation's infrastructure,&lt;br/&gt;economy, and defense. The project supports participation by&lt;br/&gt;postdocs, graduate students, junior participants, women and&lt;br/&gt;minorities as well as plenary and semi-plenary speakers and&lt;br/&gt;workshop organizers.&lt;br/&gt; Large-scale computation and the implementation of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for complex physical and societal phenomena&lt;br/&gt;are of fundamental importance to the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;Computation is also the backbone of the sciences supporting the&lt;br/&gt;nation's defense. Large-scale computation is the engine of&lt;br/&gt;numerical models for complex physical phenomena occurring at many&lt;br/&gt;scales. Fast computation and processing of the ever-increasing&lt;br/&gt;data sets obtained from various sensors is critical to the new&lt;br/&gt;military. The purpose of this major meeting, held only every&lt;br/&gt;three years, is to further the understanding of the deep&lt;br/&gt;relationships between mathematical theory: analysis, topology,&lt;br/&gt;geometry and algebra, and computational processes as they are&lt;br/&gt;evolving in tandem with the modern computer. The topics to be&lt;br/&gt;addressed include large scale computation and high performance&lt;br/&gt;computing as occurs in atmospheric and groundwater modeling,&lt;br/&gt;computer aided design and animation, data, image and signal&lt;br/&gt;processing, modeling network traffic, quantum computing, learning&lt;br/&gt;theory, optimization and control. Sustaining the nation's&lt;br/&gt;advantage in these vital areas relies on understanding the&lt;br/&gt;foundations of computational science. The meeting involves&lt;br/&gt;350-500 researchers in 18 workshops over a 10-day period, with&lt;br/&gt;special plenary sessions attended by everyone. A large contingent&lt;br/&gt;of graduate students and other young scientists are&lt;br/&gt;participating, and the program is designed to promote intensive&lt;br/&gt;interaction among the participants. Several panels are devoted to&lt;br/&gt;identifying the most promising directions for future research.&lt;br/&gt;Published proceedings, web-based materials, and the conference&lt;br/&gt;sessions themselves serve as launching pads for focus and special&lt;br/&gt;interest groups for future interactions in a range of subjects at&lt;br/&gt;the interface of mathematics and computation.</AbstractNarration>
