    <AbstractNarration>The Third Workshop on Magnetism and Superconductivity of Advanced Materials (Ladek Zdroj, Poland, July 15-20, 2002) will direct its focus on the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. A wide spectrum of new materials with novel properties, which have been discovered during the last three years, will be discussed at the workshop. Some of the materials presented will include new oxide magnetic superconductors from the class of ruthenocuprates, selected tripled state superconductors (UGe2, Sr2RuO4), heavy fermion compounds, modified C60 fullerenes, MgB2 (a "classic" superconductor that is challenging our current theoretical and experimental understanding of the electron-phonon interaction and gap anisotropy), and new compounds in the related class of manganites and ruthenates. Progress in the field of artificial heterostructures that consist of spatially distinct superconducting and magnetic layers, including systems that enable novel probes of the interaction of magnets and superconductors across an intervening layer, will be also reviewed and discussed at the meeting. An important goal of the Workshop will be providing an opportunity to strengthen collaborations between U.S. and European scientists, as well as enabling new collaborations to form. The workshop proceedings will be published in a special issue of Physica C, and will include articles based on both oral and poster presentations.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The Third Workshop on Magnetism and Superconductivity of Advanced Materials (Ladek Zdroj, Poland, July 15-20, 2002) addresses issues of novel superconducting and magnetic materials. Emphasis will be placed on properties, characterization, and processing of compounds exhibiting a range of novel phenomena arising from mutual interactions of magnetism and superconductivity. The need for this conference arises from the rapid development of this field, which is also of high interest in the community of contemporary mainstream condensed matter physics. This Workshop will also feature properties and processing of artificially grown magneto-superconducting, layered heterostructures, as well as magnesium diboride - an exciting new superconductor. Theoretical understanding of the properties of these materials and development of applications of their unique magnetic and electronic properties will be reviewed in depth at the meeting. An important goal of the workshop will be to provide U.S. and European scientists the opportunity to strengthen, as well as form new, collaborations. Young Polish and American scientists attending the workshop will be exposed to world-class research in the fields of superconductivity and magnetism. They will have the opportunity to interact in the workshop as well. All talks will be thorough, with generous time allowed for substantive discussions between the participants and speakers. The workshop materials will be published in a special issue of Physica C, and will include articles based on both oral and poster presentations.&lt;br/&gt; This NSF project is co-funded between DMR and INT as a Cooperative. Activity in Materials Sciences between the National Science Foundation and the European Commission (NSF 01-105). The project is being carried out in collaboration with the Center of Excellence for Physics and Fabrication of Low Dimensional Structures for Technologies of Future Generations (CELDIS) operated by the Polish Academy of Science within the 5th EC Framework Programme.</AbstractNarration>
