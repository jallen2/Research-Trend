    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0101364&lt;br/&gt;Gunnar Carlsson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to develop flexible &lt;br/&gt;topological methods which will allow the analysis of data &lt;br/&gt;which is difficult to analyze using classical linear methods. &lt;br/&gt;Data obtained by sampling from highly curved manifolds or &lt;br/&gt;singular algebraic varieties in Euclidean space are typical &lt;br/&gt;examples where our methods will be useful. We intend to &lt;br/&gt;develop and refine two pieces of software which have been &lt;br/&gt;written by members of our research group, ISOMAP (Tenenbaum) &lt;br/&gt;and PLEX (de Silva-Carlsson). ISOMAP is a tool for dimension &lt;br/&gt;reduction and parameterization of high dimensional data sets, &lt;br/&gt;and PLEX is a homology computing tool which we will use in &lt;br/&gt;locating and analyzing singular points in data sets, as well &lt;br/&gt;as estimating dimension in situations where standard methods &lt;br/&gt;do not work well. We plan to extend the range of &lt;br/&gt;applicability of both tools, in the case of ISOMAP by &lt;br/&gt;studying embeddings into spaces with non-Euclidean metrics, &lt;br/&gt;and in the case of PLEX by building in the Mayer-Vietoris &lt;br/&gt;spectral sequence as a tool Both ISOMAP and PLEX will be &lt;br/&gt;adapted for parallel computing. We will also begin the &lt;br/&gt;theoretical study of statistical questions relating to &lt;br/&gt;topology. For instance, we will initiate the study of &lt;br/&gt;higher dimensional homology of subsets sampled from &lt;br/&gt;Euclidean space under various sampling hypotheses. &lt;br/&gt;The key object of study will be the family of Cech &lt;br/&gt;complexes constructed using the distance function in &lt;br/&gt;Euclidean space together with a randomly chosen finite &lt;br/&gt;set of points in Euclidean space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop tools for &lt;br/&gt;understanding data sets which are not easy to understand &lt;br/&gt;using standard methods. This kind of data might include &lt;br/&gt;singular points, or might be strongly curved. The &lt;br/&gt;data is also high dimensional, in the sense that each &lt;br/&gt;data point has many coordinates. For instance, we might &lt;br/&gt;have a data set whose points each of which is an image, &lt;br/&gt;which has one coordinate for each pixel. Many standard &lt;br/&gt;tools rely on linear approximations, which do not work &lt;br/&gt;well in strongly curved or singular problems. The kind &lt;br/&gt;of tools we have in mind are in part topological, in &lt;br/&gt;the sense that they measure more qualitative properties &lt;br/&gt;of the spaces involved, such as connectedness, or the &lt;br/&gt;number of holes in a space, and so on. This group of &lt;br/&gt;methods has the capability of recognizing the number &lt;br/&gt;of parameters required to describe a space, without &lt;br/&gt;actually parameterizing it. These methods also have the &lt;br/&gt;capability of recognizing singular points (like points &lt;br/&gt;where two non-parallel planes or non-parallel lines &lt;br/&gt;intersect), without actually having to construct &lt;br/&gt;coordinates on the space. We will also be further &lt;br/&gt;developing and refining methods we have already &lt;br/&gt;constructed which can actually find good parameterizations &lt;br/&gt;for many high dimensional data sets. Both projects will &lt;br/&gt;involve the adaptation for the computer of many methods &lt;br/&gt;which have heretofore been used in by-hand calculations &lt;br/&gt;for solving theoretical problems. We will also initiate &lt;br/&gt;the theoretical development of topological tools in a setting &lt;br/&gt;which includes errors and sampling.</AbstractNarration>
