    <AbstractNarration>Cytochrome c and apoptosis activating factor-1 (apaf-1) are the judge and&lt;br/&gt;jury of mitochondrially-mediated programmed cell death (apoptosis). Their&lt;br/&gt;interaction seals a cell's fate by launching a tightly controlled program that ends&lt;br/&gt;in cellular disintegration, and imbalances in this regulation are associated with&lt;br/&gt;cancer, neurological diseases, and heart disease. Given the biological and&lt;br/&gt;medical relevance of this protein-protein reaction, it is surprising that its&lt;br/&gt;molecular basis is unknown. The broad long-term goal of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;determine the molecular basis for the interaction between cytochrome c and&lt;br/&gt;apaf-1. The main hypotheses are: a) Cytochrome c uses the same cationic&lt;br/&gt;patch to interact with apaf-1 and its redox partners. b) Apaf-1 uses specific&lt;br/&gt;anionic patches to interact with cytochrome c.&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims are 1) Quantify apaf-1 / cytochrome c binding, 2) Identify&lt;br/&gt;probable binding sites on apaf-1 and cytochrome c, 3) Test the binding sites.&lt;br/&gt;Sedimentation equilibrium methods will be used to quantify binding, but&lt;br/&gt;alternative methods are also discussed. Probable binding sites on the WD repeat&lt;br/&gt;domain of apaf-1 have been identified in modeling studies, and the redox-partner&lt;br/&gt;binding site on cytochrome c has been known for many years. The sites&lt;br/&gt;will be tested by using site directed mutagenesis. To ensure that biologically&lt;br/&gt;significant data are obtained, the variants will first be assessed by using a quick&lt;br/&gt;and biologically relevant caspase activation assay. Once the biologically&lt;br/&gt;relevant residues have been identified, the biophysics of the variants will be&lt;br/&gt;characterized. Circular dichroism spectropolarimetry will be used to assess their&lt;br/&gt;integrity. Sedimentation velocity experiments on apaf-1 variants will be used to&lt;br/&gt;assess their effects on intraprotein interactions. Sedimentation equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;techniques from aim 1 will be used to quantify their effects on the free energy&lt;br/&gt;and stoichiometry of complex formation.</AbstractNarration>
