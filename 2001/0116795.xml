    <AbstractNarration>Explorations in Science is an activity-based physics course for non-science majors. Developed during my&lt;br/&gt;tenure as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education (PFSMETE), Explorations in Science uses the study of common, natural phenomena and student-directed&lt;br/&gt;group projects to stimulate interest in a population traditionally quite apathetic towards physics. Activities&lt;br/&gt;use sophisticated computer tools to take, display, and interpret data. I would like to bring this curriculum to&lt;br/&gt;my new, permanent, institution, the Rochester Institute of Technology. While RIT is an institution of&lt;br/&gt;technology, it has a significant population of students who will benefit from Explorations in Science&lt;br/&gt;including students of imaging science, business, and the social sciences. Faculty from the College of&lt;br/&gt;Imaging Arts &amp; Sciences have already expressed interest in Explorations in Science, particularly the&lt;br/&gt;projects dealing with human body motions as these are relevant to students studying computer animation.&lt;br/&gt;To successfully offer Explorations in Science at RIT, computer sensors (e.g. force sensors, temperature&lt;br/&gt;probes, and light sensors) must be purchased. Roughly half of this proposal is for equipment that are not&lt;br/&gt;currently available in our existing labs.&lt;br/&gt;A necessary condition for the successful implementation of new materials is faculty support. To facilitate&lt;br/&gt;the implementation of a research-based curricula, I would like to begin a new project on faculty objectives&lt;br/&gt;for introductory physics courses. RIT has a national reputation of excellence in engineering and the&lt;br/&gt;imaging arts. Therefore, an overwhelming majority of students taking introductory physics at RIT are not&lt;br/&gt;physics majors. It is important to understand why other departments require these students to take physics&lt;br/&gt;and what they want their students to take from the class. The traditional answers, including "how to think"&lt;br/&gt;and "problem-solving ability," are too vague to be useful. Recent work in physics education has attempted&lt;br/&gt;to uncover exactly what is meant by "how to think," i.e. what we the physics community see as the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental diamond in the physics rough. By using the ideas and vocabulary from this research, 1 hope to&lt;br/&gt;be able to better characterize how other departments see physics. This will allow physics departments to&lt;br/&gt;better suit the needs of the majority of their students and make it easier to introduce new curricula such as&lt;br/&gt;Explorations in Physics.</AbstractNarration>
