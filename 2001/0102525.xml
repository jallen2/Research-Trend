    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0102525 (Blaine Lawson)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with global problems in geometry and in&lt;br/&gt;particular with the study of cycles residues and differential characters.&lt;br/&gt;It focuses on the relationship between certain important families of cycles&lt;br/&gt;in a space and the geometry of the space itself. Of particular interest&lt;br/&gt;are algebraic cycles and the cycles associated to singularities of mappings&lt;br/&gt;or the higher order contact of geometric structures. These objects -- of&lt;br/&gt;importance in themselves -- have been shown to have ties to other areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. A major aim here is the discovery and development of such&lt;br/&gt;ties. The proposal has several interrelated parts. The first concerns groups&lt;br/&gt;of algebraic cycles and cocycles on a projective variety. A theory of&lt;br/&gt;homology-type based on cycles has been developed by the proposer and&lt;br/&gt;others. It will be used to study concrete questions about algebraic&lt;br/&gt;spaces. In a variant of the theory involving real algebraic cycles,&lt;br/&gt;surprizing connections to equivariant homotopy theory have been found. &lt;br/&gt;The implications for real algebraic geometry will be explored, and the&lt;br/&gt;quaternionic analogues will be studied. A second part of the proposal concerns differential &lt;br/&gt;characters, objects which mediate between cycles and smooth data, and lead to important&lt;br/&gt;geometric invariants. Recent discoveries have been made concerning them --&lt;br/&gt;for example, the existence of a fundamental duality theorem. Further&lt;br/&gt;development of the theory is proposed. Geometric results will be sought by&lt;br/&gt;bringing the calculus of variations to bear in this domain. A third area of the proposal &lt;br/&gt;concerns the study of singularities and characteristic forms. The subject includes &lt;br/&gt;a generalization of Chern-Weil theory which gives canonical homologies between singularities &lt;br/&gt;of bundle maps and characteristic forms. Many applications concerning the global&lt;br/&gt;geometry of singularities, and its relation to characteristic classes and&lt;br/&gt;differential characters, will be investigated. A forth area is concerned with special &lt;br/&gt;cycles in geometry: Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds, and associative &lt;br/&gt;and Cayley cycles in G(2) and Spin(7) spaces. These latter subjects relate to gauge&lt;br/&gt;field theory and gravity in Physics as well as many areas of geometry and&lt;br/&gt;algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A concept of central importance in geometry is that of a ``cycle''.&lt;br/&gt;In algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the simultaneous solution of a&lt;br/&gt;system of polynomial equations. In differential geometry cycles arise in&lt;br/&gt;many ways: as the large scale solutions of certain differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;and as the level sets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings.&lt;br/&gt;Curves and surfaces in space are simple examples. This proposal is&lt;br/&gt;concerned with the study of certain important classes of cycles which arise&lt;br/&gt;in geometry. Part of the study aims at relating them to fundamental&lt;br/&gt;large-scale geometry of the surrounding space. In the algebraic case this&lt;br/&gt;has led to the establishment of surprizing and important relationships&lt;br/&gt;between spaces of algebraic cycles and fundamental constructions in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic topology that have led to new insights in both fields. This work&lt;br/&gt;will be continued with the intent of obtaining further concrete&lt;br/&gt;applications. A second part of the proposal concerns differential characters,&lt;br/&gt;objects which mediate between cycles and smooth data. They lead to&lt;br/&gt;important geometric invariants and have appeared in discussions of the&lt;br/&gt;``Mirror Symmetry Conjecture'' from modern physics. The proposer has made&lt;br/&gt;some recent discoveries about characters, including a basic Duality&lt;br/&gt;Theorem. Further development of the theory and its applications is&lt;br/&gt;proposed. Another area of investigation is concerned with relations&lt;br/&gt;between cycles and geometry which arise from connections. Connections are&lt;br/&gt;fundamental in mathematics, where they constitute differentiation laws, and&lt;br/&gt;in physics, where they represent the fundamental forces of nature at the&lt;br/&gt;classical level. The investigator has developed a theory of singular connections which&lt;br/&gt;encompasses much previously unrelated phenomena and has applications to&lt;br/&gt;many areas of geometry. The proposal will continue this work with&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on applications. Yet another area of the proposal is concerned&lt;br/&gt;with very special cycles in geometry which relate to gauge field theory and&lt;br/&gt;gravity in Physics as well as many areas of geometry and algebra. &lt;br/&gt;This project will also be concerned with graduate student development.&lt;br/&gt;Students will be part of the research team. There will also be an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate educational effort aimed at fostering mathematical&lt;br/&gt;independence and developing interactive environments.</AbstractNarration>
