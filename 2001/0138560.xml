    <AbstractNarration>The rapid development of technology and its by-products require increased&lt;br/&gt;precision in mathematical modeling of the relevant phenomena to make the&lt;br/&gt;models more realistic and more readily applicable. This has required some&lt;br/&gt;basic changes in the direction of research in many fundamental areas. The&lt;br/&gt;scientists concerned have been involved for some years now in promoting the&lt;br/&gt;use of advanced methods in Analytical Dynamics and Control, and in the&lt;br/&gt;Control of Complex Nonlinear Systems. The workshop will involve experts both&lt;br/&gt;in the purely dynamical aspects of such systems so that improved models with&lt;br/&gt;more realistic predictions can be generated and experts in Lyapunov&lt;br/&gt;formalisms for handling bounded uncertainties in system parameters so that&lt;br/&gt;control actions can be made in the face of uncertainties. A range of&lt;br/&gt;application areas is also intended to be broached, so that a crossover of&lt;br/&gt;information between various disciplines that have the same types of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems can be effected. Past experience has shown that such&lt;br/&gt;crossover of information has led to new ideas and new collaborative research&lt;br/&gt;projects among attendees of the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Eleven workshops have been held to date between 1986 and 2000. The first&lt;br/&gt;five were held in the US at the University of Southern California, and they&lt;br/&gt;helped to get together scientists and engineers mainly from the US and the&lt;br/&gt;Pacific Rim, with occasional participation from scientists from other&lt;br/&gt;countries. In an effort to initiate a technical exchange between US and West&lt;br/&gt;European scientists and engineers who are working in this area, the next two&lt;br/&gt;workshops were held in Vienna (Austria) and Ulm (Germany). The East European&lt;br/&gt;scientific community was drawn into the following workshop in Sopron&lt;br/&gt;(Hungary), which was co-sponsored by NSF and the Hungarian Academy of&lt;br/&gt;Sciences. The 1997 workshop was held in Rio de Janeiro and was sponsored by&lt;br/&gt;the Brazilian Ministry of Science. This workshop indicated that there were&lt;br/&gt;numerous scientists working in the area of Dynamical systems and Control in&lt;br/&gt;South America. The tenth workshop was held in Lambrecht (Germany) and was&lt;br/&gt;co-sponsored by the Volkswagen Corporation and the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation. The large community of scientists and engineers working in South&lt;br/&gt;America caused the International Organizing Committee to select Brazil yet&lt;br/&gt;another time, and the 11th workshop was held in Brazil in 2000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It has been decided by the International Organizing Committee to have the&lt;br/&gt;next workshop in the US, in Los Angeles, bringing the venue after an entire&lt;br/&gt;decade back to the location from which the workshops initiated. The workshop&lt;br/&gt;will be held at the University of Southern California. One of the main&lt;br/&gt;thrusts of this particular workshop is to focus more on bringing junior&lt;br/&gt;faculty (especially women-faculty) and graduate students, so that they can&lt;br/&gt;have a greater chance of increased exposure to the more established&lt;br/&gt;community in the area of dynamics and control, and so that they can have an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to interact with their counterparts who are working outside the&lt;br/&gt;US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These workshops, each of whose proceedings have been published either as&lt;br/&gt;special journal issues or as books, have led to the realization that there&lt;br/&gt;are today a large number of scientists who are working in South America, the&lt;br/&gt;former USSR, as well as both West and East European countries like Germany,&lt;br/&gt;France, Russia and the Ukraine, in similar areas of dynamics and control. In&lt;br/&gt;particular the last three meetings have clearly pointed out the need for&lt;br/&gt;increased interaction between scientists from Europe, South America, and the&lt;br/&gt;former USSR. There appears to be a substantial body of information gathered&lt;br/&gt;in these countries that is yet unknown to US scientists and engineers. An&lt;br/&gt;exchange of information in this important area with our colleagues in these&lt;br/&gt;countries will be beneficial to the engineering and scientific community&lt;br/&gt;here in the US. These workshops have led, in the past, to collaborative&lt;br/&gt;research projects, not only among the US attendees but also between&lt;br/&gt;investigators from the US and those from different countries; some of these&lt;br/&gt;joint research projects have been funded by NSF. We therefore expect, as&lt;br/&gt;before, that the forthcoming workshop will open up new avenues for&lt;br/&gt;collaborative research and sustained long-term cooperation among scientists&lt;br/&gt;and engineers through joint research projects. This, we hope, will be more&lt;br/&gt;so true for this particular workshop, since its focus will be more on junior&lt;br/&gt;faculty who may be more active and enterprising.</AbstractNarration>
