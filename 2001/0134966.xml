    <AbstractNarration>0134966&lt;br/&gt;Hud&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continental weathering is an important component of global geochemical cycles and is one of the most significant determinants of the atmospheric CO2 levels, and hence climate, on geologic time scales. Weathering of organic carbon is an important source of CO2; weathering of silicates a sink. The long-term goal of the PI's research is to understand the mechanisms and magnitudes of continental weathering in various pristine environments at present and to then project the results into the geologic past using suitable proxies. In this endeavor, characterizing the behavior of different chemical elements as a function of weathering environment is important. The PI proposes to study weathering of organic carbon rich reducing sediments as manifested in large pristine rivers. This proposal describes an integrative approach using redox-sensitive, oxyanion-forming elements (Re, Mo, V, U) and the Os isotopic system (187Os/188Os) intimately related to them. These elements are enriched in reducing sediments and are released as soluble oxyanions when they undergo fast oxidative weathering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research activities consist of three parts: field work, instrumental analyses and data interpretation. Field work will be carried out in western China, eastern Tibet, and northern Vietnam, areas affected by the Himalayan collision but whose fluvial geochemistry is poorly understood. This will be a continuation of the successful collaboration with scientists in China and Vietnam. A graduate student at Northwestern University and visiting scholars from China/Vietnam will be involved in all three activities. At undergraduate students level, this research will be integrated into the Analytical Methods in Geochemistry course that the PI is developing to strengthen the interdisciplinary Environmental Science Program at Northwestern University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide fundamental understanding of the behavior of redox-sensitive elements and Os isotopes, which is in turn important in deciphering the paleo-environments of the Earth. Additional benefit is documenting the present weathering regime of the Upper Yangtze, which is important for the Chinese scientists in their attempt to monitor the effect of the Three Gorges Dam and erosion of top soil that is becoming a serious problem. Also, a clear comparison can be made between the undeveloped headwaters and the agriculturally impacted lower reaches of the Chinese and Vietnamese rivers.</AbstractNarration>
