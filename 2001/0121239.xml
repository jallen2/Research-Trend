    <AbstractNarration>e are proposing to develop computational tools for researchers&lt;br/&gt;and students to model, visualize, and analyze historic and ancient&lt;br/&gt;sites. This proposal addresses four major scientific components&lt;br/&gt;to support this research. First, we are proposing new methods&lt;br/&gt;of creating complex, 3-D, photorealistic models of large sites.&lt;br/&gt;This includes a mobile robot sensing system that can be used as&lt;br/&gt;an intelligent sensing device over a large scale. Second, we are&lt;br/&gt;proposing to develop new methods to image below-ground data accurately&lt;br/&gt;and efficiently. These methods are especially suited to modeling&lt;br/&gt;the wealth of subsurface information at archaeological sites.&lt;br/&gt;Third, we will be developing new database technology to catalog&lt;br/&gt;and access a site's structures, artifacts, objects, and historical&lt;br/&gt;references. This will significantly improve a user's ability to&lt;br/&gt;query and analyze a site's information. Fourth, we have created&lt;br/&gt;a wearable augmented reality system for presenting georegistered&lt;br/&gt;information to mobile users, using overlaid graphics and sound.&lt;br/&gt;We will extend this system to create a new class of information&lt;br/&gt;visualization systems that integrate 3-D above- and below-ground&lt;br/&gt;models, 2-D images, text and other web-based resources to annotate&lt;br/&gt;the physical environment We will apply this system to support&lt;br/&gt;scientists in the field, as well to allow on-site and remote tours&lt;br/&gt;of historic and ancient sites. The research will utilize a local&lt;br/&gt;testbed, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City,&lt;br/&gt;and a unique and important archaeological excavation at the Dakhleh&lt;br/&gt;Oasis in Egypt. The project will attract students and the public&lt;br/&gt;to the study of world heritage; provide an exceptional opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for active learning; and develop our ability to explore, analyze,&lt;br/&gt;critically evaluate and interpret material culture within historical&lt;br/&gt;contexts. The challenge is to bring the on-site experiences that&lt;br/&gt;develop these skills to the classroom and the public in general.&lt;br/&gt;Through critical inquiry and a variety of techniques, teachers&lt;br/&gt;and students can reconstruct examples of material culture to develop&lt;br/&gt;a complex understanding of the past. In this way, we can resist&lt;br/&gt;the temptation to replicate with new technologies what we have&lt;br/&gt;done successfully with other means and instead expand the possibilities&lt;br/&gt;for learning. Through learning in context, this project will bring&lt;br/&gt;together the primary sources of various fields and draw the social&lt;br/&gt;sciences out of the classroom into the historical milieu. This&lt;br/&gt;project will hopefully redefine the relationships among technology,&lt;br/&gt;faculty research and curriculum content. Most important, it will&lt;br/&gt;disseminate this information to as wide an audience as possible.</AbstractNarration>
