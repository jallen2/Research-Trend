    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0103208&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Lee Mosher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivating theme of geometric group theory is that finitely&lt;br/&gt;generated groups can be studied using topological and geometric&lt;br/&gt;methods. Starting around 1980, Gromov proposed classifying&lt;br/&gt;groups geometrically using the relation of quasi-isometry. He&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated that the quasi-isometry class of a group G can often&lt;br/&gt;be described explicitly in simple algebraic or geometric terms, a&lt;br/&gt;process now referred to as ``quasi-isometric rigidity'' or&lt;br/&gt;``QI-rigidity'' for the group G. The first part of this project&lt;br/&gt;will be to investigate QI-rigidity problems for graphs of surface&lt;br/&gt;groups and of abelian groups. An initial focus will be those&lt;br/&gt;graphs of groups with the simplest algebraic structure, namely&lt;br/&gt;semidirect products with free groups, determined by a&lt;br/&gt;homomorphism from a free group into an appropriate automorphism&lt;br/&gt;group such as the mapping class group of a surface. General&lt;br/&gt;graphs of surface groups are determined by homomorphisms into the&lt;br/&gt;commensurability mapping class group, a much more mysterious&lt;br/&gt;object, and this point of view will be used to investigate&lt;br/&gt;constructions of new and interesting examples. Also, recent work&lt;br/&gt;on graphs of abelian groups has revealed a lot of rich structure,&lt;br/&gt;suggesting a real possibility of obtaining QI-rigidity in many&lt;br/&gt;new cases. In the second part of this project, the focus will be&lt;br/&gt;to study geometric properties of free groups, motivated by&lt;br/&gt;analogies between surface groups and free groups. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;Thurston's ending lamination conjecture, an important goal in the&lt;br/&gt;study of surface groups, has an analogue in the study of free&lt;br/&gt;groups, in terms of classifying certain group actions up to&lt;br/&gt;equivariant quasi-isometry. Pursuing this issue will require&lt;br/&gt;generalizing many of the standard tools of surface groups, such&lt;br/&gt;as geodesics in Teichmuller space, to the setting of free groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is the study of infinitely symmetric&lt;br/&gt;patterns. Popular examples called ``surface groups'' are&lt;br/&gt;familiar from wallpaper symmetries and from the symmetries of&lt;br/&gt;Escher's prints. Scientific examples occur in the symmetry&lt;br/&gt;groups of crystalline arrays, and the symmetry groups of field&lt;br/&gt;theories in particle physics. The development of topology&lt;br/&gt;starting in the late 19th century, and the concomitant&lt;br/&gt;development of combinatorial group theory, exhibited a direct&lt;br/&gt;link between abstract groups and geometry. The need for deeper&lt;br/&gt;understanding of this link has been demonstrated again and again&lt;br/&gt;by different threads within 20th century mathematical&lt;br/&gt;developments. Many of these threads were pulled together around&lt;br/&gt;1980 by Gromov, whose proposed unification of geometric group&lt;br/&gt;theory using the relation of ``quasi-isometry'' has been very&lt;br/&gt;fruitful in the intervening twenty years. The focus of this&lt;br/&gt;research project will be to investigate quasi-isometric&lt;br/&gt;classification problems for several different types of symmetry&lt;br/&gt;groups. In particular, by using a constructive technique known&lt;br/&gt;as ``graphs of groups'', new symmetry groups can be constructed&lt;br/&gt;out of familiar examples such as surface groups; these and&lt;br/&gt;closely related constructions will be the subjects of this&lt;br/&gt;research project.</AbstractNarration>
