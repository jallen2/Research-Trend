    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the Eleventh International Symposium on Nondestructive Characterization of Materials to be held June 24-28, 2002, in Berlin, Germany. This will be the latest in a series of international symposia that was first held in 1983. The objective of these symposia is to provide a unique focus on the science and technology of nondestructive evaluation applied to materials characterization. The ultimate goal is to develop innovative, more sensitive and more precise methods to characterize the properties of materials much earlier than possible with current nondestructive testing techniques, so that any material alterations detrimental to the desired application can be detected and corrected well before macroscopic defects occur. Papers will include research and applications for aging infrastructure, nondestructive characterization of microstructures, on-line measurements for process control, precision and accuracy of nondestructive characterization measurements, advances in computed assisted tomography, non-contact ultrasonics, microwave advances and applications, and advanced high resolution probing techniques. Of considerable interest will be state-of-the-art developments and applications where the complex nature of materials has been recognized. The recipients of funds will be selected by the organizing committee with awareness of geographical distribution and the desire to include as many women and minorities as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nondestructive characterization of materials has been of immense interest to the materials community as well as practicing engineers concerned about the quality and sensitivity of nondestructive examination of real structures. This symposium functions to gather together both NDT technologists and NDE researchers. Research, needs, and applications in the nondestructive testing and evaluation of material characteristics such as yield strength, ductility, elastic modulus, grain size, microstructure, texture, fiber placement, and residual stress will be discussed. Several poster sessions will be held during the course of the symposium so that many participants can present the results of their research efforts, especially young scientists and graduate students. This grant supports the travel and registration of selected participants based on their need and expertise.</AbstractNarration>
