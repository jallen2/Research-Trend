    <AbstractNarration>The first experiment to measure the ratio of the elastic and magnetic form&lt;br/&gt;factors of the proton at large four-momentum squared, Q^2 with good&lt;br/&gt;accuracy produced unexpected results. This experiment realized in 1998 at&lt;br/&gt;Jefferson Lab used the recoil polarization technique, which takes advantage&lt;br/&gt;of the fact that the transverse component of the recoil proton polarization&lt;br/&gt;is proportional to the product of the 2 form factors, thus allowing accurate&lt;br/&gt;determination of the small electric form factor. In a second experiment at&lt;br/&gt;JLab in 2000, the measurement was extended to 5.6 GeV^2 , the results&lt;br/&gt;confirmed the intrinsically different Q^2-dependence of the electric and&lt;br/&gt;magnetic form factors of the proton beyond any doubt. The data from these 2&lt;br/&gt;JLab experiments have been a challenge for theoretical models which attempt&lt;br/&gt;to describe the proton structure in the non-perturbative domain of Quantum&lt;br/&gt;Chromo Dynamics (QCD). As the simplicity of perturbative QCD may not be&lt;br/&gt;encountered at accessible laboratory energies, an understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;structure of the proton (and likewise of the other nucleon, the neutron)&lt;br/&gt;requires the use of phenomenological models which depend in parts on data.&lt;br/&gt;Nucleons are the building blocks of the matter we are made of and in which&lt;br/&gt;we live. A full understanding of the structure of the nucleon in terms of&lt;br/&gt;its quark and gluon constituents will be achieved only when we accumulate a&lt;br/&gt;complete data base of its response to the electromagnetic probe, electrons&lt;br/&gt;and photons, over a large enough Q^2-range; such experiment represent&lt;br/&gt;the main part of the research program at JLab. We now have a third&lt;br/&gt;experiment, recently approved with highest priority; it will extend the&lt;br/&gt;range of Q^2 probed to 9 GeV^2.This grant will make it possible for&lt;br/&gt;me to continue leading this project to and through the next phase, which&lt;br/&gt;require new detectors (a new polarimeter to measure the recoil proton&lt;br/&gt;polarization, and a new calorimeter to measure the associate scattered&lt;br/&gt;electron) and will take 3 years to prepare.</AbstractNarration>
