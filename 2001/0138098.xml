    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0138098&lt;br/&gt;Thomas J. Peters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will define new representations for &lt;br/&gt;intersecting spline surfaces within computer-aided design &lt;br/&gt;(CAD) geometric objects. They will also create algorithms &lt;br/&gt;to compute error bounds for approximated intersections &lt;br/&gt;representing topological boundaries. Many modeling&lt;br/&gt;techniques for geometric design depend upon reliable &lt;br/&gt;intersection algorithms. Intersection algorithms will be &lt;br/&gt;designed to deliver spline-based CAD geometric models that &lt;br/&gt;can be robustly used within a variety of engineering &lt;br/&gt;calculations. These intersection representations and error &lt;br/&gt;bounds will significantly improve robustness between engineering &lt;br/&gt;design and computational applications for stress analysis, &lt;br/&gt;fluid dynamics and electromagnetics. No single intersection representation or method will be appropriate for all &lt;br/&gt;intersection problems, similar to the mature view&lt;br/&gt;taken in computational linear algebra relative to matrix &lt;br/&gt;inversion. There, a matrix is first analyzed as to whether &lt;br/&gt;it is singular, ill-conditioned (as in the case of a Hilbert &lt;br/&gt;matrix), positive-definite, etc. For these approximated &lt;br/&gt;spline intersections, new guaranteed error bounds will be &lt;br/&gt;developed, as well as corresponding new criteria for&lt;br/&gt;semantic consistency of the intersection boundaries formed &lt;br/&gt;within spline-based geometric models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, the significant improvements to approximated &lt;br/&gt;spline models from this project will provide clear benefits &lt;br/&gt;to science, industry, and defense. The delivery of the &lt;br/&gt;Boeing 777 airplane has been hailed in the popular press &lt;br/&gt;as the first production of a 'paperless' airplane, meaning &lt;br/&gt;that computerized models supplanted the traditional paper&lt;br/&gt;drawings of the engineering design room. While an impressive&lt;br/&gt;milestone, the next ambitious step is to eliminate many of &lt;br/&gt;the physical prototypes used for destructive testing&lt;br/&gt;and engineering analyses prior to releasing an airplane. &lt;br/&gt;These tests on physical prototypes are expensive. An &lt;br/&gt;appealing, cost-effective alternative is to reliably &lt;br/&gt;simulate the complex behavior of turbulence, stress and &lt;br/&gt;strain on computerized geometric models of these aircraft. &lt;br/&gt;Progress towards that goal has been delayed by inaccuracies &lt;br/&gt;introduced in the geometric input to these simulations, &lt;br/&gt;specifically along intersection boundaries, and improvement &lt;br/&gt;of such intersections is the primary focus of this project. &lt;br/&gt;This project will ensure relevance to these contemporary &lt;br/&gt;aeronautical design problems by the participation of&lt;br/&gt;Boeing scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
