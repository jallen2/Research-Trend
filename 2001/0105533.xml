    <AbstractNarration>This research involves two applications of graph algorithms; the first&lt;br/&gt;regards communication in networks, the second involves solving flow&lt;br/&gt;problems in structured networks. The investigators study algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for finding paths connecting many communicating parties in a network.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is that the paths do not overutilize any particular link in&lt;br/&gt;the network. The second item the investigators will study is&lt;br/&gt;the famous problem of routing the maximum amount of flow through&lt;br/&gt;a network. This problem is itself interesting and has numerous&lt;br/&gt;applications in fields as diverse as transportation and computer vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the investigaters study low congestion routing in&lt;br/&gt;networks. This problem is easy in a relaxed fractional setting but&lt;br/&gt;notoriously difficult in an integral setting. Recent work has&lt;br/&gt;established relationships between a cut based upper bound and the&lt;br/&gt;fractional lower bound on this problem. These results will lead to&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of the integral version of this problem.&lt;br/&gt;Research on this problem has made use of techniques from linear&lt;br/&gt;programming, randomized rounding, combinatorial graph theory, as well&lt;br/&gt;as geometric embeddings of graph metrics. For the maximum flow&lt;br/&gt;problem, the investigaters study ideas in a recent maximum flow&lt;br/&gt;algorithm in order to extend them to the minimum cost flow problem.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators also study the maximum flow problems on planar and&lt;br/&gt;other restricted classes of graphs.</AbstractNarration>
