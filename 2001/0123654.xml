    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation of women in all levels of faculty and academic administration, particularly at the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional practices, policies, climate and culture. The Unviersity of Puerto Rico, Hamacao proposes to implement a five year program to increase the participation and advancement of women in the natural and social sciences. The University of Puerto Rico (UPR), Humacao Campus is an undergraduate institution with approximately 4,300 students; 99% of Puerto Rican origin and 65% women. For years UPR has had one of the highest rates of recruitment and graduation of undergraduate women in science, mathematics, and engineering in the United States. At the Humacao campus, 68% of the students in the Biology and Chemistry programs and 50% in Mathematics are women. In Physics, the only program with a minority of women the number has increased to 26% after the efforts of the last 7 years. Although the number of women in science is high compared to universities in the US mainland, women are still underrepresented in the faculty and do not advance to the highest academic ranks at the same rate of male faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project includes the following activities: &lt;br/&gt;Investigate the causes and consequences of the participation of women in science in the UPR-Humacao to develop strategies that can be used in UPR and elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;Identify problems that inhibit the advancement of women faculty and determine how they might differ between universities in Puerto Rico and other US universities. &lt;br/&gt;Set-up a coordinated campus effort to revise procedures, and to define and implement policies and practices for the recruitment, retention and advancement of faculty to increase the participation and advancement of women faculty.&lt;br/&gt;Set-up training for new faculty on career transitions, including on gender related issues and how to advance in academic positions..&lt;br/&gt;Set-up training for administrators on approaches to improving gender equality and diversity.&lt;br/&gt;Increase the recruitment of women in Physics and Electronics and Computational&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics by providing scholarships for graduate studies (with funds from UPR-H) to talented students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPR-H will carry out an assessment and evaluation program on the proposed activities throughout the project to develop short and longterm interventions, and to measure the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The program will serve as a model for other Hispanic universities, both in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the US. This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
