    <AbstractNarration>Foundation Science is a comprehensive, articulated curriculum for grades six through ten in which conceptual understandings are built and deepened from year to year. The curriculum in grades six through eight consists of four modules in each of the three major science disciplines. The sequence of modules in each discipline develops concepts in progressively deeper and more complex ways so that modules can be taught by discipline or in an interdisciplinary manner. The ninth and tenth grade modules are developed in Phase One&lt;br/&gt;along with the conceptual framework for the entire curriculum. These modules serve as a prototype for all the modules; they address learning goals and formative and summative assessment strategies that inform instruction and measure students' achievement for the learning goals. Each module consists of a student book and teachers guide. Educational technology is used for instruction and learning, accessing and sharing information as well as for assessment, professional development and community outreach. Professional development enhances the teachers' content knowledge, supports the hands-on, inquiry approach and prepares teachers for using the variety of assessments. Also included are materials to inform the community about the approach of the materials and also to gain administrative support for their implementation. The evaluation includes information about student learning of the learning goals.</AbstractNarration>
