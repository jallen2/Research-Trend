    <AbstractNarration>0110532&lt;br/&gt;Wikramanayake&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depletion of nuclear beta-catenin in early sea urchin embryos affects the&lt;br/&gt;fates of multiple cell lineages along the animal-vegetal (A/V) axis. It is&lt;br/&gt;known that the micromeres, which form the early signaling center that&lt;br/&gt;specifies mesendoderm, require nuclear beta-catenin to become competent to&lt;br/&gt;carry out their inductive functions. Beta-catenin signaling is also&lt;br/&gt;required in the veg2 lineage for these cells to respond to micromere&lt;br/&gt;signals and to become specified as mesendoderm. Identifying&lt;br/&gt;transcriptional targets of beta-catenin and elucidating their functions&lt;br/&gt;would be a critical step in defining the molecular basis of mesendoderm&lt;br/&gt;specification. This proposal will focus on SUWnt8, a nuclear&lt;br/&gt;beta-catenin-sensitive Wnt gene that is activated in the micromeres&lt;br/&gt;coincident with the entry of beta-catenin into the nuclei of these cells&lt;br/&gt;and in the veg2 tier shortly after transit of beta-catenin into the nuclei&lt;br/&gt;of this cell tier. Four proposed specific aims will define the function of&lt;br/&gt;SUWnt8 in these cell lineages and will further the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;mesendoderm specification in the sea urchin embryo. These aims are: (1) To&lt;br/&gt;determine the role of cell interactions in regulating early SUWnt8&lt;br/&gt;expression in the mesendoderm domain. This will provide insight into the&lt;br/&gt;relative roles of cell autonomous and non cell-autonomous mechanisms in&lt;br/&gt;early mesendoderm specification. (2) To determine how SUWnt8 participates&lt;br/&gt;in early mesendoderm specification by elucidating its role in the&lt;br/&gt;micromeres and the veg2 tier by blocking its activity using morpholino&lt;br/&gt;antisense oligonucleotide-mediated translational inhibition. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;a possible role for SUWnt8 in maintaining nuclear beta-catenin levels in&lt;br/&gt;vegetal cells and in suppressing the activity of animalizing transcription&lt;br/&gt;factors in vegetal cells will be determined. (3) While nuclear&lt;br/&gt;beta-catenin is required for normal mesendoderm specification, there is&lt;br/&gt;evidence that micromeres can induce mesendoderm in animal half blastomeres&lt;br/&gt;in the absence of detectable nuclear beta-catenin. It will be determined&lt;br/&gt;if SUWnt8 can signal through the planar cell polarity pathway via the&lt;br/&gt;Disheveled protein to participate in mesendoderm specification in parallel&lt;br/&gt;with the beta-catenin pathway. (4) The unique expression pattern of SUWnt8&lt;br/&gt;makes it a powerful reagent for studying the transcriptional basis of&lt;br/&gt;mesendoderm specification. The trans-acting factors that mediate SUWnt8&lt;br/&gt;expression in the micromeres and the veg2 tier will be identified.&lt;br/&gt;Together, these studies will further our understanding of how the sea&lt;br/&gt;urchin A/V axis is specified and patterned and may provide insight into&lt;br/&gt;the evolution of the A/V axis in bilaterians.</AbstractNarration>
