    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Drs. Theriot and Jansen at the University of Texas at Austin to train scientists in the identification and ecology of microorganisms known as diatoms. Diatoms are single-celled organisms that can dominate the microscopical life in lakes, oceans, and rivers. They are of interest to basic science because they are diverse (thousands of species), are easily manipulated in cell cultures for experiments, and have many unusual cell properties (e.g., their cell wall is literally made out of glass!). The latter fact also makes them abundant in the fossil record, which makes them important more practical uses such as the study of natural cycles of climate change, the impact of human activities on lake ecology, and the discovery of oil. The practical uses of diatoms have drawn so much attention to diatom studies, in fact, that few people are actually devoted to basic diatom studies. On the other hand, new technologies have attracted many students to fields such as molecular biology and away from traditional fields of study. This is the problem addressed by this project and is highlighted by the fact that Dr. Theriot is the only person in North America with a university faculty appointment who also has formal training in the most basic element of diatom studies, their classification. His colleague, Dr. Jansen, is a leader in the field of using DNA and molecular biology to classify higher plants. Their labs have conducted important collaborations essential to the success of this project. This proposal is designed to ensure that there will be a new generation of diatom scientists with a background in both the classical elements of classification and the tools to further our understanding of diatoms in the 21st century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drs. Theriot and Jansen will train, at a minimum, two postdoctoral associates, three graduate students, and two undergraduates in the science of diatom identification and classification (= taxonomy, or systematics). The training program is centered on three studies of the classification, physiology, ecology, geological distribution and molecular biology of different groups of diatoms. The basic research component of each study is centered on reconstructing evolutionary relationships by comparing the DNA (the genetic makeup of the cells), the morphology (shape and form of the cell and its components) with the known fossil record of these species. The evolutionary relationships will then be studied in relationship to environmental conditions in which the diatoms originally evolved and in which they are found today. The students will create computerized catalogues of the Texas Memorial Museum of Science and History diatom collections, as well as computerize all related data including illustrations of the species. This information will be available on the World Wide Web. The students thus will receive the field and laboratory skills necessary to become competent modern biologists capable of independent investigations into further aspects of diatom biology and/or to apply their knowledge of diatom biology to problems of societal and economic importance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All studies, basic and applied, using diatoms require expert identification of diatoms. This project will ensure a new generation of diatom taxonomists with the combination of old and new skills necessary to be successful in the next century. They will be able to compete for academic positions, to train other experts, to be a resource for those needing to know about practical application of knowledge about diatoms, and to contribute directly to the growth of our basic understanding of these important links in the food web and indicators of the health of the natural environment.</AbstractNarration>
