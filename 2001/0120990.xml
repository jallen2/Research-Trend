    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the synthesis of new ternary transition metal pnictide and pnictide oxide phases. It combines exploratory synthesis with systematic structure-property studies. The primary emphasis is on property measurements and characterization of compounds involving alkaline earth or rare earth with transition metals and the group 15 pnictide elements, along with the suboxides of these mixtures. This group utilizes the Zintl concept to direct the synthesis of new magnetic and electronic compounds. The approach provides a good starting place for the discovery of new structures and properties. In order to explore new compounds and to measure properties, fluxes will be used to produce large crystals. In addition novel properties and structure-property relationship of these pnictide and layered pnictide-oxides will be investigated. The primary goal is to train students in solid state synthesis and characterization techniques. Students are involved in all aspects of new discovery and property measurements. Some of the experiments outlined in the proposal make use of national facilities such as the Advance Light Source and the National Center for Electron Microscopy at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. In addition, there is a strong collaboration with chemistry, physics, and materials science groups at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This type of synergism provides the student with a well-rounded education and prepares them for the multidisciplinary science of today's industry. In addition, the education of undergraduates and outreach to the general public in the importance of materials synthesis to our future technological advances is included as a theme of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new materials is an important cornerstone of new technologies. One of the fundamental issues in this development is the synthesis of new materials coupled with property measurements. Combining synthesis with state-of-the-art characterization tools with an aim towards discovering new magnetic, and electronic materials significantly enhances the chances of timely technological impacts.</AbstractNarration>
