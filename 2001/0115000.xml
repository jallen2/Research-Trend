    <AbstractNarration>0115000&lt;br/&gt;Prasad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. Paras N. Prasad, Department of Chemistry and Director of Photonics Research Laboratory, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York and Dr. Raouf El-Mallawany, Department of Physics, Menofia University, Shebin El-Kom, Egypt. The objectives of the research are to develop and study new material based on tellurite glasses for their potential for non-linear applications. The study will include: Preparation of high optical quality of tellurite glasses (in the bulk &amp; fiber form) by using new different rare earth and transition metal oxides in order to get a glass with high refractive index and low dispersion, optical measurements which include the measurements of the refractive index at different wavelengths and the wavelength of IR transmission, thermal &amp; Elastic characterization measurements which include: glass transformation, crystallization temperatures, stability, longitudinal, shear, bulk, Young's moduli, Poisson's ratio and Debye temperature of the produced glasses, and structural determinations like x-ray Diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The project supports collaboration between two well-recognized scientists who have the expertise and resources for this research. The topic is important to the field of amorphous materials, and has applications in the expanding arena of photonics. Understanding of tellurite glasses will have an impact in the development of pressure sensors and optical materials. The international team is quite suited for the project, as the Egyptian scientist has significant expertise in the synthesis of tellurite glasses of different compositions, and the US scientist has vast expertise in material characterization. This project has the potential to greatly benefit both sides by developing new materials that can have wide applications. The project will promote training of Egyptian and US graduate students who will participate in this collaborative work. This project meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.</AbstractNarration>
