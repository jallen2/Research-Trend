    <AbstractNarration>A coupled modeling and empirical approach to the study of the life history and&lt;br/&gt;physiological ecology of cold seep vestimentiferans and communities.&lt;br/&gt;Seep vestimentiferans and their symbionts are primary producers that provide complex&lt;br/&gt;habitat structure in a non-toxic setting for a diverse assortment of seep-endemic and non-endemic&lt;br/&gt;heterotrophic species. As such, they are arguably the most important keystone species&lt;br/&gt;in widespread areas of seepage on the continental slope. Recent work has demonstrated that one&lt;br/&gt;species (at least) of seep vestimentiferan is extremely long-lived and can support its autotrophic&lt;br/&gt;life style with the uptake of dissolved gasses across buried portions of its body. Thus, in many&lt;br/&gt;ways, the seep vestimentiferans are analogous to long-lived, ecosystem-structuring, woody plant&lt;br/&gt;species in a terrestrial environment.&lt;br/&gt;We will develop models to address resource acquisition and allocation, life histories, and&lt;br/&gt;community productivity of cold seep vestimentiferans that will guide and focus field and&lt;br/&gt;laboratory studies of cold seep vestimentiferan communities. We propose to work on the upper&lt;br/&gt;Louisiana Slope of the Gulf of Mexico at a depth range of 540 to 1,000m and will include&lt;br/&gt;communities on both hard substrata and sediment that are exposed to a range of sulfide&lt;br/&gt;concentrations. We will use empirical studies and comparative methods to develop, test the&lt;br/&gt;predictions of, and refine, Dynamic Energy Budget models, while at the same time addressing&lt;br/&gt;specific hypotheses concerning vestimentiferan aggregation physiology and ecology.&lt;br/&gt;Our in situ work will be guided by these mathematical models and interfaced with very&lt;br/&gt;efficient and quantitative collection methods that will maximize the information gleaned from&lt;br/&gt;each collection and provide material for future studies, thereby minimizing our short and long-term&lt;br/&gt;impact on the communities. Growth rates of thousands of individuals will be measured and&lt;br/&gt;these data used to estimate the longevity and to calculate the resources allocated to growth by&lt;br/&gt;each vestimentiferan species. We will determine whether "roots" (posterior extensions that can&lt;br/&gt;be used to mine sulfide from within sediments) are a general feature of seep vestimentiferans and&lt;br/&gt;whether they are environmentally induced. The models will be used to explore the relative&lt;br/&gt;importance of root sulfide uptake to the sustenance of aggregations in different situations and the&lt;br/&gt;implications of vestimentiferan sulfide demand on biogeochemical models of sulfide production.&lt;br/&gt;To facilitate this, environmental concentrations of sulfide and diffusion distances across root&lt;br/&gt;tubes and tissues will be measured, and concentrations and sulfide binding properties of the&lt;br/&gt;hemoglobins in the different species will be determined. The biomass, size frequency,&lt;br/&gt;distribution, and reproductive state of the vestimentiferans will be determined for intact&lt;br/&gt;aggregations and collections processed so that the species richness and biomass of all associated&lt;br/&gt;fauna in each collection can also be determined. This will allow us to formulate life history&lt;br/&gt;models, to scale up the models of individuals to the levels of aggregations, and to model excess&lt;br/&gt;production and its use by associated fauna.&lt;br/&gt;Fisher has extensive experience with the Gulf of Mexico seep communities and has visited&lt;br/&gt;the sites. Shea is a theoretical ecologist with experience in life-history modeling of terrestrial&lt;br/&gt;and aquatic autotrophic systems. The proposed approach will significantly increase our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these widespread and productive deep-sea communities and their impact on the&lt;br/&gt;surrounding deep sea, and will provide a modeling framework to focus related and future&lt;br/&gt;investigations. The proposed studies will yield basic insights on the ecology, physiology and&lt;br/&gt;reproductive biology of deep-sea systems in general and chemoautotrophic systems in particular.&lt;br/&gt;They will also provide new theory, and tests for existing theory on the evolution of life history&lt;br/&gt;strategies.</AbstractNarration>
