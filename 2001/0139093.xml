    <AbstractNarration>The overall objectives of this work are to develop a thorough &lt;br/&gt;understanding of three-dimensional water waves of finite amplitude, and &lt;br/&gt;ultimately to develop a practical model to describe these waves efficiently. &lt;br/&gt;A model that is both accurate and computationally efficient could have &lt;br/&gt;many practical applications. Specific problems to be addressed are: (1) the &lt;br/&gt;existence and stability of three-dimensional, doubly-periodic, traveling &lt;br/&gt;water-wave patterns, through the full range of depths; (2) the prevalence &lt;br/&gt;of hexagonal, rectangular or crescent-shaped waves (or other multiply &lt;br/&gt;periodic wave patterns) among ocean waves; (3) the long-wave and &lt;br/&gt;modulational descriptions of water waves, and the subsequent stability &lt;br/&gt;analyses that are feasible in these cases; (4) the design and implementation &lt;br/&gt;of algorithms to make practical use of exact solutions of asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;models in shallow and deep water; (5) the relation between the detailed &lt;br/&gt;dynamics of three-dimensional, nonlinear waves and some commonly &lt;br/&gt;used ocean-wave transport models; and (6) the impact of a detailed local &lt;br/&gt;description of nonlinear wave dynamics on these transport models, in the &lt;br/&gt;presence of large amplitude nonlinear waves or under conditions of &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear wave focusing. These problems will be studied using analysis, &lt;br/&gt;computation, asymptotics, and algebraic geometry, involving the full &lt;br/&gt;equations and approximate models, all in conjunction with state-of-the-art &lt;br/&gt;physical experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The destructive force of large-amplitude ocean waves is well known. &lt;br/&gt;Large-scale ocean waves have a major impact on the design of ocean-&lt;br/&gt;going ships, of off-shore oil platforms, and of other structures in a coastal &lt;br/&gt;environment. These waves also impact the scheduling and routing of &lt;br/&gt;shipping patterns, and they strongly affect air-sea transport processes. Yet &lt;br/&gt;most theoretical models of ocean waves now in use are based on waves of &lt;br/&gt;small amplitude. In this investigation we focus on developing a thorough &lt;br/&gt;understanding of large-amplitude waves. The ultimate goal is to develop a &lt;br/&gt;practical, mathematical model that may be used operationally in the &lt;br/&gt;applications listed above. In particular, the investigators plan to build on &lt;br/&gt;their recent work in which they have observed certain coherent patterns of &lt;br/&gt;large-amplitude waves. They have observed these patterns in laboratory &lt;br/&gt;experiments, as solutions to the well-known equations of water waves, and &lt;br/&gt;as solutions to other equations that are (more) approximate models of &lt;br/&gt;water waves. Their work involves a variety of mathematical and &lt;br/&gt;computational tools as well as state-of-the-art laboratory experiments. In &lt;br/&gt;the present work the investigators will combine all of their tools to &lt;br/&gt;understand and describe these coherent patterns and to use them as the &lt;br/&gt;building blocks for a practical model of ocean waves.</AbstractNarration>
