    <AbstractNarration>Power electronics technology is widely used in various industrial sectors and has recently been&lt;br/&gt;identified by the Office of Science and Technology Policy as critical for the future growth of the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;economy. Today innovations in electronic products are progressing at an unprecedented rapid pace.&lt;br/&gt;However, power electronics technology has not kept pace with the growth in low and medium power&lt;br/&gt;electronic industries. With this proposal, the PIs seek to improve the power supply performance by&lt;br/&gt;exploring new design techniques to develop a family of efficient, high-frequency, low and medium&lt;br/&gt;power AC-DC converters with reduced cost and improved reliability, and still achieve near unity&lt;br/&gt;power factor. This effort targets future stringent power requirements for high-speed microprocessor&lt;br/&gt;used in next generation computer and communication systems.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to develop novel hybrid energy transfer AC-DC converters&lt;br/&gt;improved efficiency and increased reliability and provides Power Factor Correction (PFC). In a&lt;br/&gt;traditional single-stage AC/DC-PFC scheme, the converter normally operates in Discontinuous&lt;br/&gt;Conduction Mode (DCM) and has the advantages of simplicity, low cost and high reliability, while&lt;br/&gt;less efficiency due to its inherent high voltage and current stresses. Moreover, it cannot achieve&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously, the desired input performance in terms of low power factor and harmonics, and&lt;br/&gt;output performance in terms of voltage ripple and regulation capabilities. The two-stage scheme can&lt;br/&gt;achieve unity power factor and higher output performance, but at the expense of high component&lt;br/&gt;count and increased system complexity. This in turn increases cost and degrades the reliability of the&lt;br/&gt;whole power electronic system. In both single-stage and two-stage AC/DC converters, the power is&lt;br/&gt;processed twice as all the transferred energy would once store in an intermediate bulk capacitor. Here,&lt;br/&gt;we propose a novel method that allows parallel path of energy transfer to minimize power-processing&lt;br/&gt;times and to improve converter efficiency and reliability. A lion share of the input power directly&lt;br/&gt;transferred to the output without going through the input current shaping stage while the converter&lt;br/&gt;remains a near-unity power factor. Furthermore, considering the operation irrelevance of PFC stage&lt;br/&gt;and DC-DC stage in two cascade stage converters, the PIs also propose a novel concept to improve&lt;br/&gt;the efficiency by linking PFC stage with DC-DC stage to provide soft-switching conditions for the&lt;br/&gt;PFC stage or DC/DC stage without adding any auxiliary switch.&lt;br/&gt;During the projects two-year period, the following major tasks will be carried out:&lt;br/&gt;1) Investigate the limitations of improving efficiency in existing PFC- AC/DC converters.&lt;br/&gt;2) Aiming at reducing the power losses and processing time, analyze the power flow features,&lt;br/&gt;and build the potential path to forward partial input power to the output side directly to&lt;br/&gt;minimize the power processing times.&lt;br/&gt;3) Compare existing practical soft-switching DC/DC topologies; develop the suitable magnetic&lt;br/&gt;coupling paths between the PFC stage and DC/DC stage to benefit each other, such as&lt;br/&gt;providing soft-switching condition for PFC stage or/and DC/DC stage.&lt;br/&gt;4) Investigate integrated system issues and possible solutions, focusing on interaction between&lt;br/&gt;different stages and control schemes.&lt;br/&gt;5) Set-up simulation platform and physical test bed, conduct comparative study for overall&lt;br/&gt;performance between the proposed topology and existing AC/DC converters.</AbstractNarration>
