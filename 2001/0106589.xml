    <AbstractNarration>1. The proposed project covers several topics in Probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics. The first group of questions is about graph colorings.&lt;br/&gt;It mainly deals with the study of chromatic and choice numbers of&lt;br/&gt;graphs satisfying certain local conditions. One of the open problem&lt;br/&gt;which investigators will study is bounding the chromatic number of a&lt;br/&gt;graph G with maximum degree d, which contains no copy of a fixed graph&lt;br/&gt;H. A variant of this problem was posed already twenty years ago by&lt;br/&gt;Komlos and Szemeredi and so far it was solved only for some special&lt;br/&gt;cases. Investigator also plans to work on a few related questions&lt;br/&gt;about vertex list coloring and acyclic edge coloring of graphs.&lt;br/&gt;Another set of questions is about asymptotic properties of random graphs&lt;br/&gt;and random regular graphs. Here investigators goal is to understand&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of independent sets of nearly optimal size in sparse&lt;br/&gt;random graphs, and use this to determine the asymptotic behavior of&lt;br/&gt;its choice number. It is sometimes the case that an existence proof,&lt;br/&gt;supplied by the probabilistic method, is not sufficient and it is&lt;br/&gt;better to have an explicit construction. One of the major open&lt;br/&gt;problems in this field is to construct exponentially large graphs,&lt;br/&gt;without a clique or an independent set of size k. In this project&lt;br/&gt;investigator intends to consider this problem together with its&lt;br/&gt;bipartite version. He also plans to study the properties of&lt;br/&gt;pseudo-random graphs and their applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Leave nothing to chance. This cliche embodies the common belief&lt;br/&gt;that randomness has no place in carefully planned methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;In modern Combinatorics at least, nothing can be further from the&lt;br/&gt;truth. Here the Probabilistic Method has been developed intensively&lt;br/&gt;and become one of the most powerful and widely used tools.&lt;br/&gt;Use of probability proved to be helpful in tackling many long&lt;br/&gt;standing open problems. Another major reason for the development of&lt;br/&gt;this method is the important role of randomness in Theoretical&lt;br/&gt;Computer Science. Here algorithm which make random choices during its&lt;br/&gt;execution proved to be simplest and fastest for many applications.</AbstractNarration>
