    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0103511&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Francis Bonahon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Project proposes to study several geometric problems in&lt;br/&gt;dimension 2 and 3. A common theme is that these problems all&lt;br/&gt;involve hyperbolic geometry, either as a tool to understand wider&lt;br/&gt;range problems or as a topic of interest in itself. The first&lt;br/&gt;half of the proposal is a natural extension of the research&lt;br/&gt;developed by the Principal Investigator in the past few years. On&lt;br/&gt;the purely hyperbolic side, it proposes to study convex cores of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic structures on 3-dimensional manifolds, and to further&lt;br/&gt;develop an approach to hyperbolic structures on surfaces which is&lt;br/&gt;based on the technique of geodesic currents. On the more&lt;br/&gt;topological side, it proposes to take advantage of methods of&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic geometry to analyze simple closed curves on&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. In particular, one of the objectives of the proposal is&lt;br/&gt;to determine the fractal dimension of the space of simple closed&lt;br/&gt;curves on a surface. The second part of the proposal is based on&lt;br/&gt;exciting new conjectures which would connect two aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;theory of knotted curves in 3--dimensional space which so far&lt;br/&gt;have had very little interaction, namely topological quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theory and hyperbolic geometry on knot complements. The&lt;br/&gt;project proposes to attack these conjectures and, if these are&lt;br/&gt;proved, to further develop the connections so established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on the interplay between&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic geometry and topology. In low-dimensional topology,&lt;br/&gt;one tries to analyze the possible shapes for spaces of dimensions&lt;br/&gt;2 and 3. In particular, it includes as a subfield knot theory,&lt;br/&gt;where the goal is to understand all possible ways in which a&lt;br/&gt;string can be knotted in space; techniques of knot theory have&lt;br/&gt;successfully been applied to analyze the recombination of DNA and&lt;br/&gt;the knotting of complex molecular structures. Hyperbolic geometry&lt;br/&gt;is apparently very different. It is a non-euclidean geometry&lt;br/&gt;which was introduced in the early nineteenth century, in order to&lt;br/&gt;test the internal consistency of the axioms of the classical&lt;br/&gt;geometry developed by Euclid and other Greek mathematicians. An&lt;br/&gt;unexpected connection was established in the nineteen seventies,&lt;br/&gt;through ground breaking work of Bill Thurston who showed that&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic geometry could be successfully used to solve problems&lt;br/&gt;in topology. For instance, there is a number associated to each&lt;br/&gt;knotted curve, called its "hyperbolic volume" and which can be&lt;br/&gt;computed fairly easily by current software. If two knotted curves&lt;br/&gt;have different hyperbolic volumes, one is guaranteed that it is&lt;br/&gt;impossible to deform one curve to the other. A new picture is now&lt;br/&gt;beginning to emerge, where the hyperbolic volume of a knotted&lt;br/&gt;curve unexpectedly occurs in techniques of mathematical physics&lt;br/&gt;originally designed to predict the behavior of high energy&lt;br/&gt;particles. The main part of the proposal is aimed at clarifying&lt;br/&gt;this picture, with the expectation that the cross-fertilization&lt;br/&gt;between topology, hyperbolic geometry and mathematical physics&lt;br/&gt;will lead to advances in each of these three fields.</AbstractNarration>
