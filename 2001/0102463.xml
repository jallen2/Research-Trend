    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0102463&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Darryl McCullough&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work advances a number of research projects in the&lt;br/&gt;area of low-dimensional topology. Their unifying theme is the&lt;br/&gt;automorphisms of 3-dimensional manifolds, including homotopy&lt;br/&gt;equivalences, diffeomorphisms, and isometries. Specific projects&lt;br/&gt;include: the Generalized Smale Conjecture for elliptic&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds, the isomorphism problem for diffeomorphism groups of&lt;br/&gt;elliptic 3-manifolds, generalization of the Abikoff-Maskit&lt;br/&gt;structure theory for Kleinian groups using topological methods,&lt;br/&gt;investigation of free actions of finite groups on orientable&lt;br/&gt;handlebodies using Nielsen equivalence classes of generating&lt;br/&gt;sets, and fibration theorems for spaces of fiber-preserving&lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphisms of manifolds having fiberings and singular&lt;br/&gt;fiberings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary mathematical constructs that will be investigated are&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds, which are geometric objects locally modeled on the&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional spatial structure of the physical universe, and&lt;br/&gt;groups, which are algebraic systems with an operation akin to the&lt;br/&gt;addition of ordinary numbers. Some of the ongoing work has&lt;br/&gt;already been applied in the theoretical physics of gravitation,&lt;br/&gt;but most of its applications are entirely within pure&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. The guiding philosophy of most of the research is to&lt;br/&gt;use topological and geometric structure of 3-manifolds to&lt;br/&gt;understand groups of symmetries and other kinds of&lt;br/&gt;automorphisms. Groups of automorphisms of a mathematical object&lt;br/&gt;often exhibit their own interesting structure. A classic example&lt;br/&gt;of this is the finite-dimensional vector spaces. They are rather&lt;br/&gt;simple objects, but their automorphism groups, the general linear&lt;br/&gt;groups, have a rich structure and find wide-ranging uses in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics. Within the proposed work, an example is&lt;br/&gt;the 3-manifolds called handlebodies. These are among the simplest&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds to describe topologically, but their groups of&lt;br/&gt;symmetries are subtle and varied. In fact, any finite group can&lt;br/&gt;be a group of symmetries of some handlebody, and the number of&lt;br/&gt;distinct ways that a group can act as symmetries on a given&lt;br/&gt;handlebody can be quite large. A different use of the philosophy&lt;br/&gt;involves Kleinian groups, which are discrete groups of symmetries&lt;br/&gt;of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. Each Kleinian group produces a&lt;br/&gt;quotient 3-manifold, and one of the projects uses the topological&lt;br/&gt;structure of these quotient 3-manifolds to give an algebraic&lt;br/&gt;classification of Kleinian groups.</AbstractNarration>
