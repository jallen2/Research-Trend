    <AbstractNarration>The University of the District of Columbia plans to establish a Science, &lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (SMET) Research and Training Center&lt;br/&gt;to develop and implement strategies to teach and retain students in SMET &lt;br/&gt;courses. Specific objectives for organizing the Center are to: 1. Modify the&lt;br/&gt;content of entry level (gate-keeper) science, mathematics and engineering courses&lt;br/&gt;for undergraduate students to enable them to improve their performance and &lt;br/&gt;retention rates in these programs, to improve performances on graduate and &lt;br/&gt;professional school standardized tests,and increase their competitiveness for&lt;br/&gt;employment opportunities; 2. Develop procedures that will be used to improve&lt;br/&gt;science, mathematics, engineering, and technology capabilities of faculty and&lt;br/&gt;students by identifying and planning activities such as seminars, symposia,&lt;br/&gt;and workshops to expose them to current trends in the various disciplines; and &lt;br/&gt;3. Obtain information on the current status of teaching and research facilities &lt;br/&gt;in the Biological and Environmental Sciences, Chemistry and Physics, Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;, and Engineering programs in order that a strategy can be developed to improve&lt;br/&gt;laboratory infrastructure which includes obtaining equipment and adequate space &lt;br/&gt;that will enhance faculty and undergraduate student research. The SMET Center is &lt;br/&gt;designed to improve the academic performance and increase student retention. &lt;br/&gt;Entry level (gate-keeper) science, mathematics and engineering courses in the&lt;br/&gt;SMET curricula will be revised to add a research component to the laboratory&lt;br/&gt;courses in order to emphasize reasoning skills and stimulate logical thinking. &lt;br/&gt;This activity is designed to develop a long-term dynamic curricula that can adapt &lt;br/&gt;to changing technologies. One hundred freshman students will be randomly selected&lt;br/&gt;to participate in the center. Fifty students will have declared majors in one of the&lt;br/&gt;SMET disciplines and 50 will be undeclared majors. The participants will be followed&lt;br/&gt;through graduation to determine the impact of the SMET Center activities on course&lt;br/&gt;attendance and completion rates, passing rates, research activities, grade point &lt;br/&gt;averages, graduation rates, enrollment in graduate and professional schools and&lt;br/&gt;employment. The Center administrators will consist of the principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;, two co-principal investigators and an administrative assistant. The administrators&lt;br/&gt;will plan and implement Center activities with the advice and support of the advisory &lt;br/&gt;committee. The principal investigator will have the primary responsibility of &lt;br/&gt;supervising all aspects of the program with the co-principal investigators assuming &lt;br/&gt;the day-to-day operations of the Center, such as, organizing, conducting and, &lt;br/&gt;implementing the activities. An advisory committee consisting of scientists and&lt;br/&gt;administrators (7), as well as, two consultants will complete the administrative&lt;br/&gt;core. All faculty in the SMET disciplines will be invited to participate in the center.&lt;br/&gt;They will participate in enrichment activities (research, workshops etc.), &lt;br/&gt;implemented by the Center. These activities are expected to produce energetic&lt;br/&gt;faculty, committed to teaching and research. They will utilize improved teaching&lt;br/&gt;techniques and computer technology to make courses interesting and stimulating. &lt;br/&gt;The status and availability of research and teaching facilities in the SMET disciplines&lt;br/&gt;at UDC will be assessed by consultants. The consultants (2), selected from UDC faculty,&lt;br/&gt;will inventory current equipment and available space in the University for teaching&lt;br/&gt;and research. Additionally, the consultants will provide information concerning &lt;br/&gt;available research facilities in government, industry, and research-intensive &lt;br/&gt;universities in Washington.</AbstractNarration>
