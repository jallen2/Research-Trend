    <AbstractNarration>A big theme in number theory in the last 50 years has been the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between automorphic forms, Galois representations and objects from algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. There is an extensive web of extraordinary conjectures (for instance&lt;br/&gt;the Artin conjecture, the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Langlands' conjectures,&lt;br/&gt;Serre's conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture) linking these three&lt;br/&gt;seemingly very different subjects (which relate to analysis, algebra and&lt;br/&gt;geometry respectively). Progress on these conjectures is currently very&lt;br/&gt;exciting. Under his previous NSF grant the PI proved (with Michael Harris) the&lt;br/&gt;local Langlands conjecture for GL(n) of a p-adic field; completed (with&lt;br/&gt;Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad and Fred Diamond) the proof of the &lt;br/&gt;Shimura-Taniyama conjecture; found (with Kevin Buzzard, Mark Dickinson and&lt;br/&gt;Nick Shepherd-Barron) the first infinite families of non-soluble irreducible&lt;br/&gt;Artin representations for which one could prove the Artin conjecture; and&lt;br/&gt;established the meromorphic continuation and functional equation of the&lt;br/&gt;L-functions of all abelian varieties ``of GL(2)-type''. The PI will&lt;br/&gt;continue to work on related problems. In particular he will work with Michael&lt;br/&gt;Harris to generalise the work of Wiles and of Wiles and the PI from GL(2) to&lt;br/&gt;GL(n). There seems to be just one significant problem remaining in the way of&lt;br/&gt;a really useful result. If this problem can be overcome the PI will work with&lt;br/&gt;Michael Harris and Nick Shepherd-Barron on applications to the arithmetic of&lt;br/&gt;elliptic curves. The PI will also look for generalisations of his work with&lt;br/&gt;Michael Harris on the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n) to other&lt;br/&gt;reductive groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This circle of ideas is the one that led to Andrew Wiles' celebrated proof of&lt;br/&gt;Fermat's last theorem after over 300 years. They fall into the general area of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved&lt;br/&gt;extraordinarily fruitful. Among its many consequences are new error correcting&lt;br/&gt;codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and&lt;br/&gt;compact disks.</AbstractNarration>
