    <AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Ben Nelson, Mr. Christian Wells will collect data &lt;br/&gt;for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue ongoing archaeological research &lt;br/&gt;at the prehispanic site of El Coyote, located in the Cacaulapa Valley of &lt;br/&gt;northwestern Honduras. This research will investigate the relationship between &lt;br/&gt;community feasting and the political organization of the polity that formed and &lt;br/&gt;collapsed between the seventh and tenth centuries AD. Archaeologists wish to &lt;br/&gt;understand the processes that integrate and differentiate individuals in &lt;br/&gt;ancient communities, with the greater goal of reconstructing past systems of &lt;br/&gt;government and their effects on the growth and change of societies. Mr. Wells' &lt;br/&gt;previous excavations in the main civic-ceremonial plaza at the site have &lt;br/&gt;revealed abundant evidence for food production and consumption on a large &lt;br/&gt;scale, suggesting that communal feasts were a central practice in the rulership &lt;br/&gt;of El Coyote. Such events would have served as a mechanism for polity &lt;br/&gt;integration, as well as a context in which exotic items were publicly displayed &lt;br/&gt;to enhance the social prestige and political authority of local leaders. With &lt;br/&gt;NSF support, Mr. Wells' doctoral dissertation research will examine the &lt;br/&gt;organization of feasting in the plaza, including what material culture was &lt;br/&gt;employed, where food consumption took place in relation to the temples that &lt;br/&gt;delimit the plaza, and which social segments of the polity participated. His &lt;br/&gt;research will incorporate archaeological excavation of the plaza and adjacent &lt;br/&gt;buildings, as well as trash middens that accumulated on the margins of the &lt;br/&gt;plaza. In addition, he will chemically characterize soil samples from the plaza &lt;br/&gt;to study the distribution of phosphorous and heavy metals, which will indicate &lt;br/&gt;the locations of activity areas. His research will also examine the composition &lt;br/&gt;of ceramic vessel remains from the trash areas in order to illuminate the &lt;br/&gt;different social groups that participated in plaza-oriented activities. &lt;br/&gt;Archaeologists are interested in the practice of feasting and the social &lt;br/&gt;relations that are reproduced during feasts. The examination of material &lt;br/&gt;culture and soil chemistry at El Coyote is a direct method for the study of &lt;br/&gt;this phenomenon, and will yield new information on the organization of feasting &lt;br/&gt;in ancient complex societies and the degree to which this practice was involved &lt;br/&gt;in the political and economic administration of El Coyote. In addition, the &lt;br/&gt;research will enhance our knowledge of the material signatures of feasting in &lt;br/&gt;the archaeological record and will assist in training a promising young &lt;br/&gt;scientist.</AbstractNarration>
