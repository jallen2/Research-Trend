    <AbstractNarration>Novel extreme composite materials due to constituents of negative stiffness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R. S. Lakes, R. W. Carpick, R. F. Cooper*, W. J. Drugan&lt;br/&gt;Department of Engineering Physics and *Department of Materials Science&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;Madison, WI 53706&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research is directed toward the attainment of extreme&lt;br/&gt;material properties by relaxing some of the assumptions commonly held about&lt;br/&gt;constituent behavior in a composite material. A composite material&lt;br/&gt;combines two or more constituent phases of different material properties to&lt;br/&gt;achieve a new material with enhanced mechanical/transport properties.&lt;br/&gt;Effective mechanical properties of composites are determined primarily by&lt;br/&gt;the properties of the materials being combined, the interface behavior, and&lt;br/&gt;the spatial arrangement of the phases in the composite. Traditionally, the&lt;br/&gt;design variables associated with composites include (i) the choice of&lt;br/&gt;constituent materials, (ii) the volume fraction of the constituents, and&lt;br/&gt;(iii) the geometry of the phases.&lt;br/&gt; Recently, one of the writers (Lakes) and co-workers showed that&lt;br/&gt;several classes of composites can exhibit extreme behavior if one&lt;br/&gt;constituent has negative stiffness. An analysis of the possibilities in&lt;br/&gt;viscoelastic composite systems was reported in Physical Review Letters.&lt;br/&gt;Peak damping and large stiffness anomalies are possible even with a dilute&lt;br/&gt;concentration of inclusions, provided matrix damping is small. An&lt;br/&gt;experimental illustration of the behavior of a lumped unit cell was&lt;br/&gt;reported in Philosophical Magazine Letters. It disclosed singular&lt;br/&gt;mechanical damping tan(delta) [where tan(delta) is the tangent of the phase&lt;br/&gt;angle between stress and strain] in a system containing post-buckled tubes.&lt;br/&gt;A further experimental illustration of extreme behavior in a particulate&lt;br/&gt;composite was reported in Nature. Composites prepared with a dilute&lt;br/&gt;concentration of ferroelastic inclusions exhibited large peaks in&lt;br/&gt;tan(delta). The inclusions are more effective than diamond in increasing&lt;br/&gt;the composite stiffness at selected temperatures. These results point to&lt;br/&gt;the possibility of achieving extreme behavior in designed composites, and&lt;br/&gt;exceeding conventional bounds based on the assumption of positive&lt;br/&gt;constituent stiffness.&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this research is to explore the effects of constituents&lt;br/&gt;of negative stiffness in composite materials. We hypothesize on the basis&lt;br/&gt;of some initial theoretical analyses and experiments that if one phase has&lt;br/&gt;negative stiffness, the overall stiffness of the composite can be made&lt;br/&gt;large. Moreover, we hypothesize that extreme mechanical damping effects can&lt;br/&gt;occur if one phase has negative stiffness.&lt;br/&gt; Multiple methods of achieving inclusion negative stiffness are to&lt;br/&gt;be examined. Also, the question of stability of materials and composites&lt;br/&gt;is to be examined in new theoretical developments. For a composite with&lt;br/&gt;extremely high stiffness to be useful, it must be stable.&lt;br/&gt; Composites with inclusions of negative stiffness are of scientific&lt;br/&gt;interest in that current understanding of heterogeneous media is predicated&lt;br/&gt;on an assumption of each phase to have positive stiffness. Our preliminary&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and experimental results indicate extreme effects in stiffness&lt;br/&gt;and damping when that assumption is relaxed, so we anticipate that the&lt;br/&gt;present work will facilitate the development of new classes of materials&lt;br/&gt;with extreme properties, even materials stiffer than diamond.</AbstractNarration>
