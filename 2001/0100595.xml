    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research is designed to advance the recent progress on nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian PDE towards three goals:&lt;br/&gt;1. Extend the local-in-time initial value methods to solve more complicated &lt;br/&gt;PDE.&lt;br/&gt;2. Adapt the initial value techniques to treat initial-boundary value &lt;br/&gt;problems. &lt;br/&gt;3. Construct a global-in-time theory of nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal identifies specific problems whose solutions contribute &lt;br/&gt;to the three goals for which there are &lt;br/&gt;methods of attack emerging from the last decades' spectacular progress.&lt;br/&gt;The studies for Goal 1 aim to extend the sharp 1-dimensional calculus &lt;br/&gt;techniques for proving multilinear estimates in Bourgain's Xs,b spaces &lt;br/&gt;by carrying out an incremental research plan, involving&lt;br/&gt;small Xs,b denominators, spatial anisotropy and vanishing parameters.&lt;br/&gt;A technique for recasting initial-boundary value problems as initial&lt;br/&gt;value problems with boundary forcing has recently been developed, in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with Kenig. The range of applicability of this method is&lt;br/&gt;the main topic of the proposed investigations toward Goal 2. A &lt;br/&gt;reinterpretation of the L^2 conservation law for the KdV equation, obtained &lt;br/&gt;in collaboration with Keel, Staffilani, Takaoka and Tao, has led to a new &lt;br/&gt;method for showing global wellposedness by constructing almost conserved &lt;br/&gt;quantities using multilinear harmonic analysis and the local wellposedness &lt;br/&gt;machinery. The third thrust of the proposed research will exploit these &lt;br/&gt;quantities to understand the long-time behavior of nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No specific scientific or engineering application motivates the proposed &lt;br/&gt;studies; rather the intention is to contribute toward a general rigorous &lt;br/&gt;theory of nonlinear phenomena including turbulence, singularity formation, &lt;br/&gt;scattering and recurrence. The widespread applicability of Hamiltonian PDE, &lt;br/&gt;across diverse fields of current scientific and technological significance, &lt;br/&gt;demonstrates the central prominence of the proposed research to our &lt;br/&gt;science and engineering infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is designed to advance the recent progress on nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian PDE towards three goals:&lt;br/&gt;1.
