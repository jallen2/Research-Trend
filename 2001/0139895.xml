    <AbstractNarration>This Focused Research Group project includes investigators&lt;br/&gt;from three different universities: Luca Dieci at Georgia&lt;br/&gt;Institute of Technology, Michal Jolly at Indiana University, and&lt;br/&gt;Erik Van Vleck at the University of Kansas. The project&lt;br/&gt;considers the approximation of Lyapunov exponents and other&lt;br/&gt;spectral information for dynamical systems. The main goal is to&lt;br/&gt;study and implement numerical techniques to approximate Lyapunov&lt;br/&gt;exponents of continuous dynamical systems, as defined by a system&lt;br/&gt;of time dependent differential equations. The investigators are&lt;br/&gt;implementing and comparing so-called continuous and discrete QR&lt;br/&gt;and SVD approaches. They distinguish between linear and nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;problems, the chief difference being that in the linear case no&lt;br/&gt;approximation of solution trajectory is attempted. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators study Lyapunov exponents for systems of large&lt;br/&gt;dimension, such as spatially discretized time dependent PDEs. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, they consider PDEs for which an inertial manifold is&lt;br/&gt;known to exist, and study the relative merits of techniques that&lt;br/&gt;compute the exponents after a prior inertial manifold reduction&lt;br/&gt;versus those that work with the full (spatially discretized) PDE.&lt;br/&gt;Methods that use the Jacobian and Jacobian-free methods are&lt;br/&gt;compared. The investigators also develop general purpose&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and software for approximation of Lyapunov exponents&lt;br/&gt;and aim to include the algorithms within standard software for&lt;br/&gt;differential equations.&lt;br/&gt; In many areas of science and engineering, physical and&lt;br/&gt;biological systems are modeled with differential equations. In a&lt;br/&gt;nutshell, a differential equation is a rule specifying how a&lt;br/&gt;given initial state of the system evolves into future states. In&lt;br/&gt;practice, we are given the differential equation and the initial&lt;br/&gt;state, and need to find the solution (i.e., the evolution of the&lt;br/&gt;initial condition). Realistic models depend on parameters and&lt;br/&gt;the solution of the differential equation will of course depend&lt;br/&gt;on the values of the parameters as well. The ultimate goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to provide scientists with quantitive means of&lt;br/&gt;assessing the dependency of solutions with respect to variations&lt;br/&gt;of the initial state or the parameters in the problem. Lyapunov&lt;br/&gt;exponents, and other related "spectral quantities," do exactly&lt;br/&gt;this. A chief effort of the investigators is the development of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and computational software for approximation of&lt;br/&gt;Lyapunov exponents and other spectra.</AbstractNarration>
