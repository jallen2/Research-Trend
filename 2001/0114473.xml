    <AbstractNarration>Jackson&lt;br/&gt;0114473&lt;br/&gt; The investigator uses mechanical models to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms involved in tumor encapsulation, multiple lobe&lt;br/&gt;formation, and transcapsular spread. Mass and momentum balance&lt;br/&gt;equations are written for the normal cells, neoplastic cells, the&lt;br/&gt;extracellular matrix (ECM) on which they are anchored, and the&lt;br/&gt;interstitial fluid in which they are bathed. This system is&lt;br/&gt;closed by suitable constitutive relations for the mass supply,&lt;br/&gt;the partial stress tensor, and the momentum supply of each&lt;br/&gt;constituent. The former is defined on the basis of&lt;br/&gt;phenomenological observations of tumor cell growth and the latter&lt;br/&gt;is based on the mechanical properties of each phase. The model&lt;br/&gt;equations, consisting of a set nonlinear conservation and&lt;br/&gt;evolution equations, are analyzed using asymptotic analysis,&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation analysis, and perturbation theory in order to&lt;br/&gt;quantify the relative importance of chemical processes (such as&lt;br/&gt;ECM production and degradation) and mechanical properties of the&lt;br/&gt;tissue (such as ECM density and stiffness) in influencing capsule&lt;br/&gt;formation. A further objective is to characterize the&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation that leads to multiple lobe formation. Through&lt;br/&gt;analysis and simulation of the model, the investigator aims to&lt;br/&gt;discover which factors (mechanical and chemical) determine&lt;br/&gt;successful capsule formation and to quantify their influence.&lt;br/&gt; The mechanisms by which a tumor becomes encapsulated as a&lt;br/&gt;continuum of cells or as several lobes of different sizes,&lt;br/&gt;separated by connective tissue, is an interesting, important, and&lt;br/&gt;unsolved phenomenon in tumor biology. In fact, the presence (or&lt;br/&gt;absence) of a dense capsule surrounding a neoplastic mass is a&lt;br/&gt;major determinant of prognosis and the ultimate survival of the&lt;br/&gt;host. Despite the importance of capsule formation, little is&lt;br/&gt;known about the process by which capsules arise. The&lt;br/&gt;incestigator develops a mathematical modeling framework that&lt;br/&gt;describes tumor growth, encapsulation, multiple lobe formation,&lt;br/&gt;and transcapsular spread based on the physical forces and&lt;br/&gt;cellular interactions involved. The specific aims are to use&lt;br/&gt;mechanical models to assist in understanding i) the role tumor&lt;br/&gt;cell, normal cell, and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions in&lt;br/&gt;capsule formation, ii) the effects of tumor induced ECM&lt;br/&gt;production and degradation on the formation of tumor capsules,&lt;br/&gt;iii) the role of tissue properties such as ECM density and&lt;br/&gt;stiffness in slowing or impeding the process of tumor&lt;br/&gt;encapsulation, and iv) the bifurcation that allows a simple&lt;br/&gt;encapsulated continuum of cells to make the transition to a&lt;br/&gt;multi-nodular form. There are implications for clinical diagnosis&lt;br/&gt;as well as for prognosis.</AbstractNarration>
