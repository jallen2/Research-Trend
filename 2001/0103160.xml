    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0103160&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jie Qing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project consists of two related research &lt;br/&gt;topics. The first part is research in conformal geometry. &lt;br/&gt;The second part is a continuation of the research of &lt;br/&gt;formation and structure of singularity developed along &lt;br/&gt;geometric flows. For conformal geometry part it takes surface &lt;br/&gt;theory as the guideline of geometry in higher dimension. The &lt;br/&gt;theory of conformally flat structure, in 4 dimension for &lt;br/&gt;instance, has not been so successful because of the lack of &lt;br/&gt;right analytic tools, in our view point. But it seems that &lt;br/&gt;some replacement of complex analysis by theory of fourth &lt;br/&gt;order PDE is found to be very promising to study conformal &lt;br/&gt;geometry. Therefore the main thread in the part of this &lt;br/&gt;proposed research is to further develop conformal geometry &lt;br/&gt;with those newly developed analytic tools. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;research takes a fundamental and comprehensive approach &lt;br/&gt;to the study of conformal geometry. It will significantly &lt;br/&gt;enhance and develop the conformal geometry. It will also &lt;br/&gt;provide some ways to better understand topology in 3 and 4 &lt;br/&gt;dimension. For the second part of this proposed project we &lt;br/&gt;continue our research in the study of formation and structure &lt;br/&gt;of singularity developed along the heat flow for harmonic &lt;br/&gt;maps from surfaces. It is always very interesting to &lt;br/&gt;understand the behavior of the flow across the finite time &lt;br/&gt;singularity. The better understanding of the finite time &lt;br/&gt;singularity is believed to be very helpful in further &lt;br/&gt;applications of the theory of harmonic maps in topology and &lt;br/&gt;physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of conformal geometry has a very long &lt;br/&gt;history and extensive literature. It is intimately tied with&lt;br/&gt;modern physics as we have seen it in conformal field theory.&lt;br/&gt;Particularly it becomes even more important as the correspondence &lt;br/&gt;between quantum gravity and conformal field theory relatively&lt;br/&gt;well understood in physics demands mathematical foundation, as&lt;br/&gt;well as stimulates development in conformal geometry. Therefore&lt;br/&gt;it is clear that conformal geometry is an exciting frontier of&lt;br/&gt;modern sciences. Singularities naturally develop in many &lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for almost everything in sciences. Singularity,&lt;br/&gt;for instance, develop when some parameters in the physical system &lt;br/&gt;approach certain critical values, like Ginzburg-Landau model in &lt;br/&gt;super-conductivity and super-fluids. To study the singularities in &lt;br/&gt;evolution systems have been the major problems in the theory of &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations with tremendous applications to &lt;br/&gt;many physical and engineering fields. Any essential analytic &lt;br/&gt;progress in this line will greatly attract attention from experts &lt;br/&gt;in all related areas. At last, but not the least, the proposed &lt;br/&gt;project is also generating research activities to the benefit&lt;br/&gt;of the graduate program in the Department of Mathematics at UCSC.</AbstractNarration>
