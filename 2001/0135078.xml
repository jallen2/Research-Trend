    <AbstractNarration>DMS Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award #: 0135078&lt;br/&gt;PI: Venkataramani, Shankar &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Chicago&lt;br/&gt;Program: Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Program Manager: Catherine Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Singularities and Microstructure - Multiple Scale Analysis for Nonlinear PDE, Geometric Problems, and the Physical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There exist a variety of tools for studying multiple scale behaviors&lt;br/&gt;in nonlinear systems, and the method of choice for a particular&lt;br/&gt;problem often depends on whether the investigator is an analyst, an&lt;br/&gt;applied mathematician or a physicist. An important goal is to&lt;br/&gt;effectively merge the various approaches, and develop new ways of&lt;br/&gt;thinking about multi-scale problems. To this end, this project focuses&lt;br/&gt;on investigating five interdisciplinary problems, using ideas from&lt;br/&gt;functional analysis, geometry, topology, matched asymptotics and&lt;br/&gt;scaling arguments, in conjunction with numerical simulations. These&lt;br/&gt;problems are (1) Generalized crumpling: Combining functional analytic&lt;br/&gt;methods with geometric/topological ideas to study singularities and&lt;br/&gt;microstructure; (2) Blowup in Parabolic PDEs: Applying Morse theory to&lt;br/&gt;the dynamics of blowup solutions; (3) Dynamics of microstructure:&lt;br/&gt;Studying global bifurcations involving the change of microstructure in&lt;br/&gt;a model system; (4) Pattern formation and non-equilibrium phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions: Investigating multiple scale behaviors in nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;systems in the presence of noise; and (5) Topological transitions in&lt;br/&gt;fluid interfaces: Using tools from PDE to investigate topological&lt;br/&gt;transitions in 2 fluid systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many real world systems are interesting precisely because they exhibit&lt;br/&gt;different behaviors on different scales. This is certainly true for&lt;br/&gt;living organisms, geological and geophysical systems, technologically&lt;br/&gt;important composite materials and even social structures and&lt;br/&gt;hierarchies. Thus researchers across many disciplines grapple with the&lt;br/&gt;following two questions, which are the essence of multiple scale&lt;br/&gt;analysis: (1) How does the large scale (macroscopic) behavior emerge&lt;br/&gt;out of the collective behavior of the small scale (microscopic)&lt;br/&gt;units?, and (2) What are the rules governing the large scale behavior,&lt;br/&gt;and how does this influence the behavior of the small scale units? The&lt;br/&gt;research component of this project studies these questions in a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical setting through problems that arise in material science&lt;br/&gt;and in physics. The overall goal is to meld together a variety of&lt;br/&gt;techniques to develop tools that can successfully handle complex&lt;br/&gt;real-world multiple scale problems. This is combined with an&lt;br/&gt;integrated approach to pedagogy, that features a strong involvement in&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate research, development of research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for groups that are under-represented in mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;the physical sciences, curriculum development both at the graduate and&lt;br/&gt;the undergraduate level, and development of materials for scientific&lt;br/&gt;outreach to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date: December 17, 2001</AbstractNarration>
