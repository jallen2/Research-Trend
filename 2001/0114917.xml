    <AbstractNarration>Bringing Up Girls in Science (BUGS) is a demonstration project in the Department of Technology &lt;br/&gt;and Cognition at the University of North Texas (UNT). The goal of this project is to provide &lt;br/&gt;educational experiences in an outdoor learning lab for girls in grades four and five that will&lt;br/&gt;increase girls' interest, participation, self-concept, knowledge, and achievement in the &lt;br/&gt;environmental sciences. During Year One, thirty 4 th and 5 th grade girls (BUGS participants) &lt;br/&gt;will participate in an after school outdoor science lab at Sam Houston Elementary in the &lt;br/&gt;Denton Independent School District in Denton, TX. Participants for the project will be &lt;br/&gt;recruited from across the district. BUGS participants will be mentored by female &lt;br/&gt;high students enrolled in the Texas Academy for Mathematics and Science (TAMS). &lt;br/&gt;BUGS participants and mentors will be joined the second and third year of the project&lt;br/&gt;by girls in special populations at distance sites through the use &lt;br/&gt;of two-way audio-visual desktop conferencing tools, a project WEB site, chat rooms, and &lt;br/&gt;computer ``pen-pals''. For the second and third year special populations joining the project &lt;br/&gt;will include: (1) students with emotional and behavioral problems attending Rose Street &lt;br/&gt;Day Program and Therapeutic School in Wichita Falls, TX; (2) a school district which serves &lt;br/&gt;large numbers of Hispanic and Native American students in Bernalillo, New Mexico; and&lt;br/&gt;(3) students from a rural school district in Decatur, Texas. BUGS participants at distance &lt;br/&gt;sites will be able to use ``electronic field trips'' developed from activities that were &lt;br/&gt;videotaped during Year One to increase their opportunities to participate in the ``outdoor&lt;br/&gt;science lab experience.'' Family involvement will be ongoing throughout the project.&lt;br/&gt;Career awareness and educational opportunities materials will be housed by a local&lt;br/&gt;public library for the parents of BUGS participants. Three parent &lt;br/&gt;meetings per year will be provided to ``showcase'' student work and provide educational &lt;br/&gt;and career information.</AbstractNarration>
