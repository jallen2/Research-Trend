    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0103739&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project can be conditionally divided into the following (related) &lt;br/&gt;parts: Study of periodic metrics (including area-minimizing properties &lt;br/&gt;of flats in normed spaces, symplectic filling volumes for Finsler&lt;br/&gt;metrics, asymptotic volume growth of Finsler tori, Riemannian metrics &lt;br/&gt;without conjugate points on products, and Lagrangian systems on tori &lt;br/&gt;without conjugate points); Relationship between bi-Lipschitz equivalence &lt;br/&gt;and quasi-isometries (with the most intriguing cases of general Penrose &lt;br/&gt;tilings and finitely presented groups, including co-compact lattices in &lt;br/&gt;the same Lie group); Products of non-commuting maps, flows of positive &lt;br/&gt;metric entropy, and sequential dynamics; Applications of geometry of &lt;br/&gt;non-positive curvature to algorithmics and dynamics; Geometry of &lt;br/&gt;non-negatively-curved manifolds (foliations by minimal surfaces, &lt;br/&gt;isolated flat totally geodesic tori); the PI's graduate students work &lt;br/&gt;on generalizations of the Finite Distance Theorem to non-Abelian groups, &lt;br/&gt;approximations of embedded surfaces with small variation of Gaussian &lt;br/&gt;curvature by developing surfaces, constructing Lipschitz homeomorphisms &lt;br/&gt;with prescribed Jacobians, generating certain groups by products of &lt;br/&gt;conjugates of elements from a bounded subset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the project deals with large-scale invariants of &lt;br/&gt;periodic metrics. Their physical analogs are macroscopic properties of &lt;br/&gt;periodic media (such as a crystal substance), and the problem is to &lt;br/&gt;understand how such properties can be recovered from microscopic &lt;br/&gt;characteristics and vice versa. A large part of the project belongs to &lt;br/&gt;a borderline between geometry and dynamics, and in particular new &lt;br/&gt;applications of geometric methods. For instance, problems of stability &lt;br/&gt;in sequential dynamics model situations where the laws of evolution of &lt;br/&gt;an object (for instance, a physical or an ecological system) are subject &lt;br/&gt;to small perturbations; it is desirable to understand the result of such &lt;br/&gt;perturbations in the large time scale. There are also applications of &lt;br/&gt;modern geometry of singular spaces to problems originated from statistical &lt;br/&gt;physics (such as estimates on the number of collisions of particles in &lt;br/&gt;gas models, a problem that goes back to Boltzmann), and to computational &lt;br/&gt;problems (such as: how to numerically find a shortest path between&lt;br/&gt;around several obstacles). The last part of the project deals with &lt;br/&gt;stability of geometric objects described by curvature-type &lt;br/&gt;characteristics. Indeed, whenever we study a geometric object &lt;br/&gt;(for instance, a surface), we deal with imprecise information. Thus it is &lt;br/&gt;important to understand whether small deviations in this information &lt;br/&gt;can result in crucial changes for the geometric object (or even a &lt;br/&gt;non-existence of a model object).</AbstractNarration>
