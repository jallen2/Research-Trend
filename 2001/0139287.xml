    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator, together with various collaborators, studies&lt;br/&gt;the cohomology of arithmetic groups as modules over an algebra of Hecke&lt;br/&gt;operators. He considers conjectures connecting (1) mod-p cohomology&lt;br/&gt;classes of congruence groups which are eigenclasses for all the Hecke&lt;br/&gt;operators with (2) mod-p representations of the Galois (symmetry) group&lt;br/&gt;of the algebraic numbers. These conjectures amount to saying there should&lt;br/&gt;exist reciprocity laws (usually non-abelian) connecting the two types of&lt;br/&gt;objects. The conjectures are tested computationally, which leads to&lt;br/&gt;further refinements of them. The principal investigator outlines an&lt;br/&gt;approach for proving them in some special cases. Another set of computer&lt;br/&gt;calculations probe for the existence of automorphic representations of&lt;br/&gt;cohomological type which are not lifted from smaller rank groups. These&lt;br/&gt;are conjecturally connected with reciprocity laws of Langlands type.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the investigator and a colleague develop a theory of p-adic&lt;br/&gt;families of not necessarily p-ordinary cohomology classes for congruence&lt;br/&gt;groups. They use this to study the question whether non-lifted&lt;br/&gt;automorphic representations are "p-adically rigid".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic number theory studies the properties of polynomial&lt;br/&gt;functions and equations whose coefficients are whole numbers. Ever since&lt;br/&gt;Descartes invented analytic geometry in the early 1600's, the ability to&lt;br/&gt;solve algebraic equations has been central to mathematics, science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. In the last 50 years a new set of applications of number&lt;br/&gt;theory has opened up in the field of cryptography. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator studies delicate questions involving the fine structure and&lt;br/&gt;properties of solutions to certain systems of algebraic equations.&lt;br/&gt;Although one can often obtain approximate solutions using computers, there&lt;br/&gt;are many very subtle and difficult questions concerning the existence and&lt;br/&gt;form of the exact solutions. There are a number of conjectures on the&lt;br/&gt;table to explain what is going on, and the principal investigator has&lt;br/&gt;contributed some of them. He and his colleagues study these conjectures&lt;br/&gt;by verifying them in some cases by extensive computer calculations, and by&lt;br/&gt;proving them in special cases. At the core of this research is the&lt;br/&gt;surprising connection with geometric objects ("cohomology classes") that&lt;br/&gt;can be constructed in spaces of n-dimensional crystal lattices.</AbstractNarration>
