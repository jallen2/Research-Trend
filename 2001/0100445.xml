    <AbstractNarration>Hoffman will investigate the properties of endomorphisms which are&lt;br/&gt;isomorphic to one sided Bernoulli shifts. One direction this work&lt;br/&gt;will take is to show that particular dynamical systems are isomorphic&lt;br/&gt;to one sided Bernoulli shifts. In particular Hoffman will attempt to&lt;br/&gt;classify which toral endomorphisms are isomorphic to a one sided&lt;br/&gt;Bernoulli shift. He will also attempt to classify all toral&lt;br/&gt;endomorphisms up to isomorphism. Hoffman will try to show the&lt;br/&gt;differences between Ornstein's theory of Bernoulli automorphisms and&lt;br/&gt;the emerging theory of Bernoulli endomorphisms. A particular example&lt;br/&gt;of this relates to compact extensions of Bernoulli endomorphisms.&lt;br/&gt;Rudolph proved that any compact extension of a Bernoulli shift that is&lt;br/&gt;weak mixing is isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift. Hoffman will try to&lt;br/&gt;show that Bernoulli endomorphisms do not share this property. Hoffman&lt;br/&gt;will also continue his work in probability theory. He will continue&lt;br/&gt;to study infinite percolation cluster on the square lattice. In&lt;br/&gt;particular he will compare the properties of simple random walk on the&lt;br/&gt;square lattice with the properties of simple random walk on infinite&lt;br/&gt;percolation clusters. The overall goal of this portion of the&lt;br/&gt;research is to determine if the distribution of paths for simple&lt;br/&gt;random walk on the infinite percolation cluster can be rescaled in&lt;br/&gt;such a way as to generate the distribution of Brownian paths in the&lt;br/&gt;plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of randomness is a major part of the application of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics to many interesting systems. For example, in statistics&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of randomness is used to make sense of data and in applied&lt;br/&gt;math random processes are used to model financial markets dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems. This proposal deals with randomness in the context of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems and probability theory. This proposal will attempt&lt;br/&gt;to classify various types of mathematical systems according to the&lt;br/&gt;type and amount of randomness that they exhibit.</AbstractNarration>
