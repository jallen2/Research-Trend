    <AbstractNarration>The mission of Northwest Indian College (NWIC) is to provide post-secondary&lt;br/&gt;educational opportunities for Native Americans that is sensitive to their worldviews,&lt;br/&gt;background, and academic needs and goals, and prepare them for the challenges of &lt;br/&gt;leadership in their tribal communities. In addition to providing effective opportunities &lt;br/&gt;for students to develop academic competence, the NWIC mission is to infuse students &lt;br/&gt;with clear communication skills, critical thinking skills, and a developed sense of&lt;br/&gt;civic responsibility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Northwest Indian College Division of Math and Science is proposing implementation &lt;br/&gt;of a SMET learning community educational plan that begins with entering freshman and&lt;br/&gt;supports them through to the completion of an AA or AS degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first-year goal of this program would be to generate student interest and growth &lt;br/&gt;toward further education in math and science. Building on this foundation, the overall&lt;br/&gt;goal would be to have these students then obtain associates and baccalaureate degrees &lt;br/&gt;in science or math-related fields. The first year would be a "developmental year" for&lt;br/&gt;students whose test scores indicate that this is necessary. (Note: The majority of &lt;br/&gt;students entering NWIC would have test scores reflecting this need. It is often&lt;br/&gt;the lack of a growth or preparation period that contributes to student failure&lt;br/&gt;in math and science.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the first year, the plan would be as follows:&lt;br/&gt;* Each eligible student would enter into an integrated academic group or cohort.&lt;br/&gt;* A testing specialist would evaluate math and science competencies for each student.&lt;br/&gt;* All students would be enrolled in the following courses: Public Speaking, Introduction to&lt;br/&gt;Computers, Native American History/Philosophy, and Introduction to Successful Learning&lt;br/&gt;during fall quarter and throughout their first (or developmental) year. These courses,&lt;br/&gt;which are required for graduation from Northwest Indian College, would be fully&lt;br/&gt;integrated among each other while also being integrated with introductory science and&lt;br/&gt;math courses in which students are placed according to their initial test scores.&lt;br/&gt;Example: The cohort would be assigned a relevant science topic such as iswater quality.lo&lt;br/&gt;Individually and as a group, students would research the topic, using math to compute&lt;br/&gt;statistics, the Internet to find background material and group discussions to enhance&lt;br/&gt;individual research. Students would give oral and written presentations using the&lt;br/&gt;principles discussed in the cohort instruction. (Note: A somewhat different form of this&lt;br/&gt;schedule and approach has been used successfully with our NSF funded Tribal&lt;br/&gt;Environmental and Natural Resource Management program (TENRM). The result has&lt;br/&gt;been much higher than average retention and completion for students lacking needed&lt;br/&gt;skills.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By combining required courses where NWIC students typically do well (i.e. Speech), with&lt;br/&gt;developmental science and math courses, students will be more likely to successfully&lt;br/&gt;complete essential coursework for graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northwest Indian College students have demonstrated they must be immersed in their&lt;br/&gt;culture, history, and philosophy if they are to effectively understand and build upon &lt;br/&gt;their role inthe Native communities. The college knows they must also develop the&lt;br/&gt;science and math skills necessary to help their culture survive and intends to meet&lt;br/&gt;these needs by offering introductory science and math courses fully integrated with &lt;br/&gt;curriculum related to Native culture, history, and philosophy. As they build increased &lt;br/&gt;self-esteem while finding success in the classroom, students will recognize their &lt;br/&gt;capacity to do science and math. They will then feel comfortable pursuing further &lt;br/&gt;science and math-related courses as they eventually enter baccalaureate programs and&lt;br/&gt;the SMET workforce.</AbstractNarration>
