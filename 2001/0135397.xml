    <AbstractNarration>Smith, Kenneth P.&lt;br/&gt;0135397&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The neuroscience community is accumulating a vast amount of human brain mapping data using a&lt;br/&gt;variety of techniques that operate over a wide range of spatial scales. Currently its use is generally&lt;br/&gt;limited to the lab of origin; the data is not readily available to other investigators for subsequent studies.&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research is to design, prototype, and evaluate an information infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;human brain mapping data which will help realize the full potential of this growing store of mapping&lt;br/&gt;data. In this initial undertaking, we focus on a system that enables the analysis, exploration, and&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. Our major aims are: 1) to develop&lt;br/&gt;and deploy an operational digital library for structural MRI data that will enable users to contribute and&lt;br/&gt;retrieve data, as well as explore and analyze associated metadata; 2) to design a data warehouse of&lt;br/&gt;structural MRI data that will allow users to manipulate images, explore spatial relationships among&lt;br/&gt;regions, and reason about abstract attributes of structural regions (e.g., volume); 3) to design a&lt;br/&gt;content-based retrieval system that will allow users to retrieve images with features similar to those in a&lt;br/&gt;submitted example; 4) to develop techniques that enable users to dynamically aggregate warehouse&lt;br/&gt;information into a probabilistic brain atlas for specified populations of interest; and 5) to develop a&lt;br/&gt;prototype system that will ground architecture and query language development in a real world setting so&lt;br/&gt;that tradeoffs in design choices may be accurately evaluated.</AbstractNarration>
