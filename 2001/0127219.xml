    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;This is a Full-Scale-Development Proposal based on a successful Proof-of-Concept Grant&lt;br/&gt;(NSF Award No. 9952653) demonstrating an innovative approach to materials for upper-&lt;br/&gt;division undergraduate engineering education. The value of visual materials in conveying &lt;br/&gt;technical concepts is very well established, and is here applied in a multimedia form to &lt;br/&gt;the topic of thermofluid dynamics (i.e. convective heat transfer, thermodynamics, and gas &lt;br/&gt;dynamics), with strong emphasis on experimentation and optical flow visualization. The &lt;br/&gt;results are materials captured on one or more CD-ROMs that can be used by instructors &lt;br/&gt;and students as a visual supplement to any of the standard textbooks on these topics. &lt;br/&gt;The suitability of such materials for national dissemination has already been demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;This approach makes use of the ubiquity and low-cost of CD-ROM technology, &lt;br/&gt;which makes it especially important for small and minority universities that sometimes &lt;br/&gt;lack the facilities to convey the laboratory experience directly to their students. The&lt;br/&gt;major SMET challenge being addressed is that of enhancing traditional engineering &lt;br/&gt;education with highly-visual material not currently available, and thus conveying to &lt;br/&gt;students a sense of the research-laboratory experience. One DUE theme also addressed &lt;br/&gt;here is faculty development, by providing faculty with an unusual supplementary &lt;br/&gt;teaching tool, thus broadening their preparation beyond what is traditionally available&lt;br/&gt;in textbooks. Integration of technology is also a component part of this project. That is,&lt;br/&gt;during the learning, the course materials require the students to use computers and to &lt;br/&gt;interface with multimedia systems environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keywords: Multimedia, multimedia fluid mechanics, optical flow visualization.</AbstractNarration>
