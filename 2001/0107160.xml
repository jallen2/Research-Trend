    <AbstractNarration>Smith&lt;br/&gt;0107160&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops mathematical methods that exploit&lt;br/&gt;the special properties inherent in dynamical systems arising in&lt;br/&gt;the biological sciences and applies them to specific problems.&lt;br/&gt;The main focus is on the long-term behavior of the dynamics after&lt;br/&gt;transient effects have disappeared. The work on biofilms focuses&lt;br/&gt;on systems of advection-diffusion equations coupled to ordinary&lt;br/&gt;differential equations with coupled nonlinear boundary conditions&lt;br/&gt;in piecewise-smooth domains. Aside from well-posedness and the&lt;br/&gt;existence of multiple steady states, which are nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;questions, the important biological information comes from key&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues for associated nonstandard eigenvalue problems and&lt;br/&gt;their dependence on parameters. Both mathematical analysis and&lt;br/&gt;numerical simulations are required for an understanding. The work&lt;br/&gt;on the paradox of the plankton focuses on the classical model of&lt;br/&gt;n-species exploitative competition for k essential&lt;br/&gt;(non-substitutable) nutrients. If n is larger than k there can be&lt;br/&gt;no equilibrium coexistence of all n species so one must seek&lt;br/&gt;oscillatory coexistence. The investigator exploits certain&lt;br/&gt;heteroclinic structures (cycles of equilibria) that arise&lt;br/&gt;naturally in such systems in order to seek periodic coexistence&lt;br/&gt;solutions. The theory of competitive and cooperative systems can&lt;br/&gt;play a significant role. Abstract dynamical systems theory comes&lt;br/&gt;into play in the work on robust persistence. Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;understanding chain recurrent sets and Morse decompositions of&lt;br/&gt;the boundary dynamics (where one or more species are absent) are&lt;br/&gt;key to showing that persistence for a dynamical system is robust&lt;br/&gt;to perturbation of that system or of its parameters.&lt;br/&gt; Dynamical systems that arise naturally in many areas in the&lt;br/&gt;biological sciences often have special features not shared by&lt;br/&gt;systems arising in the physical sciences. Broadly speaking, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator develops mathematical methods that exploit these&lt;br/&gt;special properties and applies them to specific problems. The&lt;br/&gt;main focus is on the long-term behavior of the dynamics after&lt;br/&gt;transient effects have disappeared. Progress in this area can&lt;br/&gt;help to answer important biological questions that are subject to&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling, such as whether an infectious disease&lt;br/&gt;becomes endemic in a population or becomes extinct, or which&lt;br/&gt;species in an ecosystem can survive and which will become&lt;br/&gt;extinct. A substantial effort is devoted to understanding the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of mathematical models in three areas of the&lt;br/&gt;biosciences. The first is microbial growth and competition in&lt;br/&gt;environmental settings where biofilms may form on surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;Biofilms are of great importance in the health sciences and food&lt;br/&gt;industry where their formation typically results in negative&lt;br/&gt;outcomes. They are responsible for food and water contamination,&lt;br/&gt;dental caries and periodontal disease, and the contamination of&lt;br/&gt;medical implants. The investigator studies under what conditions&lt;br/&gt;biofilms may form and what bacterial densities can be expected.&lt;br/&gt;The second is a fundamental issue in population biology, the&lt;br/&gt;so-called "paradox of the plankton": why can so many plankton&lt;br/&gt;species (and, more generally, species of other taxa) be supported&lt;br/&gt;by so few limiting resources? The investigator provides&lt;br/&gt;mathematically rigorous results for the existence of oscillatory&lt;br/&gt;coexistence states of the relevant mathematical models when the&lt;br/&gt;number of species exceeds the number of resources, as is typical&lt;br/&gt;in natural environments. The third is a more robust theory of&lt;br/&gt;persistence (also called permanence) for dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;arising in population dynamics. In its simplest form, this theory&lt;br/&gt;seeks not to determine the global behavior of solutions of a&lt;br/&gt;dynamical system representing interacting populations but rather&lt;br/&gt;to answer the more basic question: What species are present at&lt;br/&gt;the end of the day? While past research in this area has&lt;br/&gt;primarily ignored the fact that population models are only&lt;br/&gt;approximately correct, the investigator seeks to provide answers&lt;br/&gt;to the basic question that hold true for all small perturbations&lt;br/&gt;of the model equations.</AbstractNarration>
