    <AbstractNarration>0102686&lt;br/&gt;Casazza&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will concentrate on several new applications of frame theory &lt;br/&gt;concerning the transmission of information. First, for communication &lt;br/&gt;networks such as the Internet, packets of data are often lost in transmission &lt;br/&gt;and are retransmitted according to a protocol invisible to the user. In &lt;br/&gt;many applications, the subsequent delay is unacceptable and best possible &lt;br/&gt;reconstruction from what is initially received is necessary. Second, it has &lt;br/&gt;been shown that wireless communication systems which employ multiple &lt;br/&gt;antennas can have very high channel capacities. Until now, constructive &lt;br/&gt;approaches to achieving this capacity have relied on the assumption that &lt;br/&gt;the receiver knows the complex-valued Rayleigh fading coefficients. This &lt;br/&gt;assumption is often unrealistic in practice and recently new classes of &lt;br/&gt;unitary space-time signals have been proposed where neither the sender &lt;br/&gt;nor the receiver knows the fading coefficients. The investigators will &lt;br/&gt;facilitate the implementation of both of these programs along with a host &lt;br/&gt;of related problems in signal/image processing. This will require: (1) The &lt;br/&gt;construction of totally new families of uniform tight frames with specific &lt;br/&gt;optimization properties; (2) The development of algorithms for their &lt;br/&gt;implementation; (3) The development of new (and computationally &lt;br/&gt;efficient) methods for inverting the Gabor frame operator to allow a much &lt;br/&gt;broader class of functions to be used for signal/image processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it possible to develop a cell phone which will not fade under almost any &lt;br/&gt;circumstance? Is it possible to have your computer receive an almost &lt;br/&gt;perfect message immediately after it is sent? Is it possible to develop a &lt;br/&gt;hearing aid which not only allows the wearer to hear what he/she wants, &lt;br/&gt;but also allows a person to filter out sounds they do not want to hear? Is it &lt;br/&gt;possible to have a breast x-ray which is so clear that cancer diagnoses are &lt;br/&gt;99% accurate? The answer is that all of these (and a host of other &lt;br/&gt;important questions) are ``theoretically possible''. What is needed for the &lt;br/&gt;implementation of these important applications is the development of a &lt;br/&gt;branch of mathematics called ``uniform tight frames''. Working with a &lt;br/&gt;dozen research groups around the country, the investigators are developing &lt;br/&gt;the mathematics needed for these applications as well as developing the &lt;br/&gt;means to implement these results in the specific cases listed above and a &lt;br/&gt;large number of other areas of application.</AbstractNarration>
