    <AbstractNarration>Abstract DMS-0103957:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contains the following main topics: &lt;br/&gt;1. Approximation of Riemannian &lt;br/&gt;manifolds by polyhedral metrics and generalization of Alexandrov embedding&lt;br/&gt;theorem. The PI has proved that approximability by polyhedral metrics&lt;br/&gt;implies a new kind of curvature bound which appears naturally but has never been&lt;br/&gt;considered in geometry before. The proof is interesting in its own right,&lt;br/&gt;as it uses a Lemma closely resembling the Alexandrov embedding theorem&lt;br/&gt;(which states that any positively curved metric on a 2-sphere is isometric&lt;br/&gt;to a convex surface in a Euclidean space). This brings us back to a more&lt;br/&gt;geometrical point of view on Riemannian Geometry, according to which&lt;br/&gt;``interesting'' curvature bounds should arise from properties of&lt;br/&gt;embeddings of manifolds into Euclidean space. This circle of ideas also&lt;br/&gt;gives a new approach to the old conjecture that every simply connected&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian manifold with positive curvature operator is diffeomorphic to a&lt;br/&gt;sphere; &lt;br/&gt;2. Collapsing with lower curvature bound. The general goal of this topic&lt;br/&gt;is to understand how collapsing with lower curvature and diameter bounds&lt;br/&gt;happens and, in the very best case, to construct a structure analogous to&lt;br/&gt;the one obtained by Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov for the case of bounded&lt;br/&gt;curvature.&lt;br/&gt;3. Gate spaces. Gate spaces are related to a circle of problems arising&lt;br/&gt;from the question of K.Grove of whether there is an Alexandrov space that&lt;br/&gt;has two different smoothings into Riemannian manifolds of the same&lt;br/&gt;dimension and lower curvature bound;&lt;br/&gt;4. Applications of megafolds to collapsing with bounded curvature and to &lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow. Megafolds are a generalization of Riemannian manifolds and&lt;br/&gt;orbifolds that has already proved it usefulness for collapsing with&lt;br/&gt;bounded curvature; in particular, they were used by the PI to prove, in&lt;br/&gt;coloboration with W.Tuschmann, the main part of the Klingenberg-Sakai&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture. Such a collapsing also arises naturally from the rescaling of&lt;br/&gt;the Ricci flow; it can be used to construct singularity models for the&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow with no injectivity radius estimates; &lt;br/&gt;5. Theory of Alexandrov spaces. Alexandrov spaces appear naturally as&lt;br/&gt;limits of Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bound. Most geometric&lt;br/&gt;results which are true for Riemaninan manifolds with lower curvature bound&lt;br/&gt;are also true for Alexandrov spaces; however, there are several such&lt;br/&gt;results that cannot be generalized. For example, it is not known whether a&lt;br/&gt;convex hypersurface in an Alexandrov space is also an Alexandrov&lt;br/&gt;space. Such problems are mostly due to the lack of local analysis, and&lt;br/&gt;that is what the PI proposes to study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian manifold, which could be considered as a simplified version of&lt;br/&gt;space-time, is a way too complicated object. The first topic in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal is aimed at studing Riemanian manifolds by means of approximation&lt;br/&gt;by simpler objects. These objects are polyhedral spaces, i.e. spaces glued&lt;br/&gt;of Euclidean polyhedra. The other topics considers a different approach to&lt;br/&gt;studing Riemannian manifolds. It is based on considering extremal metrics,&lt;br/&gt;in an appropriate sense, for example how Riemannian manifolds collapse to&lt;br/&gt;lower dimenssional objects. This method makes possible to get new results&lt;br/&gt;in the main stream direction of Riemannian geometry: how to make&lt;br/&gt;conclusions about global structure of space basing on local properties.</AbstractNarration>
