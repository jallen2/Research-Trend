    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0125170&lt;br/&gt;Paul M. N. Feehan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal goal of our research is to prove the celebrated &lt;br/&gt;formula of Edward Witten (1994), relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten series of smooth four-manifolds. Witten used &lt;br/&gt;quantum field theory methods to derive his celebrated formula, &lt;br/&gt;based on the concept of `duality', whereas the approach we &lt;br/&gt;have been pursuing jointly with Thomas Leness is a mathematical &lt;br/&gt;one, employing a moduli space of non-abelian monopoles as a &lt;br/&gt;cobordism between links of Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten &lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces. We have already partially verified Witten's &lt;br/&gt;formula using this approach, showing that in many cases the &lt;br/&gt;series agree up through terms of order depending only on &lt;br/&gt;the topology of the four-manifold. We aim to build on &lt;br/&gt;those results, by showing next that a relation between the &lt;br/&gt;two series of the overall expected shape exists and then &lt;br/&gt;applying auxiliary techniques to prove that his formula is &lt;br/&gt;the only one possible. A second goal of our research is to&lt;br/&gt;develop a proof of Witten's formula, in the special case of &lt;br/&gt;symplectic four-manifolds equipped with Lefschetz fibrations, &lt;br/&gt;and shed light on the relationship between Seiberg-Witten &lt;br/&gt;invariants, Donaldson invariants, and the structure of Lefschetz fibrations. Ultimately, we also hope to explain the relationship between the mathematical and quantum field theory methods of &lt;br/&gt;deriving Witten's formula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Witten's formula, as understood by mathematicians, is part of a physical theory developed by Witten and Nathan Seiberg relating non-abelian Yang-Mills theory (a generalization of Maxwell's &lt;br/&gt;theory of electromagnetics) and the simpler abelian Seiberg-Witten gauge field theories. In the physical world, quantum Yang-Mills theories provide a theoretical basis for describing elementary &lt;br/&gt;particle interactions. In the mathematical world, beginning with &lt;br/&gt;the work of Simon Donaldson in 1983, classical Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten gauge theories have played a fundamental role &lt;br/&gt;in probing the geometry of four-dimensional spaces. String&lt;br/&gt;theory is often cited by physicists as the most promising &lt;br/&gt;candidate for a unification of quantum field theory (itself &lt;br/&gt;is a unification of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong &lt;br/&gt;forces) and Einstein's theory of gravity. Such a `grand &lt;br/&gt;unified theory' would give a single theoretical framework &lt;br/&gt;for explaining both short-range, high-energy elementary &lt;br/&gt;particle interactions and the long-range gravitational force. &lt;br/&gt;However, discovery of such a unified framework has eluded &lt;br/&gt;physicists for nearly three-quarters of a century. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;while Einstein's theory of gravity is founded on rigorous &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, the goal of providing a mathematical foundation &lt;br/&gt;for quantum field theory has not yet been realized. Most &lt;br/&gt;physicists agree that particle accelerators of impossibly &lt;br/&gt;large size would be needed to experimentally verify that &lt;br/&gt;string theory is the `right' theory of nature. However, &lt;br/&gt;while independent, mathematical verifications of quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theory predictions can never replace experimental tests, &lt;br/&gt;they may increase our confidence that quantum field theory &lt;br/&gt;predictions are correct when experimental checks are impossible &lt;br/&gt;with current technology. We hope that our project may serve as a &lt;br/&gt;small step in such directions.</AbstractNarration>
