    <AbstractNarration>We propose an equipment grant to enhance ongoing and future lightwave communications and&lt;br/&gt;radar remote sensing research and education at the University of Kansas. The instrumentation&lt;br/&gt;we propose to acquire includes various lightwave components, a network analyzer, a portable&lt;br/&gt;spectrum analyzer, two arbitrary waveform generators, a high-speed data acquisition system, and&lt;br/&gt;a high-speed oscilloscope. The lightwave components includes lasers with integrated electro-absorption&lt;br/&gt;modulators, high-power erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA), a semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;optical amplifier (SOA), a 35-GHz photo receiver with amplifier, fiber-optic delay lines, optical&lt;br/&gt;splitters/combiners, an extended DWDM-band tunable laser, and pump laser diodes for a Raman&lt;br/&gt;amplifier.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to use the lightwave equipment to upgrade our 10 Gb/s test beds to 40 Gb/s to&lt;br/&gt;support ongoing and future research activities. We will use the high-speed oscilloscope and&lt;br/&gt;spectrum analyzer for testing and calibrating our existing radars as well as the new ones being&lt;br/&gt;developed for glacial ice studies and as prototypes for Mars observation. We will use the&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary waveform generators as flexible signal sources to support activities related to ongoing&lt;br/&gt;efforts on the development of a pulse-compression LIDAR and also investigating optimized&lt;br/&gt;waveforms for various remote sensing applications. We propose to use the network analyzer&lt;br/&gt;primarily as a dedicated source and receiver for our antenna testing range, which is needed to&lt;br/&gt;support our radar development activities.&lt;br/&gt;In lightwave communications research, the 40 Gb/s per optical channel is the next signaling rate&lt;br/&gt;to be deployed to meet society's insatiable communication needs. Extensive experimental&lt;br/&gt;testing is required to study and evaluate the many questions critical to the implementation of this&lt;br/&gt;signaling rate. The proposed upgrades to our testbed will allow us to evaluate the performance&lt;br/&gt;of components, subsystems, and systems at this signaling rate. To launch and then detect&lt;br/&gt;40 Gb/s signals for system evaluation, short-pulse lasers, power dividers and combiners, and&lt;br/&gt;wide-bandwidth photodetectors are needed. In addition, to manage fiber nonlinearities for these&lt;br/&gt;increased signaling rates, distributed signal amplification with Raman amplifiers will need to be&lt;br/&gt;employed.&lt;br/&gt;Three ongoing projects in remote sensing will benefit significantly from the proposed test&lt;br/&gt;equipment: (1) measurement of ice thickness and accumulation rate over the Greenland ice sheet;&lt;br/&gt;(2) design and development of a radar prototype for Mars; and (3) design and development of a&lt;br/&gt;pulse compression LIDAR for a future satellite mission. The test equipment will allow us to&lt;br/&gt;improve our existing coherent radar depth sounder for obtaining ice thickness data over a few&lt;br/&gt;outlet glaciers that are thinning and for which no ice thickness data are available. The ice&lt;br/&gt;thickness data are essential to the study of the dynamics of these glaciers. The Mars radar&lt;br/&gt;development involves design tradeoffs in modulation waveform, frequency, sidelobe levels, and&lt;br/&gt;antenna size. The test equipment will contribute to testing and evaluating an optimized&lt;br/&gt;prototype radar for a future Mars lander or/and orbiter, as well as investigating the use of single-sideband&lt;br/&gt;modulation techniques to improve the sensitivity of our pulse compression LIDAR.&lt;br/&gt;Currently 17 graduate students, seven undergraduate students, two post-doctoral research&lt;br/&gt;engineers, and five faculty are involved in the ongoing research projects. We anticipate similar&lt;br/&gt;numbers of students and research associates to be involved in future lightwave communications&lt;br/&gt;and remote sensing research at this institution. Thus the proposed equipment is a significant&lt;br/&gt;contribution to the research and education mission of the University of Kansas.</AbstractNarration>
