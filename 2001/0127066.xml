    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;A growing body of literature amply documents the low levels of scientific literacy&lt;br/&gt;among the American public. To address this issue we are providing a framework in which&lt;br/&gt;large numbers of undergraduates can achieve basic scientific literacy. We are&lt;br/&gt;accomplishing this goal through development of a general biology laboratory course for&lt;br/&gt;approximately 2325 students per year including non-science majors, underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minorities and future K-16 teachers. This course is adapting materials from Oklahoma State University, New York University, Sweetbriar College, Wellesley College, and Project Kaleidoscope The new biology course utilizes project-based learning and critical thinking skill development to introduce and allow discussion of relevant scientific concepts. Expected project outcomes include: graduates able to engage in scientifically aware behavior and informed citizenship, improved scientific knowledge, and an appreciation of the connections between science and "real-world" problems. The project is yielding innovative hands-on, minds-on laboratory activities suitable for large numbers of students that are available for adaptation by other institutions through a published laboratory manual. Dissemination is being accomplished through a project web site, presentations at national meetings, faculty development workshops, publication of laboratory materials and professional articles. This model is one that can be easily adapted by other institutions and, therefore has excellent potential for other universities who teach large numbers of students.</AbstractNarration>
