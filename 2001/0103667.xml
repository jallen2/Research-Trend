    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0103667&lt;br/&gt;Richard M. Hain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to better understand the &lt;br/&gt;structure of mapping class groups and then to apply this &lt;br/&gt;knowledge to the problem of understanding motives over &lt;br/&gt;the spectrum of the integers. The Principal Investigator &lt;br/&gt;hopes to compute the stable highest weight decomposition &lt;br/&gt;of the graded quotients of the lower central series of &lt;br/&gt;the Torelli groups (tensored with the reals) as modules &lt;br/&gt;over the real symplectic group of rank g. This should be &lt;br/&gt;of interest to those studying 3-manifold invariants. The &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator plans to use his knowledge of this&lt;br/&gt;stable decomposition to study the image of the Galois group &lt;br/&gt;of the rational numbers on appropriate completions of mapping &lt;br/&gt;class groups. In particular, he (in joint work with Makoto &lt;br/&gt;Matsumoto) hopes to be able to characterize the Zariski &lt;br/&gt;closure of the image of the Galois group in the group of &lt;br/&gt;outer automorphisms of the relative unipotent completion &lt;br/&gt;of mapping class groups of large genus. This should lead &lt;br/&gt;to improved understanding of the connections between Hodge &lt;br/&gt;Theory and Galois Theory; in particular, to improved &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the role of mixed zeta numbers in Galois theory.&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator also plans to study the &lt;br/&gt;pseudoconvexity of the moduli spaces of curves. &lt;br/&gt;Looijenga has conjectured that there is a proper,&lt;br/&gt;non-negative, (g-2)-pseudoconvex real-valued function &lt;br/&gt;defined on the moduli space of genus g curves. Hain, in &lt;br/&gt;joint work with Looijenga, hopes to prove that the function &lt;br/&gt;that he constructed with David Reed several years ago is &lt;br/&gt;such a function. This result would lead to new vanishing&lt;br/&gt;results for coherent cohomology of moduli spaces of curves &lt;br/&gt;as well as unified proofs of several results of Diaz and &lt;br/&gt;Harer on the topology of these moduli spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of those geometrical properties &lt;br/&gt;of surfaces and their generalizations that remain unchanged &lt;br/&gt;under stretching (short of tearing) and other continuous &lt;br/&gt;deformations. Geometry is the study of those properties &lt;br/&gt;of surfaces and their generalizations that preserve geometric&lt;br/&gt;properties such as distances and/or angles. There is a profound connection between the topological symmetries of a surface&lt;br/&gt;(called the mapping class group of the surface), the geometry &lt;br/&gt;of all of the different ways of measuring angles on such a &lt;br/&gt;surface (the moduli space of conformal structures on the surface) &lt;br/&gt;and the arithmetical properties of the surface when viewed as &lt;br/&gt;the graph of a polynomial. Questions about mapping class&lt;br/&gt;groups and moduli spaces of conformal structures on surfaces &lt;br/&gt;arise in many areas of mathematics (such as the study of numbers, &lt;br/&gt;and algebraic geometry), and have applications to particle &lt;br/&gt;physics through string theory and conformal field theory. There &lt;br/&gt;are also potential significant applications to cryptography. The &lt;br/&gt;goal of this proposal is to further explore and understand the intricate and deep connections between these topological, &lt;br/&gt;geometrical and arithmetical aspects of surface theory,&lt;br/&gt;especially those aspects with connections to number theory.</AbstractNarration>
