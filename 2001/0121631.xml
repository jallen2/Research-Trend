    <AbstractNarration>Our primary research goal is to develop a prototype voice-enabled&lt;br/&gt;translating communicator which will deliver information services across&lt;br/&gt;the linguistic divide for minority languages in order allow remote&lt;br/&gt;linguistically-diverse users to communicate directly with Internet&lt;br/&gt;content and databases, and more importantly to communicate with others&lt;br/&gt;speaking a different language from their own. The latter will enable&lt;br/&gt;information, education, and, for example, health services, to reach&lt;br/&gt;remote minority-language communities. Achieving this goal requires&lt;br/&gt;major advances in machine learning for translation and in cross-language&lt;br/&gt;speech-recognition adaptability to wider language phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional transfer-rule-based MT requires up to a person-century&lt;br/&gt;to build and perfect a new language pair. Statistical and&lt;br/&gt;Example-Based MT replaces human coding effort by vast amounts of&lt;br/&gt;bilingual training data, which are virtually unobtainable for most&lt;br/&gt;minority languages. Without a radical advance, leading to an&lt;br/&gt;over-an-order-of-magnitude improvement in development time, the&lt;br/&gt;only commercially justifiable MT applications involve the major&lt;br/&gt;European languages, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic and perhaps a&lt;br/&gt;couple more relatively-popular languages. The vast majority of human&lt;br/&gt;languages are currently relegated to the proverbial MT dust heap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose new MT approaches based on extended and new machine&lt;br/&gt;learning methods. The first approach consists of statistical MT&lt;br/&gt;methods that learn from orders of magnitude less training data,&lt;br/&gt;and that can more effectively incorporate prior linguistic information&lt;br/&gt;(including dictionaries, word classes, and known linguistic&lt;br/&gt;rule classes or constraints) by using the joint source-channel&lt;br/&gt;modeling approach combined with exponential (maximum entropy) models.&lt;br/&gt;The second approach is a new method for acquiring high-quality MT&lt;br/&gt;transfer rules from native informants which decreases dependence on&lt;br/&gt;human experts and reduces development time. Semantically-conditioned&lt;br/&gt;transfer rules are generalized via a new locally-constrained&lt;br/&gt;Seeded Version-Space method based on a controlled bilingual corpus&lt;br/&gt;and interactive tools to elicit information from native informants.&lt;br/&gt;The third method builds general phone models across multiple language&lt;br/&gt;families for speech recognition and adapts the recognizer to new&lt;br/&gt;languages with minimal new- language training data. All of these&lt;br/&gt;methods are based on new and existing machine learning algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that combine prior knowledge with limited amounts of new data in&lt;br/&gt;order to converge quickly on working machine translation and speech&lt;br/&gt;recognition and synthesis systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary societal impact will be a significant contribution&lt;br/&gt;to the global democratization of informa- tion, a process that&lt;br/&gt;requires bridging current linguistic barriers, especially for&lt;br/&gt;low-density or economically- disadvantaged languages. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;preservation and teaching of endangered languages will be directly&lt;br/&gt;enabled by the new linguistic and acoustic knowledge coupled with&lt;br/&gt;existing tutorial software. If successful, Avenue (Adaptable Voice-Enabled&lt;br/&gt;Natural-translator for Universal Empowerment) will be the prototype&lt;br/&gt;of an MT system that will empower world-wide access to multilingual&lt;br/&gt;information.</AbstractNarration>
