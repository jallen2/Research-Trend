    <AbstractNarration>0105148&lt;br/&gt;Milligan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The performance of individuals within populations and the ability of&lt;br/&gt;populations to respond to selection, e.g., due to environmental&lt;br/&gt;changes, have received special attention by conservation biologists.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, small relative to large populations are generally&lt;br/&gt;regarded as either containing individuals expressing deleterious&lt;br/&gt;genes or lacking sufficient genetic variation to respond to selection. The&lt;br/&gt;quantitative genetics measures of inbreeding depression and&lt;br/&gt;heritability quantify these effects, and ideally such measures would&lt;br/&gt;be available for both small and large populations of the same&lt;br/&gt;species. This study is using innovative molecular genetic methods to&lt;br/&gt;measure these quantities in populations of Aquilegia (Ranunculaceae;&lt;br/&gt;columbines) that vary dramatically in total population size. DNA&lt;br/&gt;genotypes will be used to determine how related inviduals are within&lt;br/&gt;the populations; statistical models will then be used to estimate the&lt;br/&gt;quantitative genetics parameters describing inbreeding depression and&lt;br/&gt;heritability. Because populations of different sizes will be studied,&lt;br/&gt;a relationship between these measures and population size can be&lt;br/&gt;detected if it exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conservation biology has increasingly relied upon molecular genetic&lt;br/&gt;variation. However, to fully understand how that variation relates to&lt;br/&gt;adaptive differentiation, evolutionary potential, and resistance to&lt;br/&gt;the threat of extinction--all critical concerns of conservation&lt;br/&gt;biology--a better understanding of the quantitative genetic basis of&lt;br/&gt;adaptive traits is critical. Furthermore, the assumptions mentioned&lt;br/&gt;above about how population size affects that basis require empirical&lt;br/&gt;testing in natural populations. This novel study addresses and&lt;br/&gt;empirically tests important phenomena in biological conservation using&lt;br/&gt;measurements of quantitative genetics in field environments.</AbstractNarration>
