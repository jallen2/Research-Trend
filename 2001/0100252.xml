    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project has several related components: 1) We&lt;br/&gt;plan to continue our study of the Schelling segregation&lt;br/&gt;model as a dynamical system. This model, which first arose&lt;br/&gt;in economics, is related to a number of lattice models in&lt;br/&gt;statistical physics like the lattice gas, but more difficult&lt;br/&gt;due to the inherent non-local nature of site coupling; 2) We&lt;br/&gt;plan to study the "rigidity" of periodic point invariants&lt;br/&gt;for symbolic and hyperbolic dynamical systems. These&lt;br/&gt;topological invariants include, for a Holder continuous&lt;br/&gt;function f, the unmarked periodic orbit spectrum, the beta&lt;br/&gt;function P(-s f), and the zeta function. These invariants&lt;br/&gt;are fundamental objects of study in dynamics and statistical&lt;br/&gt;physics, but the information about the function f they&lt;br/&gt;capture is subtle and poorly understood; 3) We plan to&lt;br/&gt;continue our investigation into the distribution of values&lt;br/&gt;of fundamental quantities in ergodic theory (e.g. Lyapunov&lt;br/&gt;exponents, local entropy, and Birkhoff averages) and the&lt;br/&gt;fine structure of the corresponding phase space&lt;br/&gt;decomposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has several related components: 1) We&lt;br/&gt;plan to continue our study of the Schelling segregation&lt;br/&gt;model as a dynamical system. This model, which was first&lt;br/&gt;proposed by the eminent economist Thomas Schelling, is&lt;br/&gt;related to a number of lattice models in statistical physics&lt;br/&gt;like the lattice gas, but more difficult due to the inherent&lt;br/&gt;non-local nature of site coupling; 2) Pressure is a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental object of study in statistical physics, but even&lt;br/&gt;in highly idealized systems, the information about the&lt;br/&gt;system it captures is subtle and poorly understood. We plan&lt;br/&gt;to study whether certain systems are completely identified&lt;br/&gt;by their pressure. These problems have striking similarities&lt;br/&gt;to fascinating questions which Kac adroitly summarized with&lt;br/&gt;the question "Can you hear the shape of a drum?"; (3) For&lt;br/&gt;ergodic systems, the time average of a function along almost&lt;br/&gt;every orbit equals the spatial average. Only very rarely can&lt;br/&gt;almost every orbit be replaced by every orbit. We plan to&lt;br/&gt;study the fine structure and dimension of the exceptional&lt;br/&gt;set whose time average does not coincide with the spatial&lt;br/&gt;average</AbstractNarration>
