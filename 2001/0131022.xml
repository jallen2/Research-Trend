    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference on Macromolecular Organization and Cell Function has met biannually since 1987. This award will provide partial funding for the ninth conference in this series (and the fourth consecutive one to be held at Queens College, Oxford University), which is scheduled for August 4-9, 2002. The first conferences concentrated on the role of enzyme organization in metabolic regulation, but the subject matter has been greatly broadened over the years. The conference now deals with virtually all aspects of cell function, focusing on the intracellular organization of cellular components, the mechanisms underlying and controlling this organization, and the essential role of intracellular organization in cell function. Conference topics continue to evolve in relation to the questions that can be effectively addressed by new technologies and the integration of different disciplines. For example, many of the focus areas of the conference are now especially relevant for the application of emerging technologies in proteomics and structural biology. Sessions in the upcoming conference include "Nucleic acid super-structures and gene expression," "Organization of cellular metabolism," "The cytoskeleton and cell function," "Organization of translation," "New technologies for the post-genomic era," "The virtual cell," and "Molecular imaging in intact living systems." This is a truly interdisciplinary conference that has, throughout its history, successfully promoted the exchange of ideas among scientists with diverse backgrounds, expertise, and interests. These range from the areas of biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology to biophysics, physics, and instrumentation, as well as theoretical biology and mathematical modeling. Discussion leaders help to integrate the various presentations into cohesive themes and speakers are asked to provide basic background information to enable those in other disciplines to understand the material. Ample time for general discussion at the end of each session typically leads to a lively exchange of ideas and provides topics of conversation for poster sessions and mealtimes. A priority is also placed on facilitating the participation of young scientists, not only junior faculty members, but also postdocs and graduate students. This has been accomplished both by providing supplemental funding (for 11 students and 14 postdocs in 2000) and, starting with the 2000 conference, by establishing a session of "poster flashes" in which junior attendees are invited to make a brief oral presentation to promote interest in their posters. The conference has consistently received high ratings in surveys completed by the participants and attendance has been steadily increasing.</AbstractNarration>
