    <AbstractNarration>0124121&lt;br/&gt;Neuberger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a conference on Variational Methods: Open &lt;br/&gt;Problems, Recent Progress, and Numerical Investigations to be held &lt;br/&gt;June 11-14, 2001 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona. &lt;br/&gt;The term Variational Methods in the title refers to a rich area of partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations and a family of methods historically used to &lt;br/&gt;investigate them. Many famous mathematicians have made significant &lt;br/&gt;contributions in the last century to this area, but it is widely held that the &lt;br/&gt;time is ripe for a new round of discoveries to be made. Solutions of these &lt;br/&gt;problems typically rely on tools from a wide range of mathematical &lt;br/&gt;areas and potentially have a significant impact on the study of important &lt;br/&gt;physical applications. The purpose of this conference is to assemble as &lt;br/&gt;many experts as is possible in this research area, in order to discuss and &lt;br/&gt;catalog the area's most important open (unsolved) problems and the &lt;br/&gt;methods that might be used to attack them. Numerical investigations &lt;br/&gt;(using a computer to visualize and approximate solutions and their &lt;br/&gt;properties) are gaining respect in the mathematical community, but their &lt;br/&gt;power is not yet fully appreciated by many in the established research &lt;br/&gt;world, nor are they yet accessible to many of those who do appreciate &lt;br/&gt;that power. This modern approach will be integrated with traditional &lt;br/&gt;(non computer-related) discussions via numerical lectures and hands-on &lt;br/&gt;technological demonstrations. Special attention will be given to physical &lt;br/&gt;applications, in order to facilitate our contributing to real-world science &lt;br/&gt;and to provide a source of renewed inspiration for our endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The driving force for this conference is a desire to produce a highly &lt;br/&gt;usable, in fact essential, reference for those actively researching in the &lt;br/&gt;area and for young mathematicians just starting their careers. Both &lt;br/&gt;groups will benefit greatly from having a single succinct catalog of good &lt;br/&gt;research problems together with an introduction to the most fruitful &lt;br/&gt;relevant mathematical tools and an exhaustive bibliography. A publisher &lt;br/&gt;(American Mathematical Society Journal of Contemporary &lt;br/&gt;Mathematics) has already provisionally accepted a proposal for &lt;br/&gt;publishing this document. The conference will encourage informal &lt;br/&gt;discussion about the future of our field, the potential for it to make &lt;br/&gt;significant contributions to the sciences, and how best to put all this &lt;br/&gt;information in a single proceedings volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the discussed research will be on nonlinear elliptic partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations, a key application of variational methods. &lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear equations in general are vital to the description of physical &lt;br/&gt;phenomena, and elliptic equations describe (roughly speaking) one third &lt;br/&gt;of these. The efficient harvesting of biological mass, modeling of star &lt;br/&gt;birth and death, and the fundamental equations governing quantum &lt;br/&gt;physics all rely on elliptic equations. Significant progress in this research &lt;br/&gt;area has the potential to make a real difference, scientifically and &lt;br/&gt;economically, to the world at large. The aim is to trigger a vibrant &lt;br/&gt;renewed surge of interest and effort towards solving these types of &lt;br/&gt;problems. The conference and corresponding proceedings volume will &lt;br/&gt;be of equal parts research and educationally oriented. Beginning &lt;br/&gt;researchers will be exposed to research in mathematics to the physical &lt;br/&gt;importance of the field, unsolved problems will be suggested for their &lt;br/&gt;pursuit, and analytical and numerical tools essential to that research will &lt;br/&gt;be introduced. These new researchers who attend or, more generally, &lt;br/&gt;have access to the resulting proceedings volume, will in the long run be &lt;br/&gt;the key contributors. The aim is to encourage informal discussion, where &lt;br/&gt;real mathematics is done, but guide the process with a focus on the &lt;br/&gt;ultimate goal of producing a cohesive document.</AbstractNarration>
