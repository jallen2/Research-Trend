    <AbstractNarration>Arizona State University College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS)&lt;br/&gt;NSF CEAS Collaborative Interdisciplinary Research Community (CIRC)&lt;br/&gt;Scholars Program&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project provides 40 scholarships to talented low-income students majoring in computer science and engineering. The program called the Collaborative Interdisciplinary Research Community (CIRC) Scholars Program, includes a CIRC Academic Enrichment Program and the Research Orientation Workshops (ROW) Program. This project enables ASU to recruit and to retain high quality students with financial need who, without this support, might not be able to continue their education on a full time basis. The focus of the recruitment is on students of junior or higher standing and transfer students, but also includes some sophomores and some graduate students with special financial needs. Underrepresented minority students in computer science and engineering (African American, Hispanic, Native American, and women) are especially recruited for these scholarships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) at ASU has a well, established infrastructure to support the project. Key to the support of the scholars, is the requirement to participate in an Academic Enrichment Program that includes workshops on study skills and close mentoring and monitoring by ASU staff and faculty, as well as the Research Orientation Workshops (ROW) Program, which concentrates on research and graduate school. Scholars are also offered the opportunity to participate in one of ASU's high profile research groups in the CEAS.&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NO.:&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME:&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:&lt;br/&gt;NSF RECEIVED DATE:&lt;br/&gt;0123146&lt;br/&gt;Anderson-Rowland, Mary&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;Department of Collaborative Interdisciplinary Research Community (CIRC)&lt;br/&gt;05/01/2001</AbstractNarration>
