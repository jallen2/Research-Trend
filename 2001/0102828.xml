    <AbstractNarration>Nationwide statistics show marked under-representation of minority students attending &lt;br/&gt;graduate schools or pursuing careers in the areas of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;(SEM). HBCU's are in the most ideal situation to provide solutions to this problem. &lt;br/&gt;Universities like Kentucky State University must make every effort to recruit, retain,&lt;br/&gt;and graduate minoritySEM students and subsequently enable them to attend graduate &lt;br/&gt;school. Unfortunately, enrollmentin SEM disciplines is declining rather than growing. &lt;br/&gt;Therefore, Kentucky State University is submitting a proposal to the NSF HBCU-UP &lt;br/&gt;initiative designed to increase enrollment of minoritystudents in SEM areas and &lt;br/&gt;enhance their preparedness for graduate school success. Teams Enhancing Access for &lt;br/&gt;Minorities in Science (TEAMS) is a comprehensive program designed to prepare young &lt;br/&gt;minority students for entry into careers in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics &lt;br/&gt;(SEM) fields. The first phase of the program is a summer Undergraduate Bridge&lt;br/&gt;Program for rising high school seniors and graduates. Once students matriculate at &lt;br/&gt;Kentucky State University, they will proceed as TEAMS through several phases of &lt;br/&gt;their undergraduate academic program culminating with an intensive Graduate Bridge&lt;br/&gt;Program in preparation for graduate school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of TEAMS is to increase the number of qualified minority students &lt;br/&gt;entering graduate schools in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics and to provide&lt;br/&gt;them with academic experiences and research opportunities which will increase &lt;br/&gt;their participation in graduate schools and their degree of successful completion&lt;br/&gt; of graduate endeavors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of the TEAMS Program will include: &lt;br/&gt;- Providing a conduit that will facilitate the entry of high potential minority high &lt;br/&gt;school students into Kentucky State University through an Undergraduate Bridge&lt;br/&gt;Program that will support andprepare high school students to reach above average &lt;br/&gt;achievement in undergraduate studies in SEM courses. &lt;br/&gt;-Providing students with a curriculum that will challenge them in a manner that is&lt;br/&gt; appropriate for developing the content and skills in subject areas pertinent to &lt;br/&gt;graduatestudies in SEM. &lt;br/&gt;-Establishing Excel Study/Research Teams that will prepare students in content,&lt;br/&gt; problem-solving skills, and cooperative and investigative approaches to learning. &lt;br/&gt;-Establishing a Graduate Bridge Program that will promote readiness for and an &lt;br/&gt;awareness of the expectations of graduate studies by providing students with first&lt;br/&gt;hand experiences in various aspects of research. &lt;br/&gt;-Providing faculty development activities, such as workshops, seminars, institutes,&lt;br/&gt;and conferences on innovative teaching strategies, including inquiry-based teaching &lt;br/&gt;and learning, collaborative learning, and interdisciplinary approaches.</AbstractNarration>
