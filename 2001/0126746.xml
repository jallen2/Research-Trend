    <AbstractNarration>0126746&lt;br/&gt;Ball&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications &lt;br/&gt;(IWOTA) has been held biannually since 1981 and more frequently in &lt;br/&gt;recent years (starting in 1995) in eight countries in North America, Europe &lt;br/&gt;and Asia. The IWOTA conferences offer a rich program on a wide range &lt;br/&gt;of the latest developments in operator theory and its applications. In a &lt;br/&gt;combination of plenary lectures by eminent mathematicians and parallel &lt;br/&gt;sessions of invited and contributed talks, the plan is for this year's &lt;br/&gt;conference (to be held August 6-9, 2002 on the Virginia Tech campus in &lt;br/&gt;Blacksburg, Virginia) to cover a wide range of topics, including &lt;br/&gt;operator/system theory, operator/scattering theory, operator &lt;br/&gt;theory/numerical analysis, operator theory/wavelets and signal processing, &lt;br/&gt;operator theory/harmonic analysis as well as topics in Krein space &lt;br/&gt;operator theory and core engineering. These topics form a core of the &lt;br/&gt;basic science behind a variety of applications, including control of &lt;br/&gt;industrial processes or high performance aircraft, tomography and image &lt;br/&gt;reconstruction, pulse propagation in optical fibers, seismology, data &lt;br/&gt;compression and reconstruction, and identification of only approximately &lt;br/&gt;known parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original concept of IWOTA was as a satellite conference for operator &lt;br/&gt;theorists to the broader based international symposium on Mathematical &lt;br/&gt;Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS), to be held August 12-16, 2002 &lt;br/&gt;at the University of Notre Dame. While this concept is still in place, the &lt;br/&gt;scope of IWOTA has broadened considerably in recent years and IWOTA &lt;br/&gt;has now attained an independent identity as a world-wide conference for &lt;br/&gt;recent developments in core operator theory and its applications. IWOTA's &lt;br/&gt;primary objective is to bring together major researchers in the area of &lt;br/&gt;operator theory and related fields. These meetings provide opportunities &lt;br/&gt;for all participants to present their own work in contributed talks, to &lt;br/&gt;interact with other researchers from around the globe, and to broaden their &lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the field by hearing the invited lectures of eminent &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians. In addition IWOTA emphasizes cross-disciplinary &lt;br/&gt;interaction among mathematicians, electrical engineers and mathematical &lt;br/&gt;physicists, and encourages participants to continue on to the MTNS &lt;br/&gt;conference for a further broader interdisciplinary interaction. In addition, &lt;br/&gt;IWOTA encourages and financially supports the participation of young &lt;br/&gt;researchers, i.e., advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients, &lt;br/&gt;for whom the opportunities offered by expert conferences are particularly &lt;br/&gt;important</AbstractNarration>
