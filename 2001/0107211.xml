    <AbstractNarration>This is funding to subsidize the expenses of graduate students participating in the doctoral consortium immediately preceding the Fourth International Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM'2001), to be held July 26-28, 2001 in Fairfax, VA. Computational modeling has emerged as a central, but complex and sometimes fractionated, theme in research on cognition. The ICCM conferences provide a unique worldwide forum where researchers from diverse backgrounds come together to compare cognitive models, to evaluate models using human data, and to further the development, accumulation and integration of cognitive theory. ICCM-2001 will be the first of these important events to take place outside of Europe. Attending the conference and participating in the doctoral consortium which precedes it will enable the students to present their work to and receive feedback from the scientific community, will help them develop a supportive community, and will foster interaction with and mentoring by senior researchers. The students will be selected by a committee, with special consideration to be given to students from under-represented groups and from institutions where cognitive modeling is not a strength.</AbstractNarration>
