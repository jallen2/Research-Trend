    <AbstractNarration>Embedded software is ubiquitous: it is present in a vast array of everyday products and appliances, and it accounts for an increasing share of the functionality and development cost of systems such as cars and aircrafts. Innovation in many fields, from transportation to military, from consumer products to manufacturing, is increasingly dependent on our ability to design ever more sophisticated embedded systems.&lt;br/&gt;Yet, the sophistication and complexity of embedded software is fast approaching the limit of current design abilities. This project aims at developing a formal approach to embedded software design that copes with complexity through the exploitation of design structure, and in particular, of modularity (the ability to assemble a system from components) and hierarchy (the ability to implement a complex component as a collection of simpler components).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is articulated in three directions. The first project direction focuses on methods and tools&lt;br/&gt;for ensuring that the components used in a design are compatible one with the other. This helps to avoid bugs stemming from the interaction of multiple components, which are often among the hardest to prevent and detect. The project develops theories of component interfaces that captures the protocol, timing, and performance aspects of the interaction among embedded software components. The resulting interface theories constitute an extended type system that encompasses not only the values passed as inputs and outputs, but&lt;br/&gt;also the dynamic behavior of the components, enabling to check at design time whether the components interact in a compatible way. The second project direction investigates methods for deriving the performance and reliability of a system from that of its components. In parallel to this modular approach to analysis, this project direction will pursue a modular approach to debugging, in which the components are analyzed in isolation, and the results are used to guide the simulation of the entire system. Finally, as embedded systems are often used as controllers of a device or physical system, the third project direction proposes the use of&lt;br/&gt;multi-modal stochastic systems, a model that supports in an integrated fashion system identification, controller design, and code generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to direct student involvement in the proposed research, the educational component of this proposal consists in the development of two courses: Introduction to systems engineering, and real-time embedded software. The first course will introduce students to a structured, model-based approach to system design; the second will present the techniques and challenges of real-time embedded software development. These courses will be informed by the philosophy that structure, in terms of composition and hierarchy, is the key to the design of complex systems, and that models are the basis of reasoning about systems. This model-based, structure-oriented approach is an innovative element in the curriculum generally available in Computer Engineering and Computer Science departments. The courses will play a pivotal role in the planned growth of the Software Engineering discipline at UC Santa Cruz.</AbstractNarration>
