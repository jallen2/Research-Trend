    <AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to design and establish a research-integrated education program for machining difficult-to-machine materials. Machining difficult-to-machine ceramics, superalloys, and composites presents numerous challenges. Structural ceramics such as silicon nitride are finding applications in aerospace, automobile, and related industries. However, machining these materials is expensive and can induce subsurface cracks that compromise the strength of the material. The research objective is to develop novel laser integrated cutting tools that will be used for cost-effective machining of structural ceramics that is insensitive to part quantity and geometric shapes. Temperature monitoring capability will be built into the cutting tool to provide feedback for process control during machining. Micromechanical simulation of the machining process will be developed for producing ceramic components with minimal subsurface cracks. The educational components will address the specific educational needs of various sectors of the community through innovative means such as a new multifunctional laboratory for undergraduate and graduate students and area K-12 students and teachers. Integration of research and cooperative learning and effective assessment techniques will form a dynamic learning environment for undergraduate and graduate students. Short courses in machining difficult-to-machine materials will be developed for non-traditional students from industry who want to keep current with the new technologies being developed in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact of this project includes new cutting tools for machining difficult-to-machine materials, new scientific knowledge on thermally assisted machining processes, and the creation of a world-class workforce in the area of machining structural ceramics.</AbstractNarration>
