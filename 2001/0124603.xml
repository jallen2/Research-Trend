    <AbstractNarration>Duennebier&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0124603&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Funds are requested for the design, construction and testing of a small experiment module (SEM) for use in ocean bottom observatories. The purpose of this module is to reduce the effort necessary to conduct relatively simple observatory experiments at the ocean floor. Ocean bottom observatories will soon be providing opportunities for investigators to conduct scientific investigations using power from the observatory and transmitting data to shore through the observatory. The interface between the observatory and the scientist's sensors is intimidating for many investigators, requiring consideration of sampling, filtering, digitizing, timing, power, and data formatting, as well as construction of sophisticated electronics, pressure vessels, buoyancy devices, and related hardware. The proposed module will greatly simplify this task, allowing investigators to concentrate on their science, rather than on engineering. While those investigators with engineering expertise available will not necessarily need such an interface, the installation of relatively simple experiments coupled to a SEM will be far less complicated, making it easier and more cost effective for many to participate in observatory science. We envision a package similar to the SEM available at nearly every science node of major ocean bottom observatories. The prototype proposed here should point out any shortcomings in our conceptual design for such a device, and establish its usefulness to the community.&lt;br/&gt; The prototype of this package will include ports for connection of up to twelve sensors, including an absolute pressure sensor for tsunami detection. It is proposed that the first SEM at the Hawaii-2 Observatory will be installed during the next visit to the site in 2002 or 2003. Future versions of the SEM can be modified to the needs of a particular observatory.</AbstractNarration>
