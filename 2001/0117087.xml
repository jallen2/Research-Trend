    <AbstractNarration>The relationship between identity and territory has been largely ignored, yet is of profound and growing significance in the globalizing world. With international boundaries becoming more porous and an increasing number of people residing in locations away from their traditional homelands, a fundamental question arises as to the importance of the 'tether' between identity and territory. This question is most readily addressed by examining the de- and re-territorialization of identity within a group living in diaspora during a period of repatriation. The Mongolian-Kazakhs represent such a group, with a series of additionally salient characteristics. First, the Kazakhs of Mongolia have lived outside of their native homeland for more than 70 years, following their ancestors' flight from the collectivization campaigns of the Stalinist era. Second, the Kazakh ethnic group has only recently begun to nationalize within the Soviet-constructed homeland of what has become the Republic of Kazakhstan. Third, the sudden independence of Kazakhstan and the government's active repatriation campaign provide an historical opportunity to investigate the loss and reacquisition of territorial identity through the formation of homeland conceptions and their often-controversial consideration by Kazakhs within and outside of Kazakhstan. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine those Mongolian-Kazakhs opting for repatriation to Kazakhstan, those opting to remain in Mongolia, and those opting to return to Mongolia after an attempted repatriation. This project will combine surveys, in-depth interviews, and archival research methods to triangulate data on this complex and highly subjective topic. Fieldwork will be carried out in Mongolia and Kazakhstan using local sociological institutes for assistance with surveys and in-depth interviews. This comparative structure will provide a clear picture of the ways in which identity and territory are constructed and mutually constituted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terms "de-territorialization" and "re-territorialization" of identity are employed to extend scholarly understanding of the multifaceted relationships between diverse concepts such as territoriality, identity formation, place attachment, and homeland psychology. Literature from a wide array of disciplines will be employed in the theoretical exploration of the topic. This exploration of place making as integral to identity formation will help advance geographic theory and social theory in general. The fundamental questions addressed in this research of how people develop and sustain their attachments to place, and the degree to which our conception of 'where we belong' informs our sense of 'who we are' is a critical topic that has long been ignored. By advancing the theoretical literature pertaining to the relationship between territory and identity, this research will provide a framework with application beyond the specific case. The contemporary international system offers many examples of contested notions of homeland and people defined objectively as living 'out of place' but potentially holding self-conceptions of 'rootedness' in their current places of residence. In addition, the case study for this project is significant because the ethno-demographic landscape of Central Asia, especially Kazakhstan, is replete with ethnic diasporas attempting to reassess their 'place in the world'. By elucidating the dynamics of de- and re-territorialization of identity, this project will provide insights that can inform policy formation among the nationalizing states throughout the world. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.</AbstractNarration>
