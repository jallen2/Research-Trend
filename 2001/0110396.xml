    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the mechanisms of stabilization of protein structure represents one of the major&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the protein folding problem. The contributions of various short-range interactions,&lt;br/&gt;such as hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic effect, and configurational entropy, to protein&lt;br/&gt;stability have been well documented. However, it is becoming more and more evident that the&lt;br/&gt;long-range electrostatic interactions between charged protein groups are also important&lt;br/&gt;contributors to protein structure and stability. The proposed work has an overall goal to explore&lt;br/&gt;the relation between the charge-charge interactions on the protein surface and the protein&lt;br/&gt;stability by engineering a thermostable protein by redesigning the charge-charge interactions on the&lt;br/&gt;protein surface, and analyzing the optimized charge-charge interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical part of the work is based on the calculation of the charge-charge&lt;br/&gt;interactions in proteins using Tanford-Kirkwood approach with Bashford-Karplus approximation&lt;br/&gt;(TK-BK procedure). The experimental measurement of the stabilities of the protein variants&lt;br/&gt;designed using TK-BK predictions will be done using differential scanning calorimetry, or using&lt;br/&gt;chemical (urea) induced denaturation monitored by the changes in the circular dichroism or&lt;br/&gt;fluorescence intensity properties. The fundamental importance of this research is that&lt;br/&gt;using a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between charge-charge interactions and the protein stability will be explored. From the practical&lt;br/&gt;point this research will provide the foundation for the design of proteins stable at extreme&lt;br/&gt;temperatures. This will benefit the industrial use of proteins where thermostability of enzymes is&lt;br/&gt;in many cases the largest obstacle.</AbstractNarration>
