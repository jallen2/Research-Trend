    <AbstractNarration>Piezoelectric thin films are attractive elements in several MEMS applications due to &lt;br/&gt;the large generated force, high electromechanical coupling coefficients, and &lt;br/&gt;substantial charge output that can be generated. This proposal focuses on two &lt;br/&gt;approaches to increasing the performance in piezoelectric MEMS devices: (i) enhancing &lt;br/&gt;the effective piezoelectric response in thin ferroelectric films utilizing in-plane &lt;br/&gt;poled structures and (ii) developing miniaturized flextensional transducers to amplify &lt;br/&gt;the piezoelectric effect. From the scientific standpoint, the program will determine &lt;br/&gt;how the piezoelectric properties of in-plane polarized lead zirconate titanate films &lt;br/&gt;compare to through-the-thickness polarized transducers, as well as any differences in &lt;br/&gt;the way piezoelectric and dielectric properties age and fatigue relative to &lt;br/&gt;conventionally poled films. A processing scheme to enable production of flextionsional &lt;br/&gt;MEMS transducers will also be developed. In addition, a MEMS switch for RF applications &lt;br/&gt;with large displacement (~2 microns) and high-speed (&lt;1microsecond) will be &lt;br/&gt;demonstrated using the d33 coefficient and a flextensional actuation mechanism. The &lt;br/&gt;educational aspects of this program will concentrate on training graduate as well as &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate researchers. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are miniaturized devices produced with the same &lt;br/&gt;techniques developed for integrated circuits, and typically range from several microns &lt;br/&gt;to several millimeters in size. Such devices are now widely used in ink jet printers &lt;br/&gt;and automobile air bag deployment accelerometers. Many fields, including miniaturized &lt;br/&gt;biomedical instrumentation for bedside diagnosis, commercial electronics such as cell &lt;br/&gt;phones, and small sensors to detect phenomena as diverse as toxic gases or the imminent &lt;br/&gt;failure of a piece of industrial equipment would benefit from MEMS devices with higher &lt;br/&gt;sensitivities or with the capability of doing more work. This program is designed to &lt;br/&gt;increase the functionality of MEMS systems by exploring the integration of high &lt;br/&gt;performance ferroelectric thin films with motion amplification. This program will also &lt;br/&gt;train and educate scientists in an interdisciplinary research environment in a &lt;br/&gt;technologically-significant area of national importance.</AbstractNarration>
