    <AbstractNarration>Robust Limited Memory Hybrid Sparse Solvers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sparse linear solvers can be broadly classified as being either 'direct' or 'iterative.' Direct solvers are based&lt;br/&gt;on a factorization of the associated sparse matrix and are extremely robust. However, their memory requirements grow as a non-linear function of the matrix dimension because original zeroes fill-in during factorization.&lt;br/&gt;The Krylov subspace (KSP) family of iterative methods are memory scalable, but their convergence&lt;br/&gt;can be slow or fail altogether. This project concerns developing scalable hybrids than can be parameterized&lt;br/&gt;to model the range from pure iterative to pure direct methods. We propose to develop parallel algorithms&lt;br/&gt;and software engineering methods aimed at providing robust, limited memory hybrid solvers that satisfy the&lt;br/&gt;computational demands of a variety of applications.&lt;br/&gt;On the algorithmic front, our focus is on hybrids obtained by preconditioning KSP solvers using suitable&lt;br/&gt;incomplete matrix factors. Such preconditioners are robust and widely applicable, but until recently they&lt;br/&gt;were considered unsuitable for parallel computing. The main reason is that the sparse triangular solves for&lt;br/&gt;applying the preconditioner become a bottleneck due to the relatively high latency of communication. We&lt;br/&gt;have recently developed a latency tolerant 'selective-inversion' scheme that overcomes this problem to yield&lt;br/&gt;an efficient and scalable implementation. In this project, we propose developing parallel sparse factorization&lt;br/&gt;techniques that are efficient for the entire spectrum of fill-in. We will develop a new 'supernodal diagonal&lt;br/&gt;row block' formulation for scalable incomplete factorization. We will also consider innovative ways of&lt;br/&gt;combining symbolic (level of fill) and numeric (threshold) strategies to specify fill-in to be either retained&lt;br/&gt;or discarded. Additionally, our algorithmic framework enables us to provide a single, unified, extensible&lt;br/&gt;implementation of hybrids for symmetric positive definite, symmetric indefinite, and nonsymmetric systems.&lt;br/&gt;On the software front, we define a new 'usage model' based 'reverse engineering' process to develop a high-performance domain specific solver as a smart composite of several methods. Our premise is that the right composite solver is domain specific; substantial performance gains can be realized by selecting the right combination of underlying methods to match linear system attributes. We will obtain a uniform interface to a variety of parallel sparse solver software by developing an object-oriented sparse template library that utilizes parameterized polymorphism. Composites will be instantiated by using this template library and a scripting language that supports parallel computing using MPI.&lt;br/&gt;Our design goals and performance targets will be keyed to three large-scale computational science applications. The first concerns computational methods for advanced optimization; this application requires robust indefinite solvers. The second is a structural mechanics application for modeling cracks and fractures. The third application involves large sparse eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum molecular dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Our project represents a concerted effort to resolve critical research issues in the area of parallel sparse&lt;br/&gt;matrix computations. Our goal is to develop the next generation of sparse solvers by combining research in&lt;br/&gt;parallel algorithms and software engineering.</AbstractNarration>
