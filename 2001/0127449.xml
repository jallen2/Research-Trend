    <AbstractNarration>Economics (82)&lt;br/&gt;Economics students enrolled in large lecture-based introductory courses rarely have the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to interact with course content. Because of this they do not gain a deep&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the material or the ability to analyze and interpret complex economic&lt;br/&gt;events. Classroom experiments have been shown to be useful in aiding student&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the material. In the past these exercises have been impractical in large&lt;br/&gt;courses. This project is developing wireless classroom technology to allow students in&lt;br/&gt;large classes to participate in classroom experiments during the class meeting times. We&lt;br/&gt;have assembled a cross-disciplinary group that is creating a learning system that is making it &lt;br/&gt;possible to realize the benefits of classroom experiments in large classes. Our vision is of a&lt;br/&gt;portable system composed of standard electronic handheld devices (such as PDAs) that&lt;br/&gt;communicate with a laptop computer that will organize economics simulations such as&lt;br/&gt;markets, public goods environments and economic games. While other researchers are&lt;br/&gt;currently working on internet-based experiments, such systems do not translate to large&lt;br/&gt;classes unless students complete the exercise asynchronously. The instructor has only&lt;br/&gt;very limited ability to revise the game in response to student questions or suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation is a critical component of this project. We have designed a controlled&lt;br/&gt;experiment to collect data on performance in a large lecture course. We are evaluating&lt;br/&gt;to what extent this wireless system can improve student outcomes and reduce costs.</AbstractNarration>
