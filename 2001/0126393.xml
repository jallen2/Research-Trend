    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;Carroll College, Wisconsin's oldest institution of higher education, is adapting an effective model of core curriculum reform for the liberal arts setting. We are modeling our curriculum reform efforts after a successful program developed at the California State University at Fullerton. Our initial efforts at curriculum revision resulted in substantive changes to the content presented in the four core courses, but did not impact how that content was delivered. As outlined in this proposal, our efforts at curriculum reform now center on three objectives for enhanced student learning: 1) strengthening the investigatory skills of students, 2) modeling the integration of biological fields, and 3) developing and implementing multi-level assessment strategies that validate practice and identify areas for growth. This project supports faculty development to help coordinate our teaching efforts, enhance our expertise with particularly effective pedagogical strategies, and measure the effectiveness of our curriculum. Students are using essential equipment including mobile workstations in a series of integrated investigations designed to develop research skills incrementally while also demonstrating the connections between multiple levels of biological inquiry. Our ultimate goal in this phase of curricular reform is to enhance student learning by creating an assessment-driven core curriculum. The outcome of our project is students who more successfully retain basic concepts in upper-division courses and who approach their senior research project with a solid foundation in how to ask and answer biological questions. Secondary biology education students are integrated into our teaching collaboratives, enhancing their professional preparation. We are also improving the teaching skills of faculty in the biology department, with reform spreading to other members of the Science Division, other Carroll faculty members, and local high school and college science teachers who participate in faculty development opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
