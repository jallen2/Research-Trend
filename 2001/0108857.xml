    <AbstractNarration>Rubin&lt;br/&gt;0108857&lt;br/&gt; This investigator develops and applies mathematical&lt;br/&gt;techniques for the study of activity patterns in&lt;br/&gt;conductance-based neuronal network models incorporating features,&lt;br/&gt;such as continuous coupling, diffusive interactions, and&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity in parameter values, that have largely been&lt;br/&gt;neglected in previous mathematical work on these systems. Many&lt;br/&gt;of the mathematical results relate to the derivation and&lt;br/&gt;subsequent analysis of subsystems of equations capturing dynamics&lt;br/&gt;on disparate time scales. One challenge in this endeavor is that&lt;br/&gt;the additional features considered prevent the application of&lt;br/&gt;known methods that could otherwise be used to reduce the&lt;br/&gt;subsystem sizes and thereby facilitate analysis. The particular&lt;br/&gt;activity patterns that are investigated are sustained, localized&lt;br/&gt;activity of cell populations in the thalamus involved in sleep&lt;br/&gt;rhythms and in tracking head direction; wave propagation, block,&lt;br/&gt;and reflection in inhomogeneous neuronal media such as branching,&lt;br/&gt;thickening, or damaged neurons; and periodic and chaotic&lt;br/&gt;oscillations in a heterogeneous population of respiratory&lt;br/&gt;pacemaker cells in the brain stem. While this work is motivated&lt;br/&gt;by particular neuronal systems, it provides new steps in&lt;br/&gt;directions with broad relevance. Thus, the results of this&lt;br/&gt;project yield insight into pattern formation and selection&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms that apply in specific neuronal contexts but that also&lt;br/&gt;constitute more generally occurring phenomena.&lt;br/&gt; Neuronal networks of the central nervous system can&lt;br/&gt;typically display multiple types of rhythmic activity, ranging&lt;br/&gt;from periodic bursts of synchronized oscillations to traveling&lt;br/&gt;waves of activity to more disorganized patterns. Many of these&lt;br/&gt;forms of activity appear to be relevant to fundamental neuronal&lt;br/&gt;processes. The overall goal of the investigator is to study&lt;br/&gt;mathematically the oscillatory population rhythms and wave&lt;br/&gt;propagation arising in certain models of neuronal networks, based&lt;br/&gt;on systems involved in such disparate tasks as navigation,&lt;br/&gt;respiration, and the generation of sleep rhythms. This work&lt;br/&gt;elucidates the mechanisms that allow these networks to support,&lt;br/&gt;and to modulate between, distinct activity patterns. These&lt;br/&gt;results lead to conclusions about the roles of various&lt;br/&gt;biophysical parameters in shaping network dynamics, with&lt;br/&gt;individual contributions teased apart in a way that may be quite&lt;br/&gt;difficult to achieve with a purely experimental approach. Such&lt;br/&gt;findings can then serve as guideposts for future biological and&lt;br/&gt;computational experiments.</AbstractNarration>
