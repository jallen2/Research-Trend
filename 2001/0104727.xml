    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0104727&lt;br/&gt;Grigory Mikhalkin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study complex and real algebraic&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces from a topological perspective. In&lt;br/&gt;particular it will study the interrelation of their&lt;br/&gt;topological and algebraic properties. This subject&lt;br/&gt;recently got a new powerful tool, the so-called&lt;br/&gt;theory of amoebas. Mikhalkin will work on further&lt;br/&gt;developing this theory and will make use of amoebas&lt;br/&gt;for investigating algebraic varieties. Amoebas have&lt;br/&gt;already proved to be an extremely useful tool in&lt;br/&gt;several areas of Mathematics, including Algebraic&lt;br/&gt;Geometry, Topology and Complex Analysis. Earlier&lt;br/&gt;Mikhalkin used this tool in the proof of topological&lt;br/&gt;uniqueness of maximal arrangements of plane real&lt;br/&gt;algebraic curves (in the context of Hilbert's 16th&lt;br/&gt;problem). A part of the project is to obtain a&lt;br/&gt;generalization of this result in higher dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;The other part of the project is based on the same&lt;br/&gt;technique but will investigate complex algebraic&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces by constructing and analyzing certain&lt;br/&gt;singular Lagrangian fibrations over PL-complexes.&lt;br/&gt;Such fibrations give a hope to extract topology&lt;br/&gt;hidden in the Hodge structure of algebraic varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic varieties and, in particular, real algebraic&lt;br/&gt;varieties are fundamental mathematical objects naturally&lt;br/&gt;occuring in modern-day Physics, Optics, Mechanics and&lt;br/&gt;Robotics. For instance, all possible positions of a&lt;br/&gt;mechanical linkage (e.g. an arm of a robot) form a real&lt;br/&gt;algebraic variety. The question of topological classification&lt;br/&gt;of plane real algebraic curves (1-dimensional varieties)&lt;br/&gt;posed by Hilbert over 100 years ago is still open. A&lt;br/&gt;recent advance by Mikhalkin in this problem relied on&lt;br/&gt;a new mathematical notion, that of amoeba, introduced&lt;br/&gt;by Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinski. Algebraic amoebas&lt;br/&gt;are regions in space which are associated to varieties.&lt;br/&gt;These concave regions with "tentacles" and "vacuoles"&lt;br/&gt;resemble in shape biological amoebas.</AbstractNarration>
