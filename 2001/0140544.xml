    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies conditions under which systems of &lt;br/&gt;homogeneous polynomials in many variables have nontrivial zeros in p-adic &lt;br/&gt;completions of the rational numbers. A conjecture usually attributed to &lt;br/&gt;Artin states that if the coefficients of the polynomials are all integers, &lt;br/&gt;then such zeros exist in all p-adic completions provided that the number &lt;br/&gt;of variables is large enough when compared to the degrees of the &lt;br/&gt;polynomials, and gives a bound on the required number of variables. While &lt;br/&gt;the first part of this conjecture has been shown to be correct, the &lt;br/&gt;conjectured bound is false in general. However, the bound is correct if &lt;br/&gt;the prime p is sufficiently large. This leads to the questions of what &lt;br/&gt;the correct general bound should be and also how large the prime p needs &lt;br/&gt;to be for Artin's bound to hold. The investigator studies these questions &lt;br/&gt;in general, and also when the polynomials are restricted to being additive &lt;br/&gt;(i.e. having no cross-terms). These questions are studied both when the &lt;br/&gt;degrees of the polynomials are all equal and when they may vary, and are &lt;br/&gt;also studied in the more general setting where the p-adic completions of &lt;br/&gt;the rational numbers are replaced by extensions of these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Since the time of the ancient Greeks, a fundamental question in &lt;br/&gt;number theory has been to find solutions of (systems of) equations in &lt;br/&gt;which all of the variables are integers. When attempting to show that &lt;br/&gt;such solutions exist, it is often first necessary to obtain information &lt;br/&gt;about the so-called "local" solutions. These are solutions in the number &lt;br/&gt;systems of "p-adic integers," where p may be any prime number. In fact, &lt;br/&gt;it turns out that if there is even one prime p for which the system does &lt;br/&gt;not have a solution in p-adic integers, then it has no solutions in &lt;br/&gt;ordinary integers either. There are also some special situations in which &lt;br/&gt;the converse holds: if the system has solutions in p-adic integers for &lt;br/&gt;every prime p, then it automatically has a solution in regular integers. &lt;br/&gt;Hence it is an interesting problem to attempt to determine when equations &lt;br/&gt;have p-adic solutions. Such questions are also interesting apart from &lt;br/&gt;their connection to integral solutions of equations, since they provide &lt;br/&gt;insight into the nature of p-adic numbers, and how they differ from &lt;br/&gt;ordinary real numbers.</AbstractNarration>
