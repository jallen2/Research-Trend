    <AbstractNarration>The global theory of minimal surfaces in space is in a phase of&lt;br/&gt;explosive growth. Many new methods of constructing complete&lt;br/&gt;embedded minimal surfaces have recently been found; in place of a&lt;br/&gt;dearth of examples just a few years ago, we now have a quite&lt;br/&gt;varied collection of surfaces, including infinite families. A&lt;br/&gt;basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them&lt;br/&gt;into families with common properties and understood&lt;br/&gt;limits. Fruitful approaches have recently been developed that&lt;br/&gt;combine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of&lt;br/&gt;geometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis,&lt;br/&gt;notably Teichmuller theory. Some of the problems the team will&lt;br/&gt;attack are: Are there embedded minimal surfaces with one&lt;br/&gt;heliciodal end and arbitrary genus? Is the classical Scherk&lt;br/&gt;surface the unique desingularization of a pair of planes? Of&lt;br/&gt;what families is the Scherk surface the limit point? At the same&lt;br/&gt;time, the group hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of Weierstrass&lt;br/&gt;representations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible, fully&lt;br/&gt;documented, and useful as a research tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to&lt;br/&gt;biochemistry to ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient;&lt;br/&gt;indeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at their&lt;br/&gt;foundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some&lt;br/&gt;or several of its features in the expression we witness. At its&lt;br/&gt;base, this philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we&lt;br/&gt;search for principles in science that can be formulated as&lt;br/&gt;extremal problems. In mathematics, we can make this assumption of&lt;br/&gt;optimality very rigorous by expressing it as an equation. This&lt;br/&gt;leaves us with the problem of understanding all of the solutions&lt;br/&gt;of that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very rich&lt;br/&gt;type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which&lt;br/&gt;is already known to have a number of quite subtle&lt;br/&gt;characteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small&lt;br/&gt;piece has less area than any other surface with the same&lt;br/&gt;boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in&lt;br/&gt;physical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,&lt;br/&gt;the problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating&lt;br/&gt;droplets and soap films by F. Plateau. Today the applications&lt;br/&gt;range from cosmology to the understanding of the structure of&lt;br/&gt;stable periodic structures in compound copolymers. As in many&lt;br/&gt;other optimization problems, for the minimal surface problem, we&lt;br/&gt;do not have much general information about solutions to the&lt;br/&gt;equation expressing extremality. At present though, we do have a&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of examples which help to guide our intuition, and&lt;br/&gt;which we are beginning to organize. It is thus a good model&lt;br/&gt;problem, enriching our understanding of all optimization&lt;br/&gt;problems.</AbstractNarration>
