    <AbstractNarration>This project, which is divided into several parts,&lt;br/&gt;is concerned with several interrelated areas of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry centered around the birational geometry &lt;br/&gt;and the Hodge theory of algebraic varieties. In the first part,&lt;br/&gt;the investigators intend to construct differentials on certain &lt;br/&gt;universal spaces arising in algebraic geometry, and apply these to&lt;br/&gt;the study of algebraic cycles. In the second part&lt;br/&gt;the investigators, in collaboration with D. Abramovich&lt;br/&gt;and K. Karu, intend to extend their previous work to the&lt;br/&gt;prove the strong factorization conjecture for birational maps.&lt;br/&gt;This conjecture says that any birational map between smooth&lt;br/&gt;complete varieties has a particularly simple structure: it&lt;br/&gt;is a sequence blow ups followed by a sequence of blow downs&lt;br/&gt;with smooth centers. In the third part, the investigators&lt;br/&gt;will apply the previously established weak factorization &lt;br/&gt;conjecture to compare the Hodge structure of two birationally &lt;br/&gt;equivalent minimal models. In the fourth part, one of the &lt;br/&gt;investigators intends to extend their previous vanishing&lt;br/&gt;theorems and apply them to the study of birational&lt;br/&gt;invariants. In the fifth part, one of the investigators will &lt;br/&gt;attempt to relate the Hodge theory of higher homotopy groups to &lt;br/&gt;the intersection theory of algebraic cycles. In the&lt;br/&gt;sixth part, one of the investigators intends to study a class &lt;br/&gt;of surface singularities, which are important for birational&lt;br/&gt;geometry, over fields of positive characteristic. In the&lt;br/&gt;sixth and final part, one of the investigators intends to &lt;br/&gt;extend the theory of toroidal embeddings by taking into account&lt;br/&gt;certain stratifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Algebraic varieties are geometric objects which provide a&lt;br/&gt;rich set of models for a number of phenomena within mathematics&lt;br/&gt;as well as in neighboring fields of science such as physics and&lt;br/&gt;computer science. They have the advantage of being describable &lt;br/&gt;in finite terms, as solutions to a finite system of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;equations. However, these descriptions are often complicated and &lt;br/&gt;not unique; deciding when two such descriptions lead to equivalent,&lt;br/&gt;or even approximately equivalent, varieties is very difficult.&lt;br/&gt;Approximate equivalence is made precise by the notion of&lt;br/&gt;birational equivalence. One of the goals of this project is to &lt;br/&gt;study the finer structure of the birational equivalence relation.&lt;br/&gt;Another goal of this project is to introduce and study certain&lt;br/&gt;natural birational invariants, that is, measures&lt;br/&gt;of the geometric complexity of algebraic varieties. Some of&lt;br/&gt;these invariants count the number of harmonic (energy&lt;br/&gt;minimizing) objects associated to the algebraic variety.&lt;br/&gt;These two goals are related since the investigators expect that the&lt;br/&gt;fine structure of the birational maps will yield insights into&lt;br/&gt;the properties of these invariants.</AbstractNarration>
