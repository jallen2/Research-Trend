    <AbstractNarration>CDMA systems have achieved great commercial success in wireless communications since the first&lt;br/&gt;IS-95 system was deployed in Seattle in 1994. In fact, most of the future wireless communication&lt;br/&gt;systems will be using CDMA technology. Yet, as far as reaching the great potential of CDMA in terms&lt;br/&gt;of higher system capacity, lower bit error rate, and lower packet loss rate, the problem of demodulation in&lt;br/&gt;the presence of multiple access interference remains as a significant bottleneck for all CDMA systems.&lt;br/&gt;To solve this multiple access interference problem, researchers and engineers have worked since the early&lt;br/&gt;1980's on so-called multiuser detectors (MUD). Unfortunately, thus far none of the multiuser detectors&lt;br/&gt;has been implemented in a real CDMA system, because of the prohibitive complexity of these structures.&lt;br/&gt; There are two major factors that contribute to this situation. First, CDMA systems must use long&lt;br/&gt;spreading sequences for several practical reasons, whereas multiuser detectors must use short spreading&lt;br/&gt;sequences. Second, the complexity of even the simplest multiuser detector is still too great to be&lt;br/&gt;implemented in the fastest electronics, for all but the smallest of data rates. In this work, we propose to&lt;br/&gt;address both of these problems in a collaborative effort. The collaboration will be organized so that Dr.&lt;br/&gt;Qingchong Liu of Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, will initially focus on the first objective,&lt;br/&gt;and Dr. David W. Matolak of Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, will initially (and concurrently) focus on&lt;br/&gt;the second objective. Results will be exchanged frequently, and meetings will be held quarterly. After&lt;br/&gt;some early progress, our collaboration will grow closer as we combine the work objectives and consider&lt;br/&gt;system (transmitter and receiver) performance.&lt;br/&gt; We propose first to extend some recent results obtained for the construction of long spreading&lt;br/&gt;sequences from short sequences. This can be termed the system objective. These new sequences will&lt;br/&gt;be appropriate for both conventional CDMA systems and for multiuser detectors. This method was&lt;br/&gt;invented by one of us and has been implemented in possibly the fastest wireless network running at&lt;br/&gt;400Mbps in the Spaceway system by Hughes Electronics. It has significantly reduced receiver&lt;br/&gt;complexity and cost, and gives essentially optimum performance. By measuring sequence correlations at&lt;br/&gt;multiple levels, the method provides new insights on sequence design and tremendously reduces&lt;br/&gt;complexity in signal design and detection for broadband wireless communications. This method has the&lt;br/&gt;potential to help bridge a gap between current CDMA systems and multiuser detectors.&lt;br/&gt; We also propose to study reduced complexity multiuser receivers from the perspective of reduced&lt;br/&gt;complexity trellis search techniques, combined with one of the most promising MUD receiver structures,&lt;br/&gt;in a partitioned manner. This can be termed the receiver objective. The MUD receiver of interest is&lt;br/&gt;the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver, which is attractive for its good performance and&lt;br/&gt;modest complexity. The partitioning approach will aim to share the detection tasks between the MMSE&lt;br/&gt;front-end and the reduced-complexity trellis processor. These receivers will make use of the new&lt;br/&gt;spreading sequences specified for use in future 3 rd and 4 th -generation CDMA wireless communication&lt;br/&gt;system standards, and the multiple level sequences developed in the system objective. The reduced&lt;br/&gt;complexity trellis search techniques will explore use of the analogous techniques researched for&lt;br/&gt;equalization, but not fully applied to the problem of CDMA multiuser detection. Our goal for these two&lt;br/&gt;objectives is to create a fundamental bridge to connect the existing and planned CDMA systems with the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical multiuser detectors so that the bottleneck of the multiple access interference problem in&lt;br/&gt;CDMA systems can be surmounted.&lt;br/&gt; Both objectives of this proposed work will employ analysis, followed by computer simulations.&lt;br/&gt;Both objectives will also require the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students. The modeling&lt;br/&gt;work will aim to reconcile theory with practical implementation and thus provide engineering education&lt;br/&gt;in the best sense: connecting principles and practice. Training students in both system design and&lt;br/&gt;receiver design for CDMA will also naturally be valuable to the wireless industry. In addition, the&lt;br/&gt;research will provide material for inclusion in several new graduate courses, and in undergraduate design&lt;br/&gt;projects, at both universities.</AbstractNarration>
