    <AbstractNarration>The proposer intends to continue his study of geometric questions &lt;br/&gt;in the theory of meromorphic functions, using the new techniques &lt;br/&gt;developed in his previous work. The main directions of the &lt;br/&gt;proposed research are the following.&lt;br/&gt;a) Questions related to Bloch's theorem and the Type Problem of&lt;br/&gt;a simply connected Riemann surface, especially the relations&lt;br/&gt;between the conformal type of a surface and its integral curvature.&lt;br/&gt;b) Problems of geometric function theory arising in real algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. More specifically, it includes counting real solutions&lt;br/&gt;of certain systems of algebraic equations of geometric origin, which&lt;br/&gt;have important applications in linear control theory. &lt;br/&gt;c) Generalization of results of geometric function theory to&lt;br/&gt;quasiregular maps in spaces of arbitrary dimension.&lt;br/&gt;d) Normality criteria for families of holomorphic curves in projective&lt;br/&gt;spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the basic questions in mathematics and its applications is&lt;br/&gt;whether a given equation or a system of equations has solutions,&lt;br/&gt;how many, and where are they located. In the theory of meromorphic functions&lt;br/&gt;one studies these questions for equations of the type&lt;br/&gt;f(z)=a, where a is a given complex number and f a given meromorphic function.&lt;br/&gt;The class of meromorphic functions includes elementary functions,&lt;br/&gt;such as rational, exponential and trigonometric ones, as well as the special&lt;br/&gt;functions, a. k. a. higher transcendental functions, such as the&lt;br/&gt;Gamma function, Airy functions, elliptic functions and so on.&lt;br/&gt;Most functions arising in applications of mathematics belong to&lt;br/&gt;this class. In modern mathematics, questions about solvability&lt;br/&gt;of equations are usually formulated in geometric language, which makes&lt;br/&gt;the results appealing to our geometric intuition. &lt;br/&gt;The logic of development of mathematics and its applications&lt;br/&gt;require an extension of results to vector-valued functions known&lt;br/&gt;as ``holomorphic curves''. The proposer plans to continue his study&lt;br/&gt;of geometric theory of meromorphic functions and holomorphic curves.&lt;br/&gt;A part of the proposal is related to existence of real solutions, which is&lt;br/&gt;by far more subtle than the existence of complex solutions, which are usually&lt;br/&gt;studied. This part is inspired by the so-called "pole placement problem", which is a major unsolved mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problem in control theory of linear systems. The results in this area&lt;br/&gt;will have implications for the design of complicated automatic control systems. &lt;br/&gt;These results would establish limitations on the possibility to&lt;br/&gt;control a system of given size by a control device of certain class.</AbstractNarration>
