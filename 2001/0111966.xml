    <AbstractNarration>The AIM Research Conference Center (ARCC) will foster progress in&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical sciences and contribute significantly to the&lt;br/&gt;current and future productivity of mathematicians. Through the&lt;br/&gt;sponsorship of focused workshops, ARCC will provide a new venue&lt;br/&gt;for research mathematics which will enhance and complement&lt;br/&gt;existing conference centers and institutes. ARCC focused&lt;br/&gt;workshops will be distinguished by their emphasis on a specific&lt;br/&gt;mathematical goal, such as a significant unsolved problem, an&lt;br/&gt;important new result, or the explanation of the convergence&lt;br/&gt;between two distinct areas of mathematics. Also planned are&lt;br/&gt;workshops exploring connections between mathematics and other&lt;br/&gt;sciences. A small team of researchers will carefully plan each&lt;br/&gt;workshop so as to maximize its effectiveness in achieving this&lt;br/&gt;goal. Central to each workshop will be a public website which,&lt;br/&gt;during the lead-in phase, will outline the scope of the workshop&lt;br/&gt;and provide resources to the participants. Most workshops will&lt;br/&gt;last for one week and will feature a small selection of talks&lt;br/&gt;coupled with several problem and discussion sessions.&lt;br/&gt;Immediately following the workshop, the website will be expanded&lt;br/&gt;to serve both as a record of the workshop and as a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;resource for the current status of important problems and&lt;br/&gt;results. The website will remain up-to-date through the&lt;br/&gt;incorporation of future work and new developments. The&lt;br/&gt;collection of all workshop websites will grow to become a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive and interconnected resource for the most important&lt;br/&gt;problems and results in modern mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, mathematics has become an increasingly&lt;br/&gt;collaborative endeavor, and many of today's important unsolved&lt;br/&gt;problems will require techniques from several areas of the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences. The ARCC focused workshops will provide&lt;br/&gt;an ideal forum for a team of researchers, working together, to&lt;br/&gt;map out strategies, set priorities, work toward a solution, and&lt;br/&gt;set in place a framework for progress on important problems. It&lt;br/&gt;is expected that these workshops will often lay the groundwork&lt;br/&gt;for significant efforts, both by focused research groups and&lt;br/&gt;through special, longer term programs at other institutes. When&lt;br/&gt;it is operating at full capacity, ARCC will sponsor 20-25 focused&lt;br/&gt;workshops per year, each designed to facilitate collaborative&lt;br/&gt;progress on an important area of the mathematical sciences. To&lt;br/&gt;ensure that these collaborations will be successful, the leaders&lt;br/&gt;in each field will be involved in the planning of the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;Equally importantly, junior scientists and graduate students will&lt;br/&gt;be actively involved in the workshops, thereby ensuring the&lt;br/&gt;long-term development of the ensuing work and contributing to the&lt;br/&gt;education of new mathematicians. Special attention will be&lt;br/&gt;devoted to facilitate collaborations which include women,&lt;br/&gt;minorities, and researchers at primarily undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;institutions. This will allow for a more effective use of the&lt;br/&gt;nation's collective mathematical knowledge and resources. The&lt;br/&gt;AIM Research Conference Center's emphasis on focused&lt;br/&gt;collaborative research will foster significant progress on&lt;br/&gt;important mathematical problems and will be of significant&lt;br/&gt;benefit to both current and future generations of mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>
