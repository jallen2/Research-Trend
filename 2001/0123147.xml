    <AbstractNarration>The Hutlee/Umyuarchdelee proposal (Athabascan/Yupik words for leader, boss, a &lt;br/&gt;good thinker)is a five-year project based on a hybrid of models with proven success &lt;br/&gt;in educating minoritystudents. The project will include academic enhancement for &lt;br/&gt;gatekeeper math and sciencecourses integrating active learning pedagogies, intensive &lt;br/&gt;sessions, and relevant ways of learningfor Native students. To sustain student success &lt;br/&gt;the project will provide faculty "sponsorship," vigilant student support skills, &lt;br/&gt;incorporate a "Master Learner" curriculum to strengthen students-social contexts, &lt;br/&gt;and integrate job shadowing and internships with industry and Native&lt;br/&gt;organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Interior-Aleutians Campus and Bristol Bay Campus service area comprises 235,000 &lt;br/&gt;squaremiles and 74% Native population. Less than .5% of the students enrolling through &lt;br/&gt;these two campuses are full time students. Recruiting students from 90 (of Alaska's&lt;br/&gt;220) villages, this project proposes to enroll five cohorts in a two-year village-based&lt;br/&gt;program. Through course work and intensive weeklong sessions during the semester as&lt;br/&gt;well as intensive math summer sessions, student cohorts will build an academic learning&lt;br/&gt;community. This learning community will carry on after students complete project&lt;br/&gt;coursework and transition to urban-based four-year SMET degree programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategic goals of this project are:&lt;br/&gt;* To increase Alaska Native participation and success in SMET degree gatekeeper courses.&lt;br/&gt;* To significantly increase the number of Alaska Native students who pursue baccalaureate&lt;br/&gt; degrees in SMET disciplines or enter SMET careers.&lt;br/&gt;* To develop a collaborative program among the University of Alaska Campuses, industry,&lt;br/&gt; and Tribal organizations to strengthen SMET academic infrastructure for Alaska Native&lt;br/&gt; students.&lt;br/&gt;* To provide faculty and students with the tools and education to actively use technology in&lt;br/&gt; academic courses.&lt;br/&gt;The Hutlee/Umyuarchdelee method of delivering gatekeeper math and science courses will&lt;br/&gt;include curricular enhancements that employ active learning pedagogies and include a holistic&lt;br/&gt;pedagogical philosophy. Methods of curricular enhancements are:&lt;br/&gt;* Additional faculty contact time extending math courses from three to five days by adding&lt;br/&gt; math labs which integrate methods for active learning such as hands-on manipulatives.&lt;br/&gt;* Six and eight weeks summer math intensives with relevant industry internships.&lt;br/&gt;* Weeklong semester-based intensive sessions that integrate academics, problem solving,&lt;br/&gt; and Master Learner curricular activities.&lt;br/&gt;* Building a student cohort academic learning community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential impacts of the Hutlee/Umyuarchdelee project are:&lt;br/&gt;* To develop SMET knowledgeable Alaska Native engineers.&lt;br/&gt;* To develop SMET knowledgeable Alaska Native leaders who will participate in making&lt;br/&gt; decisions about tribal lands that will forever change the lifestyles, economics, and&lt;br/&gt; existence of rural Alaskan communities.&lt;br/&gt;* To develop curricula and a delivery model which will impact not only students and&lt;br/&gt; communities affected though this program, extend to other SMET students in different&lt;br/&gt; geographical areas.</AbstractNarration>
