    <AbstractNarration>0109004&lt;br/&gt;Fenical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is for support of a collaborative research between Dr. William Fenical, Marine Research Division, University of California at San Diego, San Diego, California and Dr. Diaa Youssef, Department of Pharamcognosy, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt&lt;br/&gt;The two plan a series of expeditions and research seminars within Egypt and research visits of the Egyptian scientist to Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. The purpose is to expand our knowledge of the sources, types and reactivities of the defensive molecules produced by Red Sea invertebrates, and to explore the natural functions of these molecules in defensive adaptations. The goal is to explore the natural products chemistry and chemical ecology of these marine invertebrates, principally gorgonian and alcyonacean corals, sponges and encrusting ascidians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This award will allow a team of US scientists to collaborate with Egyptian scientists in a research project to study an area that is not well understood. The interaction should be mutually beneficial. The project will provide Fenical's group access to a new research site, and will provide them international exposure. This exposure would be particularly valuable for graduate students. It will benefit Youssef's group by providing them exposure to one of the leading natural products chemistry groups in the world, by the advanced training, and by the provided.</AbstractNarration>
