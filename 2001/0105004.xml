    <AbstractNarration>0105004&lt;br/&gt;Shkoller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three year research effort is founded upon the author's recent &lt;br/&gt;development of a novel Lagrangian averaging procedure for the Euler and &lt;br/&gt;Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics. The method is based on &lt;br/&gt;expressing the exact Lagrangian fluid flow as a composition of a smooth &lt;br/&gt;deterministic volume-preserving Lagrangian flow and a rough stochastic &lt;br/&gt;flow consisting of volume-preserving near-identity transformations. This &lt;br/&gt;decomposition is asymptotically expanded about the identity, substituted &lt;br/&gt;into the variational principle, and then averaged. The resulting &lt;br/&gt;deterministic system of equations is termed the Lagrangian averaged &lt;br/&gt;Navier-Stokes (LANS) equations in the presence of viscosity, and the &lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian averaged Euler (LAE) equations in the ideal case when &lt;br/&gt;viscosity is absent. Both the LAE and LANS models are parameterized by &lt;br/&gt;a small spatial scale alpha, and are derived in such a fashion as to &lt;br/&gt;accurately reproduce the dynamics of the Euler and Navier-Stokes &lt;br/&gt;equations at spatial scales larger than alpha, while averaging (or &lt;br/&gt;homogenizing) the fluid motion at scales smaller than alpha. Unlike &lt;br/&gt;current approaches such as Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or &lt;br/&gt;Large Eddie Simulation (LES) models which add artificial dissipation to &lt;br/&gt;the system to remove subgrid scales, the LAE/LANS equations preserve &lt;br/&gt;the underlying structure of the inviscid dynamics, namely, energy, &lt;br/&gt;helicity, and circulation, by instead using a geometric, nonlinear dispersive &lt;br/&gt;mechanism. As a result, our LANS model, unlike RANS or LES, does not &lt;br/&gt;artificially suppress intermittency, a fundamental feature of fluid &lt;br/&gt;turbulence. The resulting system is a set of dynamically coupled partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations for the mean velocity field and covariance tensor. &lt;br/&gt;This system will be the backbone of a massive analytic and computational &lt;br/&gt;assault on the modeling and understanding of fluid turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although heavily studied by numerous researchers for over a century, &lt;br/&gt;incompressible fluid turbulence elusively remains one of the last great &lt;br/&gt;challenges of modern scientific exploration. Its understanding is of &lt;br/&gt;paramount importance in a wide range of engineering and physical &lt;br/&gt;applications, ranging from the design of airplanes and automobiles, to &lt;br/&gt;daily weather forecasts and global climate prediction. Roughly speaking, &lt;br/&gt;a flow becomes turbulent when all of the spatial scales in the fluid are &lt;br/&gt;activated, or in other words, when the fluid is moving so chaotically, as to &lt;br/&gt;create smaller and ever smaller vortices. In such a flow regime, the &lt;br/&gt;trajectory of each fluid particle appears unpredictable, yet the challenge is &lt;br/&gt;to derive a mathematical set of equations which can describe this &lt;br/&gt;unpredictable motion. About 150 years ago, the Navier-Stokes equations &lt;br/&gt;were introduced for this very purpose, and although it is now generally &lt;br/&gt;accepted that these equations do indeed provide a remarkable physical &lt;br/&gt;model of reality, it remains a mathematical mystery as to whether or not &lt;br/&gt;unique solutions to these equations exist for all time. Moreover, even &lt;br/&gt;numerical approximations of these equations on the world's fastest &lt;br/&gt;supercomputers are incapable of modeling the small-scale structures and &lt;br/&gt;patterns which are formed in a turbulent regime -- the computer simply &lt;br/&gt;runs out of memory long before it can simulate the prohibitively small &lt;br/&gt;vortical motion. The LANS model, described above, is intended to &lt;br/&gt;alleviate these fundamental difficulties, and make the computational &lt;br/&gt;simulation of turbulent flows feasible.</AbstractNarration>
