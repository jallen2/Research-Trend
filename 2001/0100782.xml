    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0100782&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) What is the distribution of the eigenvalues of a&lt;br/&gt;random matrix, with certain symmetry conditions to&lt;br/&gt;guarantee the reality of the spectrum? What happens to&lt;br/&gt;the distribution, when the size of the matrix gets&lt;br/&gt;large? What about universality in the limit?&lt;br/&gt;(2) What is the statistics of the length of the&lt;br/&gt;longest increasing sequence in random permutation or&lt;br/&gt;random words (Ulam's problem). This question applies&lt;br/&gt;to models of interface growth, polymers in random&lt;br/&gt;environments, first passage percolation problem, and&lt;br/&gt; "dimer" configurations.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Integrals over groups and symmetric spaces, (or&lt;br/&gt;over their tangent spaces) lead to a variety of&lt;br/&gt;interesting matrix models. The coefficients of the&lt;br/&gt;(perturbative) expansions have striking combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;or topological significance and can be computed in a&lt;br/&gt;recursive way. This work originates in the works of&lt;br/&gt;Feynman, 't Hooft, Bessis-Itzykson-Zuber and Witten,&lt;br/&gt;in the context of string theory.&lt;br/&gt;(4) The sample canonical correlation coefficients&lt;br/&gt;(maximum likelihood estimates) for the canonical&lt;br/&gt;correlation coefficients of two Gaussian populations&lt;br/&gt;are the test statistic for the statistical&lt;br/&gt;independence of the two populations, as studied by&lt;br/&gt;Hotelling, James and Constantine.&lt;br/&gt;(5) The four problems above and their&lt;br/&gt;"time"-perturbations are all solutions to integrable&lt;br/&gt;equations or lattices. For large random matrices or&lt;br/&gt;permutations, they are solutions to the Korteweg-de&lt;br/&gt;Vries equation. In the finite case, they are solutions&lt;br/&gt;to the Toda lattice, and to two new integrable&lt;br/&gt;lattices, the Pfaff and Toeplitz lattices.&lt;br/&gt;%Besides matrix integrals solutions, these lattices&lt;br/&gt;%have interesting rational solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is fair to say that matrix integrals point the way&lt;br/&gt;to new integrable systems, but also to new&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial and probabilistic questions !&lt;br/&gt;General description: The problems above&lt;br/&gt;relate to a number of important questions in physics,&lt;br/&gt;engineering and statistics:&lt;br/&gt;Problem (1) has its origin in the study of energy&lt;br/&gt;levels (excitation spectra) of heavy nuclei in nuclear&lt;br/&gt;physics (Wigner, Dyson). These levels are so intricate&lt;br/&gt;that any explicit description would be intractable.&lt;br/&gt;For that reason, Wigner proposed a statistical model&lt;br/&gt;for these energy levels. Concerning problem (2), &lt;br/&gt;it is well known that a large percentage of computer &lt;br/&gt;time is devoted to the rearrangement of the data used &lt;br/&gt;in the course of computations. How many data, after a &lt;br/&gt;complete reshuffling, are statistically still in order? &lt;br/&gt;This question of random permutations also applies to&lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanics, the basis of thermodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;and to questions of polymers. Some of the matrix &lt;br/&gt;models (3) provide toy models for string theory, &lt;br/&gt;an important set of ideas at the basis of the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental interactions in the physical world.&lt;br/&gt;It turns out that certain matrix models, mentioned&lt;br/&gt;above, are used in testing whether two sets of&lt;br/&gt;statistical data are correlated, as sketched in (4).&lt;br/&gt;The Korteweg-de Vries equation, the arch-type&lt;br/&gt;``soliton equation", describes the propagation of&lt;br/&gt;waves in shallow water; a similar non-linear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equation governs the propagation of&lt;br/&gt;ultra-short pulses in optical fibers, when the wave&lt;br/&gt;length is long compared to the diameter of the fiber.</AbstractNarration>
