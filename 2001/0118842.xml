    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary problem addressed is the deleterious effect of dynamic&lt;br/&gt;multipath propagation on high-speed wireless digital communications &lt;br/&gt;supporting real-time video and multimedia applications. Digital TV (DTV) &lt;br/&gt;is a target application along with Fourth Generation Cellular Communication &lt;br/&gt;Systems. Reflections off buildings and other structures cause ghosts &lt;br/&gt;and other artifacts in the reconstructed video stream. These multipath &lt;br/&gt;effects can wreak havoc on all functions of the receiver causing&lt;br/&gt;loss of synchronization and loss of carrier/timing recovery as well&lt;br/&gt;as inter-symbol interference. Discrete ghosts are often associated with &lt;br/&gt;multipath conditions of large, flat surfaces, such as tall steel buildings. &lt;br/&gt;However, multipath conditions can occur in areas with hills and dense foliage&lt;br/&gt;where a signal can travel through many paths to the receiver. When the signal&lt;br/&gt;is bounced back from a moving object, complex ghosts can arise with a &lt;br/&gt;time-varying nature that is very challenging for the equalizer to overcome.&lt;br/&gt;To accommodate delay spreads of up to 40 microseconds, current generation &lt;br/&gt;Digital TV receiver chips employ a Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) with &lt;br/&gt;more than 100 Feed-Forward taps and more than 400 Feed-Back taps. This &lt;br/&gt;constitutes a large number of taps to adapt implying slow convergence and &lt;br/&gt;high computational complexity. Future high-speed wireless multimedia &lt;br/&gt;applications will place even more stressful demands on equalizer performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will develop fundamental advances in the area of&lt;br/&gt;reduced-dimension Decision Feedback Equalizers (DFE's).&lt;br/&gt;These include methods for dimensionality reduction based on a&lt;br/&gt;powerful reduced-rank adaptive filtering algorithm referred to &lt;br/&gt;as the Multi-Stage Nested Wiener Filter (MSNWF). The MSNWF provides&lt;br/&gt;convergence speeds better than the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm,&lt;br/&gt;but at a much reduced computational complexity due to the fact that &lt;br/&gt;that the MSNWF constrains the overall weight vector to lie &lt;br/&gt;in a data-adaptive, low-dimensional subspace.&lt;br/&gt;The MSNWF has been successfully employed to effect a reduced-rank, &lt;br/&gt;linear equalizer for applications in Third Generation Cellular Communications&lt;br/&gt;based on both CDMA Technology and the European GSM EDGE System. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator will also develop other means for dimensionality&lt;br/&gt;reduction including the use of the channel shortening concept employed in &lt;br/&gt;OFDM systems to reduce the length of the cyclic prefix, and symbol waveform &lt;br/&gt;compression achieved through simple linear filtering at the receiver.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the investigator will study the use of reduced-dimension DFE's&lt;br/&gt;for equalization when block space-time coding is employed under frequency &lt;br/&gt;selective multipath conditions.</AbstractNarration>
