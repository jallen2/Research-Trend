    <AbstractNarration>The investigator applies tools from group representation&lt;br/&gt;theory to study deformations of representations of profinite&lt;br/&gt;groups and of complexes of modules for such groups. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator's main theme is to examine problems and&lt;br/&gt;applications related to generalizations of the deformation&lt;br/&gt;theory of group representations developed by B. Mazur. The&lt;br/&gt;generalizations are extensions of this theory to (1)&lt;br/&gt;deformations of objects in derived categories, and (2)&lt;br/&gt;deformations of representations whose images lie in various&lt;br/&gt;linear algebraic groups, such as orthogonal groups. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator studies applications of these theories to certain&lt;br/&gt;embedding problems. The second theme is to determine for finite&lt;br/&gt;groups the ring structure of the universal deformation ring of&lt;br/&gt;an irreducible modular representation, using only the local&lt;br/&gt;structure of the finite group. The investigator also works on&lt;br/&gt;one other project which concerns moduli spaces of representations&lt;br/&gt;of finite dimensional algebras. The goal is to use the rich&lt;br/&gt;algebro-geometric structure of moduli spaces to obtain a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the geometric behavior of algebra automorphisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are abstract mathematical objects by which one may encode&lt;br/&gt;and study symmetry, for example in chemical molecules, crystals, networks,&lt;br/&gt;or abstract mathematical structures. Representations of groups provide&lt;br/&gt;a way to extract information about the internal structures of a group.&lt;br/&gt;Roughly speaking, representations can be thought of as "linearized&lt;br/&gt;snapshots" of the group which are given by explicitly described&lt;br/&gt;matrices. In this project, the investigator studies deformations of&lt;br/&gt;representations. The deformations of a given representation form a&lt;br/&gt;family of representations which are associated to this representation&lt;br/&gt;in a certain way. In case there is a single deformation which can be&lt;br/&gt;used to describe all deformations, one talks about a universal&lt;br/&gt;deformation. Universal deformations provide universal constructions which&lt;br/&gt;can be used to solve certain problems all at once, which otherwise would&lt;br/&gt;have to be solved in a case-by-case fashion. It is the goal of this&lt;br/&gt;project to study certain generalizations of deformations of&lt;br/&gt;representations which in turn should lead to more powerful applications&lt;br/&gt;in different areas.</AbstractNarration>
