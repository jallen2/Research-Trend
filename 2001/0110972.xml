    <AbstractNarration>Proteolysis plays fundamental roles in cell homeostasis, cell cycle control, regulation of transcription, and development. Lysosomal/vacuolar autophagy and the proteasome pathway handle the bulk of cellular proteolysis. Although proteasome function has been characterized in considerable detail, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of autophagy. Autophagy delivers proteins, RNAs, lipids, carbohydrates, and entire organelles to the lysosome/vacuole where they are degraded by soluble acid hydrolases. Autophagy occurs by at least two morphologically distinct mechanisms that are conserved between yeast and mammals. In macroautophagy, cytoplasm and organelles are enveloped by double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which fuse with the vacuole membrane to release autophagic bodies into the vacuole lumen for degradation. During microautophagy, bulk cytoplasm and organelles are sequestered into invaginations of the vacuole membrane which are released into the lumen by homotypic membrane scission. &lt;br/&gt;It was recently discovered that nonessential portions of the yeast nucleus are degraded in the vacuole by a novel form of receptor-mediated microautophagy called Piecemeal Microautophagy of the Nucleus (PMN). PMN occurs in the physical context of Nucleus-Vacuole (NV) junctions, which are formed though physical interactions between Vac8p in the vacuole membrane and Nvj1p in the nuclear envelope. The first morphologically distinguishable phase of PMN is the development of convex bulges in NV junctions. Bulges develop into blebs that become increasingly engulfed by the vacuole until they remain attached to the nucleus by narrow tethers. PMN blebs detach from the nucleus by scission of vacuolar and nuclear membranes and are released as PMN vesicles into the vacuole lumen. Finally, PMN vesicles are degraded by soluble vacuolar hydrolases and the products either stored in the vacuole or recycled to the cytoplasm. &lt;br/&gt;PMN is gradually derepressed during asynchronous growth as nutrients become limiting. The nutritional control of PMN is mediated by the TOR signaling pathway and a recently described gene, PMN1/Yih1 . Cells remain viable during PMN because chromosomal DNA is excluded from blebs and vesicles. Nuclear components targeted for PMN, including nuclear pore complexes and the pre-ribosome rich portion of the nucleolus, are packaged into PMN blebs. PMN represents the first case of selective autophagy where both the vacuole receptor (Vac8p) and the cargo ligand (Nvj1p) are known. These findings provide a facile genetic, cellular, and biochemical model system for elucidating the molecular mechanism of selective microautophagy. The aims of this project focus on genes that are both conserved in humans and central to elucidating the molecular mechanism and physiological control of PMN:&lt;br/&gt;1. PMN-mediated degradation of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). This aim will test whether PMN functions to degrade and recycle excess or dispensable nuclear components. The targeting and degradation of specific PMN cargo and the rates of synthesis and degradation of NPCs in growing and starving cells will be characterized. It will be determined whether specific nucleoporins are removed from the NPC prior to their delivery into PMN blebs. For example, Mlp1p and Mlp2p normally link yeast chromosomes to the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC. Because chromatin is excluded from PMN vesicles, it will be determined whether Mlp1p and Mlp2p remain associated with telomeres and do not accompany the NPC into PMN blebs. &lt;br/&gt;2. Regulation of PMN by Pmn1p/Yih1p. Pmn1p/Yih1p is a Nvj1p interacting protein as determined by two-hybrid assay. Also, PMN1 is necessary for the repression of PMN in rich medium, where it is likely to potentiate TOR kinase signaling. PMN1/Yih1 is conserved in mammals, although its function is not known. Experiments will be performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which Pmn1p/Yih1p controls PMN. These include intracellular localization studies, analysis of how PMN1p/Yih1p levels are controlled, determination of the physical basis by which Pmn1p/Yih1p interacts with Nvj1p, and assays to determine how Pmn1p/Yih1p controls the degradation of Nvj1p. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the integration of research and education through the participation of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and through the utilization of the project as a pedagogical organizing tool in a course taught by Dr. Goldfarb.</AbstractNarration>
