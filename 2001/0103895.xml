    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0103895&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Anthony M. Bloch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics and Control of Mechanical Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for the continuation and extension of the &lt;br/&gt;proposer's research into the dynamics and control of nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;mechanical systems in finite- and infinite-dimensions. In &lt;br/&gt;particular, research is proposed in the following areas: integrable &lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems in finite- and infinite- dimensions including both &lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian and nonholonomic systems, the stabilization and control of &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear mechanical systems via energy methods and the extension of &lt;br/&gt;these methods to systems with nonholonomic (nonintegrable) constraints, &lt;br/&gt;the geometry of the smooth and discrete dynamics of rigid bodies, and &lt;br/&gt;the control of quantum mechanical systems. A general area of interest &lt;br/&gt;that encompasses several parts of this proposal is the relationship &lt;br/&gt;between energy preservation and asymptotic behavior in dynamical systems &lt;br/&gt;and between reversible and irreversible behavior. In the integrable &lt;br/&gt;systems area the proposer is interested in the nonabelian Toda lattice, &lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional generalizations of Toda, and generalized smooth &lt;br/&gt;and discrete rigid body systems. Finally he intends to analyze the &lt;br/&gt;dynamics and control of various coupled mechanical systems in both the &lt;br/&gt;classical and quantum regimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is aimed at studying the behavior of various mechanical &lt;br/&gt;systems that are important for applications in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;These include systems such as wheeled or articulated robots, aerospace &lt;br/&gt;systems, submarine vehicles, and quantum (microscopic) devices. Quantum &lt;br/&gt;devices, where the laws of motion of atoms and molecules play a key role, &lt;br/&gt;have become increasingly important in such areas as communication and &lt;br/&gt;coding theory. In addition to studying the behavior of these systems &lt;br/&gt;the proposer intends to analyze their control and optimal control -- &lt;br/&gt;that is, to provide methods for using such systems in engineering &lt;br/&gt;applications in a practical, stable, and efficient manner. The proposer&lt;br/&gt;intends to analyze various key examples of such mechanical systems with &lt;br/&gt;mathematical structure which is particularly amenable to detailed&lt;br/&gt;qualitative and quantitative analysis. Further, the proposer intends to&lt;br/&gt;analyze the transition between the behavior of systems at the quantum&lt;br/&gt;(microscopic) level and the large scale (macroscopic) level. This &lt;br/&gt;transition is important for the application of physical devices in the &lt;br/&gt;real world as well as interesting from the scientific point of view.</AbstractNarration>
