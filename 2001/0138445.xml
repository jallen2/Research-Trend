    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0138445&lt;br/&gt;Denis Zorin&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0221666&lt;br/&gt;Mathieu Desbrun&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0220905&lt;br/&gt;Peter Schroder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative project funded by the CARGO program under&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0138445, DMS-0221666, and DMS-0220905.&lt;br/&gt;Accurate computational representations of complex geometry &lt;br/&gt;are of great importance in many disciplines ranging from &lt;br/&gt;engineering and manufacturing to medicine and biology. With &lt;br/&gt;the wide availability of powerful computational resources and &lt;br/&gt;ever better acquisition technologies such as 3D laser &lt;br/&gt;scanning and volumetric MRI or CAT imaging the geometries &lt;br/&gt;used in applications are becoming increasingly complex. One &lt;br/&gt;aspect of this complexity is topology, i.e., the presence&lt;br/&gt;of holes and tunnels and of a network of one and &lt;br/&gt;zero-dimensional surface features such as creases and spikes. &lt;br/&gt;Typical examples of topologically complex shapes are a &lt;br/&gt;perforated plate or the system of blood vessels of the body. &lt;br/&gt;Traditional representations of geometry are at worst weak &lt;br/&gt;and at best cumbersome and inefficient in representing&lt;br/&gt;such complex topologies. Modeling of macro- and microscopic &lt;br/&gt;biological structures is becoming increasingly important &lt;br/&gt;for medical research, training, and treatment support. Such &lt;br/&gt;structures often have extremely complex shape and topology &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., the blood vessel or the nervous system, facial&lt;br/&gt;muscles, a folded protein molecule). The representations &lt;br/&gt;and algorithms we develop will result in new efficient ways &lt;br/&gt;of manipulating and processing computer representations of &lt;br/&gt;such structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project a team with expertise in numerical analysis, &lt;br/&gt;geometric modeling, discrete algorithms and computer graphics &lt;br/&gt;is studying ways to bring fundamental mathematical tools &lt;br/&gt;and highly efficient algorithms to bear on the challenge &lt;br/&gt;of creating efficient and accurate computational &lt;br/&gt;representations and algorithms for surfaces of complex&lt;br/&gt;topology. In particular we are investigating theory and &lt;br/&gt;practical algorithms for (I) removal of topological noise &lt;br/&gt;in existing models as well as in raw data used for surface &lt;br/&gt;reconstruction; (II) topology discovery in volumetric &lt;br/&gt;data sets; (III) construction of multiresolution &lt;br/&gt;representations of geometry which can meaningfully&lt;br/&gt;abstract fine level topology at coarser resolutions to &lt;br/&gt;enable powerful multiscale techniques for rendering, &lt;br/&gt;modification and simulation. Particular attention is paid &lt;br/&gt;to exploring measures of topological scale which are &lt;br/&gt;crucial to most of the algorithms being developed. The &lt;br/&gt;algorithms to be developed by the team will have immediate &lt;br/&gt;applications in two areas: Computer-Aided Design and &lt;br/&gt;Medical Visualization. In CAD, examples of potential &lt;br/&gt;applications include topology cleanup, simplification &lt;br/&gt;for integration of scanned 3D data with manually &lt;br/&gt;constructed models and use of multiscale representations &lt;br/&gt;for interactive conceptual design representations.</AbstractNarration>
