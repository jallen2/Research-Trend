    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to examine parental management of adolescents' peers in three ethnic contexts (African-American, Latino [primarily Mexican], and White). In recent years, there has been growing interest in examining parental management of adolescents' peer relationships. Given the increase in importance of peers during adolescence and given that peer influence is also a predictor of school adjustment, drug use, and delinquent behavior, it is important to examine the ways in which parents manage the peer relationships of adolescents. Much current research on parental management of peers focuses on White adolescents. More research examining issues of normative development among minority populations, such as parental management of peers, is needed. This research will provide new information on the role of parental management of peers for adolescents in non-White and White groups and its relation to adolescent academic achievement and adjustment (e.g., drug use, delinquent behavior, friendship quality, loneliness). The project will consist of two studies. The first will identify the precursors of parental management of adolescents' peer relationships (e.g., parental goals, parental beliefs, parental perceptions of adolescents' behaviors) and it will identify the range of strategies used by parents in the management of adolescents' peer relationships. Ninety adolescents and their parents (30 African-American, 30 Latino, and 30 White) will participate in interviews regarding several facets of parental management of peers, including precursors to parental management of peer relationships. Information derived from the first study will be used to refine and develop questionnaires to be used in the second study. That study will assess the suitability of the measures for use across the three ethnic groups, examine the relations between precursors of parental management of peers, such as parental beliefs about authority over peer relationships or adolescent adjustment, and examine adolescent outcomes (e.g., academic achievement, friendship quality, drug use, and delinquent behavior) associated with parental management practices. For the second, a total of 100 African-American, 100 Latino, and 100 White seventh-graders, their parents, and their best school friends will be followed for one year. All participants will complete questionnaires at the beginning of the academic year and at the end of the academic year. Analysis of the data will allow assessment of whether the questionnaires function similarly across the three ethnic groups, as well as whether particular precursors are related to management of peers and whether management is, in turn, related to academic achievement, friendship quality, drug use, and delinquent behavior. The data should ultimately be useful in constructing training for parents in peer management techniques that would be effective in achieving desired and socially acceptable outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
