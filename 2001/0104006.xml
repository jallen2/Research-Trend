    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0104006&lt;br/&gt;John J. Millson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millson and his collaborators will explore the geometric &lt;br/&gt;properties of configuration spaces of n-gon linkages in &lt;br/&gt;Lie algebras, symmetric spaces, compact Lie groups and &lt;br/&gt;Euclidean buildings beginning with the question of deciding &lt;br/&gt;when these moduli spaces are nonempty (finding the generalized&lt;br/&gt;triangle inequalities). In addition they will study the finer &lt;br/&gt;structure of these moduli spaces. In particular, they will &lt;br/&gt;study commutative and noncommutative Hamiltonian systems of differential equations on these spaces and use the quantizations &lt;br/&gt;of these systems to obtain results about the representation &lt;br/&gt;theory of compact Lie groups and of the Artin groups of Lie &lt;br/&gt;type. Millson and B.Leeb have obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for the moduli spaces of n-gon linkages in Lie &lt;br/&gt;algebras to be nonempty generalizing well-known results of &lt;br/&gt;Klyachko for sl(n,C). Millson, M.Kapovich and B.Leeb have &lt;br/&gt;found necessary and sufficient conditions for the moduli &lt;br/&gt;spaces of n-gon linkages in Euclidean buildings and symmetric &lt;br/&gt;spaces to be nonempty. In some cases, Millson and &lt;br/&gt;H.Flaschka have constructed (commutative) integrable &lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian systems on these spaces but the flows are &lt;br/&gt;not periodic. For applications to the representation &lt;br/&gt;theory of compact Lie groups it is critical to find the &lt;br/&gt;associated "action variables," i.e. find Hamiltonians &lt;br/&gt;with periodic flows which are functions of the original Poisson-commuting Hamiltonians. Millson and Toledano-Laredo &lt;br/&gt;have constructed representations of Artin groups of Lie &lt;br/&gt;type by quantizing certain noncommutative Hamiltonian systems. &lt;br/&gt;They hope to construct the trigonometric analogues of their &lt;br/&gt;quantum systems. The results just mentioned may be found at http://www.math.umd.edu/~jjm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Millson's work begins with one of the first theorems of &lt;br/&gt;high-school geometry - the theorem that if two triangles &lt;br/&gt;have the same set of side lengths then they are congruent. &lt;br/&gt;The analogue for quadrilaterals is clearly false: one can &lt;br/&gt;change a square into a rhombus without changing the side&lt;br/&gt;lengths. So one is led to try to parametrize the set of &lt;br/&gt;all planar n-gons with the same side lengths. From there &lt;br/&gt;one is led to a favorite theme of nineteenth century &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, the study of planar linkages (systems of&lt;br/&gt;rods and hinges). In the nineteenth century such a &lt;br/&gt;study was of immense practical significance - the problem &lt;br/&gt;was to convert linear motion (of a piston rod) to circular &lt;br/&gt;motion (turn a wheel) by a linkage. The problem was&lt;br/&gt;solved by a French naval officer, Peaucellier. It turns &lt;br/&gt;out that from the modern point of view the nineteenth &lt;br/&gt;century work is insufficiently precise. Millson and &lt;br/&gt;Kapovich have corrected the errors and written up a proof &lt;br/&gt;of a result (often attributed to Thurston) that, given &lt;br/&gt;any smooth manifold M, there is a planar linkage whose &lt;br/&gt;configuration space is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union &lt;br/&gt;of a number of copies of M. This result will appear in&lt;br/&gt;the journal "Topology". The above work on planar linkages &lt;br/&gt;led to a study of n-gon linkages in space. This theory is &lt;br/&gt;enormously richer, connecting with symplectic geometry, &lt;br/&gt;integrable Hamiltonian systems and representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;The analogous theory in spherical and hyperbolic three-space &lt;br/&gt;and their generalizations (compact Lie groups and the &lt;br/&gt;symmetric spaces of their complexifications) appears to &lt;br/&gt;connect up with some of the newest objects in geometry &lt;br/&gt;and algebra, for example Poisson Lie groups and &lt;br/&gt;quantum groups.</AbstractNarration>
