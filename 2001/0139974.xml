    <AbstractNarration>0139974&lt;br/&gt;Griffiths&lt;br/&gt; Much of modern technology, including computers, lasers, and magnetic&lt;br/&gt;resonance imaging, utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics, the&lt;br/&gt;physicist's most fundamental theory of nature, and would not be possible if&lt;br/&gt;this theory had never been invented. Given this success, one might suppose&lt;br/&gt;that quantum mechanics would by now be as well understood as other foundation&lt;br/&gt;stones of modern science, such as thermodynamics and relativity theory. On the&lt;br/&gt;contrary, as Richard Feynman, one of the great physicists of the 20th century,&lt;br/&gt;once put it, "Nobody understands quantum mechanics." The lack of a clear&lt;br/&gt;understanding, to which Feynman was referring, has not, obviously, prevented&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics from being applied to a vast range of technological devices.&lt;br/&gt;But students are frustrated when they try and learn the subject from teachers&lt;br/&gt;and textbooks whose lack of clarity illustrates the truth of Feynman's remark.&lt;br/&gt;Clearing up the conceptual mess in its foundations would certainly not detract&lt;br/&gt;from, and might even assist in, the technological applications of quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, and could well prove important for future developments in areas such&lt;br/&gt;as quantum computation and quantum cryptography, where impressive advances are&lt;br/&gt;accompanied by equally spectacular gaps in our current understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research project, as indicated in the title, has a double focus.&lt;br/&gt;One is the use of quantum histories - a promising approach developed by various&lt;br/&gt;people including Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel laureate who at one time was&lt;br/&gt;Feynman's colleague at Cal Tech - for addressing and clearing up the conceptual&lt;br/&gt;difficulties in the foundations of quantum theory. Several major paradoxes,&lt;br/&gt;including the famous double slit, have been resolved using the histories&lt;br/&gt;approach, and this method gets rid of mysterious long-range influences that are&lt;br/&gt;present in some older interpretations of quantum mechanics, and which are hard&lt;br/&gt;to reconcile with relativity theory. However, up till now these new&lt;br/&gt;developments have been confined to the technical literature, and they need to&lt;br/&gt;be moved into classrooms and textbooks if they are to make the subject more&lt;br/&gt;accessible to the next generation of scientists. There is plenty of work to be&lt;br/&gt;done, both in making abstract mathematical formulations more understandable&lt;br/&gt;through simple physical examples, and in convincing teachers and textbook&lt;br/&gt;writers that students deserve something better than the traditional&lt;br/&gt;("Copenhagen") approach, the one Feynman could not understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The second focus of this research is quantum information theory, the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental science behind both quantum computing and quantum cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;Classical information theory was developed half a century ago by Claude&lt;br/&gt;Shannon, and plays an important role in the modern theory of communication, as&lt;br/&gt;in the efficient use of weak radio signals to transmit information from distant&lt;br/&gt;space probes to the earth. Quantum information theory generalizes Shannon's&lt;br/&gt;ideas to situations where quantum effects are important, and while it has had&lt;br/&gt;some notable successes, it has also run into the following difficulty:&lt;br/&gt;Shannon's formulation is based on the use of probabilities, but incorporating&lt;br/&gt;probabilities into quantum mechanics in a consistent way is the source of many&lt;br/&gt;of the conceptual difficulties that troubled Feynman. The histories approach&lt;br/&gt;resolves the problem of quantum probabilities in a consistent manner that&lt;br/&gt;allows an immediate extension of many of Shannon's ideas into the quantum&lt;br/&gt;domain. Whether this provides a satisfactory foundation for quantum&lt;br/&gt;information theory remains to be seen, but it looks promising. If it succeeds,&lt;br/&gt;there will be a double benefit: a clearer understanding of what quantum&lt;br/&gt;computing and cryptography can and cannot do, and a new way to think about&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanical processes in terms of the generation and transmission of&lt;br/&gt;information.</AbstractNarration>
