    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT for Proposal No. ECS-0115836&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid recording is a new recording paradigm that seeks to overcome&lt;br/&gt;fundamental physical limits of existing magnetic and optical recording&lt;br/&gt;technologies. Hybridization combines thermally assisted magnetic writing&lt;br/&gt;with giant magnetoresistive readback, to circumvent the physical limits&lt;br/&gt;of both magnetic and optical recording. This approach breaks the&lt;br/&gt;coupling seen in magnetic recording systems among the size of a bit, the&lt;br/&gt;field required to write it and the length of time for which the&lt;br/&gt;information is stable. Thus, magnetic grains in the medium smaller than&lt;br/&gt;10 nm can be stabilized, which is a critical advance for reaching&lt;br/&gt;densities of 1 terabit/in2 and beyond. These advances will only be&lt;br/&gt;possible, however, if a plausible head design is demonstrated that&lt;br/&gt;integrates magnetic write poles with a localized source (probably&lt;br/&gt;optical) of thermal energy. An essential insight being pursued for this&lt;br/&gt;technology is how to apply magnetic write fields and heat, as well as&lt;br/&gt;perform MR readback with a single packaged device from a single side of&lt;br/&gt;the disk. It is the goal of this project to design, prototype, and test&lt;br/&gt;devices suitable for this application. Specific novel devices that will&lt;br/&gt;be investigated will include two-dimensional mode-index lenses, and&lt;br/&gt;near-field optical antenna structures. The Data Storage Systems Center&lt;br/&gt;(DSSC) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and GOALI collaborator,&lt;br/&gt;Seagate Technology, has extensive experience in the design and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of new head designs. The collaboration on head&lt;br/&gt;fabrication will include a program of co-design with Seagate&lt;br/&gt;researchers, joint wafer fabrication, and post-fabrication modification&lt;br/&gt;of existing heads. It is anticipated that the result of this&lt;br/&gt;academic-industrial collaboration will be a demonstration of a plausible&lt;br/&gt;integrated head design for hybrid recording, which will remove an&lt;br/&gt;important barrier to the advancement and eventual commercialization of&lt;br/&gt;this technology.</AbstractNarration>
