    <AbstractNarration>The work will continue to develop the algorithm of the LOQO &lt;br/&gt;interior point code for general continuous mathematical &lt;br/&gt;programming problems, and expand the range of problems to &lt;br/&gt;which it can be applied. Areas of research include better&lt;br/&gt;detection of infeasibility and unboundedness, better detection &lt;br/&gt;of linear dependence of the constraints, and better estimates &lt;br/&gt;of initial estimates to the optimum point. Work on higher &lt;br/&gt;order methods, which can greatly improve algorithmic efficiency, &lt;br/&gt;will be continued, with particular interest in applying filter &lt;br/&gt;methods. In an attempt to expand the scope of the types of &lt;br/&gt;problems that the algorithm can solve, the research will be &lt;br/&gt;concerned with solving discrete problems using interior point &lt;br/&gt;methods. On type of problem considered will be mixed integer &lt;br/&gt;quadratic programming. Problems of this type commonly arise in &lt;br/&gt;finance. Mixed integer linear programming problems will also &lt;br/&gt;be studied, with an initial focus on quickly finding feasible &lt;br/&gt;solutions. Further work will be concerned with general &lt;br/&gt;complementarity problems, especially those that arise in &lt;br/&gt;economics and engineering. In all cases, appropriate collections &lt;br/&gt;of problems arising from real applications will be modeled &lt;br/&gt;in AMPL. These will be made available via the internet, as will &lt;br/&gt;extensions to the LOQO program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LOQO code for solving a variety of types of mathematical &lt;br/&gt;programming problems has been under development for the past &lt;br/&gt;four years as a joint research effort of the principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;and Professor Robert Vanderbei of Princeton University. The code &lt;br/&gt;is made freely available via the internet, and to date has been &lt;br/&gt;downloaded several thousand times. It is used to solve problems &lt;br/&gt;as diverse as engineering design, portfolio optimization, airline &lt;br/&gt;scheduling problems, and is currently being adapted for various &lt;br/&gt;projects in medical research. The proposed research is &lt;br/&gt;concentrated both on improving the efficiency of the code and &lt;br/&gt;increasing the set of problems for which the code can be used. &lt;br/&gt;The new types of problems for which it is hoped the code can &lt;br/&gt;be adapted efficiently are problems with variables that must be &lt;br/&gt;an integer, generally 0 or 1. These problems are extremely common, &lt;br/&gt;and of great practical value. For example, when assigning aircraft &lt;br/&gt;to routes, a whole plane must be assigned to a specific route, &lt;br/&gt;not some fraction of a plane. Including integer variables within &lt;br/&gt;the context an algorithm of this type is very new, and will be &lt;br/&gt;approached initially through important specific applications.</AbstractNarration>
