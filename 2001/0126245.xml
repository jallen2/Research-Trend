    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13) With its capability of visualization and manipulation at atomic and molecular&lt;br/&gt;levels, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has become one of the most important&lt;br/&gt;advancements in science and technology in the past decade. This project is adapting and integrating&lt;br/&gt;SPM into a two-semester Electron Microscopy (EM) course that has been taught at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC). The addition of SPM instrumentation to&lt;br/&gt;the course gives students a broader view and experience on the cutting edge&lt;br/&gt;microscopy technologies. The integration also allows a more efficient approach in&lt;br/&gt;teaching the subject, because the course covers a wider range of techniques used in&lt;br/&gt;microscopy and emphasizes the application of these techniques in various fields. The&lt;br/&gt;improvement of the course is being achieved by introducing, in addition to the existing&lt;br/&gt;hands-on experiments on EM, two verification-type experiments using SPM to visualize&lt;br/&gt;atomic structures on well-defined crystalline surfaces in the first semester. This is&lt;br/&gt;followed, in the second semester, by three inquiry-based experiments that involve both&lt;br/&gt;SPM and EM. The improved course enhances the interdisciplinary education&lt;br/&gt;in science, mathematics, engineering and technology at UMKC.</AbstractNarration>
