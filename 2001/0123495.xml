    <AbstractNarration>The high demand likely to be placed on the capacity of telecommunication networks in the near future urges&lt;br/&gt;conversion of hybrid electro-optical signal processing to all-optical processing, exploiting the largest bandwidth available in the optical domain. One way of catering to this demand is by multiplexing in time as&lt;br/&gt;well as wavelength domains. Using picosecond-duration optical pulses, which could be soliton-like over&lt;br/&gt;portions of the network, one can first perform multiplexing in the time domain (i.e., time-division multiplexing, or TDM) for local to metropolitan-area network applications and then in the wavelength domain (wavelength-division multiplexing, or WDM) for wide area coverage. This scenario leads one to conclude that the key issue to be addressed is how to take advantage of the powerful digital-processing techniques in the pure-optical domain, that minimize the detrimental effects of noise at a very fundamental level. The idea is that, for digitally encoded data [1's (0's) represented by the presence (absence) of pulses], instead of using linear amplifiers which act on signals in an analog fashion and inevitably introduce 3 dB of noise one can employ digital-switching amplifiers or optical regenerators. At the same time, pure-optical digital switching is potentially much more reliable and faster than electro-optical switching. Furthermore, optical switching will also be needed to implement other networking functions, such as demultiplexing to process at very high speed the header of a data packet used for addressing to different users on the network.&lt;br/&gt; Our preliminary experiments show that the parametric nonlinearity of optical fibers can be exploited&lt;br/&gt;to perform functionalities that will be needed in packet-switched all-optical networks, such as fiber-optic&lt;br/&gt;cache-memory buffers, picosecond-pulse all-optical regenerators, all-optical limiters, and tunable clock re-covery modules. These devices take advantage of the ultrafast parametric nonlinearity of glass fiber and&lt;br/&gt;hence are capable of operating at speeds in excess of 100 Gb/s. Moreover, they will be essential for deploying&lt;br/&gt;packet-switched, ultrahigh-speed time-division and wavelength-division multiplexed all-optical networks.&lt;br/&gt; In all of our experiments thus far, standard dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) has been used. Fiber lengths&lt;br/&gt;on the order of 100's of meters are required for used with ps-duration pulses of a few watts peak power to&lt;br/&gt;achieve the data processing functions. Here we propose to explore the use of high-nonlinearity fiber, such&lt;br/&gt;as microstructure fiber (MF, which is only now becoming commercially available), to perform essential&lt;br/&gt;functions in high-speed all-optical processing. Because of their strongly guiding behavior, the MFs can&lt;br/&gt;be wound into very tight loops, suggesting that they could potentially fit into a compact modular switching&lt;br/&gt;package. Specifically, we propose to utilize the high-nonlinearity microstructure fibers to develop all-optical data processing modules. These include a cache storage buffer based upon parametric amplification that will be capable of operating in the 10's of Gb/s range. With use of the high-nonlinearity fiber, the average pump power requirement can be met with commercially-available watt-class optical amplifiers. We will carry out experiments to explore various ways of reading, writing, and erasing the stored data patterns.&lt;br/&gt;Our work has shown that the ultrafast parametric nonlinearity can be exploited either to provide broadband&lt;br/&gt;tunable gain or dynamic gain modulation for clock-recovery. We propose to combine the two to demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;optical phase-lock loops, which in principle can be extremely fast as they rely on the Kerr nonlinearity&lt;br/&gt;for envelope-phase discrimination. Simultaneous to the above experimental studies we will also develop&lt;br/&gt;numerical models of the various optical systems. This will provide a design tool to determine the parameter&lt;br/&gt;values allowing the most efficient operation of the experimental setups. We have previously demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;the possibility of stably propagating sub-picosecond pulses in fiber lines in which conjugating gain is used&lt;br/&gt;to compensate the linear loss. We propose to assemble a re-circulating loop experiment in which linear loss&lt;br/&gt;will be compensated by a pair of non-degenerate parametric (conjugating) amplifiers. The location of the&lt;br/&gt;two amplifiers will be chosen based upon further theoretical/numerical results. We will experimentally and&lt;br/&gt;theoretically study the stability properties of the sub-picosecond pulses by making various signal and noise&lt;br/&gt;measurements, and will compare the experimental results directly with numerical simulations.</AbstractNarration>
