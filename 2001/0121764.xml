    <AbstractNarration>This project brings together a diverse array of scholars from around&lt;br/&gt;the country, including computer scientists, 3D modellers and animators,&lt;br/&gt;theater practioners, and theater and music historians. The objective is&lt;br/&gt;to use digital technology to address a problem fundamental to performance&lt;br/&gt;scholarship and pedagogy: how to represent and communicate the phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;of live performance using media. This problem becomes especially pressing&lt;br/&gt;when the objective is to represent a performance tradition from the past.&lt;br/&gt;Neither a written description nor a filmed recreation is capable of conveying&lt;br/&gt;the experience of attending a live performance, an experience that encompasses&lt;br/&gt;not only the way the performance on stage looks and sounds from the perspective&lt;br/&gt;of spectators in different parts of the theatre, but also spectator's&lt;br/&gt;perceptions of and interactions with one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed solution to this problem is to recreate historical performances&lt;br/&gt;in a virtual reality environment. The central objective is to simulate&lt;br/&gt;a feeling of "liveness" in this environment: the sensation of being&lt;br/&gt;surrounded by human activity onstage, in the audience and backstage,&lt;br/&gt;and the ability to choose where to look at any given time (onstage&lt;br/&gt;or off) and to move within the environment. With respect to the performers&lt;br/&gt;themselves, a critical concern is to find a way to bring the nuances&lt;br/&gt;of great stage performances into the virtual environment. To this end,&lt;br/&gt;we propose to use motion capture technology to capture real-world performances&lt;br/&gt;by professional, highly skilled actors, singers, dancers, acrobats&lt;br/&gt;and musicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key to our project is the depth of the proposed collaboration between&lt;br/&gt;technology, scholarship, pedagogy and art. This project is conceived&lt;br/&gt;to make a significant contribution to all four domains simultaneously,&lt;br/&gt;rather than merely using any one in the service of the others. The end&lt;br/&gt;result will represent an important advance in the design and implementation&lt;br/&gt;of virtual environments, building on recent successes in creating&lt;br/&gt;photo-realistic simulations of real 3D environments. The scale of this&lt;br/&gt;simulation, and in particular the complexity and precision of the character&lt;br/&gt;animation, pose an important technical challenge: how to integrate the complex&lt;br/&gt;pre-defined motion capture-generated animations of the onstage performances&lt;br/&gt;with the autonomous behaviors of characters in the audience and backstage.The&lt;br/&gt;project also constitute an invaluable work of applied scholarship,&lt;br/&gt;an unprecedented resource for visualizing past performances and testing&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses about historical performance practices. It will provide&lt;br/&gt;an unprecedented resource for students to engage with historical performance&lt;br/&gt;traditions as performance (and not as literature or film). Finally,&lt;br/&gt;from an artistic perspective, the Virtual Vaudeville project will test&lt;br/&gt;the potential of virtual environments to provide truly high-quality&lt;br/&gt;theater experiences to remote audiences.&lt;br/&gt;~</AbstractNarration>
