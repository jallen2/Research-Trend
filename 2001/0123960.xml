    <AbstractNarration>Signal transduction networks are essential in eukaryotes, allowing cells to perceive and&lt;br/&gt;respond to continuous changes in extracellular conditions. Multiple signaling pathways&lt;br/&gt;co-exist in individual cells controlling essential responses, including hormone signaling,&lt;br/&gt;mitogenesis and apoptosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which signaling&lt;br/&gt;pathways cross talk with one another or by which specificity is conferred within a complex&lt;br/&gt;signaling network is an area of present intensive research in eukaryotic biology. It has&lt;br/&gt;long been recognized that most aspects of plant growth and development are regulated by&lt;br/&gt;networks of signaling mechanisms rather than linear signal transduction pathways.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, most plant cells express receptors for the six major classes of plant&lt;br/&gt;hormones and additional light and pathogen responsive receptors and need to process each&lt;br/&gt;pathway, while also making use of cross talk among these pathways. Recent&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary studies using new genetic, biochemical and genomic approaches have led&lt;br/&gt;to rapid and accelerating progress in understanding mechanisms that mediate cross talk and&lt;br/&gt;specificity in plant signal transduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hormones, light, pathogens and stress stimuli trigger signal transduction cascades that&lt;br/&gt;are essential for growth, development and survival of plants. The Keystone Symposium on&lt;br/&gt;Specificity and Cross Talk in Plant Signal Transduction will be focused on presentations&lt;br/&gt;on newly recognized reception and transduction mechanisms in these responses. The&lt;br/&gt;organizers have set up important avenues that will ensure diversity among presenters at&lt;br/&gt;the conference and are requesting funds, that will enable travel support for graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, post doctoral associates and selected speakers, towards achieving the goal of&lt;br/&gt;diversity and multidisciplinarity. The goal of the meeting will be to highlight major&lt;br/&gt;advances in this rapidly moving field and to synthesize an integrated understanding of&lt;br/&gt;which mechanisms mediate cross talk among pathways and which mechanisms allow specific&lt;br/&gt;modulation of plant growth and developmental responses. Understanding of these mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;is essential for manipulation of plant growth and development and for developing new&lt;br/&gt;biotechnological applications, that will ultimately benefit human health.</AbstractNarration>
