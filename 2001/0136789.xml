    <AbstractNarration>Estimation of causal effects of policy interventions such as job training programs is an&lt;br/&gt;important goal of much applied economic research. Often a reasonable starting point is the&lt;br/&gt;assume that assignment to the treatment is random given on sufficiently detailed observed&lt;br/&gt;pretreatment variables. Under that assumption one can identify the population average&lt;br/&gt;effect. This research will contribute to the literature on inference for average treatments effects under&lt;br/&gt;these assumptions in three parts. First, the research will develop&lt;br/&gt;large sample theory for matching estimators. By matching estimators we mean estimators&lt;br/&gt;where each treated unit is matched to one or a fixed number of controls, and each control&lt;br/&gt;is matched to one or a fixed number of treated units. Such pure matching estimators have&lt;br/&gt;considerable intuitive appeal and have been used widely in practice, without their large&lt;br/&gt;sample theory having been established other than for special cases. The result should be&lt;br/&gt;an asymptotic theory for such matching estimators that allows researchers to use these&lt;br/&gt;estimators in practice. In a second part, the research will investigate higher order properties&lt;br/&gt;of some of the estimators for average treatment effects that have been proposed. Many&lt;br/&gt;of these estimators have a nonparametric component. However, most of the literature is&lt;br/&gt;silent regarding the actual choice of smoothing parameters, beyond rate conditions. This&lt;br/&gt;makes it di .cult for practitioners to actually implement thse estimators. Here the plan is to&lt;br/&gt;develop a mean-squared-error based criterion to derive an explicit data-driven criterion for&lt;br/&gt;the smoothing parameter. In the third part, the research will compare a number of the&lt;br/&gt;estimators for average treatment effects. So far a number of estimators have been proposed,&lt;br/&gt;often with a small simulation study to investigate their properties. What this research accomplishes is&lt;br/&gt;a systematic comparison of various estimators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many studies of social programs such as job training programs observational data&lt;br/&gt;are used to evaluate these programs. Statistical methods for such evaluations often rely on&lt;br/&gt;matching type methods that match trainees to similar controls, that is individuals who&lt;br/&gt;received the training to individuals who did not receive the training with similar background&lt;br/&gt;characteristics and labor market histories. A variety of such methods are currently used, with&lt;br/&gt;often the properties and reliability of such methods unknown. This research investigates the&lt;br/&gt;formal properties of such methods. In addition the research will develop automated procedures for&lt;br/&gt;implementing some of these methods. Currently these methods often require the researcher&lt;br/&gt;to make a number of choices in the implementation that potentially affect the final results&lt;br/&gt;substantially, without much guidance available to guide these choices. This should make&lt;br/&gt;these methods more transparent and easier to implement. Finally, the research will compare a number&lt;br/&gt;of these methods in settings where the correct answers are known so as to evaluate their&lt;br/&gt;performance and reach recommendations to inform the future use of such methods.</AbstractNarration>
