    <AbstractNarration>This research project, in the laboratory of Professor Ludwig Bartels at the University of California-Riverside, uses scanning tunneling microscope methods as a tool in organic synthesis. This early Career award supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the site directed synthesis of organic molecules bound to surfaces. Building on recent work that demonstrated the synthesis of biphenyl from iodobenzene using the STM tip, Bartels and his coworkers will extend this approach to the synthesis of individual molecules having multiple elementary units. This approach will allow the synthesis of molecules of exactly the desired conformation. Application of this approach to the synthesis of chiral molecules of specific conformation is planned as well. This basic research program will provide the background and understanding necessary for the development of molecular electronic devices and other nanomaterial synthesis strategies. Professor Bartels is also developing a course focussing on semiconductor processing that will be taught in the Chemistry Department as a part of this Career award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A detailed understanding of the construction of complex organic molecules will result from the work carried out in this Career award. Professor Bartels and his coworkers will use STM to manipulate individual molecules, coupling various functionalities to make molecules of the desired conformation adsorbed on a substrate. Coupling reactions will be used for the initial work, followed by more complex addition reactions. A semiconductor processing course will be developed as part of this Career award.</AbstractNarration>
