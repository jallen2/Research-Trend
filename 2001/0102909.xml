    <AbstractNarration>DMS 0102909&lt;br/&gt;PI: Thaleia Zariphopoulou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most market models, the classical assumption of a perfect market &lt;br/&gt;is not satisfied. The PI proposes to continue her research program &lt;br/&gt;to develop methods to study valuation problems in incomplete &lt;br/&gt;markets, concetrated in the following class of applications: &lt;br/&gt;i) optimal asset allocation under market frictions the goal being &lt;br/&gt;to derive and analyze the optimal risky demand and to represent the &lt;br/&gt;value function in terms of distorted measures, ii) valuation of &lt;br/&gt;derivatives written on nontraded assets with the goal to use &lt;br/&gt;utility-based pricing methodology to specify the hedging strategies &lt;br/&gt;and to expole their role in risk aggregation, iii) dynamic hedging &lt;br/&gt;of volatility risks the goal being to specify the arbitrage-free &lt;br/&gt;components of the implied volatility process and to study their &lt;br/&gt;implications to the dynamic management of volatility risks, and&lt;br/&gt;iv) asset valuation under irreversible decisions with the goals &lt;br/&gt;being to evaluate early exercise instruments under constraints &lt;br/&gt;related to irreversible decisions and to analyze the impact of &lt;br/&gt;irreversibilities to prices and optimal demand. The technical &lt;br/&gt;tools come from stochastic analysis, stochastic control and &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most market settings, the classical assumption of market &lt;br/&gt;completeness is not satisfied and, therefore, the traditional &lt;br/&gt;approach of perfect replication cannot be applied. It becomes &lt;br/&gt;hence necessary to review the pricing and risk management concepts. &lt;br/&gt;The first step is the development of a unified framework to &lt;br/&gt;analyze the inherent market risks, and identify the components that &lt;br/&gt;can be hedged away and the ones that cannot. The second step is the &lt;br/&gt;establishment of a coherent method to price the unhedgeable risks &lt;br/&gt;in order to achieve effective risk management. The PI proposes to &lt;br/&gt;continue her work in market models with frictions along the &lt;br/&gt;aforementioned two general directions. The proposed methodologies rely&lt;br/&gt;heavily on the classical economic principles of utility theory which&lt;br/&gt;reflect the investors' preferences towards the risks that cannot be&lt;br/&gt;eliminated. Among others, the PI proposes to study models of asset&lt;br/&gt;allocation, derivative pricing and risk management under various market&lt;br/&gt;frictions including stochastic volatility, nontraded assets and&lt;br/&gt;irreversible management policies.</AbstractNarration>
