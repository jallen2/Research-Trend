    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to research and develop high-quality, scalable, and reconfigurable acquisition&lt;br/&gt;and display systems for digital library collections accessed via the Internet. We will acquire new digital&lt;br/&gt;collections at the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico and provide access to them through end-user displays&lt;br/&gt;that are scalable and reconfigurable. These displays will cooperate with a remote model server to&lt;br/&gt;provide the highest possible display fidelity under the current network conditions. In order to allow&lt;br/&gt;the widespread acquisition and dissemination of digital collections, revolutionary advances in 3D model&lt;br/&gt;acquistion, content delivery, and display are required. To thisend,we will focus on the following research&lt;br/&gt;challenges:&lt;br/&gt; Acquisition: we willprovide new acquisition strategies designed to produce high-quality layered,&lt;br/&gt;image-based representations, 3-D shape descriptions, and multi-layerd data. These new strategies&lt;br/&gt;will enable efficient access and high-resolution end-user display. hybrid representation of texture,&lt;br/&gt;shape, and metadata.&lt;br/&gt; Representation: we will encode the acquired collection in a way that moves toward the features&lt;br/&gt;provided in the MPEG-4 multimedia standard. This encoding will preserve the richness and&lt;br/&gt;fidelity of the data while achieving standardization for access, manipulation, and evolution of&lt;br/&gt;collections over time.&lt;br/&gt; Remote Access: we will develop new techniques supporting distributed access to digital col-&lt;br/&gt;lections in a heterogeneous networked environment. These techniques will be designed to satisfy&lt;br/&gt;access requirements across a spectrum that varies from very high quality local display and low-&lt;br/&gt;latency interactive manipulation, to remote access over wide-area, potentially low bitrate links.&lt;br/&gt; Display: we will develop new techniques for deploying scalable tiled projection displays for&lt;br/&gt;institutions and users who do not have access to sophisticated and dedicated technical support and&lt;br/&gt;high-cost hardware. These scalable display systems can be assembled from commodity hardware&lt;br/&gt;and provide automatic, continuous calibration, and rapid reconfigurability.&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for this work stems from the need for high-quality preservation, access, and display&lt;br/&gt;techniques for digitized collections. Libraries, museums, and research scholars who want to acquire,&lt;br/&gt;manipulate, and provide remote access to (and high-definition display of)digitized artifacts need cost&lt;br/&gt;effective, non-intrusive, easily configurable methods for creating and viewing high-quality collections.&lt;br/&gt;New techniques will be evaluated on real-world library collections with particular focus on the preser-&lt;br/&gt;vation and dissemination of artifacts at our partner institution for this work, the Museo de Arte de&lt;br/&gt;Puerto Rico . With the aid of expert consultants who will contribute significant effort towards this&lt;br/&gt;project at our partner institution (see attached letter), we willdevelop and deploy a prototype system&lt;br/&gt;for acqusition and display using the techniques developed as part of this project. The resulting digital&lt;br/&gt;archive will be made accessible to patrons of the museum as well as a much larger audience around the&lt;br/&gt;world via the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;We believe that this research will have significant immediate, medium-term and long-term impact.&lt;br/&gt;The immediate impact of the project will be the development of new acquisition, access, and display&lt;br/&gt;methods that will be deployed and tested at the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico, making parts of their&lt;br/&gt;collections available in forms not previously possible. In the medium term, our new technical approaches&lt;br/&gt;will be valuable not only to the digital library community, but also to other research, instructional, and&lt;br/&gt;commercial areas where configurable large-scale display systems are needed (e.g., classroom, research&lt;br/&gt;visualization centers, conference venues, etc). In the long term, we believe this proposed work has&lt;br/&gt;the potential to substantially impact the way people view and interact with data, whether the data is&lt;br/&gt;a collection of historical artifacts, a visual representation of a complex simulation, data/illustrations&lt;br/&gt;presenting in the classroom, etc. Moreover, the cost effectiveness of our approach means that it will be&lt;br/&gt;affordable to a wide range of users.</AbstractNarration>
