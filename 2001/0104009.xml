    <AbstractNarration>In the last two decades, the homotopy continuation method for&lt;br/&gt;solving polynomial systems has been established and proved to&lt;br/&gt;be reliable and efficient. Resulting from a previous project,&lt;br/&gt;supported by NSF Grant DMS-9804846, a source code, HOM4PS, was&lt;br/&gt;produced. Excellent performance of this code on a large collection&lt;br/&gt;of polynomial systems in a wide variety of applications provides&lt;br/&gt;practical evidence that the newly developed methods constitute a&lt;br/&gt;powerful general purpose solver. Nontheless, there are still&lt;br/&gt;numerous models of polynomial systems in applications which do&lt;br/&gt;not have a satisfactory line of attack. Those models provide a rich&lt;br/&gt;source of interesting and challenging problems with strong mathematical&lt;br/&gt;content. The essence of the proposed project is the advance development&lt;br/&gt;of the solver based on the conduct of further research&lt;br/&gt;to greatly enlarge the scope of its applications. The ultimate goal&lt;br/&gt;is a more complete high-quality block-box solfware which will&lt;br/&gt;incorporate the best state of the art to provide the general scientific&lt;br/&gt;community a reliable source for solving polynomial systems in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of solving polynomial systems has been, and will continue&lt;br/&gt;to be, one of the most important subjects in both pure and applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. The need to solve systems of polynomial equations arises&lt;br/&gt;very frequently in various fields of science and engineering, such as,&lt;br/&gt;formula construction, geometric intersection, inverse kinematics,&lt;br/&gt;robotics, vision and the computation of equilibrium states of chemical&lt;br/&gt;reaction equations, etc. In recent years (1993-1999), a considerable&lt;br/&gt;research effort in Europe had been directed to this problem in two&lt;br/&gt;consecutive major projects, PoSSo (Polynomial System Solving) and FRISCO&lt;br/&gt;(FRamework for Integrated Symbolic/numerical COmputation), supported by&lt;br/&gt;European Commission with thirteen university teams in seven European&lt;br/&gt;countries involved. Those research projects focused on the development&lt;br/&gt;of the already well-established Groebner basis methods within the&lt;br/&gt;framework of computer algebra. Their reliance on symbolic manipulation&lt;br/&gt;makes those methods seem somewhat limited to relatively small problems.&lt;br/&gt;In contrast, the approch by the homotopy continuation method in this&lt;br/&gt;project is numerical and exhibits much powerful application results.</AbstractNarration>
