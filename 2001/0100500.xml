    <AbstractNarration>The main thrust of this research is to establish in the setting of&lt;br/&gt;function fields analogues of major conjectures by Rohrlich and,&lt;br/&gt;Shimura on the algebraic (in)dependence of coordinates of periods &lt;br/&gt;of certain abelian varieties. The current step involves the &lt;br/&gt;analysis of the structure of certain types of t-modules, which &lt;br/&gt;correspond roughly to abelian varieties. With these tools, one &lt;br/&gt;expects further progress on related questions. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;the PI and his coworkers will establish precise conditions for &lt;br/&gt;the independence of the periods of certain one dimensional &lt;br/&gt;t-modules, called Drinfeld modules. Another approach to &lt;br/&gt;Nesterenko's recent work on the Ramanujan functions will also &lt;br/&gt;be attempted by means of determining the rational solutions to a&lt;br/&gt;certain differential equation. This would allow the application &lt;br/&gt;of the PI's Lojasiewicz inequality rather than the original&lt;br/&gt;fundamental, but considerably more complicated, independence&lt;br/&gt;criterion due to Philippon. Moreover the PI will provide a &lt;br/&gt;quite general arithmetic version of the fundamental Lojasiewicz&lt;br/&gt;inequality which is best possible in its important respects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal centers about the properties of numbers and&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. One central question is whether those numbers which&lt;br/&gt;arise in various contexts in mathematics (analysis or geometry) &lt;br/&gt;have unkown linkages. Some of the first research of this type &lt;br/&gt;over a hundred years ago resolved problems which had puzzled&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians for two millenia. One main objective of the &lt;br/&gt;present research is to show that such linkages do not exist in &lt;br/&gt;a broad setting analogous to certain central puzzles of today. &lt;br/&gt;In that setting, polynomials correspond to integers and power &lt;br/&gt;series correspond to real numbers. The core of this work will be &lt;br/&gt;carried out by the PI together with M.A. Papanikolas and G.W. &lt;br/&gt;Anderson. A coordination of quite diverse elements is crucial &lt;br/&gt;to establishing these results on the boundary between the broad &lt;br/&gt;fields of analysis, geometry, and number theory. In the classical &lt;br/&gt;case, the PI will try to develop an understanding of the behaviour &lt;br/&gt;of certain differential equations to simplify our view of certain &lt;br/&gt;recent work of Nesterenko. Just as one tries to show that there &lt;br/&gt;are no "hidden" linkages between values, one also strives to&lt;br/&gt;establish that polynomial values cannot be "unnaturally" small. &lt;br/&gt;The PI has one good version of such a result, and he will extend &lt;br/&gt;its applicability even further.</AbstractNarration>
