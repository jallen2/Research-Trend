    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0104030&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: James W. Cannon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We attempt to resolve the hyperbolic case of Thurston's&lt;br/&gt;Geometrization Conjecture for 3-dimensional manifolds. Among the&lt;br/&gt;many possible approaches, we choose to study the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;recursive properties of the fundamental group of the manifold. We&lt;br/&gt;concentrate on the asymptotic shingling patterns at infinity&lt;br/&gt;defined by the group and seek methods for proving that such&lt;br/&gt;patterns do or do not satisfy the necessary and sufficient&lt;br/&gt;conformality axiom which we introduced in our earlier studies. We&lt;br/&gt;study this problem in three contexts: (1) We study closed&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds with Gromov-hyperbolic group, with emphasis on the&lt;br/&gt;examination of concrete examples constructed by our new method of&lt;br/&gt;twisted-face-pairings; (2) We study general subdivision or&lt;br/&gt;local-replacement rules in the plane, where we have more freedom&lt;br/&gt;in constructing examples with special properties; and (3) We&lt;br/&gt;study branched coverings of the 2-sphere by the 2-sphere, where&lt;br/&gt;the corresponding problem is to some extent already solved by&lt;br/&gt;means of Thurston's combinatorial characterization of rational&lt;br/&gt;maps. It is in the third context that the connection with&lt;br/&gt;classical Teich- mueller theory becomes apparent; we are seeking&lt;br/&gt;an appropriate version of Teichmueller theory for our setting. In&lt;br/&gt;all of these contexts, we use the circle-packing programs of Ken&lt;br/&gt;Stephenson, the automatic group programs of Epstein, Holt, and&lt;br/&gt;Rees, and the program SnapPea of Jeff Weeks in conjunction with&lt;br/&gt;programs of the proposer and his coworkers to construct,&lt;br/&gt;geometrically optimize, and explore the patterns being studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;William P. Thurston has supplied us with a powerful conjectural&lt;br/&gt;picture of the spaces of 3-dimensional mathematics, the&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional manifolds. Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture is&lt;br/&gt;the most important unresolved problem in low dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology, even if one sets aside the case of spherical geometry&lt;br/&gt;where the conjecture implies the famous "million dollar" Poincare&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture. Thurston suggests that every 3-manifold can be&lt;br/&gt;divided in an intrinsic manner into pieces, each of which is&lt;br/&gt;modelled on one of eight natural geometries. Within each piece,&lt;br/&gt;one can apply well-understood algebraic and geometric techniques&lt;br/&gt;to derive properties of the manifold. This project seeks to&lt;br/&gt;resolve the generic case of the Thurston Conjecture, namely the&lt;br/&gt;case of hyperbolic geometry. The technique employed is to&lt;br/&gt;maximally unwind the manifold, that is, take its universal cover,&lt;br/&gt;and study the asymptotic properties of this cover. The cover can&lt;br/&gt;be studied combinatorially almost as a growing cellular organism&lt;br/&gt;as a plant or animal might be studied by a cell biologist. The&lt;br/&gt;cover can be studied computationally as a cellular automaton&lt;br/&gt;might be studied by a computer scientist. The cover can be&lt;br/&gt;studied analytically by methods of discrete dynamical systems or&lt;br/&gt;differential equations or conformal mapping.</AbstractNarration>
