    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0103884 (Bryant, Duke)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robert Bryant plans to apply the theory of differential systems,&lt;br/&gt;the method of equivalence, and methods from the calculus of variations&lt;br/&gt;to study a collection of problems in differential geometry and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics. In the first problem, motivated by mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physics, Bryant intends to study the geometry of connections compatible&lt;br/&gt;with either a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metric that admit&lt;br/&gt;parallel spinor fields and that differ from the Levi-Civita connection&lt;br/&gt;by a closed 3-form. In the second problem, Bryant wants to continue&lt;br/&gt;his investigations into the nature of singular special Lagrangian subvarieties&lt;br/&gt;and special Lagrangian foliations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the third&lt;br/&gt;problem, which concerns the study of the space of almost complex structures on&lt;br/&gt;6-manifolds, Bryant proposes to investigate several natural functionals on the space&lt;br/&gt;of such almost complex structures and the geometry of the extrema&lt;br/&gt;of these functionals. Fourth, Bryant plans to continue his study&lt;br/&gt;of the space of homologically volume minimizing cycles in compact Lie groups,&lt;br/&gt;with the goal of finding a complete classification of the volume minimizing&lt;br/&gt;cycles in each homology class in a compact, simple, simply connected Lie group.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, Bryant plans to continue his investigations into Finsler geometry,&lt;br/&gt;particularly the problem of classifying the spaces of constant&lt;br/&gt;flag curvature (the natural generalization to Finsler geometry&lt;br/&gt;of constant sectional curvature in the Riemannian case).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimization is a central problem in mathematics, in which one tries&lt;br/&gt;to select the 'best' configuration in a space of possible configurations&lt;br/&gt;of a model for a physical system. An example is the problem of navigating&lt;br/&gt;on a body of water in which one must take water currents into account&lt;br/&gt;in planning the 'best' path from origin to destination, where 'best' is&lt;br/&gt;taken to mean 'shortest time of traverse'. A path that is optimal for&lt;br/&gt;a short period (a 'geodesic') might not remain optimal if pursued far enough.&lt;br/&gt;This is known as instability. (For example, in a river where the current is&lt;br/&gt;faster in midstream it turns out that downstream geodesics are stable, but&lt;br/&gt;that upstream geodesics are not.) The geometric quantity that measures this&lt;br/&gt;notion of stability is known as 'curvature', since it was first identified&lt;br/&gt;in studies of the curvature of the Earth. Bryant's work studies curvature&lt;br/&gt;and 'over-determined' systems of differential equations, and is relevant&lt;br/&gt;to optimization problems in motion planning, control theory, robotics,&lt;br/&gt;and string theory models in high energy physics. Some of the specific&lt;br/&gt;problems he works on are aimed at applications to mathematical physics&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., connections with parallel spinor fields) or control theory (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;Finsler geometry, which is the subject that studies problems such as&lt;br/&gt;the navigation problem mentioned above), while others are aimed at more&lt;br/&gt;foundational questions about the nature of minimizers (e.g., volume&lt;br/&gt;minimizing cycles in Lie groups) or the limits and/or possibilities inherent&lt;br/&gt;in the current methods and techniques for minimization problems&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., special Lagrangian geometry and almost complex 6-manifolds).</AbstractNarration>
