    <AbstractNarration>Phase III Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) LSAMP&lt;br/&gt;proposes to (1) institutionalize its highly successful LSAMP Phase II activities,&lt;br/&gt;(2) double once again the degree rate from our current baseline to achieve 2,260 &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority science, mathematics, engineering, andtechnology (SMET)&lt;br/&gt;BS degrees in the year 2006, and (3) expand and link LSAMP graduates and Phase III&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP participating underrepresented minority SMET undergraduate students to our &lt;br/&gt;MGE@MSA AGEP and other AGEPs with high technology products that will help our &lt;br/&gt;students and graduates both in our service region and nationally. The Phase III WAESO&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP is the undergraduate component of a comprehensive, concerted, sequenced &lt;br/&gt;effort that helps students beginning in secondary school throughundergraduate, graduate&lt;br/&gt;school, and beyond, including the transition of college sophomores, juniors, and seniors &lt;br/&gt;toward graduate school and the development of high technology products with &lt;br/&gt;application or dissemination both regionally and nationally. Although, our LSAMP &lt;br/&gt;NSF funds will focus solely on undergraduate students, we will use non-NSF funds &lt;br/&gt;to support thousands of pre-college students and use both NSF AGEP and non-NSF &lt;br/&gt;funds to help hundreds of graduate students and graduates of Ph.D. or Master level &lt;br/&gt;programs beginning in the 7th grade and going through the doctorate and even beyond &lt;br/&gt;to faculty status or careers in the corporate or government sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the unique and highly effective features of our Phase II LSAMP that will &lt;br/&gt;be institutionalized in Phase III WAESO lie within the sequence and integration of &lt;br/&gt;the various levels of the project. For example, (1) Integrating pre-college and&lt;br/&gt;graduate study with our core undergraduate project in a coherent and&lt;br/&gt;effective way; (2) Giving scientists, specifically faculty members who are &lt;br/&gt;currently working with students in classrooms and laboratories and who review and &lt;br/&gt;rank projects which in turn also come from the field and need to compete for funds, &lt;br/&gt;primary control over project activities and the allocation of funds, including&lt;br/&gt;the flexibility to make mid-course corrections in the funding of deserving&lt;br/&gt;(or undeserving) projects, through their participation in the operational committees;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Using high-technology to produce and distribute underrepresented minority-focused&lt;br/&gt;SMET materials as well as to coordinate project components over great distances &lt;br/&gt;through the use of DVDs, CD-ROMs, the Internet, and the World Wide Web; and (4)&lt;br/&gt;Developing and maintain special programmatic initiatives directed toward each of&lt;br/&gt;our participating student populations, including American Indians. Thanks to strong&lt;br/&gt;long-term institutional support, we have the ability to not only meet the basic &lt;br/&gt;LSAMP cost-sharing requirements but, even more importantly, to meet the&lt;br/&gt;institutionalization costs of the new, third phase of the LSAMP program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the successes of Phase I in doubling the number of graduates per year of our&lt;br/&gt;target population and being above a similar doubling goal in Phase II, we propose to take &lt;br/&gt;on the formidable task of achieving B.S. degree rates reflective of the substantial &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority population of our region which is 25.8% American Indian,&lt;br/&gt;African American, and Hispanic. Thus, our long-term numerical goal in the year&lt;br/&gt;2011 of 2,858 SMET B.S. degrees awarded to American Indian, African American, and&lt;br/&gt;Hispanics as accomplishing parity with our regional population of these Americans.&lt;br/&gt;For the purposes of Phase III, we are establishing a goal of doubling the degree rate &lt;br/&gt;once again from our current baseline to achieve 2,260 degrees in the year 2006,&lt;br/&gt;which is well on the way to achieving parity.</AbstractNarration>
