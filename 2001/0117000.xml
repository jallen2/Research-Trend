    <AbstractNarration>The PI will convene, in February and again in August of 2002, a paired workshop-conference devoted to developing wide interdisciplinary approaches to environmental issues of broad public concern. This "New Directions" research conference will have a two-part invitational workshop and public conference structure. This structure will enable (1) transcending disciplinary limitations in addressing environmental issues, and (2) stimulating long-term interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research partnerships for tackling such issues. Together, the two meetings will break new ground in both the theoretical and practical aspects of interdisciplinary environmental research and education. The goals of this workshop and conference are: (a) to devise ways to more effectively situate scientific knowledge within society; (b) to bring the powerful resources of the humanities better to bear on societal questions; and (c) to create enduring partnerships across the disciplines, and between the broadest array of researchers and educators of all types and the public and private realms, in order to more successfully address environmental challenges. The February 2002 workshop will consist of 20-25 invited participants representing a wide range of perspectives: the Earth sciences, the humanities, humanistic-oriented social sciences, the corporate sector, and community groups. The August 2002 public conference will consist of the workshop participants, plus a larger group (of similarly wide background) who have responded to a call for papers on the theme of developing interdisciplinary, topical approaches to environmental challenges. The February workshop will launch a six-month period of collaboration across the disciplines and between knowledge producers and representatives of the public and private sector, helping to ensure that the August conference has the maximum possible effect. The overall goal of the paired meetings is to improve society's ability at bringing the insights of academic research to bear upon societal (especially environmental) problems, to devise ways to redirect the work of knowledge producers so that their research and scholarship is more pertinent to society.</AbstractNarration>
