    <AbstractNarration>Aldroubi&lt;br/&gt;0103104&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleagues develop a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;framework and fast computational schemes for the reconstruction&lt;br/&gt;of functions, signals or images from noisy, very large sampled&lt;br/&gt;data sets, acquired on nonuniform grids, by nonideal acquisition&lt;br/&gt;devices. The problem of nonuniform sampling and reconstruction&lt;br/&gt;is treated in the context of shift-invariant subspaces, Besov&lt;br/&gt;spaces, and in arbitrary dimensions. The theory is developed for&lt;br/&gt;the case when the samples are obtained from weighted averages.&lt;br/&gt;Density conditions for exact reconstruction are established. When&lt;br/&gt;the data are noisy, incomplete, or when the assumptions needed&lt;br/&gt;for exact reconstruction are not satisfied, bounds on the error&lt;br/&gt;between the reconstructed and original signal are derived in&lt;br/&gt;terms of the sampling densities, the averaging functionals, and&lt;br/&gt;the noise statistics. The development of the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;framework and the computational schemes requires a new set of&lt;br/&gt;techniques and ideas, and involves several areas of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;including wavelet theory, frame theory, functional analysis, and&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt; The project is motivated by problems arising in data&lt;br/&gt;transmission, geophysical exploration, astronomy, spectroscopy,&lt;br/&gt;and biomedical imaging. The problem of reconstructing a signal or&lt;br/&gt;an image from a set of nonuniform samples is encountered in many&lt;br/&gt;applications of signal or image processing. For example, the loss&lt;br/&gt;of data packets during transmission through internet or from&lt;br/&gt;satellites can be viewed as a nonuniform sampling and&lt;br/&gt;reconstruction problem. In geophysical exploration, the earth's&lt;br/&gt;magnetic field is measured by a combination of airborn, fast&lt;br/&gt;moving acquisition devices, as well as scattered stationary&lt;br/&gt;devices resulting in highly nonuniform sampling patterns, and a&lt;br/&gt;huge data set. The goal is to reconstruct the magnetic field and&lt;br/&gt;use it to reveal geological features. In fact, modern digital&lt;br/&gt;data processing of signals or images always uses a sampled&lt;br/&gt;version of the original analog signals or images. However, the&lt;br/&gt;sampling devices are never ideal, and the collected data consist&lt;br/&gt;of average samples. Moreover these data are often very large,&lt;br/&gt;incomplete, and corrupted by noise. The question then arises&lt;br/&gt;whether and how the original signal can be recovered from the&lt;br/&gt;data. Therefore the investigator aims to 1) quantify the&lt;br/&gt;conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a signal&lt;br/&gt;exactly from different sets of nonuniform average-samples; 2) use&lt;br/&gt;these analytical results to develop explicit, and computationally&lt;br/&gt;efficient reconstruction schemes; and 3) analyze the performance&lt;br/&gt;of the algorithms under adverse conditions, or when the data are&lt;br/&gt;incomplete or corrupted by noise. The development of a theory and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that perform well under stringent and realistic&lt;br/&gt;situations will help the analysis, processing and management of&lt;br/&gt;very large data sets obtained digitally by new acquisition&lt;br/&gt;modalities, and transmitted or received by communication networks&lt;br/&gt;such as the internet, cellular phones, and other distributed&lt;br/&gt;communication systems.</AbstractNarration>
