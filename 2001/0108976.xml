    <AbstractNarration>A new multivariable measurement approach to correlate melt phase separation with microscale and nanoscale structural organization in crystal-amorphous polymer blends with technologically useful properties is proposed. Significant improvements in technologies that govern new products by the polymer industry depend on the ability to correlate polymer structure resulting from melt phase separation, crystallization and processing conditions with desired properties. For potential biological applications, the microscale and nanoscale blend morphology can determine the overall function of the tissue scaffold or drug delivery device. However, a rapid and convenient method for characterizing and correlating the nanoscale and microscale morphology simultaneously has not been developed. In the proposed study, simultaneous small-angle light scattering (SALS)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) will be used to measure the microscale structure and averaged nanoscale quantities such as the fraction of crystallized material within the superstructures. A new SALS apparatus, which will allow one to perform scattering crystallization, will be constructed. Two blend systems, polyethylene oxide(PEO)/polyenaminonitrile (PEAN) and poly(caprolactone) (PCL)/poly(D, L-lactic acid) (PDLA) will be studied. PEAN is a novel amorphous polymer with excellent thermal stability and good mechanical properties for load bearing polymer film application in the aerospace and automotive industries. PCL/PDLA blends have important potential biomedical uses in the production of tissue scaffolds and drug delivery devices. Several parameters that will be used to determine the microscale and nanoscale morphology, crystallization kinetics, phase behavior and the enthalpy changes of the thermal transitions will obtained in one combined measurement. Stress-strain measurements will be performed on selected PEO/PEAN and PCL/PDLA blends to detect useful correlation between the blend morphology and mechanical properties (specifically the stress-strain behavior, Young's modulus, tensile strength, toughness and elongation at break). In collaboration with Rena Bizios (Department of Biomedical Engineering at Rennselaer), novel systematic studies will be conducted to investigate whether control of the properties of PDLA rich regions in PCL/PDLA blends by varying the phase separation process will in turn allow us to tailor their biological response including for example cell adhesion properties and the evolution of cells to functional tissue.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Comprehensive predictive structure-property of structure-biofunction models for polymer blends can be developed if the range of length scales probed by the proposed experiments can provide sufficient information for this purpose. If these predictive models and the proposed multivariable measurement method are integrated into the research and development process, a significant decrease in the time and effort for realizing the potential benefits of new biostable, biomedical and ecological polymer products can be made. This can help the US polymer industry gain an edge in the highly competitive mature global commodity market for new polymer products. With regard to biological applications, the used of simple, low cost biodegradable substrated for producing functional tissues could be a significant first step to alleviate the acute donor shortages for implants in the future. This SGER grant would make it possible to determine if the proposed multivariable measurement method can provide a rapid and convenient means for developing a fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in polymer blends.</AbstractNarration>
