    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0102955&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Zhou, Chongwu&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: NER: Carbon Nanotube Devices and Integrated Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to design, build and evaluate various novel nanotube devices and&lt;br/&gt;integrated systems. Specifically I propose to make n type field effect transistors (FET),&lt;br/&gt;nanotube p-n junctions, and an integrated single-molecule CMOS inverter. This research&lt;br/&gt;is exploratory in nature; however, if successful, will advance our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental properties of nanotubes and produce practical nanoscale devices for the real&lt;br/&gt;world.&lt;br/&gt;There has been a great deal of research into carbon nanotubes in the past few years. P&lt;br/&gt;type field effect transistors have been demonstrated consisting of semiconductive&lt;br/&gt;nanotubes with a silicon substrate backgate separated from the tube by a layer of SiO2.&lt;br/&gt;Despite the utmost interest in developing n type FETs to enable nanoscale CMOS&lt;br/&gt;circuits, the research effort has been hampered by lack of an effective doping method for&lt;br/&gt;nanotubes. I propose to demonstrate a simple, effective and reliable method to&lt;br/&gt;electrostatically dope nanotubes into n type, thus paving the way for n type FETs, p-n&lt;br/&gt;junctions and integrated systems. This new method will employ TiO2 instead of SiO2 as&lt;br/&gt;the gate dielectric. With a dielectric constant of 30 for TiO2, as compared to 3.8 for SiO2,&lt;br/&gt;the gate utilizing TiO2 will be seven times more effective than previously reported, and&lt;br/&gt;our preliminary analysis confirms that with a reasonable gate bias (~ 10 V), a nanotube&lt;br/&gt;can be electrostatically doped into n type, thereby producing an n type FETs.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, carbon nanotube p-n junctions will be demonstrated with a split-gate&lt;br/&gt;technique, by depositing TiO2 onto a semiconductive nanotube contacted with source and&lt;br/&gt;drain electrodes, and patterning two gate electrodes atop the TiO2, each covering half of&lt;br/&gt;the tube. By controlling these two gate biases independently, one can tune the left half&lt;br/&gt;tube into p type and the right half into n type, thus creating a p-n junction in between,&lt;br/&gt;which provides an ideal system for studying the depletion and screening in one&lt;br/&gt;dimension.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, a simple integrated system will be demonstrated by attaching an electrode to the&lt;br/&gt;center of a semiconductive nanotube in addition to the source and drain electrodes. This&lt;br/&gt;center electrode divides the nanotube into two segments and serves as the output of the&lt;br/&gt;circuit. The silicon substrate backgate with TiO2 dielectric layer will serve as the circuit&lt;br/&gt;input and be used to tune one tube segment to function as an n type FET and the other&lt;br/&gt;segment as a p type FET, thereby forming the worlds first single molecule inverter.</AbstractNarration>
