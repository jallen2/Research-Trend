    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0103626&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, Christopher Bishop, will study the geometric properties&lt;br/&gt;of conformal mappings in the plane and quasiconformal mappings in space,&lt;br/&gt;focusing on the expansion properties of such maps and investigating&lt;br/&gt;various applications to geometric function theory, dynamics and&lt;br/&gt;topology. The PI has shown that a result of Dennis Sullivan's&lt;br/&gt;concerning the geometry of convex&lt;br/&gt;bodies in hyperbolic three space implies a factorization&lt;br/&gt;theorem for conformal mappings in the plane and this, in turn,&lt;br/&gt;implies uniform bounds on the amount of&lt;br/&gt;contraction a conformal map in the plane can have. Finding the best constants&lt;br/&gt;in the factorization theorem has consequences for well&lt;br/&gt;known problems such as dimension distortion, integral means and Brennan's&lt;br/&gt;conjecture. The PI will continue his work on&lt;br/&gt;limit sets of Kleinian groups, a natural and important class of fractal sets.&lt;br/&gt;The questions here are mainly to estimate the fractal dimension of these sets&lt;br/&gt;and study the behavior of the dimension as the group is deformed. &lt;br/&gt;The PI will also work on the metric properties&lt;br/&gt;of harmonic measures, particularly results which quantify the &lt;br/&gt;idea that harmonicmeasure cannot be concentrated on a small set. Problems include the&lt;br/&gt;lower density conjecture, stability of harmonic measure and the growth rate&lt;br/&gt;of diffusion limited aggregation. A few other questions&lt;br/&gt;involving quasiconformal and biLipschitz maps are also considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conformal mappings are a class of functions which are important&lt;br/&gt;in many area of mathematics and which are closely related&lt;br/&gt;to mnay physical problems (fluid flow, heat conduction, &lt;br/&gt;electric fields, random growth models, ...) and have been &lt;br/&gt;intensively studied for many years. One of the fundamental &lt;br/&gt;properties of such maps is expansion; they tend to push &lt;br/&gt;points farther apart on average. Making this precise has &lt;br/&gt;motivated much research in mathematical analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The PI has discovered a new way of quantifying&lt;br/&gt;this expansion by approximating conformal maps by (the more&lt;br/&gt;general class of) quasiconformal maps and showing these&lt;br/&gt;approximations may be taken with a very strong &lt;br/&gt;expansion property. This has given a clearer understanding of some&lt;br/&gt;known results and has led to progress on new problems.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, it implies new results about Kleinian groups&lt;br/&gt;(these are important examples of conformal dynamical systems, &lt;br/&gt;and hence a contribution to the more general area of &lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems, fractals and chaos). The PI's approach &lt;br/&gt;also ties the behavior of conformal maps to the geometry &lt;br/&gt;three dimensional hyperbolic space; this connection seems &lt;br/&gt;to be new and should lead to many interesting problems &lt;br/&gt;and more interaction between the areas of complex &lt;br/&gt;analysis and three dimensional topology (already connected &lt;br/&gt;in other ways). He will also investigate the computational&lt;br/&gt;aspects of this connection which may lead to new methods &lt;br/&gt;of computing conformal maps and Greens functions (important&lt;br/&gt;for a variety of applications). The PI will also continue &lt;br/&gt;his investigation of other problems including the geometry of random&lt;br/&gt;paths such as Brownian motion, the stability under&lt;br/&gt;perturbation of certain dynamical systems and fundamental&lt;br/&gt;geometric properties of conformal and quasiconformal mappings.</AbstractNarration>
