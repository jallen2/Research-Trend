    <AbstractNarration>Protein mutation occurs as part of the evolutionary process, through mutagenesis and through post-translational modification. As yet no resource has been developed that permits the systematic study of the effect of all these mutations on protein structure, and hence function, even though the literature is full of individual instances. The new resource will contain all relevant PDB structures as its starting point and will be updated along with PDB. A prototype has been established at http://pmr.sdsc.edu. The production resource will bring together sequence, structure, and literature information using novel information acquisition tools and provide query and visualization tools for global analysis of the effects of mutation. Research in protein structure and engineering will be enhanced through using the resource for prediction and for confirmation of methods. The resource will be accessible through the web and other users may write software for doing direct querying of the resource.</AbstractNarration>
