    <AbstractNarration>Both asset pricing and investment theory rely critically on our understanding of investors' portfolio choices. One of the most studied puzzles in financial economics is that, given the returns and volatility of publicly traded equity, investors seem to allocate too little wealth to stocks. That is the premium demanded for holding equity appears too high given observed investment in the stock market. However, while most of the literature has focused on publicly traded equity, this project analyzes the holdings of households in privately held firms. The private equity market is at least as large as the public equity market. Thus, it is equally important to understand investment behavior and the risk-return trade-off in this market. The project analyzes both the risk of private equity as a whole as well as the cross-sectional distribution of realized private equity across households, using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances and the Flow of Funds Accounts and supplementary sources. Preliminary results show that most private equity is held by households who have a large proportion of their wealth invested in a single non-publicly traded company; the average returns on private and public equity are similar, but investing in a single private company is substantially riskier than investing in an index of publicly traded equity. Together these facts imply that the typical owner of private equity faces a much worse risk-return trade-off than could be obtained by investing in an index of publicly traded equity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the project explains the puzzle of poor risk -return trade-off for owners of private equity. The project examines theories of moral hazard due to partially unobservable entrepreneurial effort and theories of asymmetric information in which entrepreneurs are better informed about firm prospects than potential outside investors. making it difficult for entrepreneurs to obtain a fair value when selling equity. The project uses previously unexploited data on hours worked by entrepreneurs as well as alternative measures of ownership to provide evidence on the theory of moral hazard. To test theories of asymmetric information, the investigators have obtained data for pre- and post-IPO ownership shares for shareholders in about 400 initial public offerings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rational entrepreneurs should realize based on observing the large average ownership shares of current entrepreneurs, that they would need to hold large undiversified positions in their companies conditional on entry. Given the poor risk-return trade-off oil private equity, it is puzzling why, entrepreneurs then decide to enter. Low entrepreneurial risk aversion. non-pecuniary benefits, and over optimism and misperceived risk are possible explanations. The project provides evidence to rule out low risk aversion, leaving the distinction between alternative explanations for future work.</AbstractNarration>
