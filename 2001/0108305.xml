    <AbstractNarration>0108305&lt;br/&gt;Hanna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. Adel Hanna, Manager, Environmental Research at MCNC, Raleigh, North Carolina and Dr. Mohamed El-Shahawy, Astronomy and Meteorology Department, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. The goal of this research is to provide a clear understanding of the multiple and complex processes that contribute to air pollution episodes in Egypt. They will pursue two objectives: (1) evaluate meteorological conditions during the fall season (September, October, November) by analyzing ten years' worth of data (1990-1999), with special emphasis on the air pollution episode of October-November 1999; and (2) characterize the role of biomass burning in aggravating air pollution episodes over Cairo and adjacent cities in Egypt. During the last week of October 1999 and continuing for a period of two to three weeks, Cairo, and cities to the north along the Nile Delta were exposed to especially high levels of a number of air pollutants. The incident has drawn attention to the problem of biomass burning and other anthropogenic emission sources in the Nile Delta and greater Cairo area. This study will improve our ability to predict air pollution episodes, thus allowing people with various health problems to avoid certain activities during high-pollution periods. It will also improve our understanding of the roles played by emissions, location, terrain, and meteorological conditions in aggravating air pollution conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The project supports collaboration between two investigators, with excellent qualifications both by training, experience and knowledge of the situation they will be studying, to carry out this research. With the meteorological data and the emissions scenario, the PIs plan to use a comprehensive air quality model that has been applied to numerous geographic locations in North America. The application in Egypt will provide insight into any limitations in the use of the air quality model. This is particularly important, as global air quality models should be in agreement with regional and local models. The proposed activity should also lead to improvements in the air quality model by including new types of environments different from those for which the air quality model was initially developed, such as biomass burning, which is likely to be a leading contributor to the air pollution. This activity strongly supports the adaptation and transfer of technology in protecting the air quality and health of the citizens of Egypt, and will provide a process for extension to other locations as well. A US graduate student will participate in this project and will gain experience in international scientific collaboration. The proposal meets INT objectives in supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest, and where there are potential societal benefits. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
