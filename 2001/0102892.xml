    <AbstractNarration>The Living and Learning Science Retention Program (LALSRP) at Saint &lt;br/&gt;Augustine's College is designed to facilitate entry into the junior year by providing a &lt;br/&gt;support system for entering freshmen and sophomore science, mathematics and computer &lt;br/&gt;science (SMC) majors. A comprehensive approach to provide a support system will be &lt;br/&gt;accomplished by implementing the following objectives: &lt;br/&gt;1. To revise and update curriculum to incorporate cooperative learning which will &lt;br/&gt;enhance study skills and generate independent learners; &lt;br/&gt;2. To provide participants with intramural research experiences which will increase &lt;br/&gt;their analytical reasoning skills and provide hands-on laboratory experiences; &lt;br/&gt;3. To build students' confidence so that they can successfully pursue an &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate degree in science and technology by providing positive role &lt;br/&gt;models, mentors and a strong academic support system; &lt;br/&gt;4. To assist participants in the understanding of the process involved in pursuing a &lt;br/&gt;degree in science and technology by offering seminars, workshops and field trips; &lt;br/&gt;and &lt;br/&gt;5. To enhance and develop faculty participants by providing research and curriculum &lt;br/&gt;development opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to accomplish the stated objectives, the program will consist of five components: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Curriculum Enrichment which will include a Pre-freshman Summer Bridge Program, &lt;br/&gt;Enrichment Center and a Village of Science and Technology (VOSAT); (2) &lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate Research Experience; (3) Seminars and Workshops; (4) Scholarships and &lt;br/&gt;(5) Faculty Development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will enhance the living and learning community on the campus of &lt;br/&gt;Saint Augustine's College. It will serve as a model that can be replicated across the &lt;br/&gt;campus and can also be applied to other disciplines. It is anticipated that by the end of &lt;br/&gt;the 5-year funding period, the number of SMC graduates at Saint Augustine's College &lt;br/&gt;will increase 2 fold. In five years the campus will have an established infrastructure to &lt;br/&gt;support the transition of freshmen into the junior year. The dormitory VOSAT in &lt;br/&gt;particular, will stimulate scientific and technological discussions among majors and &lt;br/&gt;nonmajors on the campus. This proposed Living and Learning Science Retention &lt;br/&gt;Program will support 30-50 students each year and impact approximately 1,400 &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students who reside on the campus of Saint Augustine's College. This &lt;br/&gt;program will serve as a model that can be replicated on any campus that has a minority &lt;br/&gt;based population.</AbstractNarration>
