    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59) &lt;br/&gt;This project develops a prototype package of educational materials to facilitate the adoption of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) into sophomore-level mechanics courses. The objective of this project is to create PBL-based materials sufficient to cover those topics in an undergraduate dynamics course typically covered in one semester. These new materials are going to include (i) the relevant sections of a dynamics textbook, and (ii) enough homework and example problems, with emphasis on motion over intervals of space and time, to get through a semester. A subset of these materials is going to be tested in the fall of 2002 on a limited basis, in concert with the textbook that is currently being used. In the spring of 2003, at least one section of undergraduate dynamics is going to be taught using the newly created materials instead of a currently available textbook. Baseline and full assessments are going to be done during the spring 2002 semester and during the 2002-2003 academic year. In addition, through an agreement with McGraw-Hill, the materials are going to be reviewed by the mechanics faculty at 10-15 universities. At the end of the project period, the first draft of the textbook is going to be prepared. Upon the completion of this project, a proposal to complete the development of the full package, including substantial web- and team-based components is going to be submitted.</AbstractNarration>
