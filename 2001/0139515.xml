    <AbstractNarration>The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), a consortium of 64 research universities, plans to implement a three-year REU program at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. This project will provide hands-on, field-oriented research experiences to undergraduate students from throughout the United States, including minority students identified through the OTS Minority Scholars Program. This program provides support for ten undergraduates each year to have a ten-week research experience at La Selva, located in the lowland rainforest of Costa Rica. Students selected to participate in the REU Program will be paired with a research mentor at La Selva and will be responsible for supervising all aspects of the student's research design;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though the students targeted for the REU research experience will be participants in OTS' Undergraduate Program, REU fellowships will also be available on a competitive basis to undergraduates who have not participated in an OTS undergraduate course. Most importantly, through the OTS National Fellowship Advisory Committee a major effort will be made to recruit students from under-represented groups in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals and objectives of the REU Program at La Selva are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Encourage student interest in careers in field research and tropical ecology. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Establish a clear understanding of the design of field experiments and the logic and application of statistical analysis. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Build skills in the interpretation of the results of scientific experiments and the communication of these results to both technical and non-technical audiences. &lt;br/&gt;(4) To introduce students through scientific study to the importance of tropical ecosystems and facilitate a full understanding of evolution and ecology. &lt;br/&gt;(5) Increase the participation in research of women, ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students will have an immersion experience in a tropical rain forest setting that will likely become a career-determining summer. They will develop intellectual and practical skills in one of the world's most important ecosystems and contribute to improved understanding of the biodiversity conservation and ecological research priorities.</AbstractNarration>
