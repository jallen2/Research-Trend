    <AbstractNarration>Jarvis Christian College, ``the college with the personal touch and where &lt;br/&gt;dreams come true,'' proposes an aggressive and comprehensive model Historically &lt;br/&gt;Black College and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), engaging a &lt;br/&gt;community of academic partners working together to significantly increase minority &lt;br/&gt;participation and access to science careers. The Program goal is to develop, &lt;br/&gt;implement, evaluate and institutionalize a program that will achieve and sustain a &lt;br/&gt;high quality and competitive science, mathematics, engineering and technology &lt;br/&gt;(SMET) education program. The comprehensive program proposed for Jarvis &lt;br/&gt;emphasizes the following four elements: Pre-College Outreach Programs; &lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate Student Scholars; Faculty Development Opportunities; and &lt;br/&gt;Curriculum, Equipment and Laboratory Development. The specific objectives are: &lt;br/&gt;(1) to implement a summer enhancement and skills development summer workshop &lt;br/&gt;for rising high school students who have demonstrated an interest and aptitude in &lt;br/&gt;the science areas that will ensure that 80% of the participants will complete the &lt;br/&gt;twelfth grade and enroll in college as a SMET major; (2) to implement a summer &lt;br/&gt;``bridge'' program for students entering Jarvis in the Fall that will impact 90% &lt;br/&gt;success rate during the first year; (3) to develop an implement a Scholars program &lt;br/&gt;customized to achieve 90% undergraduate retention and graduation rates and &lt;br/&gt;result in at least 70% enrollment in graduate or professional SMET programs; (4)to &lt;br/&gt;develop and implement a comprehensive faculty development program, develop &lt;br/&gt;new curricular offerings and expand existing courses for improvement and (5) to &lt;br/&gt;increase diversity and the number of SMET majors by 20% annually. &lt;br/&gt;All proposed activities support the mission of the National Science &lt;br/&gt;Foundation, ``to provide access to quality science education for all students'', and &lt;br/&gt;the mission of Jarvis Christian College, ``to provide a quality education to increase &lt;br/&gt;the competitiveness of its students in post-baccalaureate efforts.'' The extensive &lt;br/&gt;evaluation process and the involvement of the total college community and the &lt;br/&gt;community partners will insure its success. This proposed Jarvis Program &lt;br/&gt;represents the model for ``Creating Windows of Opportunity for Success in the &lt;br/&gt;SMET areas.''</AbstractNarration>
