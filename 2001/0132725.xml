    <AbstractNarration>The consortium between Michigan State University and Florida State&lt;br/&gt;University proposes the construction of a highly efficient,&lt;br/&gt;large-area neutron detector for the detection of high-energy&lt;br/&gt;neutrons to be used in experiments with fast rare isotopes at the&lt;br/&gt;National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). This&lt;br/&gt;consortium is joined by Ball State University, Central Michigan&lt;br/&gt;University, Concordia College in Moorhead, Minn., Hope College,&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University at South Bend, Millikin University, Western&lt;br/&gt;Michigan University, and Westmont College, each of which will&lt;br/&gt;assemble and test one complete layer of the detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed detector consists of 144 horizontal blocks of plastic&lt;br/&gt;scintillator arranged in 9 layers of 16 detectors each, covering an&lt;br/&gt;area of 2.0 m wide by 1.6 m high. The detector is position&lt;br/&gt;sensitive and features multi-hit capability. The addition of&lt;br/&gt;passive iron converters enhances the detection efficiency for&lt;br/&gt;neutrons with energies above 100 MeV for an average efficiency of up&lt;br/&gt;to 70%. The high detection efficiency will allow the investigation&lt;br/&gt;of very neutron-rich nuclei that can only be produced with small&lt;br/&gt;intensities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detector will be used in connection with the new sweeper magnet&lt;br/&gt;with its focal plane detectors in stand-alone mode as well as with&lt;br/&gt;the combination of sweeper magnet and the S800 magnetic&lt;br/&gt;spectrograph. It will therefore be essential for the experimental&lt;br/&gt;program at the coupled cyclotron facility. The detector can be&lt;br/&gt;optimized for even higher beam energies with only minor&lt;br/&gt;modifications due to its modular design. It could be the first&lt;br/&gt;detector to be used for fast fragmentation beams at the Rare Isotope</AbstractNarration>
