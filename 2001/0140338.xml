    <AbstractNarration>March 11, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;PI: Luis Caffarelli [caffarel@math.utexas.edu], University of Texas, Austin&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0140338&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research focus in a series of phenomena that bring together&lt;br/&gt;different areas of non linear PDE. For instance, a flame front propagating in a layered medium brings together the interaction of the fast phase transition at the edge of the flame, with the linking of large scales (front speeds) and small scales (possibly random , thin layering).&lt;br/&gt;Recent models of front formation, bring together the interaction of&lt;br/&gt;optimal allocation,that provides the " variational framework" for front&lt;br/&gt;formation (the Monge Ampere equation ) with the issue of how vorticity is&lt;br/&gt;transported within, and affects the front. Finally, problems in financial engineering, bring together fully non linear equations ( for instance as "extremals" or intervals of&lt;br/&gt;"trust" when only rough bounds on volatility and correlations are&lt;br/&gt;available) with issues of phase transition , when trading strategy&lt;br/&gt;changes discontinuously at certain values of the parameters,or there are&lt;br/&gt;constraints on the range of trading, and homogeneisation, when the&lt;br/&gt;underlying space changes randomly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We plan to study several models from different sciences that bring&lt;br/&gt;together interactions of complementary non linear phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;A good example would be flame propagation in a thinly layered&lt;br/&gt;material: Observed at short range, the flame front will "wiggle", moving&lt;br/&gt;faster in some of the layers, depending on their composition.&lt;br/&gt;From far away, the flame will appear as a homogeneous front.&lt;br/&gt;Its speed , though, will depend in a very subtle way from both the nature&lt;br/&gt;of the ignition process at the edge of the flame ( free boundary&lt;br/&gt;problem) and the properties of the very fine, ( possibly randomly&lt;br/&gt;organized, as it usually occurs in nature) thin layering.&lt;br/&gt;Another example has to do with the formation of weather fronts: according&lt;br/&gt;to some models, globally the front organizes itself trying to " spread its&lt;br/&gt;energy" in an optimal way, and within, vorticity ( the "rotational&lt;br/&gt;component" of wind) is transported in an interactive way with the front&lt;br/&gt;organization. A third example comes from financial engineering when seeking optimal ( or&lt;br/&gt;safest) trading strategies, but , as in most cases, only a rough knowledge&lt;br/&gt;is available of the way different ways in which different components of&lt;br/&gt;the portfolio, or parameters ( interest rates, exchange rates, etc&lt;br/&gt;) interact.This rough or incomplete knowledge, gives rise to non linear&lt;br/&gt;strategies, that couple with constraints in the trading range,&lt;br/&gt;discontinuous trading strategies, etc.</AbstractNarration>
