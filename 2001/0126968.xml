    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;The science departments at Sweet Briar College are making a strong commitment to enhancing the preparation of new teachers by developing a set of new science courses for the undergraduate pre-service teacher. These courses, Chemistry by Inquiry, Life &amp; Earth Science by Inquiry, and Physics by Inquiry, fulfill the newly mandated requirements for teacher licensure by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Our new Science by Inquiry curriculum supports National Science Education Standards and is modeling for pre-service teachers "best-practices" in inquiry-based and hands-on approaches to teaching.&lt;br/&gt;This project is building upon a strong commitment to undergraduate science education and a commitment by the science faculty to outreach activities in the community. In addition our project is informed by national efforts in undergraduate science reform, including similarly focused NSF-funded projects: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Steven Fifield, et. al., "Integrating Inquiry-Based Science and Education Methods Courses in a 'Science Semester' for Future Elementary Teachers" (NSF award no. 0088527), University of Delaware. This is a problem-based learning project.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Sally Jean, "Project Inspire: Investigations in Science for Pre-Service Teachers; Promoting and Producing Inquiry-Based Relevant Experiences" (NSF award no. 0088646), Keene State University. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Alfonso M. Albano, "Building Bridges: Science Education Reform at Bryn Mawr College" (NSF award no. 9850090), Bryn Mawr College. &lt;br/&gt;Through adaptations of these programs we are creating science courses for pre-service undergraduate teachers that inspire them to create and discover. Our objectives in implementing this new curriculum are to provide the newly trained teachers with content mastery and hands-on science experiences and activities which are directly transferable to the NK-6 classroom, and to do so in an environment which encourages open-ended investigation and active learning. Students who complete these courses develop competency in&lt;br/&gt;science methodology, acquire a good attitude toward science and the scientific process, and learn the requisite skills (written, oral, and quantitative) to be successful teachers of science.</AbstractNarration>
