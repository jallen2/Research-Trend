    <AbstractNarration>Abstract- DMS-0104007-Geometric Variational Problems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to continue the study, joint with &lt;br/&gt;R. Schoen, of constrained variational&lt;br/&gt;problems for lagrangian cycles. In its most basic form the problem &lt;br/&gt;can be posed as follows: Consider a symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifold with a metric compatible with the symplectic form. Fix a &lt;br/&gt;homology class that can be represented by a lagrangian cycle. &lt;br/&gt;Find a lagrangian cycle that minimizes volume &lt;br/&gt;among all lagrangian cycles representing this class and derive optimal regularity of this cycle. &lt;br/&gt;In the case that the symplectic manifold is Kaehler,&lt;br/&gt;with Kaehler-Einstein metric, sufficient regularity of the minimizer &lt;br/&gt;implies that the minimizer is both lagrangian and minimal (zero mean curvature). &lt;br/&gt;If the first Chern class is negative such submanifolds could be unique, in a suitable sense,&lt;br/&gt;and then useful in understanding the geometry of the ambient manifold. &lt;br/&gt;If the Kaehler manifold is a Calabi-Yau manifold sufficient regularity implies &lt;br/&gt;that the minimizer is a calibrated submanifold, a special lagrangian submanifold.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to investigate the existence and regularity of this and &lt;br/&gt;related varitional problems and to study the consequences of these results on the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of Kaehler-Einstein manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A consequence of the proposal is an existence theorem for special &lt;br/&gt;lagrangian submanifolds of a Calabi-Yau manifold.&lt;br/&gt;This result is an essential part of the program proposed by &lt;br/&gt;Strominger-Yau-Zaslow for the geometric construction of "mirror&lt;br/&gt;symmetry". Mirror symmetry is one of the most interesting and &lt;br/&gt;important problems currently being studied in mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics. At its core it proposes a duality between a class of &lt;br/&gt;manifolds called Calabi-Yau manifolds. This duality allows &lt;br/&gt;computations to be performed on one manifold that yield a result for its "mirror". &lt;br/&gt;Thus computations that are otherwise extremely difficult can be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;The realization of mirror symmetry will effect such diverse subjects &lt;br/&gt;as algebraic geometry, differential geometry, topology, partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations and string theory.&lt;br/&gt;The current interest in this subject helps bridge the gap between &lt;br/&gt;physics and mathematics. In two-dimensions our proposal has some &lt;br/&gt;close analogies to a well-known model problem&lt;br/&gt;in non-linear elasticity. The regularity theory developed here will &lt;br/&gt;shed light on the difficult regularity problems of that theory. &lt;br/&gt;Finally this problem is the first attempt to make a systematic study &lt;br/&gt;of a variational problem with a geometric constaint. &lt;br/&gt;This idea will have other important applications in &lt;br/&gt;geometry and its applications.</AbstractNarration>
