    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the National Research Council's Solid State Sciences Committee (SSSC). The National Research Council is the working arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. The SSSC monitors field of materials research in the United States and provides guidance to federal agencies regarding their materials research programs. The Committee responds to requests for technical information and assistance; initiates conduct and publication of studies in the solid state sciences, acts as an educational resource for the community of the solid state opportunities; and provides a forum for discussion among solid state and materials scientists and Washington policymakers. The SSSC will continue these activities in the next three years, with projects such as the Materials Forum 2002 for Washington policy makers. The interface between the materials research communities and the biology communities will receive attention: a brochure at the lay level describing the interface between biology and the materials sciences will be produced. In addition a more technical study of "biomolecular materials" will be developed. The central role that solid state and materials science play in the emerging field of nanotechnology will also receive timely attention. The output of NRC SSSC an timely and useful materials and information that is widely disseminated to educational institutions, the Federal Government and technical industries. The project is co-funded with the Department of Energy and National Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the National Research Council's Solid State Sciences Committee (SSSC). The National Research Council is the working arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. The SSSC will sponsor a Forum for discussion between solid state and materials scientists and Washington policy makers. In addition the SSSC will monitor and report on several topics of great current interest, such as nanotechnology, biomolecular materials, and materials in microgravity environments. The resulting materials will be widely disseminated to educational institutions, the Federal Government and technical industries.</AbstractNarration>
