    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds to support the participation of approximately 7-9 students in the Symposium of the Materials Research Society (MRS) titled "Scanning Probe Microscopy - Frontiers in NanoBio Science" which will be held in the frames of 2010 MRS Spring meeting at Moscone West Convention Center, San Francisco, CA, April 5-9, 2010. The symposium will focus on recent developments in Scanning Probe Microscopy techniques and applications to nanomaterials, soft matter research, biotechnology, and life science with the intent of bringing together scientists from different disciplines and encouraging discussions at the cross-disciplinary level. One of the major topics is the study of nano- bio- mechanics, a proliferating area among SPM applications. One of the key purposes of the symposium is to show the importance of fundamental research of biomechanics at nanoscale. Student recipients will be selected by an ad-hoc selection committee based upon their research statements, adviser recommendations, including underrepresented status, paper authorship, and degrees being pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium serves as a knowledge dissemination platform of innovations in the area of scanning probe microscopy for student participants. The students will share and learn the state-of-the-art and challenges of the nanomechanics research through invited presentations and regular paper presentation sessions. They will also have opportunities to interact with industrial researchers, professors, and other students. Such interactions will facilitate future domestic and international collaborations. This symposium experience will be invaluable for developing the skills of this highly talented group of students who will be the next generation of industry professionals and academics.</AbstractNarration>
