    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will enable detection of open circuit failures in semiconductor packages and integrated circuits with an accuracy of 10 microns by extending capabilities of magnetic current imaging. This has been one of the most difficult problems encountered by the industry today due to increasing complexity and shrinking of leading edge designs. The only technique available today is time domain reflectometry with practical resolution of 1-2 mm and time consuming layer-by-layer deprocessing. There is a critical need for a faster, non-destructive and more reliable technique capable of locating opens at a level commensurate with package level wiring approaching 10 microns pitch. It is proposed to use magnetic current imaging with a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device&lt;br/&gt;(SQUID) to solve this critical need by analyzing high frequency signals effects at the defect location. It is expected that this approach will be able to detect opens with a resolution of about 10 microns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are: it will enable semiconductor companies to bring product to market faster and with greater reliability by rapidly finding and eliminating sources of open defects; it will benefit the nation by accelerating the introduction of advanced electronics that continuously improve quality of life for consumers, and bring opportunity gains that enhance the competitiveness of American industry.</AbstractNarration>
