    <AbstractNarration>The PI will study three types of problems about stochastic partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations (SPDEs) and backward stochastic differential &lt;br/&gt;equations (BSDEs). Firstly, he will build a connection between SPDEs &lt;br/&gt;and BSDEs; and will use it to prove the strong uniqueness and regularity &lt;br/&gt;properties for the solutions to such SPDEs. He will also study the rare events&lt;br/&gt;phenomena for financial market using large deviation principle.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, the PI will derive a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) for &lt;br/&gt;stochastic optimal control problems arising from real world applications &lt;br/&gt;where the coefficients of the systems are not smooth. This will lead to two &lt;br/&gt;new classes of BSDEs. He will study their solutions and will explore the &lt;br/&gt;numerical approximation for these. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;the PI will consider the parameter estimation&lt;br/&gt;problem based on partial information. The key to the proof of the&lt;br/&gt;consistency of such estimates is heavily dependent on the&lt;br/&gt;establishment of a filtering stability result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is motivated from the study of certain population&lt;br/&gt;models, the wireless communication and the mathematical finance. &lt;br/&gt;The PI will develop mathematic tools to study SPDEs and BSDEs arising from these problems. &lt;br/&gt;The results obtained will be applied to various real world applications for the benefit&lt;br/&gt;to the society. For example, the SMP can be applied to the power control&lt;br/&gt;problem to serve the society in improving the efficiency of the&lt;br/&gt;communication network. The study of the financial market will help&lt;br/&gt;the government to regulate the market; especially, the large&lt;br/&gt;deviation problem will help to characterize&lt;br/&gt;rare events in the financial market. The parameter estimation&lt;br/&gt;problem can be used to locate various targets including the hidden&lt;br/&gt;source of pollution. Long-term effects on graduate and post-graduate training of students in stochastic analysis and optimal control are also expected.</AbstractNarration>
