    <AbstractNarration>This research project uses photonuclear reactions with polarized beams and targets to investigate the properties of the nucleon and nucleon resonances with Compton scattering and to study heavy nuclei through photofission. The group will measure the polarizabilities of the neutron with unprecedented accuracy, providing data for the first time on currently unknown quantities such as the nucleon spin polarizabilities. Such data permits precision tests of effective field theories, lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations and predictions of the standard model of nuclear physics. The comprehensive program of Compton scattering on the proton and neutron will extract the electromagnetic polarizabilities with high accuracy. The photofission studies with polarized photons exploits the strong variation of the beam asymmetry in the direct neutron production. The measurements provide a database for developing nuclear forensics and expand our understanding of this fundamental nuclear reaction. A collaboration has been assembled to measure beam-target asymmetries for meson production with polarized neutrons in a polarized HD target at Jefferson Lab. This group will purify the commercial grade HD gas for target production. Although the HD target is ideal for use in secondary beams, the JMU group will also, with collaborators from UVA, investigate the possibility of operating a dynamically polarized HD target for use in primary beams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program is integrated with the teaching mission of James Madison University (JMU) on multiple levels. It fits well with the new Applied Nuclear Physics (ANP) program currently under development at JMU. The synergy between this program and the ANP curriculium and our advanced laboratory experience will provide students with an expanded nuclear physics experience. More advanced undergraduates, particularly those with off-campus experience, will mentor younger students. The students bring their knowledge and enthusiasm to teaching middle school students in our annual demonstration show. Program continuity and solid student work habits are fostered by student communication through a variety of venues including technical notes on the web and paper presentation at conferences. This program will be integrated with the four NSF REU programs in the college to provide an immersive experience each summer. The on-campus opportunities in low-temperature systems and gas analysis are unique. Research and teaching at JMU are recognized as two facets of the same process. This integration of research and education continues to be one of the hallmarks of the highly rated undergraduate experience at JMU.</AbstractNarration>
