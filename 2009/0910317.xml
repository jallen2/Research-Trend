    <AbstractNarration>Monogamy is characterized by the formation of strong and selective preferences for a specific partner ("pair-bonding"). Pair-bonding is associated with a number of significant changes in both behavior and physiology; however, the mechanisms for these changes are not completely understood. This research will explore a potential cellular mechanism for neural adaptations involved in the social behavior of a monogamous rodent, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). Specifically, the studies will focus on a unique protein, delta-FosB, which has emerged as a potential molecular 'switch' mediating long-term adaptations in the brain. This protein has been shown to accumulate in the brains of animals that are repeatedly exposed to drugs, food-reinforcement and wheel-running. However, the role of this protein in naturalistic, species-typical behavior is not well characterized. The proposed research consists of three goals: 1) examine delta-FosB accumulation in the brain following the formation and maintenance of a pair bond, 2) explore whether increasing levels of delta-FosB in the brain facilitates pair bond formation in the monogamous prairie vole, and 3) examine region-specific delta-FosB accumulation as a result of social separation (a chronic stressor and model of 'grief'). This study is designed to expand understanding of the evolution and neurobiology of social behavior. This research will also inform our understanding of the biology of attachment, grief and mourning in humans, as social bonds are a critical component of human behavior. Finally, this research will provide training in neuroscience for a female graduate student and multiple undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
