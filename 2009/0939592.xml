    <AbstractNarration>The Xanthomonas Genomics Conference 2009 will provide a venue for researchers from around the globe to share results and ideas. Xanthomonas constitutes the largest and most important group of plant-associated bacteria. Members of the genus cause diseases on many crop and ornamental species, as well as model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, tomato, and Medicago truncatula. Genomics is at the center of a revolution in Xanthomonas biology. Genome sequence-enabled studies are leading to a better understanding of Xanthomonas signaling and effector molecules. These studies, integrated with host plant genome-enabled research, are elucidating important plant processes. Next generation sequencing technologies are accelerating discovery. A major goal of this conference is to establish consensus objectives, standardized technologies, and common resources that will promote continued rapid progress. The 24 confirmed speakers are leaders and emerging leaders in Xanthomonas research, plant-pathogen interactions, and related fields. Xanthomonas is rapidly becoming the premier model for understanding functional, regulatory, and evolutionary aspects of plant-bacterial interactions. As Xanthomonas genomics continues to drive advances in fundamental biology, it will similarly drive the development of refined diagnostic, epidemiological, and other tools to prevent and control the many plant diseases members of the genus cause, and potentially other bacterial diseases of plants and even animals. To broaden the impact of the meeting, a white paper stating the conclusions of the roundtable discussions will be disseminated. Travel grants and fee discounts will be offered to facilitate attendance of young scientists, women and underrepresented minorities. All scheduled sessions will include student and postdoctoral speakers.</AbstractNarration>
