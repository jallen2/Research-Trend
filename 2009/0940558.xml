    <AbstractNarration>Atmospheric Sciences (41)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is enhancing experiential learning opportunities for students enrolled in an introductory atmospheric science course by constructing an environmental instrumentation laboratory that is integrating advanced equipment and preparing students for research, creating instrument-based experiential learning, and expanding understanding of how faculty adopt innovative instructional approaches. The project is increasing student proficiency related to the underlying principles and sources of uncertainty associated with environmental instrumentation, and enhancing student confidence to use technologies to observe the environment and solve real-world problems. Experienced faculty in the Departments of Atmospheric Sciences, Biology, and Mechanical Engineering , and staff from the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence, are working together to redesign an introductory course focusing on snow and wind. The course is attracting students interested in winter snow activities, and is providing them with active learning opportunities that rely on state-of-the-art real-time access to weather information. The course is also addressing wind energy, and environmental science and engineering students are benefiting from improved experiences with various instrument technologies that are pertinent to the wind energy industry. A wide range of non-majors, STEM majors, and atmospheric sciences majors are using the sustainable laboratory facility that is being developed by the project. Commitment of equipment and training from a major environmental instrumentation company is facilitating the development of and is helping to sustain the laboratory facility. The project is integrating fundamental collaborative and active learning principles that are engaging students individually, in small teams, and via peer-to-peer instruction thus enabling them to transition seamlessly from lecture-based and laboratory-based instruction to independent inquiry outdoors. The project is part of a complete redesign of the undergraduate curriculum in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences that has the potential to be transformative on a national scale. The project is determining whether an improved curriculum incorporating an integrated instrumentation facility for experiential projects is improving student learning outcomes, improving the perception of science and scientific research by majors and non-majors, and improving enrollment in atmospheric science courses. Educational modules developed by the project are being disseminated to other colleges and universities through on-line resources, webinars, and participation in educational and scientific conferences.</AbstractNarration>
