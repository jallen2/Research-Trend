    <AbstractNarration>The MCDB Database System for Managing and Modeling Uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;Analysts working with large data sets often use statistical models to&lt;br/&gt;``guess'' at unknown, inaccurate, or missing information associated&lt;br/&gt;with the data stored in a database. For example, an analyst for a&lt;br/&gt;manufacturer may wish to know, "What would my profits have been if&lt;br/&gt;I'd increased my margins by 5% last year?" The answer to this&lt;br/&gt;question depends upon the extent to which the higher prices would have&lt;br/&gt;affected each customer's demand, which is undoubtedly guessed via the&lt;br/&gt;application of some statistical model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MCDB project is concerned with the design and implementation of a&lt;br/&gt;prototype database system called the "Monte Carlo Database System," or&lt;br/&gt;"MCDB" for short. MCDB allows an expert-level analyst or statistician&lt;br/&gt;to attach arbitrary stochastic models to the database data in order to&lt;br/&gt;"guess" the values for unknown or inaccurate data, such as each&lt;br/&gt;customer's unseen demand function. These stochastic models reside in&lt;br/&gt;the database, and are always up-to-date in the sense that they are&lt;br/&gt;parameterized on the current state of the database (using each&lt;br/&gt;customer's most recent purchases in the above example).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project attacks a number of key intellectual and scientific&lt;br/&gt;challenges. Most of these are related to the fact that for&lt;br/&gt;performance reasons, it is not possible to materialize one thousand&lt;br/&gt;stochastic instances of a one terabyte data warehouse, and query each&lt;br/&gt;of them in sequence. Novel methods for avoiding such materializations&lt;br/&gt;are being considered, such as skipping Monte Carlo trials that produce&lt;br/&gt;data which will never be used to answer a specific query. The project&lt;br/&gt;also considers statistical challenges, such as generating database&lt;br/&gt;instances that fall far out in the tail of the answer distribution,&lt;br/&gt;which is necessary for specific applications such as risk assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information is available at http://mcdb.cs.rice.edu.</AbstractNarration>
