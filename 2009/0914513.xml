    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worcester State College (WSC) is working with the local school district in the City of Worcester, MA, to increase diversity in undergraduate geoscience programs through the creation of an integrated pipeline for engaging students at a variety of levels. In this district, 35.7% of the students are Latino, 12.9% are African-American, and 7.8% are Asian-American giving the program particular impact on under-represented populations. Key to this project is a strategic partnership with the Worcester Vocational Technical High School Environmental Technologies program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish these connections through a series of interlinked curricular programs, internships, and facilitation agreements between WSC and surrounding schools. The first initiative is to develop a curriculum enrichment program for middle schools teachers, the only level in public education where the geosciences are an explicit part of the curriculum in Massachusetts. The next phase in our project is to establish an internship project that will pair minority youth in Worcester with sustainability based organizations and enterprises. We have partnered with Worcester Mass Audubon, Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA, the Regional Environmental Council and youth groups like Toxic Soil Busters to develop this program. The culmination of the high school internship program will be to encourage successful interns to take advantage of an articulation agreement between WSC and area high schools that will allow them to take college level courses in the geosciences. Gaining exposure to the college environment and earning college credit will give these students a significant experiential and economic advantage should they chose to pursue an advanced degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to create a pathway from the public schools to the WSC Earth Science program. Most students who graduate from Worcester State College remain in the area after graduation so this endeavor we will produce graduates who will go on to teach geosciences at the secondary level in the surrounding communities, further cementing these institutional relationships.</AbstractNarration>
