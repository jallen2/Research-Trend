    <AbstractNarration>The 2009 Enzymes, Co-enzymes and Metabolic Pathways Gordon Research Conference will be held at the Waterville Valley Resort in Waterville, New Hampshire from July 5-10th, 2009. This conference will bring together leading academic, industrial, and government scientists who study enzyme reactions, the principles by which enzymes function, their de novo design and discovery, and the biological pathways in which they participate. The research is highly interdisciplinary, using the tools of biology, biochemistry, chemistry, physics, biophysics, engineering, and computer science. The program includes major topics at the frontier of the field with an excellent balance of leading senior and younger investigators. Current, unpublished results will be disseminated by the presentation of lectures and posters and by informal discussions, to which ample time has been allocated. The efficient sharing of cutting-edge results and thinking will accelerate the pace of research toward catalyst design, bioenergy, and metabolic engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. &lt;br/&gt; The meeting will foster professional networking and enhanced diversity in the field of enzymology and metabolic pathways. Special efforts have been made to encourage the participation of women and underrepresented scientists as well as investigators from smaller colleges and universities, many of whom are included among the session leaders and speakers. An impressive number of the attendees will be Ph.D. students and postdoctoral scholars who will have opportunities to interact with prominent scientists to enhance their growth and development.</AbstractNarration>
