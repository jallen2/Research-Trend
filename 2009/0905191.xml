    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0905191&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Dusa McDuff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since a symplectic structure allows one to measure the areas of&lt;br/&gt;two dimensional surfaces, it is natural that the two dimensional&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds of a symplectic manifold are key elements of their&lt;br/&gt;global structure. The choice of an auxiliary almost complex&lt;br/&gt;structure J determines a specially interesting class of such&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, namely those that are J-holomorphic. Using them it is&lt;br/&gt;possible to build many interesting homology theories, such as&lt;br/&gt;quantum cohomology or symplectic field theory. Recently very&lt;br/&gt;intriguing connections have come to light concerning the relation&lt;br/&gt;between the dynamical properties of the symplectomorphisms on a&lt;br/&gt;space (in particular, how much symmetry the space has) and the&lt;br/&gt;structure of its quantum homology ring. McDuff recently&lt;br/&gt;discovered that if the space has a circle symmetry then it is&lt;br/&gt;uniruled, which implies that for every choice of J there is a&lt;br/&gt;J-holomorphic sphere though every point in the space. One of her&lt;br/&gt;proposed projects will investigate such connections in more&lt;br/&gt;depth. Another will investigate the structure of toric&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, which are symplectic manifolds with maximal abelian&lt;br/&gt;symmetric group. She also proposes a joint project with Schlenk&lt;br/&gt;that will illuminate a very basic symplectic rigidity phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;This attempts to understand exactly when a four dimensional&lt;br/&gt;symplectic ellipsoid can be squeezed inside a ball. This gives&lt;br/&gt;rise to some very interesting number-theoretic questions, and&lt;br/&gt;also indicates a connection between the combinatorics of&lt;br/&gt;J-holomorphic curves in the blow up of the projective plane and&lt;br/&gt;the numbers that appear as indices in embedded contact homology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A space can have one of several fundamental geometric structures,&lt;br/&gt;for example a way of measuring distance and angle (as in&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean geometry) or a way of measuring the area of two&lt;br/&gt;dimensional objects (as in symplectic geometry.) The structures&lt;br/&gt;studied in symplectic geometry are important because they not&lt;br/&gt;only underlie the equations of classical energy-conserving&lt;br/&gt;systems such as the planetary system, but also appear as a vital&lt;br/&gt;component of many of the modern theories in physics such as&lt;br/&gt;string theory. This project aims to further our basic&lt;br/&gt;understanding of symplectic spaces. One line of inquiry&lt;br/&gt;concentrates on questions about the influence of structures in&lt;br/&gt;the large (such as cohomology) on the dynamical properties of the&lt;br/&gt;space, investigating for example the number and nature of the&lt;br/&gt;points that are fixed under an arbitrary movement of the space.&lt;br/&gt;Another line of inquiry investigates what one might think of as&lt;br/&gt;the crystalline nature of small pieces of a symplectic space;&lt;br/&gt;under pressure how do such small pieces fold so as to take up&lt;br/&gt;less space? This second line of inquiry leads to some very&lt;br/&gt;interesting questions in elementary number theory and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, the first appearance in symplectic geometry of a&lt;br/&gt;relation between these fields. These questions can be explained&lt;br/&gt;to high school students, and so will provide an excellent way to&lt;br/&gt;explain to young people something of what research mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;do today and to stimulate their interest in the field.</AbstractNarration>
