    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The award will fund the research program of Dmitri Tsybychev at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook. The research program centers on the search for non-standard model effects in the decays of b-quark states at the DØ experiment at the Tevatron, which would signal the presence of new physics. Large statistics are already available and the significant increase in data at the Tevatron coupled with the stable operation of the DØ experiment promises to open new and exciting opportunities for physics. The DØ experiment has collected data samples with integrated luminosity of more than 4 fb-1, with the prospect for acquiring an integrated luminosity of 8 fb-1 if the Tevatron continues operation through FY2010. These data will allow precision measurements of rare processes and subtle effects that were not accessible before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the LHC data start to come in late in 2009 the research program aims to look for the direct search of new phenomena at the energy frontier with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The research program would contribute the elucidation of the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. The LHC is the next energy frontier at root s of 14 TeV where beams of protons will collide with unprecedented luminosity. Thus, the LHC and its experiments will provide excellent opportunities to shed light on the origin of matter and to discover new fundamental symmetries. The research program provides complementary approaches by fully utilizing capabilities of both the DØ and ATLAS experiments.</AbstractNarration>
