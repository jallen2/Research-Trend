    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 &lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;The research funded by this award targets the difficult problem of how to debug programs running on large parallel systems. The state &lt;br/&gt;of hundreds to hundreds of thousands of parallel tasks that form a single &lt;br/&gt;computation are too complicated for a programmer to usefully analyze. &lt;br/&gt;This project will develop tools to find similarities between the state of &lt;br/&gt;different processes, simplifying the task of the programmer. The challenge &lt;br/&gt;in finding these similar tasks is to do it efficiently, without imposing an&lt;br/&gt;overhead so hight that the tool is useless. A naive implementation would &lt;br/&gt;compare the state of all processors against one another, and would introduce &lt;br/&gt;overheads increasing as the square of the number of processors. Our approach &lt;br/&gt;will successively refine sets of similar processes, will use key attributes &lt;br/&gt;of program behavior (e.g. communication patterns) to perform this grouping. &lt;br/&gt;We will also investigate the use these groups of similar processes to allow &lt;br/&gt;invariance and statistically based techniques developed for sequential &lt;br/&gt;programs (such as value and PC invariance) to be effectively adapted to &lt;br/&gt;parallel programs. Because these techniques look for rarely occurring program&lt;br/&gt;activities, applying them to disparate processes together will introduce&lt;br/&gt;noise into the analysis, severely diminishing their accuracy. The use of &lt;br/&gt;our grouping strategy will allow effective parallelization of the &lt;br/&gt;techniques, allowing them to be applied with significantly less overhead &lt;br/&gt;than when used with sequential applications.</AbstractNarration>
