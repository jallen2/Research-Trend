    <AbstractNarration>The American Computational Talent Investments for Valuable Access, Training, and Experience (ACTIVATE) Project provides scholarships to students pursuing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers with an enhanced incentive for students electing to minor in computational science. The program builds on successful scholarship and curricular efforts recently piloted for students developing computationally oriented skills with advanced computing technologies that complement their major in the STEM fields of chemistry, biology, biochemistry/molecular biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, geology, and psychology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACTIVATE Project focuses on increasing access to growing interdisciplinary STEM programs at the university, particularly in computational science. Designed to increase the concentration of STEM talent in the region required to meet local employment opportunities, the program is recruiting students from beyond Ohio and from Upward Bound programs (both locally and nationally). ACTIVATE Scholars benefit from program elements developed for the Choose Ohio First scholarship program, expanding these to create an even more diverse learning community fostered through faculty mentoring, advising, and career development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The ACTIVATE Project provides key access to critical training and experience in STEM applications in computational science, essential to training the next generation of application creators and scientists using advanced computer technologies. In addition, the expanded diversity of the STEM cohort provides the opportunity for the university to assess and refine strategies for recruiting, preparing, and retaining underrepresented students pursuing STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: ACTIVATE Scholars serve as role models for increasing the number of students who may otherwise not consider STEM careers as an option. Equipped with a strong STEM background, interdisciplinary, liberal arts and computational preparation, these students are preparing to be leaders in their fields, and pioneering career pathways for many first time college families nationally. The ACTIVATE Scholars Project also brings essential geographic, gender, racial, and economic diversity to a regional cohort of STEM students. ACTIVATE Scholars work closely with the local Upward Bound program on campus to further develop STEM interest among underrepresented populations locally. These activities provide additional insight into methods and approaches to enhance K-12 outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
