    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0603976&lt;br/&gt;Jonathan Hanke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relationship between quadratic forms and modular forms has been a&lt;br/&gt;rich source of mathematical questions and answers for a long time,&lt;br/&gt;through the theory of theta functions. This connection has been used&lt;br/&gt;recently by the PI to understand the failure of a local-global&lt;br/&gt;principle for integral ternary quadratic forms, to give a complete&lt;br/&gt;answer of what numbers are represented by any given positive definite&lt;br/&gt;integral quadratic form in four variables, and (jointly with&lt;br/&gt;M. Bhargava) to prove Conway's 290-Conjecture which characterizes all&lt;br/&gt;positive definite integer-valued quadratic forms representing all&lt;br/&gt;positive integers as those representing 29 critical numbers (the&lt;br/&gt;largest of which is 290). The PI proposes to continue this work by&lt;br/&gt;understanding the local-global principle for a totally definite&lt;br/&gt;ternary quadratic form over a number field in terms of the structure&lt;br/&gt;of its theta function, and investigating (jointly with M. Bhargava)&lt;br/&gt;finiteness theorems (like the 290-Conjecture) for quadratic forms&lt;br/&gt;representing all odd numbers and also all prime numbers. He is also&lt;br/&gt;interested in enumerating all totally definite quadratic forms of&lt;br/&gt;class number one, since such forms are the basis of many arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;results about quadratic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question of how many ways a number can be expressed as a sum of&lt;br/&gt;two, three, or four square numbers is one of the oldest and most&lt;br/&gt;interesting problems in number theory -- and the discovery of some of&lt;br/&gt;the most fundamental symmetries of the arithmetic of whole numbers.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding these symmetries has allowed for some of the most&lt;br/&gt;celebrated results in number theory, for example Wiles's proof of&lt;br/&gt;Fermat's last theorem, and Lagrange's proof that every positive number&lt;br/&gt;is a sum of (at most) four square numbers. The PI hopes to use these&lt;br/&gt;symmetries to continue to answer simple questions about whole numbers&lt;br/&gt;-- in particular sums of square numbers -- and to provide&lt;br/&gt;computational tools to allow others to do the same. These results&lt;br/&gt;could be used to create better encryption systems, but more&lt;br/&gt;importantly, could allow for a deeper understanding of the nature of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic and its underlying structure.</AbstractNarration>
