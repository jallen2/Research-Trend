    <AbstractNarration>The project has both a theoretical component and mathematical modeling component. On the theoretical side, it will contribute to the mathematical theory of persistence, an important tool for the analysis of biological models as it provides a mathematically rigorous method to establish the long term persistence or viability of a population. Presently, the theory is difficult to apply to discrete-time dynamical systems arising in epidemiology and population dynamics because of the complexity of (boundary) attractors for discrete-time systems (e.g., the standard quadratic map). Recently, the theory of Lyapunov exponents has been applied to detect when a boundary invariant set, representing a "resident regime" is normally repelling, meaning it is invadable by a non-resident. One aspect of the project is to further develop this approach and to develop methods of computing/estimating the key normal Lyapunov exponents and their dependence on system parameters. The newly developed tools will be applied to mathematical models of a fungal disease model in amphibian populations. The project aims to improve current state-of-the-art mathematical models of in-vivo bacterial infections by including more realistic immune system responses, antibiotic treatment and the development of resistance to antibiotic, and examining appropriate antibiotic dosing strategies. A parallel effort will aim to improve mathematical models of virus disease by exploring the effects of multiple viral infections of host target cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many important questions in the life sciences center on whether or not a biological species or set of species can survive indefinitely in given environment or whether they will become extinct. Issues of biological diversity revolve around the question of which species can or cannot survive in an (possibly human-altered) environment. If a disease or parasite is introduced into a population, can it survive and become endemic in the host or will it die out or become rare? Will it drive the host population to extinction as fungal diseases appear to be doing to amphibian populations? Similar questions arise when an inoculum of bacteria or virus gains entry into a host animal or plant: can it exploit its host and initiate a chronic disease or will it be removed by a host immune response? Currently, there are few guiding principles to decide these questions but mathematical modeling and analysis can and has played a role. Motivated by these important biological questions, a mathematical theory (called persistence theory) has been developing in recent decades to provide answers. The project will contribute to this theory by sharpening the available mathematical tools and applying them to important biological problems. On the practical side, the new tools should help to predict long term persistence or extinction in particular models. A focus of the project is to apply newly developed tools to study mathematical models of disease within human and animal populations. Models of the fungal disease Chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease of amphibians caused by the chytrid fungus, implicated in the mass die-offs and species extinction of frogs in many areas of the world, will be studied. Another arena of important applications are disease processes within a given animal or plant. Mathematical modeling of in vivo disease processes is a relatively new field holding great promise due to the difficulty of real-time monitoring of these processes. Prior work aimed at creating more realistic mathematical models of generic bacterial infections of mammalian tissues including host immune response and antibiotic therapy will be extended to include known pathogen heterogeneity in virulence and susceptibility to antibiotic treatment, and alternative antimicrobial dosing strategies. The proposed extensions should lead to better understanding of the infection and treatment processes, allowing computer simulation of processes which are difficult to monitor in vivo. Mathematical modeling of virus infections have also proved to be useful, most notably for understanding HIV replication within the human host. Mathematical modeling can predict and confirm features of virus-host cell dynamics that are difficult to monitor in animal models. The investigator will examine effects of multiply infected host cells on disease dynamics.</AbstractNarration>
