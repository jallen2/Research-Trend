    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;The chloridoid grasses are a large, economically and ecologically important group of&lt;br/&gt;approximately 1500 species in 150 genera that have been classified using the highly&lt;br/&gt;variable features of the inflorescence (how flowers are arranged). Despite their&lt;br/&gt;importance, relatively little is known about the relationships among the species or the&lt;br/&gt;regulation of inflorescence development, so these issues will be addressed through&lt;br/&gt;studies of all genera and one-third of the species. DNA sequences will be used to&lt;br/&gt;reconstruct the evolutionary relationships and create a new classification, and&lt;br/&gt;inflorescences will be studied from early in development to maturity to characterize the&lt;br/&gt;differences in an evolutionary context. Genes involved in inflorescence development of&lt;br/&gt;other species will be examined for their role in chloridoids.&lt;br/&gt;Chloridoid grasses are economically important because several species are grown as&lt;br/&gt;food crops or turf grasses for humans, and many provide livestock forage.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the evolution of the group and the regulation of inflorescence&lt;br/&gt;development can have important implications for crop or turf improvement as others&lt;br/&gt;seek sources of desirable traits or increased grain yields. In addition to the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigators, the project involves undergraduate students at a small college, as well as&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research findings will be broadly&lt;br/&gt;disseminated through print and online outlets.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0920147 PI Name:Columbus, J.
