    <AbstractNarration>This project supports a two day workshop to advance the scientific study of federally funded centers and institutes as key elements in the innovation ecosystem. The workshop brings together engineers and natural, physical, and social scientists to address central questions relating to the role of federally funded centers and institutes in science and innovation policy. This workshop differs from previous workshops in two ways. First, it builds on the knowledge base derived from studies of other organizations to develop social scientific models, tools, and data with which to study new organizational entities that can contribute to innovation, with particular attention to federally funded centers and institutes. Second, it directly engages the focal units of analysis - the centers and institutes and some other related organizational entities (such as research parks and start-up firms) in developing appropriate models, data, and tools for analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This two-day workshop advances the scientific study of federally funded centers and institutes as key elements in the innovation ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The workshop provides an improved framework for deepening the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of university-industry;government partnerships so as better meet the goals of the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) of 2006 and the America Competes Act (ACA) of 2007. The workshop provides an opportunity to develop a better understanding of society's ability to generate and harness the latest in scientific and technological developments. This set of discussions should enhance US ability to compete in global markets by optimizing its knowledge-based resources, particularly in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
