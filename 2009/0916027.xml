    <AbstractNarration>Recent technological advances enable collection of massive amounts of&lt;br/&gt;data in science, commerce, and society. These datasets bring us&lt;br/&gt;closer than ever before to solving important problems such as decoding&lt;br/&gt;human genomes and coping with climate changes. Meanwhile, the&lt;br/&gt;exponential growth in data volume creates an urgent challenge. Many&lt;br/&gt;existing analysis tools assume datasets fit in memory; when applied to&lt;br/&gt;massive datasets, they become unacceptably slow because of excessive&lt;br/&gt;disk input/output (I/O) operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across application domains, much of advanced data analysis is done&lt;br/&gt;with custom programming by statisticians. Progress has been hindered&lt;br/&gt;by the lack of easy-to-use statistical computing environments that&lt;br/&gt;support I/O-efficient processing of large datasets. There have been&lt;br/&gt;many approaches toward I/O-efficiency, but none has gained traction&lt;br/&gt;with statisticians because of issues ranging from efficiency to&lt;br/&gt;usability. Disk-based storage engines and I/O-efficient function&lt;br/&gt;libraries are only a partial solution, because many sources of&lt;br/&gt;I/O-inefficiency in programs remain at a higher, inter-operation&lt;br/&gt;level. Database systems seem to be a natural solution, with efficient&lt;br/&gt;I/O and a declarative language (SQL) enabling high-level&lt;br/&gt;optimizations. However, much work in integrating databases and&lt;br/&gt;statistical computing remains database-centric, forcing statisticians&lt;br/&gt;to learn unfamiliar languages and deal with their impedance mismatch&lt;br/&gt;with host languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make a practical impact on statistical computing, this project&lt;br/&gt;postulates that a better approach is to make it transparent to users&lt;br/&gt;how I/O-efficiency is achieved. Transparency means no SQL, or any new&lt;br/&gt;language to learn. Transparency means that existing code should run&lt;br/&gt;without modification, and automatically gain I/O-efficiency. The&lt;br/&gt;project, nicknamed RIOT, aims at extending R---a widely popular&lt;br/&gt;open-source statistical computing environment---to transparently&lt;br/&gt;provide efficient I/O. Achieving transparency is challenging; RIOT&lt;br/&gt;does so with an end-to-end solution addressing issues on all fronts:&lt;br/&gt;I/O-efficient algorithms, pipelined execution, deferred evaluation,&lt;br/&gt;I/O-cost-driven expression optimization, smart storage and&lt;br/&gt;materialization, and seamless integration with an interpreted host&lt;br/&gt;language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RIOT integrates research and education, and continues the tradition of&lt;br/&gt;involving undergraduates through REU and independent studies. As a&lt;br/&gt;database researcher, the PI is committed to learning and drawing from&lt;br/&gt;work from programming languages and high-performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;Findings from RIOT help create synergy and seed further collaboration&lt;br/&gt;with these communities. To ensure practical impact on statistical&lt;br/&gt;computing, RIOT has enlisted collaboration from statisticians and the&lt;br/&gt;R core development team on developing, evaluating, and disseminating&lt;br/&gt;RIOT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information can be found at: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.duke.edu/dbgroup/Main/RIOT</AbstractNarration>
