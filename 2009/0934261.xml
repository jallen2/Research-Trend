    <AbstractNarration>Intramolecular redox reactions of a-functionalized aldehydes mediated by N-heterocyclic carbenes (or heterocyclic ylides) lead to the catalytic generation of activated carboxylates, suitable for the synthesis of esters, amides, and other carboxylic acid derivatives under economical and environmentally friendly reaction conditions. The discovery of this novel reactivity, mediated by an organic catalyst, of a-heteroatomic and a,b-unsaturated aldehydes opens a broad range of mechanistically unique pathways for the synthesis of chiral carboxylic acid derivatives, including anti-b-hydroxyesters and b-amino peptides. The design and application of chiral heterocyclic salts for catalyzing this novel process will provide an enantioselective method for directly controlling the absolute stereochemistry concomitant with esterifications and peptide couplings, and has the potential to supplant traditional multi-step chiral auxiliary based methodologies. By developing means of effecting the direct, enantioselective synthesis of amides from a,b-didehydroamino aldehydes, a waste-free, atom-economical approach to the synthesis of poly-a-amino-peptides from achiral precursors will emerge. The unique reactivities of unsaturated aldehydes under these catalytic conditions will enable novel carbon-carbon bond forming processes, including new annulation reactions affording lactones, lactams, and cyclopentanones, thereby providing a long-sought method for the direct, intermolecular synthesis of hetero- and carbocycles from stable, readily available starting materials. Applications of these new reactions include the synthesis of (1) short, biologically active a- and b-peptides, (2) the kalafungin class of naturally occurring antibiotics, and (3) the antibiotic moiramide B, which is active against drug resistant bacterial strains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Jeffrey W. Bode, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is developing new reactions catalyzed by simple organic molecules rather than by metals. This reaction chemistry not only offers promise of great chemical selectivity, but also represents an economical, environmentally friendly ("green") approach to organic synthesis, eliminating the use of potentially hazardous metals and greatly reducing waste generation. Professor Bode will exploit the newly discovered reaction chemistry for the synthesis of a variety of products, including biologically active polypeptides and antibiotics, demonstrating the potentially broad applicability of this chemistry in the synthesis of important products. He will also engage undergraduate students, both at UCSB and from local community colleges, in an alternative sophomore level organic laboratory course aimed at exposing them to hands-on training in the realities of inquiry and research based organic chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
