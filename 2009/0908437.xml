    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education at the interface of condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and photonics. The PI and coworkers have developed a novel self-consistent laser theory, which finds the steady-state of a laser with a cavity of arbitrary complexity and openness without doing time-dependent simulations. The theory treats the openness of the cavity exactly and the non-linear interactions in the cavity to all orders with a single, well-justified approximation. Recent comparisons to exact time-dependent numerical simulations of the lasing equations confirm the accuracy and validity of the approach. The PI has applied the theory to treat diffusive random lasers, a system which resisted conventional approaches because of its extreme openness. Applications of the theory to shape design of dielectric cavity lasers, to speckle correlation measurements in media with gain and to tunable random lasers will be studied. In addition, a full statistical theory of random lasers will be developed, to characterize their frequency distribution, number of lasing modes, the stability of their frequencies and modal intensities under changes in pump and impurity configuration. Finally, the theory will be extended beyond the semiclassical limit to include field quantization effects, which determine the laser linewidth and noise properties. A long-term goal is to develop a realistic laser simulation code based on the theoretical model developed by this work, which could have very wide technological impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education with potential impacts on the fields of quantum optics and photonics. The research supported by this award has the potential to change our basic understanding of lasers, which are used in a wide range of technologies including CD players and some surgical tools. Unlike a light bulb, lasers generate light waves in which each wave is in lock-step with another. This property of coherence enables device technologies that exploit the phenomenon of interference for their operation. This research project develops a theory for a new kind of laser, random lasers which, like other lasers, emits coherent light, but unlike other lasers, in random directions. Ordinary lasers use strategically placed precision mirrors to trap laser light in a gain material to amplify the light. In contrast, light in random lasers is trapped in the gain material by the laser light being scattered from randomly positioned scattering centers in that material. This notion of localizing light has analogies to electrons being trapped in localized quantum mechanical states in imperfect materials ? a phenomenon studied in condensed matter physics with aspects that keep the problem at the frontiers of the field. The PI?s research has potential impact on newly developed lasers that are about a ten-millionth of an inch in size and has many potential practical applications, including detecting injuries in human tissues, revealing chemical impurities in water, and determining the authenticity of documents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI aims to develop a realistic laser simulation code based on this theoretical model, which would have wide technological impact, with the code then used for laser design and optimization. This research lies at the cutting edge of science and optical engineering, and will possible real world applications that would benefit society.</AbstractNarration>
