    <AbstractNarration>Recent studies have demonstrated the powerful abilities of deep &lt;br/&gt;architectures for statistical pattern recognition. Deep &lt;br/&gt;architectures transform their inputs through multiple layers of &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear processing. Inspired by the connectivity of biological &lt;br/&gt;neural networks, the hidden layers of deep architectures encode &lt;br/&gt;hierarchical, distributed representations of complex sensory input. &lt;br/&gt;Theoretical results suggest that such representations are needed to &lt;br/&gt;solve the most difficult problems of artificial intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous applications of deep architectures include visual object &lt;br/&gt;recognition, statistical language modeling, and nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;dimensionality reduction. Building on these successes, this project &lt;br/&gt;develops new applications of deep architectures for problems in &lt;br/&gt;speech and audio processing. Current front ends for these problems &lt;br/&gt;are dominated by traditional methods in statistical modeling and &lt;br/&gt;signal processing. Deep architectures have the potential to &lt;br/&gt;overcome many limitations of current approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two research components with interrelated and &lt;br/&gt;overlapping goals. The project's first component explores &lt;br/&gt;unsupervised learning in convolutional neural networks. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of learning in these networks is to discover new &lt;br/&gt;features for audio event detection and automatic speech &lt;br/&gt;recognition. The project's second component investigates &lt;br/&gt;the possibility of deep learning in kernel machines. &lt;br/&gt;This possibility is suggested by a recently discovered family &lt;br/&gt;of kernel functions that mimic the computation in large, &lt;br/&gt;multilayer networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's research components are tightly integrated with &lt;br/&gt;its educational activities. The project supports two graduate &lt;br/&gt;students, including one female student. An important goal &lt;br/&gt;is to develop publicly available software for use by other &lt;br/&gt;researchers.</AbstractNarration>
