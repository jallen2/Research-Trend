    <AbstractNarration>NSF Proposal ECCS-0925716 and ECCS-0925586&lt;br/&gt;Proposal title: "Collaborative Research: High Temperature Acoustic Wave Sensors Based on the Oxyborate Crystals"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0925716, PI: Qing-Ming Wang, qmwang@engr.pitt.edu&lt;br/&gt;University Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECCS- 0925586, PIs: Shujun Zhang and Thomas R. Shrout&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is the development of acoustic wave sensors based on a high temperature piezoelectric crystal for in situ measurement of temperature, heat-flux, and pressure in severe environments. The increasing demand to enhance the performance and reliability of microsensors, particularly for those operating at high temperatures and harsh environments, results in an urgent need for advanced materials that can outperform silicon. The project includes 1) design, fabrication and characterization of high temperature surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators and thickness shear bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators; 2) high temperature characterization of SAW and BAW sensors; 3) design, fabrication, and characterization of SAW sensors based heat flux sensor, and BAW sensor based pressure sensor; 4) sensor performance and stability study at high temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The current acoustic wave sensors are limited to applications from room temperature to 300oC. This research project aims to develop robust ultrahigh-temperature (~1000oC) acoustic wave sensors for intelligent control of advanced power generation systems. Two types of sensors will be fabricated and tested based on high temperature piezoelectric crystal SAW and BAW resonators with desirable thermal, electrical and electromechanical properties at high temperature and harsh environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Development of sensor system for high temperature and harsh environments has attracted extensive research activities in the past few years but with limited success. The proposed research will advance the sensor technologies for applications in harsh and ultrahigh temperature environments by providing novel high temperature acoustic wave temperature and pressure sensors. The project will provide research and training opportunity to two graduate students and up to three undergraduate students. Emphasis will be given on recruiting minorities and women engineering students. Class lectures will be prepared based on the research activities and results of this project, and included in the existing graduate courses. Hands-on research training opportunities will be developed and provided for some talented high school students each summer through an on-going program at the University of Pittsburgh, the Pitt Engineering Career Access Program (PECAP).</AbstractNarration>
