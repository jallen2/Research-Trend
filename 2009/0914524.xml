    <AbstractNarration>Most algorithmic research in optimization has focused on models&lt;br/&gt;consisting of a single objective together with a number of&lt;br/&gt;constraints, all defined precisely and deterministically, where an&lt;br/&gt;exact solution is required. This paradigm is inadequate in many&lt;br/&gt;applications. First, there is often uncertainty in the model and data;&lt;br/&gt;this is being dealt with by a recent upsurge of work in stochastic and&lt;br/&gt;robust optimization. Second, users often require a simple approximate&lt;br/&gt;solution rather than a more complicated exact solution. When the&lt;br/&gt;problem is formulated in the appropriate space, simplicity is often&lt;br/&gt;manifested as sparsity - the vector of variables has relatively few&lt;br/&gt;nonzeros. Inclusion of nonsmooth regularization terms in the&lt;br/&gt;formulation can steer the model toward sparse solutions. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;focuses chiefly on algorithms and theory for sparse and regularized&lt;br/&gt;optimization, and on application of the methods to such important&lt;br/&gt;areas as compressed sensing, machine learning, computational&lt;br/&gt;statistics, and image processing. The project also takes a&lt;br/&gt;higher-level view, cross-fertilizing algorithmic ideas across&lt;br/&gt;different application areas, and devising and analyzing algorithms in&lt;br/&gt;general settings that encompass many specific applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimization methods can be used to solve a great variety of practical&lt;br/&gt;problems, such as design of cancer treatment plans, removing noise and&lt;br/&gt;blur from images and videos, identifying genomic and environmental&lt;br/&gt;risk factors for diseases, and reconstructing pictures, signals, and&lt;br/&gt;other data sets from limited random samples. Precise mathematical&lt;br/&gt;formulations of these optimization problems are available, and exact&lt;br/&gt;solutions can often be obtained, but what is needed in many cases is a&lt;br/&gt;simple, approximate solution that is easy to compute, understand, and&lt;br/&gt;apply. To take one example: Many images can be stored by taking a&lt;br/&gt;small number of random combinations of the pixels that make up the&lt;br/&gt;image. The optimization algorithm that reconstructs the original&lt;br/&gt;picture from the samples should look for the simplest picture that is&lt;br/&gt;roughly consistent with the random observations; this image is likely&lt;br/&gt;to appear more natural than complicated images that give an exact&lt;br/&gt;match to the data. This project investigates how the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;statements of problems like this one, and the mathematical methods&lt;br/&gt;that solve them, can be modified to produce simple solutions.</AbstractNarration>
