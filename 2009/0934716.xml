    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Robert Noyce Mathematics and Science Teachers (MaST) Scholars Phase 1 program at York College addresses the critical need for highly qualified secondary mathematics and science teachers in New York City schools. The primary objective of this program is thus the development of 50 highly qualified teachers for these high-need urban schools, through targeted financial and academic support. The program is being implemented by a team of faculty from the science, mathematics, and teacher education departments at York College, in collaboration with representatives of four partnering community colleges: Borough of Manhattan Community College, Bronx Community College, LaGuardia Community College, and Queensborough Community College of the City University of New York. An additional partner is the New York City Department of Education. Scholars are being recruited from York and the partnering community colleges, all of which serve underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For York College students preparing to be teachers, the most significant financial burden comes during student teaching, which often necessitates their withdrawal from full time employment. Thus, the scholarships focus on financial support during this year, with academic support and development programs being provided from the post-freshman summer through the second year of teaching. The academic support program includes three critical phases: 1) engagement of potential Scholars in a Teacher Explorer summer program, 2) support and development of the Scholars during the completion of their college education and teacher preparation program, and 3) professional development and support of teachers during their first two years in the classroom. The MaST program also involves Scholars and faculty in both STEM and teacher education research: as part of extensive field experiences, the Scholars create research-based curriculum for underrepresented urban students, and serve as both subjects and collaborators in the research about the development of themselves as emerging teachers. As well as serving to increase the number of highly qualified science and mathematics teachers for urban, high-needs districts, and striving to improve the retention of these teachers in urban schools, the program is contributing to the knowledge base concerning ways to support science and mathematics secondary education. Results of the program and related research are being disseminated through journals, conferences, and websites. The Scholars and new teachers in addition share results of their research within their learning communities and through their own publications and presentations.</AbstractNarration>
