    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a model for wind- and rain-wind-induced vibrations of stay cables on cable-stayed bridges. The problematic vibrations under study were first observed thirty years ago and today still elude full understanding. This research program will conduct wind-tunnel tests of circular cylinders as sectional models of stay cables. The data so-obtained will be used to carefully supplement existing field observations of stay cable vibrations obtained through long-term full-scale measurement. The experimental results will facilitate identification of the mechanisms that induce the vibrations and quantification of the core parameters that describe the phenomenon, on the basis of which a practical model for the vibration will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;When completed, this research will contribute to improving the safety and performance of transportation infrastructure by enabling engineers to efficiently design stay cables that are less susceptible to oscillatory problems as well as to develop effective mitigation devices for existing cable-stayed bridges. The outcome will also advance the fundamental understanding of interaction between a flowing fluid and circular cylinders and therefore impact other structures and systems that use such cylinders as structural members or components. The project will also provide advanced educational training to graduate and undergraduate students though their involvement at various stages of this research.</AbstractNarration>
