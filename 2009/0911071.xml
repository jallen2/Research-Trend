    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep earthquakes, some of which are among the largest and most damaging of all&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes, have been a paradox since their discovery in the 1920s. The combined increase of&lt;br/&gt;confining pressure and temperature with depth inhibits frictional sliding, the principal earthquake&lt;br/&gt;mechanism for shallow earthquakes, along fault planes beyond depths of a few tens of&lt;br/&gt;kilometers, yet earthquakes occur to depths approaching 700 km. Brittle-like shear failure under&lt;br/&gt;high-confinement also occurs with impact cratering in both rock and ice and limits the steady&lt;br/&gt;state flow stress of highly confined rock+ice mixtures and thus the may provide important&lt;br/&gt;constraints on the thermomechanical evolution of certain moons and planets. This project&lt;br/&gt;includes new experiments and modeling aimed at elucidating the fundamental physical&lt;br/&gt;mechanism(s) that underlie localized brittle compressive failure under high confinement.&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary experiments demonstrate a transition in brittle-like failure mode with increasing&lt;br/&gt;confinement and that the high confinement faults appear not to be friction controlled. Nor do&lt;br/&gt;they appear to be related to other well established faulting mechanisms, including mode II&lt;br/&gt;cracking, dehydration embrittlement, or phase transformations. Their working hypothesis is that&lt;br/&gt;at play is a fundamentally different faulting mechanism called plastic faulting -- a non-frictional&lt;br/&gt;shear instability aided by adiabatic heating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirited by past success in using ice as a model material for rock?ice was involved in the&lt;br/&gt;discovery of transformational faulting and our own discovery of what appears to be a universal&lt;br/&gt;mechanism of moderate-confinement brittle failure?and encouraged by its marked similarity to&lt;br/&gt;the behavior of rocks and minerals, this project consists of a three-year program of triaxial&lt;br/&gt;compression experiments to determine the effects, if any, of confinement, grain size and strain&lt;br/&gt;rate on both the terminal failure stress and the failure mode, with attention to microstructural&lt;br/&gt;detail, as observed using visual microscopy, cold stage SEM electron backscatter imaging, and&lt;br/&gt;cold room enabled micro-CT tomography. The researchers seek to reveal the&lt;br/&gt;physics of failure, and then to develop quantitative models of plastic fault initiation that only rely&lt;br/&gt;on independently measurable parameters. Such models are prerequisites for any conclusions&lt;br/&gt;concerning the possible role of a particular failure process in geophysical processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work also will contribute to Dartmouth's long tradition of involving undergraduates in research, through senior honors theses&lt;br/&gt;and through the Dartmouth?s Women In Science (WISP) internship program. Students involved&lt;br/&gt;in this project will participate in professional development opportunities through Dartmouth's&lt;br/&gt;Center for the Advancement of Learning and in educational outreach programs, including Junior&lt;br/&gt;Science Cafés in regional high schools, Igloo Build programs sponsored by the Montshire&lt;br/&gt;Museum of Science, and those supported through Dartmouth's NSF-funded Polar Studies&lt;br/&gt;IGERT program, including courses on communicating polar science and the ethics and policy&lt;br/&gt;implications of polar research, and educational outreach activities with communities in&lt;br/&gt;Greenland.</AbstractNarration>
