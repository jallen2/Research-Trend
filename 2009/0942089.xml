    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;Bluegrass Community and Technical College (BCTC) is implementing the Team Science project to increase student success in "gateway" chemistry and biology courses through the use of team-based learning, an instructional strategy that uses theoretically based and empirically grounded strategies for utilizing small groups to improve the learning process. The goals of the project are to positively impact the instructional culture by incorporating team-based learning concepts in the science curriculum, and to positively impact student learning outcomes in selected chemistry and biology courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cohort of full-time faculty members is participating in training, modifying curriculum, teaching redesigned courses, and mentoring other faculty members. Faculty training is led by two experts in the field of team-based learning. Adjunct faculty members are being trained in the second year of the project and are participating in the implementation of redesigned courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit is realized through the effective use of team-based learning that requires a significant change in the role and function of both the instructor and the student. Cyberlearning plays an integral role through the use of tablet PCs and DyKnow software to facilitate team activities and interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact is achieved through the involvement of adjunct faculty in all phases of the project, recognizing the increasing role of adjunct instructors in STEM education. The evaluation and dissemination activities are validating the effectiveness of team-based learning in a community college setting.</AbstractNarration>
