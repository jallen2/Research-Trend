    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on creating a 3-dimensional human genome visualization for education and exhibition. The platform will be a 3-D visualization software toolkit designed to explore the genome's structure and function in the context of the entire body. It will also ease the difficulty of genomic and proteomic searches. The toolkit will use public data to interactively present and build pathways from gene to phenotype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, no genomic software incorporates the molecular movement capability of software tools into animated processes of gene expression. In addition, no software takes the powerful dataset integration of applications to create powerful 3-D visuals. Biochemical, medical, and genetic researchers lack intuitive software to input data-rich files and automatically output genetic pathways. The team envisions a tool that will accept keyword search terms, like a trait name, and show all related regulatory molecules and pathways. This would provide users with an efficient visual map on a particular genetic topic, which could then be used to focus deeper investigation. By showing how somatic concepts connected through the integrated workings of the genome, the team will create a visualization tool for research, media production, and education. If successful, this platform will find a wide array application across industry and education sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
