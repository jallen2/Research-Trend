    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supporting the academic success of students who need to learn and use a second language is a widely recognized educational challenge in the U.S. The challenge may be met in part by developing a better understanding of how limited second language proficiency affects memory processes essential for content learning. This project will investigate memory performance in monolingual speakers of Spanish and English and in Spanish-English bilinguals using their more fluent and less fluent languages. Working in a less fluent language requires greater attention and the words are less familiar. The importance of these two factors is assessed with respect to two main questions. First, what components of memory, if any, are affected by language proficiency? Second, does language proficiency alter the strategies that individuals use to remember information? Experiments will be conducted with students at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and neighboring Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez (UACJ) in Mexico. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The research should increase understanding of fundamental memory processes in bilinguals and monolinguals. It may have profound educational implications for study techniques for students and teaching practices for educators. The research activities will increase diversity in research training and participation through inclusion of primarily Mexican-American and Mexican national research assistants and participants.</AbstractNarration>
