    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a system for monitoring the structural integrity of highway slopes, dam foundations, and other soil and rock exposures associated with the US infrastructure. The monitoring system will integrate state-of-the-art 3D imaging hardware, 3D point-cloud processing software and wireless communication. The system will be based around a cost-effective LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor, as well as the development of LIDAR point-cloud processing software. The LIDAR sensor allows continuous high-resolution 3D monitoring of rock and soil exposures from a distance. Fully automated change-detection software will be developed to pinpoint unstable areas, providing critical information on ground movement before, during and after instabilities&lt;br/&gt;occur. Wireless communication allows for continuous reporting and the issuing of warnings. The system will be cost-effective, allowing widespread use of the technology for monitoring the US geo-infrastructure, as well as other potential applications in mineral and material operations, construction, hazardous waste facilities and heritage sites. There are many challenging aspects that will advance knowledge and understanding ? deciphering change-detection information to determine ground movement, determining what is precursory activity to instabilities and issuing warnings, developing a compact, cost-effective system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project include societal benefits related to increased safety, both the safety of workers, and the safety of those that use and are impacted by the infrastructure, such as highway drivers, rail passengers, and people living below dams. The&lt;br/&gt;outcome of the proposed work is a marketable product that has significant commercial potential and would be purchased by government agencies and companies worldwide. The automatic, realtime processing of point cloud data in the field to assess rock and soil ground instability is an innovation that has many competitive advantages. By being cost-effective, the commercial&lt;br/&gt;product would encourage the widespread use of modern monitoring technologies. Competing technologies, because of their high cost, are limited to special sites such as mining operations. The proposed new technology has applications in other disciplines, including mining, civil construction, manufacturing, and forestry. The proposed monitoring system is collecting valuable&lt;br/&gt;information on rock and soil deformation and failure that is of great interest to Universities worldwide. By continually monitoring potentially unstable rock and soil exposures, new discoveries and insights are likely to occur. The proposed system could be expanded in the future to include other kinds of sensors.</AbstractNarration>
