    <AbstractNarration>This conference proposal requests support that will assist 80 US doctoral students with travel expenses so that they may attend and present at the Cognitive Science Society 2009 Meeting to be held at the Free University, from Wednesday, July 29th to Saturday, August 1st, and so that they may participate in pre-conference tutorials and workshops held on Wednesday, July 29th. The location of the conference was selected specifically to provide opportunities to create a more connected international community of cognitive scientists. Workshops and tutorials will give both junior and more senior scientists an opportunity to develop connections around meaningful points of intersecting interest. This proposals intellectual merit is the dissemination and exchange of knowledge in cognitive science and learning science within the international community. Its broader impact is in support of the training of young investigators and the development of interdisciplinary and international collaborations in cognitive research.</AbstractNarration>
