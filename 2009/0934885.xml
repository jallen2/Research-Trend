    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Portland State University (PSU) Robert Noyce Teacher Scholars Program, Phase II addresses the critical local and national need to expand the talent pool of teachers with science content knowledge, pedagogical skills and leadership capacity to improve K-12 science education. Specifically this program focuses on achievement disparities associated with socioeconomic status, ethnic/cultural background, disability and English language proficiency. It provides 24 scholarships to the students in the PSU Graduate Teachers Education Program during the project years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in the Phase II Noyce Scholars Program is a two-year commitment that culminates in the awarding of a Masters of Science in Teaching degree and an Oregon Initial Teaching License. The program emphasizes the use of student-centered and project-based learning practices, current educational technology, inquiry-learning curricula, the development and use of on-going assessment and the integration of literacy strategies for English Limited Language (ELL) students. The summary evaluation of this program yields valuable data on the merits of a research-based model for teacher education that includes an extensive partnership relationship with an in-service teacher mentor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PSU Noyce program targets both recent STEM graduates and career changers who seek employment as highly qualified science teachers in high-need K-12 schools. In Phase II, the University expands the partnerships to include three of the largest districts in Oregon: Beaverton School District (BSD), Hillsboro School District (HSD) and Portland Public School District (PPS). These districts serve a combined total of 101,000 students in grades K-12 and are designated high-need school districts.</AbstractNarration>
