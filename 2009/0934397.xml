    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on a workshop to educate advanced graduate students, post-docs, and other early career scientists on current state-of-the-art concepts in data processing and high performance computing. The primary goal is to produce a new set of leaders who are more able to exploit the large volumes of data coming from the EarthScope program. The emphasis for this workshop will be on USArray data, although methods to be discussed and developed here are applicable to PBO and other digital waveform/time series data. By bringing together domain experts in seismic data processing as instructors we expect to also use the workshop as a first step for refining short-term and long-term community needs in the data processing cyberinfrastructure required to support the USArray program. The workshop will be held at Northwestern University in late July to early August of 2009. We are planning for up to 15 students and five or more guest lecturers in addition to the PIs. This will be a hands-on short course with lectures followed by computer exercises designed to reinforce the concepts being taught. Some exercises will use local computers, but many of the exercises will utilize high performance computing machines that are part of the NSF sponsored teragrid consortium. Students will complete a design concept project at the conclusion of the workshop. They will be required to attempt to implement their design after the workshop and present the results in the fall of 2009 in a webinar. Course materials will be organized and posted to the web in collaboration with the Education and Outreach Program of the Incorporated Research Institutions or Seismology. We expect these materials to be useful in many graduate-level course in seismology.</AbstractNarration>
