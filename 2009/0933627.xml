    <AbstractNarration>0933627&lt;br/&gt;Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on safe and permanent storage of CO2 via mineral carbonation. Mineral carbonation is to be achieved through mimicry of natural inorganic chemical transformation of CO2, such as weathering of rocks to form calcium or magnesium carbonates and dissolution of CO2 in seawater/saline waters to form bicarbonates. The fundamental reaction mechanisms and kinetics of CO2 with Mg-bearing minerals (i.e., serpentine) will be comprehensively investigated, with an emphasis on validation of a proposed surface reaction mechanism and the selection of optimized chelating agents to enhance the overall conversion of the mineral carbonation process. The overarching concept is to chemically fix gaseous CO2 into a mineral matrix via tailored synthesis of magnesium carbonate. By engineering the morphological structure of synthesized magnesium carbonate (PMC) to mimic commercially available filler materials, it is anticipated that the proposed carbon mineral sequestration technology will have the feasibility to store carbon at large scale economically. Since PMC is to be produced by capturing CO2, the PMC-based filler materials produced via the carbon mineralization can be considered carbon-neutral compared to the conventional precipitated calcium carbonate filler material, which is made by processing limestone. The PI participates in developing national-scale outreach programs for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program and Chemical and Biological Separations program.</AbstractNarration>
