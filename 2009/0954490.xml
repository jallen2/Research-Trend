    <AbstractNarration>This project concerns the development of an advanced microscopy system for visualizing the propagation of light confined to nanometer-scale structures, to aid in the design of next-generation microchips integrating photonics and electronics. Photonics involves the transmission and manipulation of information using photons, in contrast to electric charges used in electronics. Great potential is seen for devices integrating the two technologies. A major obstacle to this integration is the relatively large scale of photonic structures, which are typically on the order of several micrometers in size. By comparison, state-oft-the-art electronic components are as small as tens of nanometers in size?almost 1,000 times smaller. A promising solution to the problem of disparate scales is found in surface plasmon polaritons, a type of electromagnetic wave that propagates along metal-dielectric interfaces when the interface is excited by a photon. While the frequency of a surface plasmon polariton is that of the exciting photon, the wavelength is much smaller?on the order of nanometers. Thus structures fabricated to guide and manipulate surface plasmon polaritons are of the same scale as features in state-of-the-art electronics. The high losses inherent to electromagnetic wave propagation in metal are addressed by incorporating an active gain medium into the structures. The science of manipulating surface plasmon polaritons is plasmonics. Plasmonic devices may be designed to carry out many information-handling functions now implemented by electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a relatively new field, plasmonics lacks the multitude of diagnostics available in a more mature area, such as electronics. Progress in plasmonic device development will be greatly facilitated by new imaging and visualization tools. The subject of this project is plasmon tomography, in which an advanced microscope is designed to image surface plasmon polariton propagation in nanoscale structures. The microscope may also be configured to use plasmonics to perform optical microscopy with sub-wavelength, nanometer-scale, resolution. This will provide imaging performance comparable with much more expensive alternatives, such as scanning electron microscopy. Plasmon tomography has a diverse range of applications, including biological research and medical diagnostics. Massively parallel arrays of plasmon tomography-based sensors may be produced, with applications to chemical and biological threat detection for homeland security, defense, and environmental monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities under this CAREER program span a broad range of technical and educational issues in science and engineering, and address important applications. The major research topics are as follows: 1. Image formation in surface plasmon microscopes: a comprehensive description of the relation between the back focal plane and sample?s images will be developed through combined experimental and theoretical approaches. This will allow further optimization of these microscopic techniques. 2. Surface plasmon propagation in plasmonic structures: novel plasmonics structures including an active gain medium will be fabricated and plasmon propagation through them will be characterized using the developed imaging techniques. When integrated, these studies will result in advanced quantitative methods for characterization of plasmon propagation in plasmonic devices and sensors with huge parallel capabilities. The research plan will be integrated with educational development and outreach activities. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in interdisciplinary research at the Texas Tech University Nano Tech Center relevant to our nation?s technical training needs. In addition, under this CAREER project the PI will prepare and offer a course on plasmonics with emphasis in plasmon-based imaging techniques for advanced undergraduate and graduate students and will be involved in local programs for recruiting students, emphasizing under-represented groups, to work in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
