    <AbstractNarration>This travel award supports participation in the Ninth ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM and co-sponsored by USENIX, to be held in Chicago, IL, USA, November 4-6, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research results in an important area in networking, namely that of network measurements. The conference focuses on many research issues associated with observing the Internet, including: traffic analysis, structure and topology characteristics, performance measurements, measurement-based network management, characteristics of network applications, design of monitoring systems, anomaly detection, measurement of security threats, tools and environments in support of measurement, measurement-based assessment of simulation/testbeds, workload generation and modeling. Thus attendance at IMC provides a valuable research and career development experience for graduate students from United States academic institutions. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote speeches and technical sessions, as well as interact with peers engaged in state-of-the-art research in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 10 US-based graduate students are provided the opportunity to attend IMC. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited travel funds to attend workshops; attendance at such events is an important part of their educational experience.</AbstractNarration>
