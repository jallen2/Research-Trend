    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law&lt;br/&gt;111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, faults were thought to accommodate slip in one of two ways: Stick-slip motion,&lt;br/&gt;in which long periods where the fault is essentially locked are punctuated by brief episodes of&lt;br/&gt;rapid slip (earthquakes), and steady creep at plate tectonic rates (centimeters per year) or less. The&lt;br/&gt;discoveries within the last decade of episodic slow slip and associated tremor within numerous&lt;br/&gt;subduction zones, and tremor along the San Andreas fault, show that fault behavior is much more&lt;br/&gt;varied. In episodic slow slip, faults slip at rates 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than plate tectonic&lt;br/&gt;rates at quasi-regular intervals on the order of 1 year. Because the slip episodes last for several&lt;br/&gt;weeks and extend over areas tens to hundreds of kilometers across, they release energy equivalent&lt;br/&gt;to earthquakes of magnitude 6 or more. Tremor is a quasi-continuous seismic signal thought to&lt;br/&gt;be made up of myriad small events similar to regular earthquakes of magnitude 1.5 or less except&lt;br/&gt;in being more sluggish. Because slow slip events increase the stressing rate on the shallower&lt;br/&gt;locked portion of faults that can slip in magnitude 9 earthquakes, understanding them may prove&lt;br/&gt;to be useful for earthquake hazards reduction. In addition, the increased understanding of slip&lt;br/&gt;localization that arises from this work can be used to interpret ongoing experiments monitoring&lt;br/&gt;earthquake nucleation at several kilometers depth in California and South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past several years the PI has worked with Jean-Paul Ampuero to understand the implications&lt;br/&gt;of the standard rate-and-state friction equations for earthquake nucleation on deformable&lt;br/&gt;faults. They derived analytic solutions that have been very useful for understanding complex numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations. This proposal is to extend this work to the interpretation of slow slip and&lt;br/&gt;tremor in subduction zones and along the San Andreas fault, using both numerical and analytical&lt;br/&gt;techniques.&lt;br/&gt;A consensus is emerging that slow slip and tremor are just different manifestations of slip on&lt;br/&gt;a heterogeneous interface. Propagating creep fronts seem to be a ubiquitous feature of slow slip&lt;br/&gt;on heterogeneous faults, and are very effective at generating seismic slip speeds when they collide.&lt;br/&gt;Both properties make creep fronts attractive as tremor sources. The first goal of this study is to&lt;br/&gt;address how far such creep fronts might propagate in isolation, and the necessary conditions for&lt;br/&gt;two colliding fronts to generate seismic slip. This will be carried out both for standard rate-andstate&lt;br/&gt;friction and for other constitutive laws that have been proposed for slow slip. Once the creep&lt;br/&gt;fronts collide, they can generate seismic events with moment rate histories that, depending upon the&lt;br/&gt;underlying constitutive law, are quite different from those that seismologists have come to expect.&lt;br/&gt;This will be studied initially using the ?radiation damping? approximation to elastodynamics and&lt;br/&gt;ultimately full elastodynamics. Because much information is currently coming from observations&lt;br/&gt;of tidally- and teleseismically-triggered tremor, both forms of triggering will be modeled.</AbstractNarration>
