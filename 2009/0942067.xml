    <AbstractNarration>Computing-others (35) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds and evaluates a laboratory and curricular experience to support an engaging intuitive interface for interacting with computational learning materials: motion capture and the Nintendo Wiimote. This interface supports the capture of 3-D motion, a natural means of gesturing for human learners. A Wiimote interface enables multiple learners to interact simultaneously with specially designed exercises that are intended to promote collaborative exploration of computational principles and system design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaborative exploration modules that have been developed utilize the 3-D motion interface and possess two unique advantages. First, by learning the theory and applications, students discover the need for and the uses of computational concepts and methods directly. Second, the unique motion capture and facility for interactive play enables novel and engaging explorations with the Wiimote, which has an instant appeal with young students. Thus, this work is leveraging this increased enthusiasm and motivation for a significantly stronger development of computational-thinking competencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work augments inter-disciplinary research through robust evaluation of the efficacy of teaching by 3-D motion interfacing, involving faculty from Computer Science as well as Psychology.</AbstractNarration>
