    <AbstractNarration>This is a planning workshop to link geoscientists directly with the nanoscience/technology and technology transfer communities. Goals of this meeting are to identify how to develop and implement community interests in developing a generation of nanotechnology-enabled sensors and sensor arrays that are needed for effective utilization of monitoring networks that are presently being deployed by NSF, scientists, state and local governments, and industry. The workshop will produce guidance on sensor applications that would benefit from nanotechnology, prioritize development targets, and develop a roadmap for creating sensors and arrays that will remain robust and operational during long term field deployments. Broader Impacts of the work build essential infrastructure for science and engineering across engineering, science, and environmental boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
