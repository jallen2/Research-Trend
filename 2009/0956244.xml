    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science of information and decision systems encompasses a substantial and exceptionally pervasive set of interrelated disciplines, ranging from signal and image processing; to embedded control systems; to the analysis, design, and optimization of complex distributed systems and networks. Thanks both to the richness of the challenges throughout engineering and the physical, biological and social sciences and the continuing developments of the foundations of our disciplines, the information and decision sciences stand today as an exciting, continually evolving, and critical domain of intellectual inquiry. We are excited to propose a major event, a workshop aimed at articulating a picture of the challenges and ideas that will shape the future directions and potential areas of impact of research in the science of information and decision systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will bring together leading researchers from all around the world who have been influential in shaping the vision of and leading this field. The community of leaders whom we intend to invite will include many of the most recognized names in the field, as well as some of the rising stars in our field. This event will be open to the broad national and international community. The meeting will consist of several keynote addresses, providing context and a sense of history as well as some views toward the challenges of the future. Sessions to be held will focus on core disciplines, including Systems and Control; Networks and Networked Systems; Estimation, Inference and Learning; and Optimization and Decision Sciences. The workshop will include several panel discussions aimed at articulating paths ahead and major practical and societal challenges that are driving and will drive our field in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will be a first of its kind bringing together researchers from many disciplines in order to articulate the challenges emerging in information systems. As a particular outcome of the workshop, we will invite some of the participants to produce a handful of position papers. These papers will address new and exciting formulations and highlight the practical relevance of information systems in engineering, biology, social science, and other related disciplines. We intend to make these papers, together with all the presentations, publicly available to our community. More so, we will encourage and partially support the participation of students from all institutions. In addition, Industrial partners and government agencies will be asked to provide their inputs and perspectives to guide the panel discussions and to influence the position papers. These position papers will have a far reaching effect to researchers beyond the attendees of the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
