    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop new principles for&lt;br/&gt;creating and comparing models of skilled human activities, and to&lt;br/&gt;apply those models to systems for teaching, training and assistance of&lt;br/&gt;humans performing these activities. The models investigated will&lt;br/&gt;include both hybrid systems and language-based models. The research&lt;br/&gt;will focus on modeling surgical manipulations during robotic minimally&lt;br/&gt;invasive surgery. Models for expert performance of surgical tasks will&lt;br/&gt;be derived from recorded motion and video data. Student data will be&lt;br/&gt;compared with these expert models, and both physical guidance and&lt;br/&gt;information display methods will be developed to provide feedback to&lt;br/&gt;the student based on the expert model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work lies in the development of a new&lt;br/&gt;set of mathematical tools for modeling human skilled activity. These&lt;br/&gt;tools will provide new insights into the relationship between skill,&lt;br/&gt;style, and content in human motion. Additional intellectual merit lies&lt;br/&gt;in the connection of hybrid systems modeling to language models, the&lt;br/&gt;creation of techniques for automated training, and in the assessment&lt;br/&gt;of new training methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research will be the creation of automated&lt;br/&gt;methods for modeling and teaching skilled human motion. These methods&lt;br/&gt;will have enormous implications for the training and re-training of&lt;br/&gt;the US workforce. This project will also impact many diversity and&lt;br/&gt;outreach activities, including REU programs and summer camps for K-12&lt;br/&gt;outreach. The senior personnel of this project also participate in the&lt;br/&gt;Robotic Systems Challenge and the Women in Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;program.</AbstractNarration>
