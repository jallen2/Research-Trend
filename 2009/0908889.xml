    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a 3 year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) entitled, "NSF-RET Site at Engineering Research Center on Structured Organic Particulate Systems (C-SOPS)", under the direction of Dr. Kwabena A. Narh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program hosted by NJIT and Rutgers University will provide a 6 week summer research experience under the guidance of faculty supervisors with follow up programs during each school year for a total of 54 teachers, 12 in-service high school teachers from local school districts and six NJIT/Rutgers University pre-service teachers (18 per year for 3 years). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major objectives of the program are to: 1) Provide the RET teachers with six weeks of discovery-based research experiences in carefully selected scientific research projects, inter-connected via technology driven ERC test beds from which they can develop basic knowledge and skills in the area of pharmaceutical particulate and composite systems that they can incorporate into their teaching practices; 2) Collaborate with the in-service teachers to develop age-appropriate modules/lessons, and other teaching materials to be implemented in their classrooms during the Academic Year; 3) Offer follow-up programs including workshops and classroom visitations by the NJIT faculty and graduate mentors; and 4) Utilize the evaluation instruments, developed or adapted for such activities by the Center for Pre-College Programs.</AbstractNarration>
