    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a comprehensive understanding of cell alignment induced by nanoscale surface topography. Surface topography can significantly influence cell behaviors including shape, alignment, spreading, and differentiations, a well known phenomenon typically referred as contact guidance. The research will result in understanding on the interplay between mechanics and contact guidance and providing insights on how mechanical environment can influence cellular behaviors. The research approach combines experimental investigation, theoretical development, and numerical simulations. Cell alignments will be investigated on precisely engineered surface topography with systematic variations in both critical dimension and geometrical shapes; theoretical models will be established to account the corresponding experimental observations; numerical method will be developed to simulate the process of contact guidance and compare with theoretical models and experiments. This research will also establish collaboration with National Institute of Standard and Technology. Deliverables include a suite of fundamental understanding of contact guidance mechanism, experiment modeling and simulations tools, documentation of research results, high school and engineering student and K-12 teacher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide guidelines for designing and manufacturing scaffold with nanoscale surface topography to guide the growth of tissues. Nanoscale surface topography that can control the orientation of cells including the nuclei will lead to control of gene expression which determines the tissue growth. Fundamental understanding gained from this research will expedite the design of efficient scaffold that can promote tissue growth. The results will be disseminated through journal publications, national conferences, and TeachEngineering digital library. Students at the levels of high school to graduate school will be involved in this research. K-12 teachers will benefit through TeachEngineering digital library.</AbstractNarration>
