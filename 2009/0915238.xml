    <AbstractNarration>The aim of this proposal is to develop, analyze and implement optimization&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that integrate multilevel iterative solvers, adaptive mesh refinement methods, &lt;br/&gt;and so-called `all-at-once' methods for the solution of optimization problems &lt;br/&gt;governed by advection dominated partial differential equations (PDEs). &lt;br/&gt;The presence of strong advection in the governing PDE creates many challenges for&lt;br/&gt;the numerical solution of these optimization problems, beyond the challenges already&lt;br/&gt;encountered in the numerical simulation of single advection dominated PDEs and beyond&lt;br/&gt;the many difficulties in solving PDE constrained optimization problems with weak or no advection. &lt;br/&gt;One reason for the additional challenges arising in the optimization context is the presence of the &lt;br/&gt;so-called adjoint equation, which is also an advection dominated PDE, but with advection &lt;br/&gt;given by the negative of the advection in the governing equation. This can cause significant &lt;br/&gt;and perhaps unexpected differences in the behavior of discretization schemes and iterative &lt;br/&gt;solvers when they are extended from the application to single advection dominated PDEs &lt;br/&gt;to the solution of PDE constrained optimization problems. This research will analyze &lt;br/&gt;the sources of these differences, their impact on the quality of computed solution&lt;br/&gt;and on the efficiency of solution algorithms. Another goal is to devise modifications of &lt;br/&gt;multilevel iterative solvers, adaptive mesh refinement methods, and so-called KKT solvers to&lt;br/&gt;make them robust against the presence of advection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many important real-life applications such as the shape optimization of technological devices, &lt;br/&gt;the optimal control of systems, and the identification of parameters in environmental&lt;br/&gt;processes lead to optimization problems governed by systems of advection dominated&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations. This research addresses mathematical and algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;issues that are crucial for the reliable and efficient solution of these problems. It will lead&lt;br/&gt;to a better theoretical understanding of the solution properties of these optimization problems &lt;br/&gt;as well as to new computational tools for their reliable and efficient solution. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;it will provide training opportunities for students in an important area of computational science.</AbstractNarration>
