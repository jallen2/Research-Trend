    <AbstractNarration>Ever since the first FORmula TRANslator, compilers have purported to&lt;br/&gt;take an algorithm, formulated in human terms, and compile it to an&lt;br/&gt;efficient executable. Practice clearly does not live up to this&lt;br/&gt;ideal, as programming languages force execution-oriented design&lt;br/&gt;decisions on the programmer, and compiler imperfections necessitate&lt;br/&gt;further manual optimizations. While the ordinary programmer can&lt;br/&gt;ignore this problem by using libraries, the library developer cannot.&lt;br/&gt;The problem appears more desperate now than ever, since it is not&lt;br/&gt;known what form future architectures will take, combined with a trend&lt;br/&gt;towards pushing complexity away from the architecture (for example to&lt;br/&gt;lower power consumption) and onto the program and compiler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FLAME project already allows linear algebra libraries to be&lt;br/&gt;developed and coded at a high level of abstraction that better&lt;br/&gt;captures the underlying algorithms. It has already been shown that&lt;br/&gt;these technique greatly simplify the porting of libraries to different&lt;br/&gt;platforms ranging from conventional sequential computers to exotic&lt;br/&gt;multiGPU accelerators. However, the APIs for coding at a high level&lt;br/&gt;of abstraction incur a considerable performance penalty for operations&lt;br/&gt;that in each step perform relatively little computation (e.g., level-2&lt;br/&gt;BLAS operations and ``unblocked'' algorithms). As a result, a&lt;br/&gt;nontrivial part of libflame, the library that has resulted from the&lt;br/&gt;project, still requires coding at a low level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a source-to-source translator will take&lt;br/&gt;algorithms expressed at a high level of abstraction and will transform&lt;br/&gt;these into a range of representations, including high-performance&lt;br/&gt;low-level code. This will overcome the final legitimate objection to&lt;br/&gt;the FLAME methodology since coding at a high level of abstraction will&lt;br/&gt;no longer carry a performance penalty. The approach will be&lt;br/&gt;generalized so that code transformations that an expert applies by&lt;br/&gt;hand in order to target different platforms will be made mechanical.&lt;br/&gt;Together, these represent a major departure from traditional&lt;br/&gt;approaches to library development.</AbstractNarration>
