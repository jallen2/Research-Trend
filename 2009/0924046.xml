    <AbstractNarration>0924046&lt;br/&gt;Yang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports partial travel expenses of US participants in the Fifth USA-China Chemical Engineering Conference, to be held October 13-16 in Beijing, China (http:// http://www.sinouschemeng.com/), sponsored by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and its Chinese counterpart, the Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC). The 2009 meeting follows previous successful meetings including one that took place with NSF support in 1997 (CBET-9613827). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the conference is to provide a forum for U.S. chemical engineers to meet their counterparts in China about the latest advancements, exchange research ideas, and opportunities for collaboration. Its stated theme is Chemical Engineering for Sustainable Development, a core topic of interest for ENG/CBET research involving issues such as new and renewable energy sources, clean fuels, and environmental engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical engineering is a key discipline in energy, resources, and environment, and the USA and China are two countries that can lead worldwide efforts in these areas. By bringing together scientists and engineers from these two countries, as well as other countries, to discuss these challenges and possible solutions, the conference will be able to address the key roles to be played by chemical engineers in developing processes, products and services that are needed by humanity in a sustainable way. In a still broader sense, the conference will provide a focal point of contact for the chemical engineering researchers of the two countries, as well as from other countries and regions. It should provide an excellent opportunity for exchanging information and developing future collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
