    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;The anisotropy of physical properties is a key distinguishing feature of crystalline systems, is central to the nature of fundamental interactions and their resultant phases, and is known to play a key role in stabilizing many exotic phases of matter such as high-temperature superconductivity. Motivated by the recent discovery of a new family of iron-based superconductors with intriguing fundamental properties and much promise for technological applications, this Faculty Early Career Award supports a program with a goal of developing an experimental platform capable of probing the symmetry and anisotropic nature of quantum materials by measuring heat capacity and other thermal properties in large fully rotatable magnetic fields and at temperatures approaching absolute zero. By providing a new experimental tool previously unavailable to the U.S. condensed matter physics community, several fundamental questions regarding the nature of high-temperature superconductivity and other exotic states of matter can now be addressed. This provides an opportunity for investigation of a wide range of materials of interest to both fundamental and applied research in physics, chemistry, materials science and other disciplines, and with promise for applications in energy and health-related fields. An important component of this CAREER research program is the integration of an extended education program that will include the participation of both undergraduate students through co-operative work-study programs and local-area high school students through Science Magnet Programs. Also, an international junior researcher short-visit exchange program will be organized to enhance the experience of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars working on collaborative projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Award supports a project seeking to elucidate the fundamental nature of unconventional superconductivity and the ground state properties of quantum critical systems via experimentally accessible methods of quantum tuning. The key approach is to develop an experimental platform capable of probing the symmetry and anisotropic nature of quantum materials by performing thermal transport and thermodynamic measurements down to milliKelvin temperatures in a rotatable vector magnetic field environment. With precise angular control of large, directional magnetic fields at low temperatures, specific heat and thermal conductivity probes will be used to a) map the symmetry of superconducting order parameters in iron-based and heavy-fermion superconductors, and b) investigate the role of anisotropy in quantum critical systems by measuring straightforward, interpretation-independent quantities to test the basic nature of particle excitations. An important component of this research program is the integration of an extended education program that will include the participation of both undergraduate students through co-operative work-study programs and local-area high school students through Science Magnet Programs. Also, an international junior researcher short-visit exchange program will be organized to enhance the experience of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars working on collaborative projects.</AbstractNarration>
