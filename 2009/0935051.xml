    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research award to the Missouri University of Science and Technology will employ researchers to create an integrated engineering curriculum that emphasizes sustainability and globalization in the context of green manufacturing and green facility logistics. Course projects will be developed and pursued by teams composed of students at four partner institutions, namely: Missouri University of Science and Technology, Colorado State University-Pueblo, University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, and the Universidad Publica de Navarra (Spain). The curriculum re-design is systems oriented and subjected to multiple levels of assessment that are anticipated to answer research questions relating to the efficacy with which sustainability concepts were learned by students, both individually and in teams. Outreach is planned with local K-12 school districts through teacher professional development using project-created materials. The collaborative partnership will create a flexible pipeline of students that stimulates concurrent interest in engineering in K-12 students. This will encourage more student awareness of sustainability engineering and lead to more engineering graduates needed to fill engineering jobs.</AbstractNarration>
