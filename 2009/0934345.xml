    <AbstractNarration>This exploratory project involves the first field test of a new, Relaxed Eddy Accumulation instrument for measuring concentrations and fluxes of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in a long-term, unattended operational mode under limited infrastructure conditions. During this deployment at Blodgett Forest in California in summer 2009, the instrument will measure emissions of biogenic VOCs as part of a multi-investigator study focusing on biogenic emissions and their effects on atmospheric chemistry within and above forest canopies. Scientific objectives related to biogenic VOC fluxes and chemistry will be addressed, such as comparing and contrasting results to those of earlier studies at the same site, but under changed plant physiological conditions. Minor modifications to the instrument, mostly prior to the field campaign, will be evaluated as part of a process to improve its suitability for an envisioned long term deployment to a remote rain forest location to observe tropical biosphere-atmosphere VOC exchange interannually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will allow a unique field research and networking experience for a talented graduate student at Texas A&amp;M University. It will also allow the student to add an important thesis chapter on biogenic VOC fluxes and complete graduate studies latest in spring 2010. Results from this field study will be disseminated in the peer-reviewed literature and incorporated into the Principal Investigator's (PI) atmospheric chemistry graduate class at Texas A&amp;M University. In addition, the PI will be given the opportunity to develop both old and new collaborative ties through this research, which will result in publication co-authorship. This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
