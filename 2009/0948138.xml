    <AbstractNarration>ECCS/PCAN/EAGER: Novel Tunnel Barriers and Electrodes for Advanced Magnetic Tunnel Junctions&lt;br/&gt;Suitable for Spin Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory&lt;br/&gt;Principle investigator: Stuart A. Wolf, University of Virginia&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary:&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on the development of novel tunnel barriers and electrodes for&lt;br/&gt;magnetic tunnel junctions that will be utilized in a new type of magnetic memory called&lt;br/&gt;Spin Torque Transfer Random Access Memory or STT-RAM. Although there is a&lt;br/&gt;worldwide rush to develop this new memory technology, there are some fundamental&lt;br/&gt;challenges that need to be overcome. In particular, finding materials that allow the&lt;br/&gt;junction to be switched with low currents and also have very long term thermal stability.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this EAGER proposal is to very quickly demonstrate novel solutions to these&lt;br/&gt;challenges and provide a rapid path to accelerate the development of this technology just&lt;br/&gt;as the novel toggle switching did for the more conventional Magnetic Random Access&lt;br/&gt;Memory or MRAM that has been recently commercialized. A very unique approach is&lt;br/&gt;designed to solve this problem based on developing novel oxides that have exemplary&lt;br/&gt;properties that will enable tunnel junctions utilizing these materials to satisfy the&lt;br/&gt;requirements of very low power switching and excellent thermal stability (10 year&lt;br/&gt;retention of data). In this project the exploration has three paths that could produce a&lt;br/&gt;robust and scalable STT-RAM: (1) new tunnel barriers; (2) better ferromagnetic&lt;br/&gt;electrodes; (3) new material with perpendicular magnetization.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the development of novel oxide and other materials and&lt;br/&gt;structures that are highly complex and show strong electronic correlations and emergent&lt;br/&gt;behavior. Understanding these materials and their emergent behavior has a clear&lt;br/&gt;intellectual payoff beyond just revolutionizing the STT-RAM state of the art.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, these materials are being prepared using new deposition methods: Biased&lt;br/&gt;Target Reactive Ion Beam Deposition and Pulsed Electron Beam Deposition that provide&lt;br/&gt;unprecedented control of the growth of highly ordered and smooth ultra thin films. The&lt;br/&gt;demonstration of the development of these films using these unique tools that enable&lt;br/&gt;rapid exploration of broad composition space and evaluation of novel properties provides&lt;br/&gt;solutions to a set of important research and technological challenges. This project has a&lt;br/&gt;high degree of Intellectual Merit and will provide a series of interesting publications in&lt;br/&gt;addition to translational technological solutions.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this project will be immediately incorporated into this new&lt;br/&gt;generation of random access, non-volatile memory which can, in principle be a Universal&lt;br/&gt;memory that replaces SRAM, DRAM and FLASH. UVa?s participation with the&lt;br/&gt;Semiconductor Industry both the large companies as well as a major startup company&lt;br/&gt;almost guarantees that any breakthroughs will be quickly adopted. The solid state&lt;br/&gt;memory industry has a market of over $100 Billion.</AbstractNarration>
