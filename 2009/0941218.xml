    <AbstractNarration>The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will conduct a two-day outreach forum and related follow-up activities to provide information and gather input from Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs) regarding program components and requirements for a proposed NSF HSI-STEM initiative focused on STEM education and research capacity building for HSIs. Seventy-five (50 four-year/university and 25 two-year) High Hispanic Enrollment (&gt;25%) higher education institutions will be invited to send a two-member STEM faculty team to the outreach forum Following the Forum, QEM will draft, distribute for comment, revise, and provide a report to NSF's Division of Human Resource Development (HRD) on information, concerns, and recommendations gathered at the Forum.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Forum is to assist HRD in gathering broadly representative, informed, and comprehensive input regarding essential program components and requirements for an HSI-STEM initiative. The Forum will actively engage teams from HSIs in plenary and breakout sessions to: (1) ensure that faculty at HSIs have an opportunity to inform the development of an NSF STEM education and research capacity-building program to address their needs; and (2) identify critical needs in STEM undergraduate education and research at HSIs.</AbstractNarration>
