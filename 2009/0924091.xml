    <AbstractNarration>NSF is providing partial support for the twenty-sixth biennial International Conference on Photonic, Electronic, and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC XXVI) in Kalamazoo, Michigan, July 22-28, 2009. NSF funds provide for a group of United States students and young scientists to attend the meeting. The ICPEAC series of conferences was initiated in the United States in 1958, soon achieved international standing, and later was recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). The conference is run by an independent and self-governing organization, acquiring its funding mostly from governmental subsidies, especially from the host nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award enables a number of young U.S. scientists to attend a major international conference, which has become the predominant venue for reporting new developments and exchanging scientific information in the field of atomic collision physics on an international scale. Due to the large presence of non-U.S. participants, particularly from Europe and Japan, students and postdoctoral associates meet and interact with their international counterparts, enabling these young scientists to carry out and advance atomic collision research of the highest caliber into the future.</AbstractNarration>
