    <AbstractNarration>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Edward G. Gillan of the Chemistry Department at the University of Iowa seeks support for research related to a recently discovered energetically favorable oxygen-free method to produce nanocrystalline phosphorus-rich metal phosphides (e.g., NiP2). This new method uses much lower temperatures and greater macrostructural flexibility than has previously been demonstrated in phosphide synthesis. The proposed research studies will manipulate experimental conditions, particularly with respect to Lewis base coordinating additives in solvothermal reactions, to develop rational and flexible synthetic methodologies for nanoparticle metal phosphide growth. Advances in understanding the molecular basis of precursor reactivity are critical to the tuning and control of composition, structure, and morphology of resulting metal phosphides, sulfides, and mixed anion/cation structures. Improved molecular synthetic understanding will lead to more sophisticated chemical syntheses of phosphide (and sulfide) materials with structural complexity and physical properties that are not accessible by current synthetic methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Gillan will perform research where the specific chemical reactivity investigated will encompass catalysis related to photochemical hydrogen evolution from aqueous and alcohol media and thermal catalytic removal of sulfur from organic molecules. Both catalytic processes have potential impacts in energy-relevant areas, particularly in hydrogen implementation in fuel cell technology and in sulfur removal from hydrocarbon fuels. Broader impacts also include training key research personnel to work on multifaceted research at the interface of molecular and materials chemistry and to provide the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students with the critical tools necessary for future success outside the academic laboratory. Specifically, they will be taught how to design and implement appropriate research safety protocols in the laboratory environment, to foster beneficial collaborative interactions with other researchers in allied fields, and to effectively mentor junior colleagues in design of research strategies. In addition to improvements in the teaching of materials chemistry to undergraduates, Professor Gillan has established new partnerships with the University of Iowa's Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute to aid in educating K-12 teachers and the community about real world applications of useful chemical reactions and inorganic and organic materials.</AbstractNarration>
