    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education to develop analytical and numerical methods to analyze the role of many-body interactions on electron dynamics in nanostructures. The research will focus on the spectroscopic properties of hybrid systems comprised of dye molecules and metallic quantum dots and on spin dynamics of excitons in semiconductor quantum wells with applied magnetic field. The goal is to provide an accurate description of optical characteristics that are enhanced by plasmons and modified by Coulomb correlations. These studies are relevant for applications such as sensors and biomedical devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to address the energy transfer processes that determine radiation of a dye molecule in the proximity of gold or silver nanoparticle the research will expand methodologies based on time-dependent local density approximation. Quantum mechanical effect associated with the size of the nano-particles will included to study fluorescence or surface-enhanced resonant Raman scattering spectra. Cooperative phenomena will be accounted within a classical description. The research will also investigate the non-linear optical response of two-dimensional magneto-exitons in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and phonon-assisted spin-orbit scattering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students at Jackson State University will be involved in the research and receive educational experience on a variety of analytical and numerical methods. The students will present the results of their work in publications and conference presentations. Undergraduate students at a Historical Black College will participate in advanced research projects and learn the mathematical and scientific skills crucial for a successful career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectroscopy is a widely used experimental techniques to probe the properties of materials at the atomic level. This award supports theoretical research and education to predict and interpret the experiments on systems comprised of complex molecules that interact strongly with light and very small metallic particles. The optical properties associated with the interaction between many electrons and light in semiconductors will be also investigated. These studies are relevant for applications such as sensors and biomedical devices. Undergraduate students at a Historical Black College will participate in advanced research projects and learn the mathematical and scientific skills crucial for a successful career.</AbstractNarration>
