    <AbstractNarration>Tropical forests are disappearing at a rapid pace. Active restoration, by planting native vegetation, is an effective strategy to counteract this deforestation. However, plant-eating insects could cause significant damage to trees planted for restoration and thus limit the success of restoration sites. Top predators in an ecosystem, like birds and bats, can have strong direct effects on the abundance of plant-eating insects and indirect effects on plant damage caused by those insects. This research examines the effects of bird and bat consumption of insects in restoration sites by comparing insect abundance and levels of plant damage between trees that are exposed to bird and bat predation and trees that are protected. By consuming insects, birds and bats could provide a significant ecological service which may be of particular importance to efforts to restore tropical forest by aiding plant survival and growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help improve tropical forest restoration efforts, a critical component of strategies to conserve biodiversity. restore degraded lands and maintain ecosystem services such as hydrological cycling and carbon sequestration. This work will also examine the role of birds and bats as biological controls of potentially damaging insects, information that will be relevant for many types of agricultural industries. Collaborations with local community members and education groups will provide education and training for the people that live in the study area. Results will be disseminated in English and Spanish to both general and scientific audiences.</AbstractNarration>
