    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0915376 - Novel Techniques for Lossless Data Compression and Efficient Decompression in Heterogeneous Embedded Systems&lt;br/&gt;PI: Prabhat Mishra&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demands for heterogeneous and complex embedded applications have soared drastically in recent years. Memory is one of the key driving factors in designing such systems since a larger memory indicates an increased chip area, more power dissipation, and higher cost. Compression techniques are promising to reduce memory requirements by reducing the program and data size. The existing approaches either perform efficient compression using complex and variable-length encodings at the cost of slow decompression, or fast decompression using simple and fixed-length encodings at the cost of compression efficiency. This research will develop novel tools and techniques to achieve both efficient compression and fast decompression for a wide variety of application domains and system architectures. This project will make three fundamental contributions: novel decode-aware compression, optimal bitstream placement for parallel decompression, and synergistic integration of compression and encryption. A successful implementation of the proposed research will result in significant improvement in system performance and security, and drastic reduction in overall area, cost and energy requirements. Synergistic integration of compression and encryption will lead to efficient and secure embedded systems. The outcome of this research has a direct impact on everyday life. Improved compression/decompression techniques will have double impact ? low-cost and low-power everyday appliances for the public and improved performance and security for safety-critical systems. This project will have broad educational impact by developing compression related projects in both graduate and undergraduate courses, and by involving undergraduates as well as minority students through UF Honors, University Minority Mentoring and SEAGEP programs.</AbstractNarration>
