    <AbstractNarration>Hybrid Bio-Nanomechanical Systems for Single Molecule Detection&lt;br/&gt;Cagri Savran, Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a novel nanomechanical sensor with single molecule detection sensitivity. The approach is to form a hybrid cantilever with a functional virus at its tip. The cantilever/virus hybrid structure will be used as a fishing rod to reel in the DNA, whereby the other end of the DNA will capture a target entity from a sample by means of an antibody. The packaging and reeling of the DNA upon the capture of target analyte will be detected using magnetic actuation via a magnetic bead that binds to the captured molecule.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The developed system will be the first sensor that uses a virus activity to achieve: single molecule sensitivity, efficient target capture (target-capturing antibody will not be immobilized on a surface, rather it will be extended into solution via DNA) and negligible nonspecific binding (only the tip of the cantilever where the virus is located will be in contact with the solution) and hence will finally allow nanomechanical sensors to be useful in biological research and medicine. &lt;br/&gt;Broad impact: This project has the potential to result in biosensors that are extremely sensitive which can penetrate into clinical and biological research laboratories and serve to numerous goals that range from disease biomarker detection to understanding of protein-protein interactions at the single molecule level. Also, as a part of this proposal, the laboratory portion of an undergraduate course will be modified to have MEMS/NEMS devices, and hence will educate undergraduates about this new field for years to come.</AbstractNarration>
