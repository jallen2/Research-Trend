    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds to Bradley University to acquire a state-of-the-art high-speed imaging system for research and education in the areas of dynamic fracture mechanics of advanced materials, fluid dynamics and biomedical engineering. The main component of this imaging system is a high-speed/high-resolution rotating mirror CCD camera capable of capturing 62 one-megapixel images over a wide range of frame rates up to 800,000 frames per second. The system also includes ultra-high magnification zooming lenses allowing for micron resolution (up to 1.5 micrometers/pixel). This system will enable Bradley investigators to (a) understand and predict the mechanical and fracture response of polymer-based materials over a wide range of strain rates by measuring in real-time their dynamic deformation process using the full-field digital image correlation technique; (b) study the failure mechanisms in plastic gears subjected to realistic loading and environmental conditions allowing the development of reliable models to design plastic gears; (c) study the collisions of liquid drops to improve current CFD models for fuel sprays, which could result in reduced emissions and improved fuel economy; and (d)characterize nano-fiber formation during electrospinning to create a viable microenvironment for living cells to adhere to, and also to improve current processes utilized to fabricate fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of the high-speed imaging system has broad implications in both research and education at Bradley University. This instrumentation that will be incorporated into the PIs research and instructional laboratories will create an attractive learning environment and enhance the educational experience and hands-on training of both undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduate students will be actively recruited for involvement in the projects mentioned above. The PIs plan to identify and recruit undergraduate researchers at the end of their freshman year after completion of their physics and mechanics courses. The research activities will be carefully organized such that the knowledge required to properly carry out them will both match and reinforce the material taught in the classroom. Existing courses in biomedical engineering, imaging processing, fluid dynamics and fracture mechanics will be expanded and new ones will be developed to include experiments with this imaging system to show both the extent and limitations of analytical and numerical models. This instrumentation will also provide faculty in the College of Engineering and Technology at Bradley University with the necessary tools to successfully pursue aspects of their research which are currently not available to them.</AbstractNarration>
