    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009 and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Eric Montemayor is "Biochemical studies of an enzyme important for RNA recycling." This research will be conducted at University of Texas under the sponsorship of Dr. Scott Stevens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this fellowship investigates the role of an enzyme known as Dbr 1 that plays a key role in the maintenance and proper functioning of nucleic acids, DNA and RNA. Despite its key role in the cell, this enzyme is little understood. The goal of the research is to generate a three-dimensional picture of Dbr1. Just as a mechanic needs a diagram of an engine in order to fully understand how the engine works, biologists need a detailed picture of Dbr1 in order to fully understand how it functions in nucleic acid maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this fellowship provides the Fellow with valuable training to help him to become an independent investigator capable of performing original scientific research and training future generations of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
