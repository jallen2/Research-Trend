    <AbstractNarration>Re Proposal: 0901179&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Maxim Braverman&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Northeastern University&lt;br/&gt;Effective period of award: 04/01/2009 -- 03/31, 2010&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating at the Conference on Spectral Theory and Geometric Analysis that will take place in August, 2009 at the Northeastern University, Boston, MA. Support will be provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for plenary speakers. It is understood that much of the funding will be directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain senior participants will be funded as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will feature about thirty invited speakers, who will deliver one-hour lectures, and a number of contributed talks. The principal objective of this conference is to provide a forum for the dissemination of recent results and for discussing outstanding problems in spectral theory and geometric analysis, so as to maintain the vitality of the field. Another, equally important, objective towards this end is to involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and mathematicians from other under-represented groups. Several graduate students will participate at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
