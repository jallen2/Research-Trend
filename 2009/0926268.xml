    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this BRIGE award is to investigate the effect of silver (Ag) nanostructures? morphology on the progression of an environmentally benign lead-free, pressureless sintering process. Key to the success of the project is the characterization of shape-controlled synthesis of Ag nanostructures by polyol process that could lead to the nucleation of non-stable crystallites that will favor the progression of a low temperature sintering reaction resulting in mesoporous conductive film. The specific aims of the proposed work are: 1) explore the effect of process parameters on polyol synthesis and establish a correlation with the resulting morphology of Ag nanostructures; 2) develop a model to control the geometrical features of Ag nanostructures as a function of critical synthesis parameters; 3) establish the effect of morphology on the progression of a low temperature, pressureless sintering process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide a key enabling technology for the development of next generation high power electronics such as those used in hybrid-electric vehicles, public power grids, as well as control and conversion for alternative energy sources. Successful achievement of a continuous, conductive Ag film by this technique will enable a departure from the traditional reflow process which restricts the application temperature to a fraction of the melting point of the attach material. Further, this lead-free alternative for high temperature, high power interconnections support society?s need for environmentally benign technologies. The technical objective of the project is integrally related to its outreach goal to initiate a research program to broaden the participation and increase the opportunities of Hispanic engineering students at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM). This award will encourage the engagement of these students independent scholarly research. Lastly, this award will partially sponsor the UPRM Mechanical Engineering Summer Camp for high school students by providing financial and mentoring resources.</AbstractNarration>
