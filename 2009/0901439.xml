    <AbstractNarration>GOALI: Adaptive, Reconfigurable, Self-Healing Solar Arrays&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GOALI project proposes a fundamentally new approach to solar photovoltaic (PV) array operation. We propose the ability for a solar array to adaptively reconfigure its internal connections to reduce the detrimental effects of shadows or damaged solar cells on the solar panels. A switching matrix connects a solar adaptive bank to a fixed part of a solar PV array, according to a model based control algorithm that increases the power output of the solar PV array. Control algorithms are implemented in real-time. Neural networks are used to learn shadow patterns, such as trees on rooftop installations, to help adjust the solar cell reconfigurations. An experimental reconfiguration PV system with resistive load is proposed to verify the new approach to reconfigurations. Finally, a fundamentally new solar array structure is proposed that is able to merge power electronic converters within solar arrays, creating new classifications of renewable energy power systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes several transformative concepts in scientific multi-disciplinary research advancements, all of which represent fundamentally new research approaches in renewable energy:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The notion of real-time reconfigurable, self-healing adaptive solar arrays will be introduced and developed and shown to improve solar PV array power output for several important applications. Current state-of-the-art utilizes fixed connection solar arrays only.&lt;br/&gt;2) New neural network learning models will be proposed to model shading factors and to learn/classify types of shadows and solar cell degradations. These can be used either for reconfiguration or for alarms to be sent to the user of the solar PV array.&lt;br/&gt;3) New synergisms are proposed that are able to merge features of switching power supplies with solar arrays to create fundamentally new classifications of renewable energy systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will benefit society by developing methods to extract more power production out of an inexhaustible, environmentally safe renewable energy. The solar array reconfiguration schemes will aid to mitigate hot-spot effects within the solar array, which are known to reduce life-expectancy of the arrays. Further, since reconfiguration of solar arrays allows for improved power extraction of solar arrays when they are shaded, it is possible to consider installations of solar PV systems in locations that are usually ignored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ensure high impact of the research results, formal technology transfer partnerships have been formed with two industrial companies. Specifically, joint university/industry lab experiments (at industry), solar array customer data from industry, and joint graduate student advising help ensure that the problems being studied are relevant and important. These relationships also permit the simulation, modeling and design recommendations from this proposal to be broadly disseminated to industrial solar energy applications. The results of the project will further be disseminated as journal publications, conference presentations, and possible patents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plans to involve students from under-represented groups and will build solar energy demonstrations for existing K-12 existing programs at Northeastern University. Specifically, the PI will perform solar energy demonstrations in Northeastern University Engineering Open Houses and at a local Middle School Science Night in the Boston area. A new multi-disciplinary renewable energy course will also be designed, to be taken as an elective by engineering undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
