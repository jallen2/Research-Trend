    <AbstractNarration>Computing-Others (35) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is improving the computer science curriculum by developing new approaches to engage and interest a wider base of students. Mobile technology is being used to illustrate computer concepts. This project strengthens students' interest, retention, and learning by capitalizing on the pervasive use of hand held devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group activities centered on using mobile computing, in particular PDAs and Mobile-T G3 smart phones, are being added to the curriculum to teach Computer Literacy, CS1 &amp; CS2. The mobile technology is enabling access to Web 2.0 applications on the internet and uses the Java development environment. For example, students in the traditional first year programming course CS1/CS2 are using Google's Android software to program cell phone applications. Working with the Android software provides practical experience with embedded programming. The increased interest in computer science is supported by students being able to see their applications running in real time. This provides a sense of accomplishment and relevance. The incorporation of mobile technology is being implemented throughout the curriculum in order to allow for continuity, provide relevant, modern, and meaningful content. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across the country, large computer literacy classes are becoming more common as colleges and universities face budget restrictions. Activities being developed in this project serve as a good model to other computer science teachers attempting to engage and interest students in large introductory computer science classes. Furthermore, the project modernizes the computer science educational infrastructure and produces materials useful to other educators on effective ways of incorporation of mobile technologies in the classroom.</AbstractNarration>
