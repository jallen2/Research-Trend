    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concurrency-related vulnerabilities are pervasive in modern computing &lt;br/&gt;systems. Concurrency exploits include time-of-check-to-time-of-use &lt;br/&gt;(TOCTTOU) race conditions in file systems, attacks on signal handlers, &lt;br/&gt;and evasive malware that uses concurrency to escape sandboxing &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms. As processors feature ever more parallelism, and &lt;br/&gt;computers process more of our sensitive data, defending against &lt;br/&gt;concurrency attacks is a key challenge for the coming decade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal is to protect legitimate applications from concurrency &lt;br/&gt;attacks when they access system resources (e.g., prevent TOCTTOU &lt;br/&gt;attacks on file accesses and exploitable race conditions in signal &lt;br/&gt;handlers). The objective is to provide application programmers with &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms and policies for synchronizing access to system resources &lt;br/&gt;so they can avoid unintentional vulnerabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second goal is to provide strong confinement of untrusted code in &lt;br/&gt;the presence of concurrency, i.e., blocking intentionally malicious &lt;br/&gt;behavior. Today's malware abuses concurrency mechanisms to bypass and &lt;br/&gt;circumvent containment mechanisms like reference monitors and system &lt;br/&gt;call wrappers. Providing robust system support for containing &lt;br/&gt;malicious code is a critical challenge in intrusion detection and &lt;br/&gt;prevention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern computing systems fundamentally depend on concurrency for their &lt;br/&gt;performance and functionality. Making sure that concurrency is used &lt;br/&gt;securely is essential for building a trusted cyber infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;This research will have a significant impact on the practical &lt;br/&gt;development of secure software, and enable security-critical &lt;br/&gt;applications to realize the performance benefits of today's highly &lt;br/&gt;parallel systems.</AbstractNarration>
