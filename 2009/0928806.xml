    <AbstractNarration>Fundamental to the study of coral-microbial associations is an understanding of when and how the relationships are established, and their specificity. Recently, the investigators provided the first evidence of a specific association between an early life history stage of a coral (Pocillopora meandrina) and a particular group of bacteria (Jannaschia lineage of the Roseobacter clade of Alphaproteobacteria). They will be expanding this work by examining the onset of microbial associations in key reef building corals from Hawaii in the North Pacific Ocean and Moorea, French Polynesia, in the South Pacific Ocean. Understanding the onset, specificity and function of the microbial community associated with these coral species is necessary to understand and predict the coral holobiont response to a changing environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of this proposal are to: &lt;br/&gt;1. Use cultivation independent techniques to identify and quantify microorganisms associated with several major reef building corals of Hawaii in the North Pacific Ocean that represent a variety of reproductive strategies (brooding and broadcast spawning) and differing modes of zooxanthellae symbiont transmission (vertical vs. horizontal), throughout the reproductive cycle, early developmental stages, and post-settlement stages of each.&lt;br/&gt;2. Collect and analyze similar samples from the same (or similar) species of coral found in the South Pacific Ocean in Moorea, French Polynesia, in order to assess whether the associations documented in objective 1 are localized to Hawaii, or broadly distributed across the Pacific and likely to represent common features of coral development.&lt;br/&gt;3. Use fluorescence in situ hybridization to enumerate cells of the Jannaschia lineage of the Roseobacter clade throughout the development cycle of P. meandrina collected in Hawaii. The PIs will expand this objective to include other coral species, target bacteria, and/or geographic location as they identify additional associations.&lt;br/&gt;4. Isolate microorganisms prevalent in cultivation-independent surveys of P. meandrina-associated microbial communities (e.g. Jannaschia sp.) by the application of novel culturing techniques, in order to develop model systems for the investigation of coral-microbe interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit Coral reefs are in decline as a result of increasing environmental stress due to anthropogenic activity, and there is now considerable evidence indicating that they are under threat from the effects of rising sea surface temperature and ocean acidification. Microorganisms associated with corals are thought to play a variety of potentially important roles in maintaining the health and resiliency of the coral host, and advances in methodology primarily driven by developments in the field of molecular biology are facilitating growing insight into this association. Much of coral-microbial research is focused on the contribution of microorganisms to disease and bleaching, and is focused almost exclusively on adult coral colonies. This study will provide unique information on the manner in which microorganisms interact with healthy corals throughout their developmental cycle, the specificity of these relationships, how they are initiated, and their distribution and frequency in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts (1) This proposal will support the training of one postdoctoral scholar in advancing molecular microbial ecology techniques, novel cultivation-based methodology, and coral biology. (2) The investigators will develop a website that will contain information on coral-microbial interactions, with content designed to serve as an educational resource for K-12 students, and to serve as a resource for other scientists interested in coral-microbial associations. Data generated from this study, including publications, presentations, microbial strains, gene sequences, photomicrographs and phylogenetic analyses, will be made publicly available via the website. (3) The postdoc and PI will design and annually offer a five-day intensive training workshop on the use of ARB sequence analysis program, including the application of fluorescence in situ microscopy to marine bacteria and coral samples. (4) The proposal will support the training of undergraduate students under the mentorship of the postdoctoral scholar, and will take advantage of existing programs and relationships to specifically offer these opportunities to underrepresented students at the University of Hawaii such as Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.</AbstractNarration>
