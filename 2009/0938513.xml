    <AbstractNarration>The project is developing and documenting a methodology to aid CCLI project investigators in disseminating their educational innovations using the NSDL. The investigators are convening a one and a half day workshop to identify key issues related to developing adaptable materials and to disseminating these materials. Participants are being selected from CCLI awardees that have authored web-based learning resources. The team is preparing a guide for incorporating quality into web-based instructional products and for connecting CCLI materials to the NSDL framework. Central tenants of the guide are the effective use of NSDL disciplinary pathways and recommendations for building a community of users who actively and continuously assist one another in the effective use of innovative teaching and learning processes and materials. The dissemination guide is being distributed to all CCLI awardees, posted on a web-site to allow future awardees access to it, and described at major STEM education conferences.</AbstractNarration>
