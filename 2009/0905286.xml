    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops cryptographic protocol reasoning techniques&lt;br/&gt;that take into account algebraic properties of cryptosystems.&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, formal methods for cryptographic protocol&lt;br/&gt;verification view cryptographic operations as a black box,&lt;br/&gt;ignoring the properties of cryptographic algorithms that can be&lt;br/&gt;exploited to design attacks. The proposed research uses a novel&lt;br/&gt;approach based on equational unification to build new more&lt;br/&gt;expressive and efficient search algorithms for algebraic theories&lt;br/&gt;relevant to cryptographic protocols. Equational unification gives&lt;br/&gt;a compact representation of all circumstances under which two&lt;br/&gt;different terms correspond to the same behavior. The algorithms&lt;br/&gt;are implemented and integrated into Maude-NPA, a system that has&lt;br/&gt;been successful in symbolic protocol analysis. It is demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;that Maude-NPA when enriched with such powerful unification&lt;br/&gt;algorithms can analyze protocols and ensure their reliability,&lt;br/&gt;which could not be done otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved techniques for analyzing security are helpful both in&lt;br/&gt;assuring that systems are free of bugs, and in speeding up the&lt;br/&gt;acceptance of new systems based on the confidence gained by a&lt;br/&gt;formal analysis. This research will lead to the design and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of next generation tools for protocol analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms developed will be made available to researchers as a&lt;br/&gt;library suitable for use with protocol analysis tools. Tools from&lt;br/&gt;the project will help students understand concepts relevant to&lt;br/&gt;protocol design and get hands-on experience. Equational&lt;br/&gt;unification for algebraic theories is not only useful for&lt;br/&gt;protocol analysis, but also for program analysis in general, thus&lt;br/&gt;making the results of this project to be widely relevant.</AbstractNarration>
