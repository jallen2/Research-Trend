    <AbstractNarration>Hara&lt;br/&gt;0940398&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our current understanding of air-sea interaction processes under tropical cyclones (hurricanes) is far from satisfactory and is one of the factors that are limiting our ability to improve tropical cyclone prediction (intensity prediction, in particular). Further improvement of air-sea flux parameterizations and near surface turbulence modeling, however, is a formidable scientific challenge because: (1) the need to improve understanding of all relevant processes, including near surface atmospheric and oceanic turbulence, surface waves, surface breaking waves, sea spray and bubble generations, interactions between sprays and atmospheric turbulence, interactions between bubbles and oceanic turbulence; (2) these processes occur over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from the storm scale to microphysical scales of bubbles and sprays; and (3) since many of these processes are strongly dependent on the surface wave conditions, it may be necessary to fully couple the atmospheric, wave, and ocean models in order to properly predict the air-sea interaction processes and their impact on tropical cyclone dynamics. It is evident that we need a coordinated interdisciplinary effort to significantly improve predictions of air-sea interaction processes under tropical cyclones. The PI team are thus organizing a workshop aimed on: identifying immediate and long term scientific issues to be focused upon; enhancing communication among scientists/engineers in different disciplines; and building a framework in which novel interdisciplinary research initiatives are promoted and nurtured. The workshop will be organized by 3 co-organizers, Tetsu Hara (air-sea interaction), Stephan Grilli (ocean engineering, wave breaking), and Isaac Ginis (ocean and atmospheric modeling), and will be held at the Alton Jones campus of the University of Rhode Island in 2010. The PIs will target an international and multi-disciplinary, but small enough group to allow for easy communication during general discussions. We will maintain a balance of seniority and diversity and reach out to the international community, paying special attention to early career investigators. The workshop promotes international cooperation since about half of the participants will be invited from other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being co-funded by the ENG and GEO directorates.</AbstractNarration>
