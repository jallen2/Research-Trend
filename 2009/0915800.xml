    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, the new field of compressive sensing has emerged with the &lt;br/&gt;promise to revolutionize digital processing broadly. The key idea is &lt;br/&gt;the use of nonadaptive linear projections to acquire an efficient, &lt;br/&gt;dimensionally reduced representation of a signal or image directly &lt;br/&gt;using just a few measurements. Surprisingly, Nyquist-rate sampling, &lt;br/&gt;which has dominated how signals are acquired and processed in science &lt;br/&gt;and technology since the origin of digital processing, can be leaped &lt;br/&gt;over through compressive sensing theory. Such results may have a &lt;br/&gt;profound impact broadly, including applications in spectroscopy, &lt;br/&gt;imaging, communications, as well as consumer electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, the compressive sensing framework is ``extended" to &lt;br/&gt;make it an integral part of a discrete-time all-analog-processing &lt;br/&gt;communications system that completely skips the digital domain and &lt;br/&gt;shows an excellent robustness against noise. The key idea is the use &lt;br/&gt;of non-linear mappings that act as analog channel encoders, processing &lt;br/&gt;the samples or compressive sensing measurements proceeding from an &lt;br/&gt;analog source and producing continuous amplitude samples that are &lt;br/&gt;transmitted directly through the noisy channel. Thus, all the &lt;br/&gt;processing in the communications system is made in the analog domain. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to its theoretical interest, the potential of this &lt;br/&gt;approach in practical systems is substantial. For instance, the &lt;br/&gt;proposed framework is readily applicable in practical systems such as &lt;br/&gt;imaging, where it presents a performance that is very close to the &lt;br/&gt;theoretical limits and clearly outperforms systems based on standard &lt;br/&gt;compressive sensing. Furthermore, the idea of completely avoiding the &lt;br/&gt;digital domain can be applied not just in point-to-point &lt;br/&gt;communications systems, but also in more complex communications &lt;br/&gt;problems such as distributed coding in sensor networks.</AbstractNarration>
