    <AbstractNarration>Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) are a new genre of interactive experience that requires players to collaborate in order to solve problems using the real world as a narrative platform. The goal of this project is to understand and tailor this new genre for use as (1) an engaging educational activity that provides hands-on experience using a range of collaborate technologies and computational strategies, and (2) a platform on which to co-design and evaluate novel collaborative tools that may be used in unanticipated ways. The proposed work is unconventional and high risk, yet could lead to significant payoffs. Success in the knowledge economy requires that students develop strong instincts and expertise in applying cooperative technologies and tools to effectively collect multimedia data, make sense of it, and use it to solve practical and challenging problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will produce broader impacts that focus on recruitment and retention of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students. ARGs have the potential to attract a wide variety of students from diverse socio-technical backgrounds, as well as introduce scientific and mathematical problems (e.g., puzzles) in non-traditional ways.</AbstractNarration>
