    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the building of a tool that supports test design in the context of Java-based object-oriented programming from the very beginning and throughout the undergraduate curriculum. Concurrently, curriculum materials are developed that support learning test design for both the novice programmers, and for the advanced learner, along with a comprehensive introduction to the design of test cases, the design of methods that perform test evaluation, and the design of the test reporting. The goal is to introduce gradually the techniques for test design and the understanding of the underlying concepts arising from test evaluation (equality, cloning, circularity of data definitions, handling exceptions, testing effects, etc.) so that students acquire gradually all skills needed to understand and master both test design and test evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The importance of software test design is self-evident. The project's intellectual merit is in making software testing an integral part of computing curricula, producing students who understand both the benefit of well designed tests and the art of designing both the tests and software that supports systematic testing. An additional merit is the development of the pedagogy that is needed to guide the student through the gradual introduction to the design of tests as well as software that supports testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The goal of this project is to change in a fundamental way the teaching of programming at all levels, so that the habit of proper test design is ingrained in students' minds from the beginning. Such a change has a lasting impact on students' programming practice and in the long term will impact the software industry the students enter upon graduation. Through a web site, workshops, mailing list, and other outreach activities, results are disseminated to impact instructors and students at hundreds of colleges and universities. Additional dissemination of the results is through papers and tutorials at conferences.</AbstractNarration>
