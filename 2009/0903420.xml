    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate several aspects of polynomial mappings and&lt;br/&gt;related matters. One topic involves orbits of complex polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will study when the cartesian product of finitely many such&lt;br/&gt;orbits has infinitely many points in common with an algebraic subvariety of&lt;br/&gt;affine space. This is a dynamical analogue of the Mordell--Lang conjecture&lt;br/&gt;about intersections of subgroups and subvarieties of group varieties.&lt;br/&gt;Another topic is to determine the polynomials over a field&lt;br/&gt;of positive characteristic inducing mappings with certain properties;&lt;br/&gt;these properties can be recorded in the monodromy group of the polynomial,&lt;br/&gt;so the problem is to determine polynomials with prescribed monodromy group.&lt;br/&gt;Via a splitting field construction, polynomials with unusual monodromy groups&lt;br/&gt;give rise to curves with large automorphism group. Such polynomials could&lt;br/&gt;thus be classified if one could classify curves with large automorphism&lt;br/&gt;group over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, which&lt;br/&gt;is the next topic the PI will study. A fourth topic is the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and algorithmic analysis of the problem of computing the intersection&lt;br/&gt;of two subfields of the field of rational functions, along with generalizations&lt;br/&gt;to mappings between curves. A final topic addresses connections between&lt;br/&gt;discrete mathematics and algebraic geometry, for instance via connecting certain&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial objects (Kloosterman sums) with parameter spaces (Shimura curves).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;The classical topic of dynamical systems studies the orbit of&lt;br/&gt;a number under a polynomial,&lt;br/&gt;which is the collection of numbers obtained by repeatedly applying&lt;br/&gt;the polynomial to the number. For instance, the orbit of the number 1&lt;br/&gt;under the polynomial f(x)=3x+1 is 1, 4, 13, 40, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;One question is when one such orbit can contain infinitely many numbers&lt;br/&gt;whose square is in an orbit of another polynomial. More generally, the&lt;br/&gt;PI will study when there is a polynomial relationship between infinitely&lt;br/&gt;many points in one orbit and infinitely many in another. The proposer&lt;br/&gt;intends to determine all examples of this phenomenon by proving new&lt;br/&gt;results about certain types of identities of the form a(b(x))=c(d(x)),&lt;br/&gt;where a, b, c and d are rational functions (i.e., ratios of polynomials).</AbstractNarration>
