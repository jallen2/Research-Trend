    <AbstractNarration>CIF: NeTS: Small: Collaborative research: Distributed Spectrum Leasing &lt;br/&gt;via Cross-Layer Cooperation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ?Cognitive radio? networks, in which primary (licensed) and secondary (unlicensed) terminals coexist over the same bandwidth, are regarded as a promising solution to address spectral shortage and overcrowding. The main conventional approaches to enable such coexistence are: (i) Underlay/ overlay/ interweave strategies, which enforce strict constraints on the secondary behavior in order to avoid interference to the primary; and (ii) System-wide dynamic spectrum allocation. Both frameworks have significant drawbacks for implementation of large-scale distributed cognitive radio networks due to technological and theoretical limits on secondary spectrum sensing for (i) and on the stringent constraints on protocols and architectures for (ii).&lt;br/&gt; To address the problems highlighted above, this research introduces and studies the novel framework of Distributed Spectrum Leasing via Cross-Layer Cooperation (DiSC) as a basic mechanism to guide the design of Medium Access Control/ Data Link (MAC/DL) - Physical (PHY) layer protocols in decentralized cognitive radio networks. According to this framework, dynamic ?leasing? of a transmission opportunity (e.g., a time-slot) from a primary node to a secondary terminal is performed locally as driven by primary needs in terms of given Quality-of-Service (QoS) measures at the MAC/DL-PHY layers. Specifically, DiSC enables each primary terminal to ?lease? a transmission opportunity to a local secondary terminal at MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) granularity in exchange for cooperation (relaying). The project aims, on the one hand, at a theoretical understanding of the potentiality of the approach from the standpoints of network information theory and networking theory, and, on the other, at the (clean-slate and back-compatible) design of MAC/DL-PHY protocols that effectively implements DiSC in a complex wireless environment. &lt;br/&gt;Keywords: Spectrum leasing, dynamic resource allocation, cognitive radio, cooperative transmission, cross-layer design, multi-hop wireless networks.</AbstractNarration>
