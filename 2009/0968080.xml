    <AbstractNarration>0968080&lt;br/&gt;Goldsborough&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate and understand the ignition and pollutant formation chemistry of next-generation of biofuels. Bio-derived fuels represent an important domestic resource with the potential to enable sustainability targets to be achieved while addressing regional air quality problems. These fuels behave significantly differently from conventional fuels and a fundamental understanding is critical for the development advanced combustion engines (ACE). This study will focus on biodiesels, or more specifically biodiesel surrogates. These surrogates are medium weight esters whose molecular structure is similar to today?s biodiesels and tomorrow?s bio-derived synthetic-derivatives. Synthetic derivatives are being pursued by the bio-fuel industry in order to improve important fuel properties such viscosity, surface tension, pour point and thermo-oxidative stability. It is hypothesized that manipulations of the fuel?s molecular structure not only impacts these properties, but also ignition behavior and pollutant formation. Various fuel structures will be investigated in this study including different fatty acid chains and different ester groups. A well-characterized, rapid compression expansion machine (RCEM) along with an integrated gas sampling system and GC/MS analytical unit will be employed to acquire necessary data. The data from the RCEM will be used to develop chemical kinetic mechanisms that can describe ignition delay, heat released, and combustion intermediates. The mechanisms will be validated and refined with the aid of reaction path and sensitivity analysis tools. The PI will work closely with collaborators at the National Center for Food and Agricultural Research, LLNL, the National University of Ireland Galway, ANL, Reaction Design and Ford. These organizations represent a wide spectrum of parties invested in the development and effective utilization of next-generation fuels in ACEs. The PI and his research group, through this project, will play an integral part in this evolving industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combustion chemistry of bio-derived fuels is not well understood. The proposed work will focus on C13- esters as surrogates for larger C17- C21- molecules in order to reveal how fuel molecular structure, including novel synthetic formulations, regulates ignition behavior and pollutant formation when used in operating combustion engines. Of particular interest are processes in ACE regimes including low/intermediate temperature (600-1100K), high pressure (2-20MPa) and various levels of dilution. Fundamental data for diesel and bio-diesel relevant fuels are scarce in part due to the problem of involatility. This research will develop techniques to overcome this barrier and acquire the necessary data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This integrated research and education plan will enable collaboration with others, to recruit and retain a diverse pool of high-quality undergraduate and graduate students in mechanical engineering at Marquette University. Through this program students will be exposed to: critical issues facing our nation, techniques and tools for scientific discovery, exciting and relevant research topics, and opportunities for professional development, collaborative environments and international perspectives. Strong relationships will be cultivated between the PI and three national labs, one international university, two industrial organizations. Education and outreach to area high schools will be facilitated through the College of Engineering?s participation in Project Lead the Way. The data and understanding acquired through this work will contribute to an urgently needed body of knowledge regarding bio-derived fuel combustion. Results will be disseminated widely in journal, conference, working group and web-based forums.</AbstractNarration>
