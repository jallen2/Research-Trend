    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to apply and extend position measurement techniques from the fields of scanned probe microscopy and optical lithography to solve the problem of relative tool positioning at the tens-of-nanometer level in precision five axis diamond machining. This will enable the fabrication of novel hierarchically integrated, monolithic, optical structures with size scales ranging from hundreds of millimeters down to hundreds of nanometers on a single component. The approach will be to create a fully compensated "machine-within-a-machine" with uncertainties that are an order of magnitude less than those of the original system using established thermal control and software error compensation techniques in precision engineering. Within this smaller work volume, a tool location system will be designed to locate the relative position of two single crystal diamond tools with sub-wavelength precision using a combination of low-force contact and non-contact sensors such as capacitance based air-bearing probes, quartz tuning forks, and oil immersion optical elements. The system will be tested by using one of the tools to manufacture a curved spherical or aspheric optical surface and the other to place an optically functional subwavelength pattern on that curved surface; a polarization sensitive lens is an easily tested example. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work will result in a paradigm for creating an innovative class of optics with functionality that cannot be achieved by other methods and will benefit such diverse areas as medical, military and energy technologies. This research has the potential to open up new commercial markets for optical devices. Thus, the overall program also targets multiple, integrated initiatives for research in education by leveraging existing, on-campus outreach efforts with the end goal of producing students that are trained to transfer the new technologies to industry and establish new commercial enterprises as appropriate.</AbstractNarration>
