    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research award to Tufts University and Northwestern University will study the development of professional engineering skills in undergraduate engineering students. The goals is to create a rich educational environment that fosters the development of engineering knowledge, skills and achievement both within college and in launching a successful career as an engineer. The techniques to be used will be drawn from design theory, cognitive science, developmental psychology, and engineering education research. This is a one year pilot study and the results will be presented at technical conferences and published in professional journals. The goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering through more effective development of their professional skills. The results will increase student?s interest in engineering and will enhance the number of students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.</AbstractNarration>
