    <AbstractNarration>While hardware resources for computation and data storage are now abundant, &lt;br/&gt;economic factors prevent specialized hardware security mechanisms from being &lt;br/&gt;integrated into commodity parts. System owners are caught between the need to exploit &lt;br/&gt;cheap, fast, commodity microprocessors and the need to ensure that critical security &lt;br/&gt;properties hold. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will explore a novel way to augment commodity hardware after fabrication &lt;br/&gt;to enhance secure operation. The basic approach is to add a separate silicon layer, &lt;br/&gt;housing select security features, onto an existing integrated circuit. This 3-D Integration &lt;br/&gt;decouples the function and economics of security policy enforcement from the &lt;br/&gt;underlying computing hardware. As a result, security enhancements are manufacturing &lt;br/&gt;options applicable only to those systems that require them, which resolves the &lt;br/&gt;economic quandary. We plan to identify a minimal and realizable set of circuit-level &lt;br/&gt;security capabilities enabled by this approach, which can be judiciously controlled by &lt;br/&gt;the software layers. This will significantly assist in reducing both the software complexity &lt;br/&gt;often associated with security mechanisms and system vulnerabilities. &lt;br/&gt;This research introduces a fundamentally new method to incorporate security &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms into hardware and has the potential to significantly shift the economics of &lt;br/&gt;trustworthy systems. A broader impact will result through collaborative and educational &lt;br/&gt;activities. Graduate and undergraduate student research associates will transfer &lt;br/&gt;knowledge to future teachers, researchers and Information Assurance professionals; &lt;br/&gt;and project publications will provide direct technical transfer to the embedded-systems &lt;br/&gt;and hardware-design communities.</AbstractNarration>
