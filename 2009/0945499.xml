    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project entitled Courseload Learning Platform: Digital Delivery and Use of Course Materials in Higher Education proposes to test the technical and commercial merits of an innovation aimed at greatly accelerating the use of digital course materials in higher education. It involves an industry-university collaboration with Indiana University which will mobilize students and faculty in STEM courses to help guide development of the set of conditions and capabilities required to build and leverage a broader digital learning infrastructure. Phase I findings will frame further research and innovation required in Phase II to help realize the strong commercial potential of this idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop an innovative two-tiered approach to removing barriers that prevent widespread use of digital course materials in higher education. First is a novel business model that overcomes intellectual property issues and reduces materials cost by 50%. This makes possible the second tier -- technical advancements in learning tools that enhance student attainment and enable faculty to improve teaching methodology. Building on a Fall 2009 pilot in the Information Systems discipline with its partner Indiana University, the project will conduct further research in a Spring Expansion to additional STEM disciplines, testing elements that drive viral student acceptance and improve educational outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
