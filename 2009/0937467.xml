    <AbstractNarration>Chapman Conference on Examining Ecohydrological Feedbacks of Landscape Change along Elevation&lt;br/&gt;Gradients in Semiarid Regions, October 5-9, 2009, Sun Valley, Idaho, USA&lt;br/&gt;Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union (AGU)&lt;br/&gt;and are designed to promote opportunities not normally available through larger meetings.&lt;br/&gt;The AGU Chapman Conference on Examining Ecohydrological Feedbacks of Landscape Change along&lt;br/&gt;Elevation Gradients in Semiarid Regions takes place 5-9 October 2009, in Sun Valley, Idaho.&lt;br/&gt;Ecohyrdology is an emerging and rapidly evolving science. Several books on this topic have&lt;br/&gt;been published since 2002, in addition to special features in journals. This Chapman Conference&lt;br/&gt;will examine the ecohydrological changes taking place in semiarid landscapes, across elevation&lt;br/&gt;and precipitation gradients. The conference goal is to help scientists from different disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds and land managers better understand and address the substantial changes occurring&lt;br/&gt;in semiarid landscapes. This conference builds on the success of a previous Chapman Conference,&lt;br/&gt;Ecohydrology of Semiarid Environments, held in 2002.&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that approximately 100 participants will attend this conference, with a&lt;br/&gt;mix of 20% by invitation, ~80% contributed, and about 25% will be young scientists and students.</AbstractNarration>
