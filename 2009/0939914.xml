    <AbstractNarration>This award provides travel funding to increase US participation in the&lt;br/&gt;half-year program on Stochastic Processes in Communication Sciences at the&lt;br/&gt;Isaac Newton Institute at Cambridge University, January 11 through July&lt;br/&gt;2, 2010. The program aims at the exposition of the latest developments in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences that sit at the boundary between the disciplines of&lt;br/&gt;stochastics and communications. The program will bring together experts&lt;br/&gt;from the mathematics, probability, engineering, and computer science communities, to advance the field and identify important research directions. Up&lt;br/&gt;to twenty Visiting Fellows will be in residence at any time through the period&lt;br/&gt;of the program, and additional Program Participants will be invited for&lt;br/&gt;shorter periods. Four transversal workshops, a satellite workshop for young&lt;br/&gt;researchers and several shorter events are being organized, the primary ones&lt;br/&gt;being: &lt;br/&gt;(1) New topics at the interface between probability and communications&lt;br/&gt;(11 - 15 January 2010); &lt;br/&gt;(2) Stochastic Networks (22 - 26 March 2010);&lt;br/&gt;(3) Spatial Networks (6 - 9 April 2010); &lt;br/&gt;(4) Satellite meeting for young researchers&lt;br/&gt;(At ICMS, Edinburgh, 7 - 11 June 2010); &lt;br/&gt;(5) Statistics of Networks&lt;br/&gt;(21 - 25 June 2010).&lt;br/&gt;The NSF funding will be used to facilitate the interaction of young US&lt;br/&gt;researchers with the top researchers in these areas who will be in residence&lt;br/&gt;at the Newton Institute during this program, by supporting the travel of&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers (graduate students, post-docs, and faculty members at&lt;br/&gt;most seven years beyond Ph. D.), woman researchers and researchers from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
