    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on reducing the overhead and increasing throughput of network processing in multi-core platforms. In particular, packet processing functions are proposed to be balanced across the cores so as to facilitate virtualization in next-generation systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-cost multi-core architectures that put many CPU cores on the same chip are abundantly available in the market today. Researchers are developing a range of programming techniques for different applications to efficiently utilize the parallelism available in such multi-core architectures. However, research into how to alleviate the I/O bottleneck, where protocol-processing overhead dominates the CPU execution time, is sparse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multicore has enabled broad interest in virtualization for diverse uses including server consolidation and sharing of various resources. Studies have shown that virtualization brings significant extra overhead to network I/O. The objective of this project is to develop techniques to optimize the performance of virtualized I/O with high-speed networks. In particular, the research team explores new software techniques in virtualized environments, that may reduce the network I/O overhead in multi-core processors, through the following approaches: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Life of a Packet Analysis: this involves a measurement technique to trace the life of a packet in a virtualized environment with 10 Gigabit Ethernet. The study instruments the OS software, and should reveal potential bottleneck functions that contribute heavily to packet latency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Mutithreading the protocol stack: Based on life-of-a-packet analysis, the TCP/IP protocol stack in the guest O/S and virtual machine monitor (VMM) will be divided into multiple threads that can execute in parallel on multiple cores and cut down the latency. Core scheduling techniques are developed to allocate these threads to different cores so as to exploit the cache locality of the multi-core architecture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Pipeline Scheduling: Instead of splitting the protocol stack in terms of latency bottleneck, tasks are partitioned based on code size and multiple threads developed. Techniques are developed to schedule the threads appropriately so that the cache misses are reduced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Combined Scheduling for Virtualized Environment: Although the parallel/pipeline techniques are developed separately from the TCP/IP stack and VMM, they are combined to create multiple threads in a virtualized environment and various code scheduling optimizations are applied to reduce latency and increase I/O throughput. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A complimentary project to the one described here has been partly supported by grants from the Intel Corporation. Hence, the research results obtained from this project may have strong potential for technology transfer. The PI has mentored several Ph.D. graduates who later developed reputations for architecture research and he has mentored four female Ph.D. graduates during the last two years, contributing to increasing the representation of women in computing in the country. Such efforts continue under this NSF project. UCR is recognized as a minority serving institution. Hence, involving undergraduate students will enable minority participation in the project.</AbstractNarration>
