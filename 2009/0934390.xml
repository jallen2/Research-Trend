    <AbstractNarration>Center for Grid-Connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-0934390&lt;br/&gt;University of Arkansas&lt;br/&gt;Mantooth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP-0934378&lt;br/&gt;University of South Carolina (USC)&lt;br/&gt;Dougal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Grid-Connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES)" with a focus on developing the new knowledge, tools, hardware, software, and personnel that are required to pervasively insert power electronics into the 21st century power grid in ways that will strengthen and modernize the grid. The lead of the proposed Center will be the University of Arkansas (UK) with the University of South Carolina (USC) as a research partner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New software will be developed to enable grid connected power electronics to benefit the grid as well as controlled loads. This will include new novel medium voltage multiport power converter system to efficiently and reliably integrate energy storage systems (ESS), and renewable distributed energy resources (DER), into the utility grid. The new IUCRC will target three industries: 1) utilities and other end users, 2) equipment manufacturers, and 3) component suppliers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed center has the potential to improve sustainablility and profitability of US manufacturing by developing new technologies that will reduce energy consumption and pollution. The proposed I/UCRC plans to develop leading-edge industry relevant research, and to make full use of an already-developed national-caliber facility for design, development, test, evaluation, and standardization of distribution-level grid-connected power electronic equipment. Students and faculty members will gain valuable experience by interaction with industry partners. The PIs adequately describe their plan for including under represented groups in all areas of the research program. The Center will train students and practicing engineers and establish new courses that will integrate research with education. This center has the potential to make the US a leader in power electronic systems for grids especially for developing countries.</AbstractNarration>
