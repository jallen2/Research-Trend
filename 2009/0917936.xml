    <AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project--a Type II (A:B) partnership between Purdue University, an NSF PFI graduated grantee (0538786)in collaboration with participants from another NSF partnership supported program, graduated I/UCRC Center for Surface Engineering and Tribology (9214605/9909226), at Northwestern University--focuses on developing systematic and scientific models of laser-based manufacturing processes through combined analytical and experimental investigations so as to facilitate industrial innovations and commercialization. One of the more rapidly emerging and innovative technological arenas in the global economy is laser-based manufacturing and materials processing. Recent years have seen a steady erosion of manufacturing industries at an alarming rate. Many traditional manufacturing processes are now performed in less developed countries where costs are low. Thus, in order to maintain or regain the competitiveness in manufacturing, advanced manufacturing techniques must be developed. The research will provide useful understanding of laser-material interaction, which is a common problem for other laser processes. The projects proposed, involving laser-assisted machining, laser shock peening, laser cladding and laser surface texturing, constitute an opportunity to test the assertion that fundamental mathematical modeling is an effective component of technology development and can make progress more quickly and cost effectively than empirical approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a broader use of laser-based manufacturing and materials processing technologies in the key U.S. manufacturing companies and commercialization activities. The project will also provide education and training of a diverse workforce, including graduate students, undergraduates, and high school teachers. The principles and results of laser-based manufacturing processes will be incorporated in various undergraduate and graduate classes. Involvement of underrepresented students will be pursued through existing programs such as the Women in Engineering Program (WIEP) and the Minority Engineering Program (MEP). The development of K-12 outreach materials will be embedded into the undergraduate curriculum through the highly acclaimed Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) Program investigations so as to facilitate industrial innovations and commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: Purdue University (lead institution), and Northwestern University; Private Sector Organizations (Industrial): Baker Hughes (The Woodlands, TX); Ford Motors (Detroit, MI); General Electric Aviation (Cincinnati, OH), Nanohmics (Austin, TX), and Optomec (Albuquerque, NM); Also Additional Industrial Collaborators (providing cash and in-kind support): LSP Technologies, Adiabatics, Chrysler, Lockheed Martin, Rolls Royce, and Weir Minerals. Also as collaborator, Academic Institutions: Florida International University and Bethune Community College</AbstractNarration>
