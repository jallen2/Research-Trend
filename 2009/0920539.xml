    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops an exciting and engaging curriculum for teaching introductory computing within the context of using personal robots. The second goal is the design and development of an affordable personal robot that can be brought to the level of a refined product. The project includes both the development of a textbook for use in the teaching of CS1 courses and a new software framework that will enable the use of a choice of robots, programming languages, and operating systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is meant to directly address the ongoing crisis in attracting and retaining students into computing disciplines. Based on the previous successes, the project expands and replicates the previous results on a national level. It supports faculty enhancement, community building for wider adoption and detailed assessment at a diverse range of institutions. It integrates several facets of research and development including rethinking of introductory curricula; design, development, and manufacturing of innovative robot hardware; design and development of a modern, multi-language, cross-platform software framework; context-driven textbook and other teaching materials; and community building in the educational robotics domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has a potential to develop resources that can be used and shared by instructors worldwide in teaching CS1 and robotics to undergraduate students. It establishes a non-profit, commercial, open-source distribution channel for robot kits, software, and texts. An extensive dissemination plan includes hands-on faculty training workshops to assist a diverse range of colleges and universities to test, evaluate, and adapt the materials</AbstractNarration>
