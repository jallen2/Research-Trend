    <AbstractNarration>Eigenvalue computation is a fundamental problem in numerical&lt;br/&gt;linear algebra. While there are numerous established algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for this, they do not guarantee in general to compute, in a&lt;br/&gt;floating point arithmetic, smaller eigenvalues to high relative&lt;br/&gt;accuracy. Indeed, the relative errors of smaller eigenvalues&lt;br/&gt;computed by conventional algorithms are proportional to the&lt;br/&gt;condition number of the matrix. Research over the last two&lt;br/&gt;decades has resulted in several classes of special matrices&lt;br/&gt;for which the eigenvalues/eigenvectors can be computed to high&lt;br/&gt;relative accuracy (i.e. independent of the condition number).&lt;br/&gt;All existing high relative accuracy algorithms, however, appear&lt;br/&gt;to concern small (dense) matrices only. Yet, large matrices are&lt;br/&gt;often inherently ill-conditioned and it is typically a few&lt;br/&gt;smaller eigenvalues that are of interests. The goals of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal are to study high relative accuracy iterative&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for computing a few eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a&lt;br/&gt;large symmetric positive definite matrix. The investigator will&lt;br/&gt;develop algorithms for matrices arising in some important&lt;br/&gt;applications such as discretization of differential operators&lt;br/&gt;and dimensionality reduction in machine learning, where special&lt;br/&gt;structure/properties of the matrices may be exploited to&lt;br/&gt;achieve higher accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectral (eigenvalue) analysis is a widely used mathematical&lt;br/&gt;tool in science and engineering. Eigenvalues of differential&lt;br/&gt;operators describe the natural vibrating frequencies of&lt;br/&gt;mechanical structures. Dimensionality reduction of&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional data in machine learning often leads to&lt;br/&gt;minimization of certain quadratic functionals, the solutions of&lt;br/&gt;which are eigenvectors. Solving such eigenvalue problems to&lt;br/&gt;high relative accuracy pose a challenge to existing algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, the proposed works will not only advance theoretical&lt;br/&gt;foundations and algorithm developments for large scale&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalue problems, but also contribute to the general areas&lt;br/&gt;of applied science/engineering and machine learning by&lt;br/&gt;significantly improving the accuracy of the algorithms used in&lt;br/&gt;these applications.</AbstractNarration>
