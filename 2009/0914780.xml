    <AbstractNarration>This project will explore a novel direction to address the privacy/ utility tradeoff of trace sharing: secure queries on original traces under their owner?s control. The data owner publishes a query language and an online portal, allowing researchers to submit sets of queries to be run on data. Only certain operations are allowed on certain data &amp;#64257;elds, and in speci&amp;#64257;c contexts. This policy is speci&amp;#64257;ed by the provider and enforced by the language interpreter. The interpreter analyzes the queries, runs those that are permitted and returns the results to the researcher. The results consist of aggregate information such as counts, histograms, distributions and not of individual packets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secure queries address privacy/utility tradeoff much better than sanitization. Privacy is protected by &amp;#64257;ner-grain control given to data owner, which permits detection of many passive attacks and minimization of information leakage from active attacks. Future attack vectors can be handled by adding new constraints on the query language. Secure queries also show a potential to reveal more data to researchers than it was possible with sanitization. Fine-grain control via query language enables processing of many &amp;#64257;elds in the application header, and even in sensitive application content, while satisfying the owner?s privacy concerns. This is likely to increase utility of public traces for application and security research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will investigate research utility of network trace data, and the relationship of known and novel attacks to combinations of packet &amp;#64257;elds, operations on those &amp;#64257;elds, and contexts that pose privacy risk. Based on these &amp;#64257;ndings, the team will develop a secure query language Trol, and an interpreter for this language Patrol. Trol will support common operations on traces, needed for networking research, and Patrol will prohibit queries and contexts that pose a privacy risk as speci&amp;#64257;ed by the provider ?s privacy policy. Both the language and policies will be extensible by data owners to accommodate future discoveries. Trol and Patrol will be deployed at USC/ISI and will run on publicly available, sanitized trace archives and on synthetically generated, full packet traces. This deployment will help to test expressiveness and privacy protection of Trol operations. The work will also publicize the work among data owners, to motivate the shift from sanitization to protection of traces via secure queries.</AbstractNarration>
