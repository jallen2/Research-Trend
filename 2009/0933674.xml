    <AbstractNarration>0933674 &lt;br/&gt;Theis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to convene a workshop on life cycle research needs and opportunities of nanotechnological materials, manufacturing methods, and products. Research on life cycle aspects of nanotechnology has lagged overall research efforts, and even the small (but growing) effort on environmental, health, and safety is devoted largely to understanding the fate, transport, and toxicological properties of nanostructured materials - rather than life cycle resource demands, emissions and environmental implications. Despite widespread agreement on the importance of the life cycle perspective, current research efforts with regard to life cycle assessment per se are miniscule by comparison and exhibit no discernable trend. The lack of a concerted research effort on life cycle and nanotechnology means that a number of critical issues that impact environmental quality are not being adequately addressed. These include resource availability and allocation, energy requirements, manufacturing efficiency, supply chain management, environmental properties of nanomaterials, waste generation, and end-of-life management (which includes disposal, containment, and recycling/reuse). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A focused, two day workshop is planned with a core of 12-15 expert invitees. Additional attendees will bring the total to approximately 50 individuals. Each invitee will prepare in advance a two-page paper that addresses one or more of a series of critical questions that frame the proceedings. These will be circulated and discussed in advance among all attendees. The goal of the workshop is to establish the basis for a focused research program that comprehensively addresses the environmental impacts of nanotechnology using the life cycle approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is differentiated from other nanotechnology research efforts by its specific focus on life cycle assessment methods, research needs and findings. The specific objectives are to (1) review existing research, assess the state of science, and identify gaps in the knowledge base regarding the life cycle of nanotechnological products and processes; (2) develop a critical understanding of combinations of nanostructured materials, their manufacturing processes, and resultant products that offer the greatest promise for improvements for society, as well as those that offer little promise or have a high probability of creating or worsening environmental hazards (3) develop a research plan to address the needs identified (4) establish a pathway forward that could be pursued by an intergovernmental, or joint intergovernmental-private, initiative on the life cycle of nanotechnology; and (5) explore the basis of a life cycle regulatory framework for nanotechnological applications &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a focused research strategy for managing and improving the environmental profile of nanotechnologies. The principal output of the workshop will be a final report, or white paper, to NSF and EPA that will (1) summarize the state of knowledge, gaps, and research and regulatory needs of life cycle applied to nanotechnological products; (2) provide a rationale for the need for a focused research program on life cycle and nanotechnology that includes an analysis of costs and benefits; and (3) develop an initial plan for such a research program that will explore how it might be structured (including the potential for a joint government-private partnership), suggest necessary funding levels, and prioritize research areas.</AbstractNarration>
