    <AbstractNarration>Increasing numbers of real-world application domains are generating data that is&lt;br/&gt;inherently noisy, incomplete, and probabilistic in nature. Examples of such&lt;br/&gt;data include measurement data collected by sensor networks, observation data in&lt;br/&gt;the context of social networks, scientific and biomedical data, and data&lt;br/&gt;collected by various online cyber-sources. The data uncertainties may be a&lt;br/&gt;result of the fundamental limitations of the underlying measurement&lt;br/&gt;infrastructures, the inherent ambiguity in the domain, or they may be a&lt;br/&gt;side-effect of the rich probabilistic modeling typically performed to extract&lt;br/&gt;high-level events from sensor and cyber data. Similarly, when attempting to&lt;br/&gt;integrate heterogeneous data sources ("data integration") or extracting&lt;br/&gt;structured information from text ("information extraction"), the results are&lt;br/&gt;approximate and uncertain at best. However, there is currently a lack of data&lt;br/&gt;management tools that can reason about large volumes of uncertain data, and&lt;br/&gt;hence the information about the uncertainty is often either discarded or&lt;br/&gt;reasoned about only superficially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we are building a complete probabilistic data management&lt;br/&gt;system, called PrDB, that can manage, store, and process large-scale&lt;br/&gt;repositories of uncertain data. PrDB unifies ideas from "large-scale structured&lt;br/&gt;graphical models" like probabilistic relational models (PRMs), developed in the&lt;br/&gt;machine learning literature, and "probabilistic query processing", studied in&lt;br/&gt;the database literature. PrDB framework is based on the notion of "shared&lt;br/&gt;factors", which not only allows us to express and manipulate uncertainties at&lt;br/&gt;various levels of abstractions, but also supports capturing rich correlations&lt;br/&gt;among the uncertain data. PrDB supports a declarative SQL-like language for&lt;br/&gt;specifying uncertain data and the correlations among them. PrDB also supports&lt;br/&gt;exact and approximate evaluation of a wide range of queries including inference&lt;br/&gt;queries, SQL queries, and decision-support queries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cross-disciplinary research undertaken during this project will enable us to&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously address the challenges in the areas of probabilistic databases&lt;br/&gt;and machine learning, and allow us to transfer the key technologies developed&lt;br/&gt;between those areas, thus advancing the research in both areas. It will enable&lt;br/&gt;the development of a significant and high-impact new class of real-world&lt;br/&gt;applications, in a variety of domains including health informatics, social media&lt;br/&gt;management, World Wide Web, and scientific databases. The PrDB system source&lt;br/&gt;code, and the datasets generated during the project, will be released using an&lt;br/&gt;appropriate open source license, at the project web site:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.umd.edu/db/PrDB.html</AbstractNarration>
