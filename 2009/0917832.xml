    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0917832 PI: Mammarella, Paula ORG: Materials Research Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRS Symposium BB on Materials Systems and Processes for 3D Micro- and Nanoscale Fabrication and Lithography&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This Materials Research Society Symposium will provide a forum for presenting and discussing the latest discoveries in material systems and processes for 3D microfabrication and their application for preparing functional 3D micro- and nanoscale devices. The growing interest in 3D fabrication and assembly approaches stems from the shortcomings of past attempts simply to extend 2D micropatterning approaches to form three-dimensional structures with high yield and reliability. Additionally, the challenge extends to the ability to pattern a wide range of. materials including polymers, semiconductors, ceramics, metals, biomaterials, and composites. To address these challenges, the symposium topics will cover a range of multidisciplinary topics from assembly and optical tweezers-based patterning to lithography and direct-write approaches. A strong panel of speakers has been assembled to describe both top-down and bottom-up methodologies, including DNA, protein, and viron-directed assembly and self assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The symposium brings together experts in top-down and bottom-up patterning techniques to promote an exchange of ideas for combining these methods for specific applications. The organizers have given appropriate attention to the NSF objectives of broadening participation. Support provided by NSF will be used principally to support participation by graduate students and early career faculty, with particular attention to females and members of underrepresented groups. Plans for announcing the availability of travel and subsistence support for these populations are described as are appropriate procedures for selecting from the applicants for this support.</AbstractNarration>
