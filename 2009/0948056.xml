    <AbstractNarration>0948056&lt;br/&gt;Baeumner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this conference is to serve as a conduit for discussions of unpublished data in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, and physics as they apply to development and application of bioanalytical sensors. This aim will be achieved through active participation of attendees in two poster sessions, informal discussions, and 9 oral sessions, with 30 speakers and 9 discussion leaders. The data discussed here will encompass diverse fields and will address the following themes: 1) molecular recognition using alternatives to standard antibodies and nucleic acid probes, 2) recent advances in optical, electrochemical, and mechanical detection, 3) real-world applications and in vivo sensing, 4) use of nanotechnology to advance understanding of molecular interactions and improvement of sensor design and application, and 5) supporting/enabling technologies. Specific topics will include (but are not limited to) single molecule-based probes, intracellular sensing, biomaterials with enhanced optical or electronic properties, nanoparticles, biocompatibility and the biological/non-biological interface, miniaturization and automation, and multiplexed detection in complex matrices. In addition, the Gordon Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) will convene immediately preceding the GRC (19 - 20 June 2010). Organized and conducted by graduate students and postdocs, the GRS will provide an opportunity for junior scientists to present their own work in a formal, oral format, in front of their peers. Participation in this more intimate program (limited to &lt;35 participants) will enhance the scientific training of these junior investigators and provide them with contacts and potential collaborators. A large proportion of the total proposed budget will go to support GRC and GRS conference fees for graduate and postdoctoral participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the field of Bioanalytical Sensors is by its very nature interdisciplinary, it is important to provide scientists with information on the latest research in many areas directly related to and ancillary to biosensing technologies. The conference program addresses many diverse topics associated with bioanalytical sensing - with presentations by both up-and-coming researchers, as well as world renowned scientists with long track records of successful innovation. The discussion leaders - a hallmark of GRCs - are recognized experts in their fields and will be responsible for initiating and maintaining a vigorous, all-inclusive discussion between the talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that new ideas will be generated, leading to improved instrumentation and materials for future bioanalytical sensor platforms.</AbstractNarration>
