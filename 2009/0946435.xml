    <AbstractNarration>MIRTHE Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Industry&lt;br/&gt;MIRTHE, the NSF-sponsored Engineering Research Center for Mid-InfraRed Technologies for Health and&lt;br/&gt;the Environment, conducts a vibrant education and outreach program that starts at K-12 and culminates&lt;br/&gt;at the post-doctoral level. Here, we propose a new addition to MIRTHE's post-doctoral research and&lt;br/&gt;training program, i.e. the MIRTHE Post-doctoral Fellowship in Industry program.&lt;br/&gt;A small group of recent MIRTHE graduates will be competitively selected to conduct year-long, postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;research on-site with MIRTHE industry member companies. The research projects are closely&lt;br/&gt;linked to the fellows,former MIRTHE research and strengthen the university industry partnerships arising&lt;br/&gt;from the joint work and the group of academic and industrial mentors tied together by the post-doc&lt;br/&gt;fellows. In addition to full time work in industry, the post-doctoral fellows will be assigned mentors at&lt;br/&gt;Princeton University; they will report twice yearly on their research to the entire MIRTHE community. The&lt;br/&gt;fellowships are competitive, with a strict selection process, and are tightly woven into MIRTHE's overall&lt;br/&gt;formal post-doctoral mentoring program.&lt;br/&gt;The post-doctoral fellows are appointed through Princeton University at the base salary rate; the hosting&lt;br/&gt;companies will raise the fellows, salary to the companies? rate and will fund the fellows research&lt;br/&gt;expenses; we estimate this to amount to at least 25% cost-sharing by industry.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;MIRTHE is leading the development of an entirely new platform of trace gas sensor systems that provide&lt;br/&gt;high-performance, cost-effective, and networked sensing capabilities. These sensor systems are based&lt;br/&gt;on mid-infrared Quantum Cascade laser spectroscopy and excel through their compactness, autonomy,&lt;br/&gt;networking capability, and fast time response. They fulfill the application requirements of trace chemical&lt;br/&gt;sensing on the individual point sensor, urban sensor network, remote sensor, and regional scale. In doing&lt;br/&gt;so, MIRTHE addresses the important societal challenges of securing a clean, safe, sustainable, and&lt;br/&gt;healthy environment, clean air to breathe and accessible healthcare on the national and global scale.&lt;br/&gt;The here proposed MIRTHE Post-doctoral Fellowship in Industry program sends five or more highly&lt;br/&gt;qualified, competitively selected post-doctoral fellows to work on-site with MIRTHE industry members on&lt;br/&gt;MIRTHE-related research projects. Their high degree of engineering excellence will strengthen&lt;br/&gt;university,industry collaborations and will advance MIRTHE's mission and bold vision stated above.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;MIRTHE successfully trains and graduates a diverse and globally competitive U.S. workforce ready to&lt;br/&gt;assume engineering leadership for the 21st century. Since 2006, MIRTHE's post-doctoral training program&lt;br/&gt;has grown to encompass 9 current post-doctoral fellows with career aspirations in academia,&lt;br/&gt;government, and industry. Three fellows have already ?graduated? to long-term employment in&lt;br/&gt;academia. MIRTHE has a proven track record to reach out to groups historically underrepresented in&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering, and its researcher and student diversity consistently exceeds comparable&lt;br/&gt;national averages. The here proposed MIRTHE Post-doctoral Fellows in Industry program provides an&lt;br/&gt;outstanding opportunity to increase the size and improve the diversity of MIRTHE's post-doctoral&lt;br/&gt;researcher pool.&lt;br/&gt;The program will provide MIRTHE's graduates with additional training, skills, knowledge, and insights,&lt;br/&gt;and will make them more competitive in the job-market, hence allaying the gravest of our post-doctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers, concerns about their career opportunities in the current weak economy.&lt;br/&gt;The program will attract specifically post-doctoral researchers interested in a career in industry and in&lt;br/&gt;starting up their own company. The post-doctoral fellows will also form key connections between&lt;br/&gt;academia and industry in MIRTHE's industrial/practitioner collaboration program, which develops&lt;br/&gt;prototypes of cost-effective, market-ready, mid-infrared sensing technologies; these technologies result in&lt;br/&gt;new profitable product lines and new revenue streams for important industry sectors.</AbstractNarration>
