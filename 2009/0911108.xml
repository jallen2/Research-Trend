    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research program of Prof. Linda McGown of Rensselaer Polytechnique Institute. Prof. McGown and her students will study the processes that govern affinity protein capture at aptamer-modified surfaces using affinity MALDI mass spectrometry in combination with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and imaging, and will apply the knowledge gained to enable the design of improved aptamers. The proposed study has the potential to greatly impact the field of aptamer design and facilitate the use of aptamers as recognition components in a wide range of chemical and biological applications. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in a highly interdisciplinary area at the chemical biology interface. Prof. McGown and her students will also participate in the Science Technology Entry Program (STEP) at RPI, which aims to attract and retain high school students from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups in science and engineering fields.</AbstractNarration>
