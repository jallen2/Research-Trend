    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education with the ambitious goal to formulate a consistent microscopic theory of the extraordinary phenomena which have been discovered in high temperature cuprate superconductors. The PI sees that besides the high superconducting transition temperatures, two new states of matter have been discovered in the cuprates: a strange normal metallic state with extraordinary but simply characterized properties, and a pseudogap phase in which the extrapolated normal ground state appears to have an anisotropic gap tied to the chemical potential. The PI will build on a microscopic approach which predicted a particular form of broken time-reversal symmetry in the pseudogap phase, and derived a quantum critical spectrum of the order parameter fluctuations, which leads to the phenomenological marginal Fermi-liquid consistent with the "strange metal" state, as well as couples to fermions with attraction in the d-wave pairing channel. The PI aims to solidify aspects of these developments and to attempt an understanding of aspects which are not understood. These include (i) verification of the analytic results for the quantum fluctuations by Monte Carlo calculations, (ii) inversion of the ARPES data to deduce the pairing spectrum to test the theory, (iii) understanding how the time-reversal breaking state observed in recent experiments necessarily leads to an anisotropic gap in the "pseudogap" state, as well as other issues relevant to experiment.&lt;br/&gt;The PI aims to achieve a firm enough theory backed by experimental results and with clear and falsifiable predictions so that a consensus in the important field of cuprate high temperature superconductivity can be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also take a close look at the burgeoning experimental results on the newly discovered Fe-Pnictides and formulate a model for their understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education with the ambitious goal to formulate a consistent theory of the extraordinary phenomena which have been discovered in high temperature cuprate superconductor materials. Apart from the persistence of superconductivity to much higher temperatures than the other superconducting materials known at the time of the discovery of the cuprates, the cuprate materials exhibit a host of interesting puzzles including the nature of the unusual metallic states that give way to the superconducting state as the temperature is lowered. The PI will build on his recent controversial ideas that have support in the experimental data. His work may lead to new insights into high temperature superconductivity and how to discover new materials that are superconducting at much higher temperatures, perhaps room temperature. In the superconducting state, superconductors can carry electric power without dissipation. A room temperature superconductor would enable efficient power transmission and save energy.</AbstractNarration>
