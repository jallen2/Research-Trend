    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Ayres of the University of Colorado will undertake a multifaceted study of the outer layers of the Sun. A controversy has shaken solar physics, over what ordinarily might be seen as the most arcane of details: the oxygen abundance. In the past few years, the measured abundance in the photosphere has plummeted nearly a factor of two, driven mainly by application of sophisticated 3D convection models to key atomic tracers such as atomic oxygen and oxygen-bearing molecules like OH and CO. The new low value is said to resolve several outstanding questions in the abundances in hot stars and the interstellar medium, but at the expense of wrecking the previous spectacularly good agreement between theoretical models of the solar interior (where oxygen is a crucial opacity source) and highly precise internal sound speed profiles from helioseismology. The solar low-O problem borders on a crisis, when one considers ramifications for diverse areas of astrophysics that rely fundamentally on the Sun to provide a baseline chemical composition; and even a catastrophe if the studies of solar abundances and helioseismology cannot be reconciled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present work will address these deficiencies with a multi-pronged strategy. A key objective will be to develop a series of new solar atlases at the highest possible spectral resolution and signal-to-noise, exploiting the recently upgraded Fourier transform spectrometer at Kitt Peak Observatory. A second objective will be to carefully test the most recent generation of 3D convection models, and to make such empirical modifications to the upper layers as necessary to apply them to molecular formation problems. A third, related objective, is to continue exploring the outer boundary of the photosphere, where the highly ordered fibril fields of the deep atmosphere become severely twisted and tangled, causing local heating, propelling jets of gas into the corona, and generally wreaking havoc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will advance knowledge of our Sun, specifically atmospheric structure and energy transport from the deep photosphere out to the magnetically complex low chromosphere; relevant to space weather, one of few areas in astronomy that has direct societal impact. Beyond the Sun, better determinations of the oxygen (and carbon) abundance, and the rare isotopes of C and O, are crucial to many areas of astronomy that rely on the solar baseline. Ongoing instrumental developments, in partnership with the National Solar Observatory, will serve the broader NSO user community; as well as path finding for the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST), slated for operation in the next decade. ATST will benefit not only solar observers, but also specialized nighttime projects such as coronography of faint IR sources near bright objects. Finally, a variety of outreach projects and community service activities relevant to NSF will be carried out.</AbstractNarration>
