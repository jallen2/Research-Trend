    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The goal of this project is to develop computational models of the nonverbal behavior and interactive strategies observed during face-to-face teaching. These computational models will serve as a foundation for a new generation of embodied teaching agents that approximate the benefits of face-to-face human tutoring. The project will help advance the science of learning and teaching by improving our understanding of the dynamics of nonverbal behavior in teaching at a computational level, across multiple time scales: From low-level micro-expressions in the timescale of tens of milliseconds, to cognitive and affective processes with time scales of seconds, to higher level strategic behaviors operating at longer time scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its scientific and technological value, this project has a significant outreach component. The project would help grow links between a research oriented campus (UCSD) an undergraduate teaching university (SDSU). The robotics aspects of the project will be developed in collaboration with the Preuss School Robotics Club. The Preuss School is a charter school for low-income students in grades 6-12 and is currently ranked as one of the top high schools in the nation.</AbstractNarration>
