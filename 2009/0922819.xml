    <AbstractNarration>Faculty at the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University (WSU) in Detroit, MI have been granted an award from Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to acquire a 9.4 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS) to establish a biological mass spectrometry resource. The ultra high mass accuracy and resolving power, upper mass limit, and the dynamic range of this state-of-the-art instrumentation will provide support for transformative research and education in biology and the myriad interdisciplinary fields born of biology and chemistry, chemical engineering, environmental engineering, geology, and environmental health sciences. This instrument will provide a powerful tool for studies of a broad variety of topics in structural biology and the evolving fields of genomics, proteomics, glycomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, drug development, biological/nano materials and sensor applications, and methodology development for improved sensitivity and quantitation in mass analyses of biological molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This state-of-the-art FT-ICR MS will contribute to both research and educational infrastructure at WSU. It will be used as a central tool for numerous projects in a variety of Departments and several advanced laboratory courses at WSU, and will also provide benefits to the academic and industrial researchers that employ the WSU Central Instrumentation Facility (CIF) for mass spectral analyses. The instrument is expected to have a broad impact on education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the traditionally under-represented groups that make up ~33% of the WSU enrollment. The inherently interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the projects that will benefit from this advanced instrumentation will promote WSUs training of scientists equipped to address the challenges facing the chemical, biological, geological, and engineering fields in the coming decades. Widespread dissemination of research outcomes will be achieved via presentations at scientific meetings, seminars at Universities, and research publications in a variety of scientific journals. Information regarding this FT-ICR MS instrument and research outcomes will also be disseminated to the general public and scientific communities via the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
