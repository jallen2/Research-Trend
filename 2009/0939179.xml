    <AbstractNarration>EAGER: Collaborative Research: Cross-domain Knowledge Transformation via Matrix Decompositions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional data mining algorithms discover knowledge in new domains starting from the scratch, ignoring knowledge learned in other domains. Knowledge transformation is a transformative paradigm that utilizes previously acquired knowledge in other domains to guide knowledge discovery process in a new domain and is especially useful for large data sets. In particular, utilizing applicable knowledge in other domains helps to stabilize the unsupervised learning and generate results that we may have preliminary understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to design and develop cross-domain knowledge transformation mechanisms for knowledge discovery. The transformation mechanisms are based on matrix decompositions where the knowledge been transferred are represented directly and explicitly ? making them easy to comprehend and be utilized in practice. The proposed mechanisms provide a versatile knowledge transformation framework with solid theoretical foundation and enable a new paradigm of unsupervised learning with domain knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The usefulness of these knowledge transformation mechanisms/systems will be demonstrated for effective information retrieval, consumer recommender systems, and product/online opinion sentiment analysis. The versatility of this transformative metholody will be verified across many domains.</AbstractNarration>
