    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to conduct the targeted synthesis of a new solid-state compound is one of the grand challenges of the field of solid state chemistry. This proposal targets the synthesis of new misfit layered compounds [(MX)m]1+x[TX2]n where M is a metal that forms a rock salt structure with either selenium or tellurium (X), T is transition metal that forms a layered dichalcogenide structure, n and m denote the number of layers of each constituent, and x denotes the degree of misfit between the components. These new compounds are assumed to be at least kinetically stable and will be prepared by depositing a layered precursor that is designed to self-assemble into the targeted compound. Preliminary data demonstrates that this approach works and that extended annealing in controlled chalcogen partial pressures can be used to fix the chemical potential, controlling carrier concentrations if the targeted compounds are semiconductors. Charge transfer between the constituents of the misfit layer compounds stabilizes the structure and makes them an ideal test bed for examining the effect of nanostructure on properties in well-controlled one-dimensional structures. The misfit layered compounds provide an opportunity to subtly probe the effect of charge transfer on electrical and magnetic properties, viewing them as intercalation compounds of a transition metal dichalcogenide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new synthetic techniques that allow the targeted synthesis of kinetically stable compounds is a crucial component necessary for the advancement of fundamental science and both current and future technologies crucial to international competitiveness. The proposed research program provides a firm and broad technical background for the graduate students in deposition technologies and thin film characterization techniques. The proposed external internships provides an opportunity for the graduate students to ?test drive? future careers while expanding their knowledge base, leading to more productive researchers and preparing them for careers in industry, academia or national laboratories. The graduate students will mentor one or more undergraduate researchers as part of this project, and it is anticipated that these undergraduate students will pursue advanced degrees after graduation.</AbstractNarration>
