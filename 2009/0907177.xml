    <AbstractNarration>Exploratory methods play a critical role in the understanding of large data sets, regardless of their origin, and are typically the first step in their analysis. The investigator is studying the development and use of exploratory, data-mining methods that identify patterns or regularities in high-dimensional data. The specific focus of his research is the problem of identifying sample-variable associations in large data sets that may arise from multiple measurement technologies. In the typical case where the data from an experiment are represented in the form of a rectangular matrix, sample-variable associations correspond to distinguished submatrices of the data matrix. The investigator is developing a statistically principled, significance-based approach to the problem of finding large average submatrices of a data matrix, using a simple iterative algorithm. The algorithm is applicable to real-valued and categorical data matrices. In addition to the basic method, the investigator is developing several extensions, including data-driven null models that incorporate dependence between variables, data arising from the simultaneous application of multiple measurement technologies, and application of the basic method to prediction problems such as classification, regression and survival analysis. In addition, the investigator is developing basic theory to support the use of the algorithm, and to assess the structure of data matrices under the different null models. The development and application of the methods is being carried out in close collaboration with several groups of biomedical researchers. In particular, the new data mining methodology is being incorporated into software that is used by collaborating scientists to identify and assess significant sample-variable associations in ongoing experiments involving breast, brain and lung cancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large data sets are now common in many experimental areas of science, and in particular gene-level studies of human diseases such as cancer. In such studies it is not unusual to encounter experiments containing from hundreds to thousands of samples, and tens of thousands to millions of measurements on each sample. Large data sets are part of a trend away from traditional hypothesis-driven scientific research towards data-driven research, in which researchers explore large data sets for patterns or regularities that, in conjunction with subject matter expertise, yield hypotheses that can be tested by more traditional means. The investigator is studying an exploratory method that identifies statistically significant associations between samples and variables in large data sets, associations that can yield testable scientific hypotheses. The methods being developed by the investigator are computationally efficient, and are based on established statistical principles, in particular the notion of statistical significance. The investigator is also studying ways in which the basic exploratory method can be applied to data arising from multiple measurement technologies, and application of the basic method to statistical problems such as classification and survival analysis. These activities are being carried out as part of a collaborative research program involving the sustained interactions of faculty and students from the statistical, biological, and medical sciences. The exploratory method developed by the investigator is being integrated into the basic exploratory tools of the collaborating scientists, and is a component in the analysis of several new, previously unanalyzed, data sets.</AbstractNarration>
