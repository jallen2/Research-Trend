    <AbstractNarration>This award will greatly expand the capabilities of Florida International University?s (FIU) Wall-of-Wind (WoW), and transform it into a next generation full- and large-scale testing facility for wind and/or thermal effects on buildings and other structures. The award will enable it to become a national multi-user facility, by acquiring instrumentation allowing interdisciplinary research by academia and industry, based on: (1) aerodynamic/aero-hydrodynamic/aeroelastic testing of tall buildings, flexible bridges, and other infrastructure/life-line elements in simulated atmospheric flows at large Reynolds numbers unachievable in conventional facilities, thereby reducing losses and consumption of materials and energy embodied therein; (2) testing to promote energy-efficient buildings. Errors inherent in small model scales will be significantly reduced through: testing of building models with reproduction of important architectural details; testing of full/large-scale traffic and electrical infrastructure elements with real materials/connections; full-scale testing of photovoltaic panels; full-scale thermal testing of one-floor building envelopes in turbulent flow; and interdisciplinary wind/thermal performance research. The research will increase community resilience by reducing losses in extreme winds, and promote energy-efficient buildings by reducing adverse environmental effects on building envelope performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research using the equipment purchased through this award will enhance the scientific underpinnings of design for wind, and help attain a national objective: sustainable and energy-efficient communities with enhanced human safety and comfort, and reduced property loss and insurance costs. The project will foster integration between learning and discovery processes, promote undergraduate and graduate education, and develop a trained workforce transferring technology from academia to applications. As they have in the past, women will strongly participate in WoW activities, and members of minority groups will be involved through collaboration with and recruitment of students from minority serving institutions. FIU itself primarily serves minorities, and the project will help increase the number of underrepresented students. Results of the research utilizing this equipment will be disseminated through journals, conferences, and reports to policy makers and committees, to advance the state of the art and improve current standards.</AbstractNarration>
