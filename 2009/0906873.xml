    <AbstractNarration>0906873&lt;br/&gt;Garno&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;Technical. This project addresses methods for creating nanostructures of porphyrins and phthalocyanines relevant to molecular electronics considerations. Measurement of molecular conductance with reproducibility is a recognized challenge along with the need to establish methods for reproducibly depositing molecules onto a surface with desired orientation and coverage. Scanning probe lithography (SPL) will be applied to enable CP (conductive probe)-AFM measurements of designed planar arrays of nanostructures. The test platforms planned will incorporate an insulating matrix layer of n-alkanethiol SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) surrounding nanopatterns as a calibration reference, for standardizing measurements. Experimental results will be used for deriving predictive models of electron transport in designed free-base and metal-coordinated porphyrin and phthalocyanine assemblies. Greater understanding of how self-organization and surface assembly influence electrical properties is an anticipated outcome. New SPL methods will be pioneered to control the assembly of porphyrins and pthalocyanines. It is expected that by arranging and orienting porphyrins and phthalocyanines on well defined surfaces, local measurements of charge transport can be enabled for different molecular pathways.&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. Additionally, project activities emphasize creating and fostering opportunities for underrepresented minorities and women in interdisciplinary training and research. Planned activities include minority student recruitment, sponsoring research experiences for undergraduates, K-12 outreach through the LSU ChemDemo and annual Super Science Saturday programs, hosting instrument workshops, sponsoring guest researchers and networking with HBCU programs. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed work enables students to interact with scientists of different areas to broaden the scope of their training as well as to enhance their educational experience. Curriculum developments are expected to bring the concepts of surface science and molecular imaging into undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
