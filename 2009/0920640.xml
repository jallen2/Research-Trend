    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Chemical (53)&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, Conceptests and Screencasts are being developed in support of six fundamental courses in chemical engineering: material and energy balances, fluids, heat transfer, mass transfer and separations, chemical engineering thermodynamics, and chemical reaction engineering. Conceptests are multiple-choice questions that are used in class with student-operated clickers, for interactive learning through discussion with peers and instructor feedback. Similar to problems on concept inventories, Conceptests typically cover fundamental topics that are often misunderstood by students. In addition to their use as in-class exercises, Conceptests can be used for online quizzes covering assigned reading that students complete prior to class or they can be used for homework or exams in the course. Screencasts are short screen captures of material with narration by an instructor such as mathematical solutions to problems, mini-lectures, training on using new software, or discussion of strategies for solving Conceptests. Screencasts are available online and provide students with additional instructional support when they need it and not just at defined class times or office hours. The results from this project are being rigorously assessed through formative and summative measures to determine their impact on student learning. The Conceptests and Screencasts are available over the Internet and project results are being broadly disseminated through a variety of venues.</AbstractNarration>
