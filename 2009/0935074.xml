    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research award to Purdue University will develop tools for use by mechanical engineering students at the graduate and undergraduate levels to infuse sustainability considerations into product design. The study employs an innovative research design by bringing state of the art techniques in model building and visualization into design tools that are exceptionally robust but also easy to use by undergraduate students. The results will be disseminated through professional networks and Purdue's Global Hub. The goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering through developing tools to enhance understanding of environmental sustainability. These techniques are expected to increase students' interest in engineering and will enhance the number who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.</AbstractNarration>
