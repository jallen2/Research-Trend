    <AbstractNarration>This grant funds in part support for young researchers to attend the 15th INFORMS Applied Probability Conference. The conference will be held in Ithaca New York from July 12 - 15th, 2009. The primary topics of the conference relate to the methods and applications of applied probability as they apply to problems arising in operations research and management science. However, there are also talks based on closely related fields such as physics and economics. The primary goal in supporting young researchers to attend the conference is to help develop them into future leaders. The conference will provide an opportunity to meet and learn from existing leaders, and to introduce their ideas to the general applied probability research community.</AbstractNarration>
