    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on the development of a stand-alone electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometer/chiral ion mobility spectrometer (ESI-IMS/CIMS) for on-site separation, detection and identification of environmental contaminants with the unique capability of separating chiral molecules. Many pesticides are applied as a mixture of chiral forms despite the fact that each chiral form may differ in its impact on environmental and biological processes. Efficient methods for chiral analysis will facilitate the study of stereoisomer-dependent toxicity and biodegradation, as well as permit evaluation of pollutant potential and agricultural pesticide loading. The ESI-IMS/CIMS system will be used in place of slow, expensive, lab-based chiral separation methods and will be able to concurrently detect non-chiral species of interest, including both volatile and non-volatile compounds. In Phase I, the focus is on the development of a commercial ESI-IMS system and identification and validation of chiral modifiers for use in CIMS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many environmental analysis laboratories provide pesticide analysis to their clients as the identity and quantity of pesticide residues in water, soils, and foods can have an impact on agricultural use and public attitudes. With growing awareness of the importance of chirality to the function and degradation of environmental contaminants, interest in rapid and cost-effective chiral separations will increase. Successful commercialization of ESI-IMS/CIMS technology will enhance both field and laboratory analytical abilities for environmental analysis. A portable chiral ion mobility spectrometer will allow fast, on-site analysis of pesticide residues and will provide a powerful field analytical tool for environmental scientists and analytical testing/service labs as well as government regulators. Research to determine optimal conditions to separate chiral forms of environmental contaminants using chiral ion mobility spectrometry will facilitate rapid development of the technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
