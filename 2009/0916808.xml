    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To extend the scale and generality of separation logic and grainless semantics&lt;br/&gt;to become applicable to the specification and verification of more complex and&lt;br/&gt;varied software systems, the following research initiatives are being pursued: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Higher-Order Design Patterns - Using higher-order separation logic to&lt;br/&gt; specify design patterns in object-oriented programing, and to verify their&lt;br/&gt; implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Extension to a Higher-Order Programming Language - extending separation&lt;br/&gt; logic to an Algol-like language with a heap, including procedures that&lt;br/&gt; permit global information hiding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Grainless Semantics - devising a new form of grainless semantics that gives&lt;br/&gt; a more abstract and concise description of shared-variable concurrency by&lt;br/&gt; avoiding any commitment to a default level of atomicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Implementation of Logics and Semantics - Using the Isabelle/HOL system to&lt;br/&gt; implement the machine-aided construction of proofs in separation logic in a&lt;br/&gt; way that ensures both the validity of the proofs and the soundness of the&lt;br/&gt; logic and its extensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal is to substantially increase the variety of programs that can&lt;br/&gt;be verified by separation logic, and to facilitate soundness arguments for this&lt;br/&gt;and other logics for shared-variable concurrency.</AbstractNarration>
