    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and meets the requirements established in Section 2 of the White House Memorandum entitled, Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, dated March 20, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project ?STCI: Integrated Resource Provisioning Across the National Cyberinfrastructure in Support of Scientific Workloads? is to develop a resource provisioning system that will provide a common job interface to the two national cyberinfrastructures in the US (OSG and the TeraGrid). The system will provide both a priori and dynamic provisioning capabilities, where resources can be reserved explicitly before application execution as well as implicitly as the application jobs enter the job management system. The effects of such provisioning strategies will be tracked via monitoring solutions integrated with the system. This work will also extend the provisioning capabilities to virtual environments such as those delivered by commercial and science clouds. Service administration capabilities will also be provided as part of this work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The proposed system will provide a robust and scalable resource provisioning capability that will bridge heterogeneous, distributed cyberinfrastructures, making it easier for scientists with diverse computational requirements to efficiently leverage the available computing power and improve their overall productivity. Efficient use of computational resources is also achieved by the integrated system by occupying resources as they become available and releasing those resources when they are no longer needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;The integrated and extended system will support a broad spectrum of applications in the scientific domain ranging from workflows composed of interdependent tasks to applications composed of a large number of independent jobs to loosely coupled parallel applications. In addition to the current users, the proposed system can be leveraged by applications in astronomy, gravitational-wave physics, fusion, and many others.</AbstractNarration>
