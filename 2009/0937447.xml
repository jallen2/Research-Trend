    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to support 100 undergraduate and graduate students studying in the United States to attend and/or present their research papers at the 2009 American Society of Mechanical Engineers International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference, October 4-7, 2009, in West Lafayette, Indiana. Sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Manufacturing Engineering Division, this upcoming International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference is the annual flagship conference for disseminating the latest manufacturing research and development results to an international audience. This conference support for students will be announced through the email lists of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Manufacturing Engineering Division and conference symposium organizers. Student recipients will be selected for conference support mainly based upon their research statements on manufacturing innovations by an ad-hoc selection committee. Other criteria, including underrepresented status, paper authorship, and degrees being pursued, will also be considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference serves as a knowledge dissemination platform of manufacturing innovations and challenges for undergraduate and graduate participants. The student participants will share and learn the state-of-the-art and challenges of manufacturing research through keynote presentations, plenary sessions, posters, and regular paper presentation sessions. They will also have opportunities to interact with industrial researchers, professors, and other undergraduate and graduate students. Such interactions will facilitate future domestic and international collaborations. This conference experience will be invaluable for developing the skills of this highly talented group of students who will be the next generation of manufacturing professionals and academics.</AbstractNarration>
