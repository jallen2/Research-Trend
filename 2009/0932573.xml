    <AbstractNarration>0932573&lt;br/&gt;Sundararajan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the research is to determine the thermal response of the near-apex region of a nanoprobe in response to ultrafast laser irradiation. This is an important aspect of atom probe microscopy measurements and photo-assisted scanning probe matter manipulation (nanomanufacturing). Current models do not predict temperatures accurately. Furthermore, identifying exact temperatures in the near-tip region of the probe is limited by the ability to experimentally verify the model predictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The modeling approach will employ solutions of the Maxwell equation to obtain the optical field distribution in the vicinity of the probe tip. The energy transport within the nanoscale probe will be determined using a combined Lattice Boltzmann methodology and finite element technique. The resulting model will provide fundamental knowledge regarding the optical intensity distribution inside the nanoprobe as well as how, and to what extent the near-field laser heating affects probe temperatures. Experimental validation of the model will be achieved via laser assisted atom probe microscopy experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research is relevant to atom-scale characterization of materials using atom probe microscopy as well as a range of applications involving photo-assisted probe microscopy including but not limited to nanoscale biological, chemical sensing, and nanomanufacturing. Undergraduate and graduate education will be enhanced by (1) incorporating the research results into specific engineering courses (Scanning Probe Microscopy and Nanoscale Thermal Transport) taught at Iowa State; (2) partnering with freshman honors and student work-study programs to involve undergraduate students in the research; (3) mentoring and recruiting women students in conjunction with the Society of Women Engineers and (4) dissemination of research results through an on-campus NSF International Materials Institute.</AbstractNarration>
