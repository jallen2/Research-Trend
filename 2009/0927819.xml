    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop methods to account for the effects of material creep on the buckling of structural steel columns in buildings subjected to fire. The research approach includes experiments on creep of structural steel and experiments on creep buckling of steel columns for stress and temperature regimes of interest in structural-fire engineering applications, development of analytical and computational models for creep buckling, and the development of predictive equations for creep buckling suitable for use in design practice. The experimental studies will focus on ASTM A992 steel, which is the most common grade of structural steel used in building construction in the US, and for which very little elevated temperature data exists. Deliverables for this award include a database of elevated temperature experiments on structural steel columns; analytical and design models for evaluating safety of steel columns subjected to fire; education of structural engineering students on fire performance of buildings; and education of fire fighters on structural-fire safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Columns are elements critical to the safety of building structures, and failure of a column in a fire can lead to collapse and loss of life. The results of this research will provide an important tool for evaluating the safety of steel building columns subjected to fire, and will contribute to improved practices for structural-fire safety design of buildings. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from involvement in the research and from the enhancement of courses on structural-fire engineering. Fire fighters will benefit from this award from training provided on the safety and collapse risk of structures subjected to fire.</AbstractNarration>
