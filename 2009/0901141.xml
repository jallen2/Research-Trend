    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to build a smart nanosystem with the capability of autonomous motion, recognition, and actuation through the orthogonal functionalization of heterostructured nanorods. The approach is to use glancing angle deposition to design heteronanorod backbones, where each functional unit will be integrated onto different spatial locations along backbone in a selective and efficient manner using orthogonal self-assembly. Smart materials and recognition molecules will be used to functionalize the nanomotor backbone to perform autonomous motion and controlled release. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project aims to develop a generic methodology to fabricate and design smart nanosystems that starts to mimic the complex behavior of biological systems. The approach involves: designing heteronanorods with different inorganic and polymeric materials; exploring autonomous propulsion mechanisms that allow for directed motion and photo-responsive polymers for controlled release; and integrating the backbone and functional units. Propulsion mechanisms that are catalytic, photoresponsive, and dissipative will be used to control autonomous motion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The methodology for nanomotor fabrication and selective functionalization allows the creation of smart nano-functional components and will catalyze rapid and innovative advances in designing and integrating autonomous nanomachines. With further control, implications of those nanomotors in nanoelectromechanical systems, drug delivery, disease treatment, and other areas are anticipated. In addition, the lab-based nanotechnology course module under development by the PIs will help undergraduate and high school students to obtain hands-on experience with nanofabrication. This project also establishes a rigorous physics, chemistry, and nanotechnology education and training opportunity for both graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
