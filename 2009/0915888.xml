    <AbstractNarration>Formal reasoning about concurrent programs is usually done at a&lt;br/&gt;high-level with strong assumptions such as built-in thread primitives&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., locks) and simplified memory models (e.g., sequential&lt;br/&gt;consistency). Existing formal techniques (including Hoare logic and&lt;br/&gt;type system) have consistently ignored important issues such as&lt;br/&gt;relaxed memory models, hardware interrupts, implementation of&lt;br/&gt;synchronization primitives, and support for software transactional&lt;br/&gt;memory and privatization. This severely limits their applicability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on extending and adapting existing formal&lt;br/&gt;techniques so that they can also support realistic low-level&lt;br/&gt;concurrent programs running on modern multicore and multiprocessor&lt;br/&gt;machines. The PI is developing a new operational approach for&lt;br/&gt;reasoning about programs running under relaxed memory models;&lt;br/&gt;designing new program logics for certifying both weak and strong&lt;br/&gt;memory operations (including the memory-fence and compare-and-swap&lt;br/&gt;instructions); and showing how to scale his approach to real-world&lt;br/&gt;thread implementation and to machines with relaxed memory models. If&lt;br/&gt;successful, this research will help improve the reliability of&lt;br/&gt;concurrent software components, which form the backbone of many&lt;br/&gt;critical systems in the world. It will also facilitate the&lt;br/&gt;community-wide effort for finding new programming models for safe and&lt;br/&gt;scalable multicore computing.</AbstractNarration>
