    <AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Metamaterials &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0934369 CUNY City College; David Crouse &lt;br/&gt;0934365 Clarkson University; S. V. Babu &lt;br/&gt;0934356 University of North Carolina at Charlotte; Michael Fiddy &lt;br/&gt;0934353 Western Carolina University; Kenneth Burbank &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CUNY City College, Clarkson University (CU), University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC), and Western Carolina University (WCU) are collaborating to establish the Center for Metamaterials, with CUNY as the lead institution. This proposal is based around a planning strategy to develop an I/UCRC program where the R&amp;D effort will be focused around metamaterials. The program involves four institutions with various strengths that can supplement theoretical understanding, device manufacturing, and characterization of a variety of metamaterial concepts. The Center for Metamaterials will essentially provide a one-stop shop for design, fabrication and test of wide range of metamaterials for use anywhere from the microwave to optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The proposed Center will also address the many fabrication challenges associated with exploiting these novel properties when small degrees of disorder are known to modulate properties and performance. The planning grant will enable a forum to be established whereupon strategic research programs will be matched to potential industrial members of a fully-formed I/UCRC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metamaterials will greatly extend the design tool-kit for all electromagnetic devices and systems; and will advance the technological capabilities in all areas of wireless and photonics products. The proposed Center will include universities serving a diverse student body that includes under-represented minority groups, and plans to develop extensive metamaterials education and internship programs for undergraduate, graduate and continuing-education students, as well as web-based distance learning courses. The proposed Center could have a significant impact on the nation because the novel materials have the potential to create new technologies that could have huge economic outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
