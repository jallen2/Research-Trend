    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0929263&lt;br/&gt;Kuhl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Western Regional Student Conference has been long standing tradition where students join in networking, professional development, design competitions, and make presentations on their research. The event provides students opportunities to showcase their engineering talent, innovative thought, and communication skills. Students who participate in undergrad research are able to compete in the Paper Competition, which entails presenting their research in front of judicators from industries and academia. Students may also demonstrate their engineering skills by partaking in the Chem-E Car Competition. This popular competition allows students to work in teams to design, build, and operate cars the size of shoe boxes which run on alternative fuel sources. The main goal of this competition is to be the most accurate in reaching the required distance specified one hour before the competition. Months prior to the competition students are required to use engineering fundamentals to design and construct their vehicles and establish baseline operation through testing and safety assurances. Along with running the car, the teams need to present their design and demonstrate safe engineering practice in the Poster Competition to judges as well as students and conference sponsors. Besides opportunities to compete and present their research, the conference offers a venue for networking with industry representatives at the career and graduate school fair. Another opportunity for students to interact with industry representatives is through professional development workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that more than 100 chemical engineering students will attend this event from as many as 14 universities from the California-Nevada region. Currently, it is confirmed that students will be coming from the following institutions: UC Davis, UC Berkeley. UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UCLA, Stanford, University of Nevada Reno, California State University Long Beach, and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The event is also open to the general public and presents a broad means to engage a diverse spectrum of chemical engineering students. Our key note speaker, Bryan Yeh, will give an in depth presentation on alternative fuel sources and technology of the future. Bryan is Vice President of SAIC, an alternative fuels science and technology company in the Bay Area. NSF funding will provide support to ensure that all students, regardless of financial ability, are able to participate in this opportunity that goes beyond normal classroom learning, builds community, and encourages creative behavior.</AbstractNarration>
