    <AbstractNarration>0917786&lt;br/&gt;Reid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issue: The U.S. National Academies, in collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), will conduct a joint study to assist their countries in developing strategies to meet renewable energy goals, to identify prospects and recommend priorities for research and technology cooperation between countries, and to identify related areas, such as storage and systems approaches, ripe for future cooperation. The study is intended to aid the national governments, their relevant agencies/ministries, and private industries in assigning priorities for substantial and meaningful cooperation in developing and utilizing electricity from renewable energy. The study will pursue three separate but related goals: 1) Comparatively assessing resource potential in China and the U.S. for grid-scale electricity generation; 2) Exploring near-term market opportunities for mature technologies; and 3) Recommending priorities for enhanced collaboration, with a focus on cost reduction, improved efficiency and grid connectivity, and storage. Approach: National Academy of Sciences President Ralph J. Cicerone will appoint a committee that will include experts in renewable energy technologies; electricity generation, transmission, and distribution; energy policy; and energy economics. The committee will work with a similarly appointed Chinese committee, to outline the study, organize meetings, and prepare the consensus report. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed study will assess the technology risks and tradeoffs for various energy technologies. Much of this technological information will be applicable and adaptable to China, and so an understanding of the geographic, technical, and economic constraints will provide the context for Chinese decision makers to develop appropriate strategies to sustainably meet their energy needs. In some areas, notably biomass utilization, China is among the world leaders, and certain technologies may be applicable in the U.S. context as well. Similarly, China's manufacturing prowess, combined with its growing domestic market, provide opportunities to accelerate progress along the learning curve and reduce costs for renewable energy technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Having a credible, authoritative, bilateral report highlighting the opportunities for substantial engagement, cooperation, and further investment should catalyze future U.S.-Chinese collaboration among government agencies, industries, and other relevant stakeholders. As part of the study process, the committees will hold several information-gathering meetings which are open to the public. In addition to engaging both countries at an institutional level, this study will engage relevant research universities, government laboratories and agencies, and industries in their public meetings. This will serve several purposes: 1) it will inform the committee about ongoing and planned activities being carried out in each country, 2) it will help the committee develop a report that speaks to the particular informational needs of these diverse stakeholders, and 3) it will facilitate connections between these stakeholders and some of the leading experts in various aspects of renewable energy. Following its completion, the report will be translated into Chinese and made publicly available electronically and in print form. A separately published Executive Summary, geared towards decision makers, will be widely disseminated in both countries. The committees will also consider holding a public event to formally release the reports and discuss its main findings and recommendations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Energy for Sustainability (CBET); Power, Controls and Adaptive Networks (ECCS); and NanoManufacturing (CMMI) programs from the Engineering Directorate and the Synthesis (CHEM) program from the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.</AbstractNarration>
