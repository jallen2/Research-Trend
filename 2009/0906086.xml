    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0906086&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Moon Duchin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects in this proposal are clustered around themes in&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional topology, asymptotic geometry, and the dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of group actions. Teichmuller space and the mapping class group&lt;br/&gt;are objects for special attention, and tools developed for that&lt;br/&gt;setting are often promising for wider study in metric geometry&lt;br/&gt;and geometric group theory. The PI proposes to build on recent&lt;br/&gt;work on flat metrics, their length spectra, and the associated&lt;br/&gt;boundary theory, as well as work on synthetic curvature&lt;br/&gt;conditions and their applications to random walks. Specific&lt;br/&gt;avenues of future investigation include asymptotics on the space&lt;br/&gt;of singular flat surfaces; filling inequalities and higher&lt;br/&gt;divergence functions adapted from symmetric spaces to group&lt;br/&gt;theory; and the use of intersection patterns of metric&lt;br/&gt;half-spaces to study the dynamics of isometries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While quite abstract, ideas in this work can also prove&lt;br/&gt;beautifully applicable-- for instance, Thurston's theory of flows&lt;br/&gt;on surfaces has direct and strong applications to the study of&lt;br/&gt;mixing in fluid dynamics. More immediately, though, this&lt;br/&gt;research area addresses foundational questions toward&lt;br/&gt;understanding geometric structure of complicated spaces in the&lt;br/&gt;large, in the small, and changing over time.</AbstractNarration>
