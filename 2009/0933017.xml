    <AbstractNarration>0933017 &lt;br/&gt;Holles &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this proposal are: 1) demonstrate the ability to sustainably produce H2 from lactose via aqueous-phase reforming (APR), 2) to further develop a synthesis technique for producing bimetallic catalysts with controlled microstructure (pseudomorphic overlayer) that allows fine tuning of catalytic properties, 3) incorporate concepts of sustainability and catalysis in a vertically integrated education programs for middle school, undergraduate and graduate level students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research and Intellectual Merit: The research will synthesize and characterize bimetallic catalysts with specifically controlled elemental structure to provide optimum catalytic activity.&lt;br/&gt;The work will be focused on developing pseudomorphic overlayer (base@overlayer) bimetallic&lt;br/&gt;catalysts for use in APR of lactose to produce H2. The specific objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;- Refine the reload synthesis technique for the application of a bimetallic particle and monolayer synthesis, apply it towards Ni@Pt and Co@Pt catalysts, and extend it to new supports. Overlayer catalysts show decreased H2 (and CO) adsorption strength which are postulated to increase activity since H2 (and CO) inhibits the reaction. The reload technique has previously produced catalysts with decreased H2 adsorption strength.&lt;br/&gt;- Characterize the structure and stability of the catalysts as a function of thermal and&lt;br/&gt;environmental conditions using TEM, thermogravimetry, chemisorption, x-ray&lt;br/&gt;absorption spectroscopy, and auger electron spectroscopy. A preponderance of evidence from multiple techniques will establish that the desired structure has been synthesized and that the overlayer is stable under elevated thermal and reactivity conditions.&lt;br/&gt;- Establish the structure/reactivity relationships for APR of lactose reaction on the model Ni@Pt and Co@Pt pseudomorphic overlayer catalysts. APR represents an additional challenge over existing work due to selectivity and product inhibition issues. This will demonstrate how the synthesized structures affect reactivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education: The education goal is to vertically integrate sustainability and catalysis education and research at multiple levels, beginning with middle school and continuing through undergraduate and graduate school. Specific education activities are:&lt;br/&gt;- Develop an Environmental Protection and Sustainable Energy from Agriculture Waste outreach program. The lactose example herein will be used to educate middle school students about protecting the environment from agricultural waste and how this waste can be converted to sustainable energy. This program will be developed into a Michigan Environmental Education Curriculum Support (MEECS) Water Quality unit designed for Grades 6-8 students to ensure statewide distribution. Activities will be adapted for students and schools located in the rural and economically disadvantaged western Upper Peninsula of Michigan and will target the local Native American populations.&lt;br/&gt;- Develop modules involving sustainability and catalysis for use in two currently existing undergraduate classes.&lt;br/&gt;- Graduate student participation in Sustainable Futures Institute activities here at Michigan Tech and earning the Graduate Certificate in Sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The results of this work are expected to benefit society, government, industry, and academia in the following ways:&lt;br/&gt;- Improved catalysts of this design will allow sustainable production of H2 from lactose in a carbon neutral manner, thereby improving our environment. Once developed, this technique can then be extended to other sugar sources.&lt;br/&gt;- Middle schools students who learn the importance of water quality and sustainable energy production will develop a greater interest in pursuing science careers.&lt;br/&gt;- Graduate students will understand the relationship between catalysis and sustainability while participating in experiments at national laboratories, which will expose them to a broader array of experts and to new career opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
