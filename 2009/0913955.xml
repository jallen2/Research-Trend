    <AbstractNarration>This project examines the relationships between academic elites, institutions of higher learning, and the political unrest that occurred in 2007 and 2008 due to the election in Kenya in 2008. Faculty, scientists, and students were active in the run-up to the election as well as the post-election period. However, little is known of how their actions impacted the violence that occured after the 2007 elections. Using qualitative methods and ethnographic techniques, this study will examine the role of these elites in the violence that occurred after the election. While providing an indepth view of the actions of elites in Kenya, it will also provide us with insights into the role of education elites generally in electoral activites and their aftermath in developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this project will provide taped interviews that will be made available to other researchers. The project also provides a unique opportunities to build partnerships between American and Kenyan scholars.</AbstractNarration>
