    <AbstractNarration>The main purpose of the workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic Creativity (CALC-09) is to strengthen research in automatic detection, classification, understanding, and generation of neologisms, figurative language, indirect speech acts, poetry, fiction, and other phenomena illustrating linguistic creativity. The workshop also welcomes descriptions and discussions of computational tools that support people in using language creatively. These include computational and cognitive models, metrics and tools for evaluating the performance of creativity-aware systems, specific application scenarios, and the design and implementation of creativity-aware systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CALC-09 workshop is held in conjunction with the NAACL - Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT 2009) conference in Boulder, Colorado. This award subsidizes travel and accommodation expenses for students actively participating in the workshop. These travel grants support geographic and other minorities by giving them an opportunity to exchange ideas, get into contact with key persons in the field, and gain invaluable feedback from the senior participants. The award also subsidizes travel and accommodation for an invited keynote speaker from the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop brings together people working on different forms and modalities of linguistic creativity. It fosters collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners working in academic or industrial settings, across disciplines. Thereby, the workshop facilitates the integration of current punctual efforts on different aspects of linguistic creativity into more comprehensive approaches.</AbstractNarration>
