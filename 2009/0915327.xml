    <AbstractNarration>Machine Translation (MT) into morphologically-rich languages poses unique&lt;br/&gt;challenges that have so far not been adequately addressed in state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;approaches. Even the best available MT systems into languages such as Arabic&lt;br/&gt;frequently produce translations that are disfluent and lack proper grammatical&lt;br/&gt;structure. This project explores novel approaches that address these issues by&lt;br/&gt;the development of a statistical MT framework that incorporates deeper levels&lt;br/&gt;of modeling of syntax and morphology. While the methods explored are largely&lt;br/&gt;language independent, the research is conducted and experimentally evaluated&lt;br/&gt;within the context of a large-scale English-to-Arabic MT system constructed&lt;br/&gt;using vast corpora available from LDC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this project focuses on novel approaches for combining&lt;br/&gt;syntactic and non-syntactic translation resources that are automatically&lt;br/&gt;acquired from vast amounts of parallel data and on exploring several&lt;br/&gt;alternative pathways for the integration of information provided by a&lt;br/&gt;high-accuracy morphological analysis and generation engine for Arabic into the&lt;br/&gt;MT framework. The project also explores methods for improving the syntax of MT&lt;br/&gt;output in Arabic using syntactic transfer rules that model syntactic&lt;br/&gt;divergences between English and Arabic. The goal is to develop an&lt;br/&gt;English-to-Arabic MT system that produces significantly more fluent,&lt;br/&gt;grammatical and accurate Arabic output than the current best systems, as&lt;br/&gt;measured by MT evaluation metrics (such as BLEU and METEOR), and as judged by&lt;br/&gt;human evaluators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of high-accuracy fully-automatic Machine Translation from&lt;br/&gt;English into Arabic has high potential value to the Arabic-speaking population&lt;br/&gt;at large, by opening up access to all English content available over the web.&lt;br/&gt;Such high-quality MT into Arabic may potentially also improve access to&lt;br/&gt;markets in the Arabic-speaking world for US and international companies.</AbstractNarration>
