    <AbstractNarration>Brenner&lt;br/&gt;DMS-00907985&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award is funded under the American Recovery and&lt;br/&gt;Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The investigator&lt;br/&gt;and his colleagues study a range of problems in applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, focusing on the coupling of the analytical methods&lt;br/&gt;to numerical computation, in the context of both research and&lt;br/&gt;education. The proposed research projects address a range of&lt;br/&gt;problems in engineering and science using a combination of&lt;br/&gt;approximate analysis, computation, and experiments. The specific&lt;br/&gt;projects include (1) a search for potentially unstable singular&lt;br/&gt;solutions of the Euler equation, by focusing on initial data&lt;br/&gt;consisting of vortex filaments; (2) questions in microfluid&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, including developing novel methodologies for creating&lt;br/&gt;thin polymeric fibers, and creating a biomimetic analogue of a&lt;br/&gt;fungal spore shooter; (3) biological questions, primarily aimed&lt;br/&gt;at using theory and data analysis to understand morphological&lt;br/&gt;variation in Darwin's Finches. Educational activities center&lt;br/&gt;around the general issue of how the concepts of applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics should be taught, given the prevalence of&lt;br/&gt;computation. Two specific initiatives are undertaken: The first&lt;br/&gt;involves a wiki-based method for teaching applied mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;developing applied mathematics texts; the second involves the&lt;br/&gt;development of materials for explaining to broad audiences the&lt;br/&gt;ways in which mathematics is used and has been used to impact our&lt;br/&gt;world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The activities of this project use mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical ideas to study, and hopefully solve, problems with&lt;br/&gt;broad impact on the world in which we live. One set of topics&lt;br/&gt;involves basic unsolved questions about the nature of fluid&lt;br/&gt;flows. Fluid flows occur throughout engineering and the&lt;br/&gt;sciences, and understanding how to predict their properties is&lt;br/&gt;critical for critical societal problems and needs, such as&lt;br/&gt;energy, environment materials, and engineering. The project&lt;br/&gt;develops methods for using fluid flows to create novel materials&lt;br/&gt;and material processes. Another part of the project aims to&lt;br/&gt;understand a fundamental question in biology, namely, what is the&lt;br/&gt;logic behind which biological processes lead complex organisms,&lt;br/&gt;such as ourselves, to develop and grow? This part of the project&lt;br/&gt;is based on a discovery of the investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;that quantitatively explains the morphological diversity of&lt;br/&gt;Darwin's Finches, the classical example of adaptive radiation --&lt;br/&gt;the process in which a single species gives rise to multiple&lt;br/&gt;species that exploit different ecological niches. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator extends this work to other bird species and uses the&lt;br/&gt;insights gained to create a mathematical framework for&lt;br/&gt;understanding development more broadly. Finally, central to the&lt;br/&gt;project is the educational mission of teaching undergraduates,&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and postdoctoral fellows how to effectively&lt;br/&gt;apply mathematics so that it can make a substantive difference in&lt;br/&gt;our world.</AbstractNarration>
