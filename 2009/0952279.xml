    <AbstractNarration>The 19th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2010) will be held in ETH Zurich, Switzerland in August, 2010 (http://icccn.org/icccn10/). This proposal requests $15,000 in funding to assist 10-15 United States-based graduate students to attend ICCCN 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;ICCCN is one of the leading international conferences for presenting novel ideas and fundamental advances in the fields of computer communications and networks. ICCCN serves to foster communication among researchers and practitioners with a common interest in improving communications and networking through scientific and technological innovation. Technical co-sponsorship is provided by the IEEE Communications Society. In 2009, the number of submissions in response to the CFP was over 400; only 104 regular papers were selected by the Technical Program Committee for presentation at the conference. In 2009, the conference program includes 11 technical tracks, a number of keynote and distinguished speakers and panels. Besides, there are 7 workshops on cutting edge topics. ICCCN 2010 will include similar technical tracks and workshops and continue the tradition of presenting the Best Paper Award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Participation in conferences such as IEEE ICCCN is an extremely important part of the graduate students? research and career development, providing the opportunity for them to present their own work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, interact with peers and more senior researchers, and expose themselves to leading edge work in the field of computer communication and networks. The support requested in this proposal will enable more participation of the US-based graduate students who would otherwise be unable to attend ICCCN 2010.</AbstractNarration>
