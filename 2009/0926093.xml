    <AbstractNarration>This cross-disciplinary research project aims at demonstrating a proof of new concept on heterogeneous integration of carbon nanotube supercapacitors on complementary metal-oxide-silicon integrated circuits as reliable on-chip energy sources. Fundamental studies and key issues on design, fabrication and heterogeneous integration of patterned carbon nanotube supercapacitors on the complementary metal-oxide-silicon integrated circuits will be investigated. Patterned carbon nanotube films will be assembled using a template-guide enhanced dielectrophoretic technique which is compatible to the traditional complementary metal-oxide-silicon technology. The fabricated nanotube films will be utilized to construct supercapacitors, which have multi-directional power flow capability as on-chip power sources.&lt;br/&gt;The collaborative effort will result in the development of integrated supercapacitors as independent, on-chip, power sources. It will provide an immediate transformative solution to very large scale integrated systems with the significant reduction on size and cost. It will improve system reliability and run-time and stimulate a large variety of new applications ranging from implantable devices, remote healthcare to smart buildings and ubiquitous computing and sensing. A concurrent and integrated educational program is designed to train students in industry-like environments and to enhance their problem-solving techniques and team-work skills. The educational efforts include recruitment and retention of student researchers in engineering education, enhancement of the engineering curriculum at the two research institutions (University of Delaware and University of Arizona), broader education in the society, and outreach to members of underrepresented groups. Moreover, it emphasizes diversity in engineering education and will result in tremendous social benefits.</AbstractNarration>
