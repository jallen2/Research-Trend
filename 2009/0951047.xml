    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the project is to investigate the feasibility to use the power conditioning systems in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs)-based coal-fired power plants to pulse the power of the SOFCs, thereby causing a sufficient amount of O2 to diffuse from the SOFC cathodes to anodes, oxidize the sulfur on the anode surfaces, and hence prevent the sulfur from damaging the anodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The proposed sulfur removal method provides the necessary protection to the SOFCs that the conventional absorbent-based protection method does not offer. The method also reduces the cost for sulfur removal because it allows less powerful and cheaper absorbents to be used or even make an absorbent unnecessary. The method also has the potential to prevent other contaminants in coal, such as As, P, Hg, Cd, Zn, Sb, Pb, Bi, Na, K, Fe, and Ni, from damaging the SOFCs without requiring additional absorbents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact&lt;br/&gt;The project can expedite development of SOFCs-based coal-fired power plants and therefore contributes to improvement of the nation?s energy security and quality of life. The project will provide research and hand-on experience to students in the area of power electronics and power systems and expose the students to leading-edge technologies such as coal-gasification and SOFC. The project will also enhance student education in power electronics at Montana State University (MSU) by incorporating research results in an undergraduate power electronics course. The project will also disseminate research results through conference presentations and journal publications.</AbstractNarration>
