    <AbstractNarration>Archaeological analysis suggests that cultural exchange from regional centers like Cahokia to peripheral areas took place at the time of Mississippian Emergence (~1000 years ago), and this study focuses on the relationship between human culture and biology, a central question for anthropologists. Ancient DNA methods are used to examine the importance of small-scale population movements in this change. DNA is analyzed from individuals at sites that span the Late Woodland and Mississippian periods (AD 930-1200) on the periphery of Cahokia, and from Mississippian individuals at Cahokia region sites. Analyses test the hypothesis of temporal genetic continuity at these sites, and determine whether alterations in mortuary practice reflect changing concepts of kinship. Fluoride dating will resolve the burial sequences at these sites.&lt;br/&gt;This project will significantly increase the genetic data from previously unstudied populations of prehistoric Native American peoples. Analyses will further our understanding of Native American prehistory and how culture is affected by movements of people, and provide the first genetic data from multiple Late Woodland mounds. Hypotheses regarding Late Woodland and Mississippian mortuary practices and kinship will be tested. This is the basis for a larger regional study of prehistoric genetic diversity and disease, and will be used to investigate familial factors in research on prehistoric tuberculosis infection patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides educational opportunities at multiple levels. This research is part of the dissertation of three female graduate students. The development of the Fluoride Dating Lab enhances options for graduate and undergraduate training and provides a direct benefit to regional anthropologists. Results will be utilized in outreach programs to local K-12 schools and museums. A symposium will be organized at the Midwest Archaeological Conference. These results may aid in policy formation by government institutions and museums with respect to Native populations.</AbstractNarration>
