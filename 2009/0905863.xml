    <AbstractNarration>Changes in stratospheric ozone play a key role in Earth's climate system, affecting not only the penetration of ultra-violet radiation to the surface, but also tropospheric weather and climate. This project will involve a multi-model analysis of stratospheric-resolving chemistry climate models (CCMs). These CCMs will be used to examine how stratospheric ozone will evolve (recover) in the 21st century, the impact of climate change on this recovery, and the impact of stratospheric ozone recovery on tropospheric climate and weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities will provide a detailed, quantitative evaluation of the capabilities and biases in the latest generation of stratospheric-resolving CCMs, new multi-model projections of the evolution of stratospheric ozone in the 21st century, including quantification of the impact of climate change, and new multi-model projections of the impact of stratospheric ozone recovery on tropospheric climate and weather during the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will benefit society by improving our understanding and projections of the Earth's ozone layer and climate system, relevant to upcoming international assessments of ozone and of climate change. Furthermore, a post-doctoral fellow and undergraduates will play major roles in the research and will receive advanced training in atmospheric science and data analysis techniques.</AbstractNarration>
