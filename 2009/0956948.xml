    <AbstractNarration>"Creating a Research Agenda in Computing at the Margins" is a workshop designed to help articulate a set of intellectual challenges that should be addressed by CISE researchers as they design and develop information and computing technology that is oriented toward people who are not currently in the set of already well-served technology users. This includes underrepresented populations within the United States, populations who encompass emerging markets in the third world, as well as the economic disadvantaged. The common assumption that increased access resolves the digital divide may actually be false. Indeed, what may be needed are fundamentally different kinds of technologies -- based on new advances in the methods and theories of design and evaluation, along with technological innovation -- grounded in an understanding of the unique constraints and considerations of the communities for which those systems are intended. Evidence already suggests that local differences in infrastructure, literacy, culture, or economic models, can and have fostered scientific innovations in user experience methods and theories, advances in systems and networking technologies and algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting research agenda will stimulate technical innovation that will support the creation, deployment, and assessment of technologies that allow ever more people to enjoy the benefits of the digital society. It will enrich the digital society by diversifying those who participate. New techniques and technology that addresses the wider needs of society is an important educational opportunity. As a research agenda it has the potential to teach the next generation of researchers and engineers a set of skills that help them build technologies that respond to the needs of all sectors of society.</AbstractNarration>
