    <AbstractNarration>Young U.S. scientists and students will participate in the Scientific Assemblies of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA); the International Association of Geodesy (IAG); and the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS). These Assemblies will provide an opportunity for scientists across the globe in the disciplines covered by each Assembly to exchange information on the most recent scientific accomplishments of recent research; to identify needs and priorities for future research; and to develop a basis for working relationships to plan and conduct research to meet these needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IAGA covers scientific areas such as paleomagnetism, rock magnetism, planetary magnetism, and electromagnetic induction; aeronomy of the middle atmosphere, ionosphere, mesosphere, and Polar atmosphere; magnetospheric processes; solar winds; and geomagnetic observatories, including development of models, data and indices. The IAG promotes development of a reference frame for a range of geosciences applications; geodesy and geodynamics; monitoring the gravity field and rotation of the Earth, the deformation of the Earth surface including ocean and ice, interaction with the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS), especially with respect to positioning and remote sensing of land, oceanic and atmospheric processes and features. The IAHS covers such areas as surface and ground water; water quality; water resources; snow and ice hydrology; interactions between the atmosphere, soil and vegetation; and continental erosion. Specific topics of interest at this Assembly are the ecohydrology of surface and groundwater dependent ecosystems; sustainability of groundwater in stressed aquifers; and integrated approaches to surface and groundwater resources.</AbstractNarration>
