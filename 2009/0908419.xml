    <AbstractNarration>In this collaborative proposal, Drs. Sebastien Lépine and Eric Gaidos will complete the largest and most complete census of nearby, low-mass stars, which are called M dwarf stars. They will identify the highest priority targets for planet searches, especially for Earth-mass planets in or near the habitable zones of their parent stars. Many previous surveys have been biased against these targets because they are faint or incompletely cataloged; furthermore, some M dwarf stars may have flares and spots that render them unsuitable for planet searches. The SUPERBLINK stellar motion survey, now being completed by Dr. Lépine, includes more than 95% of the estimated 50,000 low-mass systems within 50 parsecs of the Sun. The research team will carry out a large-scale spectroscopic survey of 10,000 stars to monitor atmospheric activity, estimate heavy element abundances, determine space motions, and infer ages, in order to select for targets with the highest potential for exoplanet discoveries. They will also build and maintain a comprehensive database of exoplanet search targets that will include each star's fundamental parameters (luminosity, distance, composition, activity level, estimated mass and age) and will track the results of any effort to identify exoplanets in each of those systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The list of exoplanet targets will be made publicly available and updated on a regular basis to track down targets of current exoplanet survey programs, and those around which planets have already been discovered. This will allow for exoplanet researchers to coordinate their efforts, and for the public to be kept informed of the latest discoveries. Undergraduate interns (two per year) will be involved at all stages of the research project at AMNH. One graduate student at the University of Hawaii will participate in the spectroscopic and photometric investigations. Results of this research will be incorporated into the American Museum of Natural History / Hayden Planetarium database (the Digital Galaxy), which is presented to 1 million visitors each year as part of the Planetarium's immersive 3D Space Show. A short video for public outreach will be produced each year on some aspect of this research, extrasolar planets, or habitability.</AbstractNarration>
