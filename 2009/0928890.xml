    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large number of modern physical and biological structures and phenomena require tools to ?see? below the surfaces but non-destructively and with nanoscale resolution. This need is particularly critical in soft/frqgile cellular/sub-cellular process; which requires innovative approaches for spatially resolved imaging and quantitative analysis under fluidic and physiologically viable conditions. The project concerns with development and implementation ?Fluidic-Scanning Near-Field Ultrasound Holography (Fluidic-SNFUH)? integrated with all-electronic detection for nano-bio-mechanics, at nanoscale resolution with sensitivity to the 3rd (Z) dimension. The research objectives revolve around combination of all-electronic feedback to maintain the cantilever at resonance, yet compatibility with fluidic imaging. This would enable truly non-invasive approach for biological and soft structures. By quantitative phase extraction coupled with ultrasound modeling, the project will develop the necessary hardware/software interface, enabling turn-key nanoscale 3-D tomography, essential for imaging environmental pollutants and pathogens; as well as their spatio-temporal entry into living systems.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research activities will advance not only SNFUH imaging but many SPM-based techniques to new territory. It will provide scientists and engineers with an entirely new imaging paradigm with the requisite resolution and non-destructive character, essential in many diverse fields, particularly for monitoring cellular pathway of undesirable environmental pollutants and pathogens; as well as desirable mitigating functional nanostructures. The project embodies an integrated educational plan focused on development of teaching modules in nano-bio-mechanics, hand-on-laboratories and classroom tutorials. It will include UG and RET (research experience for teachers) project modules correlated with research goals. The educational and outreach objectives will be achieved by hand-on, team experience to promote active and collaborative learning; with focus on recruiting (and retaining) traditionally under-represented students though MIN (Minority Internships in Nanotechnology) program. Successful realization of project goals has important implications for generating intellectual property (IP) of value for entrepreneurship and licensing opportunity; thereby helping create/retain high-technology jobs in the upper mid-western region of the US.</AbstractNarration>
