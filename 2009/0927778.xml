    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to determine the mechanism of hydrogen-bonding directed molecular recognition in water and the installation of such motifs onto known polymeric scaffolds. This study will provide a quantitative basis for consideration of hydrogen bonds in aqueous environment in the context of a synthetic or bio-derived scaffold. This fundamental component of the award lays the groundwork for incorporation of selective hydrogen bonding groups onto different polymeric backbones. It is anticipated that the use of selective recognition groups on natural and synthetic polymers will lead to enhanced function. Selective heteropolymeric interaction guided by hydrogen-bonding has great potential utility, especially in the context of surface coatings. Overall, this work traces an arc from study of molecular properties to the production of chemically-responsive, biocompatible and biodegradable materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, selective surface adhesion would be possible in water, with no oxidative or photocuring required, making it widely applicable as a ?molecular Velcro?, which would allow only designated coated surfaces to adhere. This would be useful in a number of industrial ad biomedical applications, such as in marine environment coatings or biocompatible surface adhesives as suture alternatives, and hydrogels for drug delivery and tissue engineering. This research bridges synthetic chemistry, materials science, engineering and biomedical research and will facilitate new cross-disciplinary educational experiences for graduate and undergraduate students. Students will also be exposed to the practical aspects of developing a new materials application. The simple hands-on experimental approach to molecular recognition concepts is amenable to incorporation into instructional labs. It is anticipated that development of a general methodology to enhance the synthetic and biopolymer function will have a transformative impact on both the agricultural and coatings industry with significant economic and environmental benefit.</AbstractNarration>
