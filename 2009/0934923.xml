    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Math for America Los Angeles (MfA LA), a non-profit organization formed by the University of Southern California (USC), Claremont Graduate University (CGU) and Harvey Mudd College (HMC), seeks to raise student achievement in the greater Los Angeles area by developing transformational secondary school mathematics teachers. The MfA LA Teaching Fellowship program is designed to attract individuals with talent and passion for mathematics and teaching to the profession, help them receive high-quality training, then provide them with all of the resources that they will need to become effective teachers. The 10 individuals selected to receive a MfA LA Teaching Fellowship under this project commit to a five-year program that includes one year of full-time graduate study and four years of teaching in a public secondary school (middle or high school) in one of the six partnering school districts (Los Angeles USD, Claremont USD, Pomona USD, Hacienda/La Puente USD, Chaffey Joint Union High School District, and Corona-Norco UDSD). Fellows receive a stipend and full tuition scholarship to attend either the Teacher Education Internship Program (TEIP) at the CGU or the Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) and Teaching Credentialing Program at the USC. While fulfilling the four-year teaching requirement, Fellows receive up to $20,000 in additional stipends per year and participate in comprehensive professional development with the goal of becoming National Board Certified by the end of the five-year Fellowship period. Professional development is designed in cooperation with the HMC Professional Development and Outreach Group. MfA LA is part of the network of Math for America sites and cooperates with the umbrella Math for America organization, whose goal is to show how the principles behind this effort to improve the quality of mathematics teaching and student achievement can be replicated across the nation.</AbstractNarration>
