    <AbstractNarration>EAGER: Characterization and Modeling of Nanoscaled Semiconductor Devices&lt;br/&gt;Marvin H. White&lt;br/&gt;Lehigh University&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;We propose a EAGER program to apply a new approach to study low-field carrier mobility&lt;br/&gt;in high-K, nanoscaled, semiconductor MOSFET devices ? devices with Coulomb&lt;br/&gt;scattering centers in the high-K dielectrics. This concept will permit the evaluation of lowfield&lt;br/&gt;carrier transport in nanoscaled devices with a two-terminal structure rather than the&lt;br/&gt;fabrication of a three-terminal device structure. We will use two hetero-insulator device&lt;br/&gt;structures: (1) a nonvolatile, ?charge-trap?, nanoscaled MANOS semiconductor memory&lt;br/&gt;device with programmable charge storage and (2) a metal gate, high-K, nanoscaled&lt;br/&gt;MOS transistor with fixed charge in the high-K dielectric.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit involves the integration of research and education to explore lowfield,&lt;br/&gt;carrier transport in high-K nanoscaled devices with a simple two-terminal&lt;br/&gt;conductance and capacitance measurement, thereby, alleviating the need to fabricate&lt;br/&gt;three-terminal devices complete with ohmic contacts. We will characterize the influence&lt;br/&gt;of Coulomb charge in experimental high high-K devices on carrier transport by varying&lt;br/&gt;the sign, magnitude and position of the charge. Two terminal measurements will be&lt;br/&gt;compared with three-terminal measurements on completed device structures. The&lt;br/&gt;experimental and theoretical studies involve device physics, chemistry, materials&lt;br/&gt;science and modeling at the nanoscale.&lt;br/&gt;The broader aspects in our program will advance diversity in the nanoelectronics&lt;br/&gt;workforce and provide intellectual technology transfer, integration of research and&lt;br/&gt;education, and promotion of partnerships with the industrial sector of the economy. We&lt;br/&gt;have developed excellent educational and outreach programs to increase diversity with&lt;br/&gt;opportunities in nanoelectronics, especially semiconductor devices ? an important area&lt;br/&gt;to maintain US leadership in a global economy. Our research provides an excellent&lt;br/&gt;vehicle for minority student outreach and partnerships with industry.&lt;br/&gt;The transformative nature of our research lies in a new approach to model low field&lt;br/&gt;transport with simple two-terminal structures, which can be easily fabricated in the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory without extensive photolithographic equipment. The concept is applicable to&lt;br/&gt;the study of carrier transport in a broad range of emerging nanoscaled devices and will&lt;br/&gt;aid rapid and innovative advances in the technology</AbstractNarration>
