    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project renovates space for marine science that is no longer adequate for research needs in the Galbraith Marine Science Laboratory at Eckerd College. Eckerd College is an undergraduate institution that is widely considered as an important engine for educating and training undergraduates who continue to graduate school in the marine sciences. Improvements to institutional infrastructure include upgrading the electrical and lighting, lab facilities, HVAC, and laboratory security. It will also provide better generator/battery back-up, which is important for laboratories in locations prone to hurricanes or other severe weather events. These improvements will impact laboratories that carry out important research in scientific imaging and neurophysiology, molecular biology and biogeochemistry, research computing, marine ecology, and sedimentology. It will also provide upgrades to the seawater and core processing labs. Institutional research programs that will be impacted include those that involve the geologic development of coastal and shallow marine systems impacted by human activities, the development of sensory systems of marine organisms, bottlenose dolphin ecology and adaptation, marine genetics, mangrove ecology, and how seawater temperature and salinity have changed over time. Broader impacts consist of improving research training of large numbers of undergraduates, many of whom go on to get advanced degrees, increasing infrastructure for science, and improving research performance on awards not only from NSF but from other Federal agencies.</AbstractNarration>
