    <AbstractNarration>Cameron (Kamin) D. Whitehouse, University of Virginia&lt;br/&gt;Proposal for Participant Support in the IPSN Extreme Sensing Competition 2009&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project provides travel and conference support for U.S. students to participate in the Extreme Sensing Competition (XSC), being held as part of the 8th ACM/IEEE Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN 2009). In the XSC, students, researchers, or industry participants build a sensor system that is used to perform a pre-specified task. The event requires students to address a number of open challenges involving sensing, control, signal processing, wireless networking, and the interactions between these areas. The 2009 competition considers body area networks (BANs) and dead reckoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Most participants in the Extreme Sensing Competition are junior graduate students and the event allows them to engage with the CPS research community early in their graduate program. Unfunded students who would otherwise be unable to attend ISPN and participate in the XSC are given special consideration for support. Students from underrepresented groups are also given special consideration for support. Advertising emphasized outreach to these groups. The event also showcases the student participants and projects to the large cyber-physical systems research community, as ISPN 2009 is a component of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Week and the competition is open to all CPS Week attendees.</AbstractNarration>
