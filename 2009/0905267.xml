    <AbstractNarration>Cooperative networking exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless channel by effectively pooling the overheard information, which is traditionally treated as harmful interference. While there is a mature suite of tools at the physical (PHY) layer to harvest cooperative gains, it is still unclear how these tools can be employed to deliver significant network capacity gains. The goal of this project is to design and implement cross-layer mechanisms for cooperative networking. By integrating PHY layer cooperation with Medium Access Control (MAC) and application layers, the project will provide higher network capacity and improved multimedia quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two interrelated components investigating basic architectures for next generation cooperative networks: (i) Cooperative data transmission, which focuses on a robust cooperative MAC-PHY incorporating multiple relays under mobility and loose requirements on synchronization and network topology. (ii) Cooperative video transmission, which exploits the synergy between cooperation and layered compression in providing unequal error protection, as well as differential quality in multicast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from potential impacts on the theory and practice of new wireless technologies, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students in all aspects of wireless communications. The impact on industry will be facilitated by the close relationship of NYU-Poly with WICAT member companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
