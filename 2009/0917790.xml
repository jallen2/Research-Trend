    <AbstractNarration>A major objective of the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference is to bring together every two years leading members of the scientific community, graduate students, and post docs to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects in marine chemistry within an informal setting. In 2009, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held August 2-7, 2009 at the Tilton School in New Hampshire. The theme for this year?s conference will be ?Process, dynamics and change in the Anthropocene ocean? and will emphasize the pressing need to comprehend the response of the ocean to anthropogenic forcing within the context of a mechanistic understanding of the underlying basic processes and an historical perspective. Presentations and discussions at the 2009 Gordon Conference will center around the following session topics: (1) Open Ocean Carbon Cycling and Fluxes; (2) Ocean Acidification, Carbonates, and Biogeochemical Responses; (3) Biomineralization and Ocean Process/State Proxies; (4) Metals, Volatiles: Inputs, Outputs, and Interior Ocean Processing; (5) Biogeochemical Mechanisms of Elemental Cycling in the Water Column; (6) Organic Tracers of Biogeochemical and Oceanic Processes; (7) Physical Structure/Dynamics-Biogeochemical Coupling; (8) Benthic Systems; and (9) Coastal Ocean Biogeochemical Processing and Exchange. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific alliances. For this reason, the National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 17 graduate student/post docs and 33 invited speakers/discussion leaders in the 2009 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference.</AbstractNarration>
