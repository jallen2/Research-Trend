    <AbstractNarration>The Albuquerque region is home to large government laboratories, large technical industries and many small high technology companies. The Southwest Center for Microsystem Education (SCME), a collaboration of the University of New Mexico, Central New Mexico Community College (CNM) , and the Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI), increases the educational capacity of the region to produce technicians skilled in supporting microelectromechanical system (MEMS) research, design, and commercialization. The regional center builds on its previous work to establish workforce needs and standards to engage academia, industry and government in identifying microsystem technician competencies, while also increasing awareness of career opportunities in MEMS by community college and high school students. Based on a needs assessment and building on prior experience, learning modules and kits are developed to enhance microsystem-focused programs and curricula in high schools and community colleges. Thirty more shared-content object (SCO) suites are created to support new topics in MEMS fabrication, characterization, instrumentation and career exploration. Hands-on kits that bring elements of the cleanroom fabrication experience into the classroom are developed and disseminated. The Center continues to provide professional development workshops for high school, community college and four-year college faculty. Each year four one-day introductory awareness workshops and four five-day cleanroom short courses are offered - one workshop is offered to tribal colleges. The Center increases interest in MEMS in high-school age populations by working in high schools that have large numbers of students from underrepresented groups and with their teachers. The effectiveness of the materials and professional development is evaluated.</AbstractNarration>
