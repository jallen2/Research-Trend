    <AbstractNarration>This workshop at Arizona State University brings together social scientists to present research on immigration, its impact on transnational migration, diverse populations and communities, and law and policy. Participants include twenty-five U.S. and foreign scholars whose research interests reflect a variety of disciplines (e.g., sociology, anthropology, economics, geography, public policy, public health) and different contexts--from the U.S. to Europe to Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants' research and discussion will address several questions, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the varied historical and contemporary reasons for the movement of populations (refugees, laborers, etc.)?&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the consequences of transnational migration for the sending and receiving countries?&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the relationships between and among immigration, refugee flows and race-based hate crimes including rape and ethnic cleansing?&lt;br/&gt;-- How does immigration affect notions of citizenship, identity and belonging?&lt;br/&gt;-- What factors explain historical and contemporary legislative responses to immigrants and refugees? To what extent can theories of racial threat and moral panics help explain these responses?&lt;br/&gt;-- Are we witnessing new patterns in offending by and victimization of immigrants (with particular attention to human trafficking, victimization of day laborers, and victimization of immigrant women by violent partners)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators leading the conference will produce a report that summarizes trends that emerged in findings reported and identify promising agendas for future social science research.</AbstractNarration>
