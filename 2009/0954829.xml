    <AbstractNarration>This award will support a network of educators from community colleges, undergraduate institutions, and research universities, together with the Department of Energy-Joint Genome Institute (DOE-JGI), that will provide accessible, inexpensive, and authentic research experience in genome annotation to undergraduate students. Genome annotation is a process that attaches biological information to DNA sequence data. Although some parts of this process can be performed with computer-based algorithms, evaluation of those analysis and functional genetic analysis are best performed by researchers. Those steps provide the opportunity for students to learn and apply current research tools and contribute to a large research effort. Microbial genome sequence data and training in the use of online annotation tools will be provided by the DOE-JGI. The network will recruit, train and mentor new members, and develop new curricula that encourage authentic research experiences in entry-level through advanced biology courses. The intellectual merits of the project will include enhanced student learning in the biological sciences through the active and inquiry-based learning strategy of relevant research, increased retention of students in the biological sciences, including students from underrepresented groups, and faculty development in the rapidly advancing field of genome annotation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project will include creation of a large and diverse cohort of educators and students participating in authentic research that advances the field of microbial genome science, fostering of interactions among the network's members and other interested researchers on a focused scientific question that has long-term potential as a vibrant research program; creation of a national model for incorporating annotation-based research into the undergraduate curriculum, and providing opportunities for many students to participate in authentic research, especially at community colleges that normally cannot afford the time and expense of an extensive and integrated research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported jointly by the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
