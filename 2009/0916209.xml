    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robotic Sensor Networks (RSNs) are finding increasing use in critical&lt;br/&gt;applications such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, emergency&lt;br/&gt;response and search-and-rescue. With recent advances in embedded&lt;br/&gt;technologies, devices that can be used as RSN units are becoming available&lt;br/&gt;for everyday use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on pursuit-evasion games where one or more&lt;br/&gt;pursuers tries to "capture" an evader who, in turn, tries to avoid&lt;br/&gt;capture. Robust, provably correct solutions to many RSN &lt;br/&gt;tasks (such as coverage and connectivity) can be obtained by modeling them as pursuit-evasion games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing solutions to pursuit-evasion games usually assume that&lt;br/&gt;(i) all players can observe each other at all times and (ii) there is&lt;br/&gt;a centralized authority that coordinates all pursuers. Hence, such&lt;br/&gt;solutions are not applicable for modeling RSN applications where the&lt;br/&gt;network faces severe sensing and communication limitations. The&lt;br/&gt;primary goals of the proposed work are to understand the effect of these&lt;br/&gt;limitations on the outcome of the game, and to design strategies to&lt;br/&gt;overcome them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Sensing and actuation are expected to play significant roles in the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of information technology and the Internet. This&lt;br/&gt;research will contribute to this evolution in two major ways. First,&lt;br/&gt;it will deliver algorithms, tools and techniques to address&lt;br/&gt;communication, sensing and actuation issues simultaneously. Second,&lt;br/&gt;it will help scientists and engineers participating in this development acquire a broad&lt;br/&gt;range of skills in areas such as algorithms, perception, robotics and communications. This&lt;br/&gt;will be achieved through outreach programs and by incorporating this research in PI's courses.</AbstractNarration>
