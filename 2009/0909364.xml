    <AbstractNarration>OISE-0826431 (Wang, Joseph J., University of Southern California) IRES: Participation in an International Student Satellite Project at KIT in Japan. This three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) collaborative research project between University of Southern California (USC) and the Kyushu Institute of Technology (KIT) in Japan will annually support six U.S. undergraduate and graduate students each spending three-months at KIT to participate in a satellite project. The U.S. student participants will work with KIT students to design, build, test, and operate a micro-satellite. The satellite mission will investigate material degradation in space, validate a CMOS camera module for use on micro-satellites, and take high resolution images of the Earth from orbit. This project represents the first ever comprehensive international collaboration for U.S. students directly related to a space mission, and will provide the participants with a global perspective in space exploration. The participants will broadly disseminate their research findings to scientists and engineers working on spacecraft environmental interactions and satellite design.</AbstractNarration>
