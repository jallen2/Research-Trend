    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless Mesh Networks have emerged as a solution for providing last-mile Internet access. By exploiting advanced communication technologies, they can achieve very high rates. However, effectively controlling these networks, especially in the context of advanced physical layer technologies, realistic models for channel interference, and distributed operation, remains a major challenge. Hence, the project focuses on developing effective and practical network control algorithms that make efficient use of wireless resources through joint topology adaptation, network layer routing, MAC layer scheduling, and physical layer power, channel, and rate control. The design of the algorithms leverages recent developments in the control of dynamical systems and randomized algorithms, and takes into account realistic channel models. This includes: (i) topology adaptation algorithms that take advantage of channel allocation, power control, and the controlled mobility capabilities of some of the nodes to dynamically decompose the network into sub-networks in which low-complexity distributed scheduling and routing algorithms are guaranteed to achieve high throughput, (ii) randomized distributed algorithms that solve the scheduling and routing problems in a computationally efficient manner using only local topological and queue size information, and (iii) evaluation of the algorithms? performance in terms of throughput, delay, and complexity. The developed algorithms will enable highly efficient operation of wireless networks. The project incorporates training of graduate and undergraduate students, outreach activities to local high-school teachers, and technology transfer to industry and government laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
