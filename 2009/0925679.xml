    <AbstractNarration>Development of Fault Tolerant Electromechanical Systems via Field Reconstruction Method&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The main objective of this research is to develop a new design methodology for fault tolerant and self-healing operation of electromechanical energy converters. Field reconstruction method will be used to develop just-in-time detection and optimal management of various electrical and mechanical faults which may occur within a multi-phase permanent magnet synchronous machine. Furthermore, a feasibility studies for inclusion of multi-physic and nonlinear magnetic problems in FRM technique will be conducted. An important educational objective of this research is to develop a web-based control system used in a long distance electric machinery laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Field reconstruction method provides an analytical formulation for analysis of electromagnetic fields using which different disciplines of engineering such as signal processing, electromagnetic, and power electronic can effectively be employed to create optimal and efficient solution for adjustable speed motor drives. This formulation allows for the use of advanced optimization algorithms, pattern recognition techniques, and modern control techniques to be effectively integrated in the design of the magnetic configuration and power electronic-based control of the drive. Development of such formulations will pave the way for shortening the computational time by avoiding the redundant numerical procedures that are typically used in finite element methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Successful implementation of efficient, fault tolerant, and intelligent electromechanical energy converters is a necessity in realization of smart grid systems. Reliable solutions for increasing the efficiency of wind generators, electric propulsion units in plug-in hybrid vehicles, and home appliances is an integral part of an energy conservation plan which can be reached through this research.</AbstractNarration>
