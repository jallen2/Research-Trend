    <AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program supports Professor Jason G. Gillmore of Hope College in a project directed toward the development of electron deficient photochromic molecules that can be used as oxidizing agents in their long-wavelength absorbing photochemically excited state. The project will involve undergraduate researchers in the design of the modified photochromes, their synthesis, and their basic photochemical and electrochemical characterization. The effectiveness of the photochromes in several cationic polymerization and small molecule isomerization reactions will be investigated. The goal is to generate a library of photochromatic materials with varying excited state reduction potentials. This primarily experimental project will also include a computational component. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research by Professor Gillmore develops gated photoinduced charge transfer by synthesizing photochromes that isomerize between short- and long wavelength absorbing states. Broader impacts could lead to applications in photoinitiation of polymerization, data storage, and increased control of chemical reactions. Another important impact of this research will be the exposure of students to topics including electron transfer, ion radical reactive intermediates, photochemistry, cyclic voltammetry, polymerization, materials science, and computational chemistry. Professor Gillmore will implement a full Peer-Led Team Learning program into the organic lecture curriculum. The PI will also hold regional workshops for postdoctoral students who are considering teaching careers at undergraduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>
