    <AbstractNarration>(Biological Sciences 61)&lt;br/&gt;A widely used successful model for incorporating research into chemistry laboratory courses (from the Center for Authentic Science Practice in Education, "CASPiE") is being adapted in a first-year biological science laboratory course at a research university (Purdue University) and a primarily undergraduate institution (Purdue University North Central). The overarching goal is to advance students' understanding of the scientific method, of biological research and of its products. Simultaneously, the method is improving students' ability to communicate scientific data and principles at an early stage in their undergraduate education. With the assistance of personnel at Purdue University that developed the CASPiE model, three new modules are being developed, each based on the research of one of three different faculty members, one in bacterial genetics, one in neuro-anatomy, and one in population biology. Each module is designed so that students work in teams to analyze preliminary results, use such results to revise the experimental design for further inquiry, and collectively summarize the conclusions of the research and present final results in poster format. The modules can be used in multiple years and shared with other institutions. Rubrics for course grading are being adapted from those already developed for the CASPiE model, as are CASPiE instruments for assessment of the educational outcomes of the new laboratory course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work is rooted in both science education and biological science. In terms of education, the work investigates whether: (1) a successful model for incorporating research into introductory laboratory courses in Chemistry can be adapted to the Life Sciences; (2) a research-based learning experience can not only provide basic skills for students, but also enhance students' scientific understanding and their ability to communicate science; and, (3) early exposure to research in an undergraduate program will improve both student retention in science and their willingness to seek out independent research experiences. In addition the research that students conduct is contributing to faculty-guided projects investigating bacterial genetics, neuro-anatomy, and population genetics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the work are also varied. It is an example of how to adapt undergraduate teaching modules across different science fields and within different institution types. Results from the project are adding, as well, to our growing body of knowledge about the efficacy of introducing research modules into introductory courses.</AbstractNarration>
