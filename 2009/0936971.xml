    <AbstractNarration>Transformational change in how humans view the natural world, utilize its resources, and interact with the environment is necessary to alleviate continued degradation of land and resources. Biomimicry is the discipline of applying nature's design solutions to human design and innovation. Nature is the world's largest research and development laboratory, and has been testing and retesting biological designs and strategies for billions of years. Nature's solutions are closed loop and in harmony with the ecosystem. By learning to design, manufacture, and live according to principles observed in nature, the tools needed to transform our world can be developed. The goal of this workshop is to convene members of the business, policy, and educational communities to learn about the transformative elements of biomimicry, envision a future where nature plays a role in education and innovation, and jointly determine the path for fully utilizing the potential that biomimicry represents. This workshop will highlight educators who have taught biomimicry both formally and informally, to discuss how biomimicry can be an exceptionally effective tool for learning. It will also feature business leaders who have developed biomimetic products and solutions. These innovative leaders will discuss the challenges of developing and commercializing products based on biomimicry, as well as the significance of their products from the perspective of industry and sustainability. Finally, there will be a biomimicry tour of the San Diego Zoo and an Invention Convention showcasing existing biomimetic inventions. This workshop will be one of the first community-wide discussions focused on the impact of biomimicry in industry and society. It is the contention of the organizers that biomimicry as a scientific discipline will play a key role in future innovation. The future will require products and processes that are sustainable and closed loop. If students, scientists and business leaders can be taught to learn principles of design and manufacture according to principles observed in nature, those principles can be used to develop the tools needed to live sustainably.</AbstractNarration>
