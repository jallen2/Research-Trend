    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project focuses on the demonstrating the technical feasibility and a commercialization path for a well-established educational robotics platform. This innovative Computer and Electronics Engineering Robot (CEENBoT), is a hands-on tool to teach basic to intermediate engineering skills by assembling a programmable robot. It is being developed to meet the global educational challenge by reaching thousands of US students, especially under-represented minorities and women. This platform places an engineering and educationally stimulating technology in student hands at an early age to increase interest in school and after school STEM experiences promoting advanced learning. The robot platform will allow students and commercial customers to customize software and accessories to their particular interests and applications. An adaptable hardware platform will be investigated to ensure compatibility with current and emerging technologies allowing the educational robot to be used for several years in a student's curriculum. Proposed product feasibility research will include: suitable power sources, solar power adaptability, programmable power/sleep settings, intelligent plug-and-play sensors, lightweight chassis for GPS navigation over turf and Internet connectivity for diagnostics and upgradeability. During the period of the grant a professional design team will show feasibility while advancing the technology and expanding the manufacturing base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CEENBoT educational platform is an outgrowth of an NSF CCLI grant to stimulate university level engineering students. Due to its success in generating enthusiasm at the university level, the platform is being introduced into grades 5-12 educational settings under two additional NSF grants: Discovery Research K-12 (cyberinfrastructure-based formal education curriculum development) and an ITEST scale up (informal educational use of the robot in 4-H clubs and summer camps). In preparation for increasing CEENBoT demand under these two grants and the further penetration into university ECE programs, the decision was made to commercialize the CEENBoT educational platform. The broader impact is the creation of a K-16 educational robotic platform for formal and non-formal educational programs (especially for inner city schools) that will provide an ongoing stimulation to increase students entering STEM fields. The proposed research will include investigation of a flexible educational robot to teach logic and programming concepts at an early age. Total US market potential for educational robots is 417,650 units annually with an $83.5 million gross revenue potential. Unit sale price is targeted at $200 with $835,000 annual revenue.</AbstractNarration>
