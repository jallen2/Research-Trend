    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The objective of this project is to study and understand fundamental phenomena underlying the interaction between the piezoelectric potential and charge transport behavior in ZnO one-dimensional nanostructures. The research aims to (1) correlate the intensity and distribution of piezoelectric potential in a ZnO nanowire with the size, strain and carrier density and to reveal the free charge screening effect on the piezoelectricity; (2) investigate how the carrier mobility is regulated by the piezoelectric field across a ZnO nanowire channel; (3) establish a general relationship between the carrier mobility and the nanowire's basic physical properties, including size, strain and carrier density. Zinc oxide nanowires with a rectangular cross section are synthesized and used for the piezoelectric and electric characterization. The research also plans to fabricate piezoelectricity-gated transistors using ZnO nanowires and to study these transistors in order to validate the theoretical framework established under this project. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The success of the research is expected to lay a foundation for applying piezoelectric semiconductor nanomaterials in advanced sensing and energy harvesting nanodevices. The research component of the project is integrated with the PI's new graduate course on Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology and an undergraduate course on Ceramics. The project also provides an excellent opportunity for training graduate and undergraduate students with fabrication and characterization technologies in the frontier of nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>
