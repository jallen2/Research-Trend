    <AbstractNarration>This workshop on Dynamics in the Human Sciences: Cognitive, Behavioral &amp; Social Complexity is being jointly coordinated by l'Agence Nationale de la Recerche (ANR) and the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate of the National Science Foundation (NSF/SBE). This two-day workshop will bring together researchers from a wide variety of disciplines united by their work on complexity science. These scholars will assess work done to date in the area of complexity science, especially through funding opportunities such as NSF's Human and Social Dynamics program and the European Commissions EXYSTENCE program. They also plan to develop possible new areas of investigation, with a focus on emergent phenomena, phase transitions, and the dynamics of complex systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop is a timely step to facilitate international collaborations in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. The respective research communities of NSF/SBE and the ANR have conducted ad hoc collaborations in the past, but this workshop aims to focus those collaborations on the field of complexity and dynamics. The chosen workshop topic of complexity is one that is being highlighted as a frontier area for the human sciences, both at NSF and abroad. Much of the research in this area has historically come from US and French researchers and these countries continue to represent the cutting edge of complexity science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop has strong broader impacts in that it will strengthen international collaborations. In addition, it includes the participation of junior scientists in the workshop, which will help their careers in their respective fields, as well as help them establish international collaborators at an early stage in their careers.</AbstractNarration>
