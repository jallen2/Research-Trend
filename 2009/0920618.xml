    <AbstractNarration>Charles S. Gasser&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # IOS-0920618&lt;br/&gt;Molecular Control of Ovule Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seeds comprise at least 70% of the calories consumed by the world's human population. Ovules are the plant structures that develop into seeds. A combined genetic and molecular approach is being used to define the mechanisms responsible for regulating ovule development. One part of the proposed work will focus on two genes, INNER NO OUTER (INO) and ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (ATS), that have been shown to encode transcription factors critical for formation of the ovule integuments (sheathing structures that differentiate to form the seed coat). Proteins that interact with the INO and ATS proteins will be identified through a protein interaction screen in yeast. The nature and biological roles of these interactions will be evaluated thorough further interaction studies and analysis of the effects of loss of function of the corresponding genes. Genes regulated by the INO transcription factor will be identified through studies on the specific sequences within the genome with which INO interacts. Transcription profiling has identified other genes expressed during ovule development and these will be evaluated genetically for roles in this process. The work will provide a better understanding of the factors controlling early development of this critical component of human nutrition and provide tools for potential manipulation of seed and fruit formation. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be instructed in the latest methods of genetic analysis enabling them to join the workforce in education or industry. Existing campus programs will be utilized to aid in recruiting members of underrepresented groups in the research program.</AbstractNarration>
