    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009 and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Jose C. Colon-Gaud is "Food webs and energy flow in tropical vs. temperate headwater streams: roles of consumers in ecosystem function." The host institution for this research is the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras under the sponsorship of Dr. Alonso Ramirez. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of our knowledge of tropical streams has been based on a few short-term studies that generally focus on consumer diversity or abundance estimates, and comprehensive investigations linking consumers to ecosystem processes are generally lacking. Consumers play an important role in the functioning of ecosystems and can influence processes such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, and energy flow. In light of declining biodiversity, understanding the roles of consumers in ecosystems has become a central theme in ecological research. This study is developing quantitative food webs for headwater streams in the Luquillo Long Term Ecological Research site in northeastern Puerto Rico by quantifying major pathways of energy flow among resources and consumers. This is access the overall importance of different food resources as drivers of community structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training objectives for this research include: 1) learning new experimental techniques in the areas of analytical chemistry, ecological stoichiometry, and food web ecology to assess the roles of consumer in ecosystem processes; 2) gain experience in the development and coordination of large-scale experiments; 3) mentoring young scientists through participation in internship programs at the University of Puerto Rico. Broader impacts include increasing the participation of under-represented groups in research experiences in the field of ecology, as well increasing our knowledge of understudied systems.</AbstractNarration>
