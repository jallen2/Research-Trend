    <AbstractNarration>Lead Institution: University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;Project Director: Ronald J. Pugmire &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Utah State EPSCoR Planning Grant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Description &lt;br/&gt;This multi-disciplinary, intra/inter-institutional planning project will improve and enhance research and research-based education within the State of Utah by strengthening the science and engineering research facilities and infrastructure to attract and retain highly qualified research personnel to the state; enhancing education and training of students of all backgrounds in science and engineering fields with special emphasis on engaging underrepresented groups in the research enterprise; and improving and promoting the transfer of technology from institutions of higher learning to the commercial sector. An expected outcome of the planning process is the development and submission of a Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) proposal to NSF EPSCoR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Through a coordinated planning effort, it is expected that collaboration will increase between and among academic institutions in the State of Utah. The two public research institutions, University of Utah and Utah State University, and one private university, Brigham Young University will catalyze the multi-disciplinary inter-institutional effort to improve the state?s overall research and research based education infrastructure. The management team has directed major federally funded programs as well as industrially funded projects. The planning committee represents major institutions across Utah and this committee will provide the leadership needed to successfully execute the elements outlined for this project. Significant pre-planning activities have occurred, and all of the participating organizations will provide additional resources to assure the success of this planning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;By establishing closer relationships between Utah?s community colleges, the primarily undergraduate schools, and the three research universities, this project will increase collaboration between universities in Utah, improve the educational experience of science and technology students at all levels, and increase the educational opportunities of under-represented groups by establishing closer relationships between the community colleges, the primarily undergraduate schools, and the research universities. Investment in Utah will be carefully targeted to achieve the EPSCoR goal of sustainable science and technology infrastructure improvements at the state and institutional levels. The results of these efforts are expected to significantly increase the capabilities of Utah researchers to succe</AbstractNarration>
