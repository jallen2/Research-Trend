    <AbstractNarration>PI: Yu, Jaehyuk&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 0950850&lt;br/&gt;Title: Regulation of sporogenesis in Aspergillus &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungi are of great importance to humankind as pathogens, environmental recyclers, industrial producers, and agricultural aids. A large number of fungi produce spores as the main means of dissemination and survival. Spores are also the primary agent for infecting hosts for many pathogenic fungi. Moreover, in some fungi spore formation is intimately related with production of toxic secondary metabolites called mycotoxins that cause adverse health effects to humans, animals and plants. Despite its fundamental importance in both basic and applied aspects, the mechanism underlying spore formation in molds is largely unknown. This project investigates functions of two newly identified velvet genes that play a key role in regulating sporulation and production of mycotoxins in molds. These two velvet genes are hypothesized to control expression of other genes associated with spore and toxin formation via binding to DNA and acting as transcriptional regulators. This project employs recently developed genetic and molecular tools that facilitate the understanding of gene function in fungi. Expected results include better understanding the functions of these novel regulators, identification of groups of genes that are controlled by the two genes, and defining the genetic networks regulating spore formation and toxin production in molds. Understanding the mechanisms governing sporulation and secondary metabolism in molds will provide new insights into controlling both beneficial and detrimental activities of other industrially, medically, and agriculturally important fungi. In broader impacts, this project will provide opportunities to promote excellence in science education and rigorous training of graduate and undergraduate students in the disciplines of microbiology, genetics and genomics.</AbstractNarration>
