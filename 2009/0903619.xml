    <AbstractNarration>0903619&lt;br/&gt;B. Allenby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; "The First Symposium on Industrial Ecology for Young Professionals" is designed and organized by young professionals (e.g., graduate students and post-doctoral researchers), including members of the Student Chapter of the International Society for Industrial Ecology (ISIE). The focus of the symposium is research and application in the area of Industrial Ecology, emphasizing sustainability. The symposium, to be held at Arizona State University on May 17, 2009, will immediately precede the joint international conference at the same site for the IEEE International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISSST ' 09, formally the annual International Symposium on Electronics and the Environment) and the annual International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS ' 09). Both ISSST ' 09 and ISTAS ' 09 are closely related to industrial ecology. The primary goal of the symposium for young professionals is to provide an opportunity for them to present ongoing research, receive constructive feedback, and network with senior professionals in the field. Additionally, the event will enable young professional in the U.S. to establish a national network of young industrial ecology researchers for ongoing exchange and future collaborations. Research foci will include Material and Substance Flow Analysis (MFA/SFA), Life Cycle Assessment and Management (LCA/LCM), design for the environment, resource productivity, energy efficiency, and industrial symbiosis. The award of travel funds and accommodation subsidy will enable a number of young professionals, including women and minorities, to attend the symposium when they otherwise would be unable to do so. For this event, the faculty PI is Braden Allenby (Arizona State University [ASU] and Immediate Past President, ISIE), and the faculty co-PIs are Roland Geyer (University of California, Santa Barbara) and Eric Williams (ASU). Additionally, Prof. Clinton Andrews (Rutgers U.) serves on the Technical Committee for the symposium.</AbstractNarration>
