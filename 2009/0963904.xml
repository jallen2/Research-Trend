    <AbstractNarration>There has been an enormous amount of work in recent years directed&lt;br/&gt;toward understanding the structural and dynamical properties of&lt;br/&gt;"informatics graphs" or "complex networks." Most of this work has been&lt;br/&gt;on small to medium-sized networks, and it has led to an improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the properties of networks arising in many graph&lt;br/&gt;mining applications. In spite of this, formulating appropriate models&lt;br/&gt;for and answering even basic questions about larger informatics&lt;br/&gt;graphs remains challenging. For instance, recent work has shown that&lt;br/&gt;dynamic properties as well as basic structural properties of large&lt;br/&gt;informatics graphs are not reproduced even qualitatively by popular&lt;br/&gt;network generative models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will use traditional and recently-developed&lt;br/&gt;approximation algorithms for the graph partitioning problem as&lt;br/&gt;"experimental probes" of large informatics graphs in order to&lt;br/&gt;characterize in a more robust and scalable manner the structural and&lt;br/&gt;dynamic properties of very large informatics graphs. This will&lt;br/&gt;include extending and implementing recently-developed algorithms such&lt;br/&gt;as "local" spectral methods and algorithms that intuitively&lt;br/&gt;"interpolate" between spectral and flow-based methods, as well as&lt;br/&gt;revisiting in light of new applications traditional methods such as&lt;br/&gt;the global spectral method and ideas underlying the popular package&lt;br/&gt;Metis. A central goal will be to provide the analyst with tools that&lt;br/&gt;have sufficient algorithmic and statistical flexibility to&lt;br/&gt;characterize the local and global structures of large networks in a&lt;br/&gt;rich and robust way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the proposed work lies in extending recent&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and algorithmic developments and applying them to very&lt;br/&gt;real-world problems. The Broader Impact of the project lies in&lt;br/&gt;enhancing interdisciplinary education at Berkeley and Stanford and&lt;br/&gt;more generally. This will involve the organization of meetings and&lt;br/&gt;courses that will include the opportunity for research projects,&lt;br/&gt;including by students from underrepresented groups, that focus on&lt;br/&gt;bridging theoretical methods and real-world applications.
