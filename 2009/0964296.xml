    <AbstractNarration>The broad topic of polymer physics impacts every industrial sector from electronics to transportation to medicine to textiles to energy generation and storage. Similarly, there is a breadth of cutting edge topics in polymers from new understanding in polymer crystallization to energy conversion and transmission to mechanical properties of soft gels to simulating polymer dynamics at the nanoscale. This Polymer Physics GRC will be designed both to extend the wellestablished topics in the field and to introduce the community to less familiar and overlooked topics, such as mechanical properties and electroactive polymers. Speakers will include past participants of this GRC and also bring in leaders from related fields. The conference will feature 22 invited lectures, wherein the opening 10 minutes are specifically designed for a general polymer physics audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference seeks, as do all GRC's, to gather leading people in the field and to bring them into extended contact with one other and with younger researchers (specifically, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers). Extended discussions in both formal and informal settings over many days are accomplished by the retreat-like atmosphere of the GRC format that is known to build and nurture lifelong friendships and to ignite new collaborations. In addition to the scientific content of these discussions, it is also an opportunity for mentoring. I have set specific diversity objectives for the speakers and discussion leaders with respect to career stage, gender, and geography. To integrate the new and returning conferees, a speakers' table will be established where speakers will dine with junior scientists and a variety of afternoon and social activities will be organized to encourage mingling.</AbstractNarration>
