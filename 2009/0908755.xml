    <AbstractNarration>Putkaradze&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908755&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops equations of motion for elastic&lt;br/&gt;strings with rigid "bouquets" of charges that may swivel around&lt;br/&gt;the elastic base. In addition to elastic energy of the bend,&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary nonlocal interactions between the charges are&lt;br/&gt;considered. The studies are kept completely general and can&lt;br/&gt;include electrostatic interactions, the Lennard-Jones&lt;br/&gt;interactions preventing self-intersection of the string, or any&lt;br/&gt;other nonlocal interactions. The investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;derive an exact geometric theory of the motion of the nonlocally&lt;br/&gt;interacting elastic strings and apply it to a variety of&lt;br/&gt;problems. This theory is based on the Simo-Marsden-Krishnaprasad&lt;br/&gt;theory of exact elastic rods. After the theory is derived, an&lt;br/&gt;explicit method for computing exact helical solutions of the&lt;br/&gt;equations is found. The investigator also shows that for&lt;br/&gt;geometric reasons, an explicit dispersion relation for the&lt;br/&gt;propagation and stability of linear waves on helical solutions&lt;br/&gt;can be derived. This technique also provides a method for&lt;br/&gt;computing linear combinations of elastic constants if the shape&lt;br/&gt;of helical molecules and the interactions between the charges are&lt;br/&gt;known. The investigator also derives a discrete analogue of the&lt;br/&gt;equations allowing a wide class of exact solutions, called&lt;br/&gt;n-helices. These are discrete helices with the pattern repeating&lt;br/&gt;after n shifts. The bifurcation structure of these discrete&lt;br/&gt;n-helices is examined. Finally, it is shown how to use helices&lt;br/&gt;as basic building blocks for construction of more complex&lt;br/&gt;molecular conformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Long chains of organic molecules, like proteins, form the&lt;br/&gt;basis of all life on Earth. The shape of these molecules plays a&lt;br/&gt;crucial role for their function in a living body, and thus&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the inner structure of these molecules is an&lt;br/&gt;important task. It has been found that the inner structure of&lt;br/&gt;many proteins consists of tightly wound helices, and those&lt;br/&gt;helices are packed together in a complex fashion. The helices&lt;br/&gt;are held together by a complex interplay of electrostatic and&lt;br/&gt;elastic (and other) forces. How can one describe the formation&lt;br/&gt;of these complex shapes? Why are helices so ubiquitous in&lt;br/&gt;Nature? The investigator and his colleagues approach these&lt;br/&gt;questions by deriving a theory of molecular chain evolution that&lt;br/&gt;can include many possible interactions between individual atoms. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator shows that, because of geometric reasons,&lt;br/&gt;helices are stationary states for simple molecules, no matter how&lt;br/&gt;complex the interaction between the atoms may be. This theory&lt;br/&gt;forms a basis for understanding of the inner structure of&lt;br/&gt;biological molecules and their dynamics. Better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the spatial structure of molecules and their formation helps in&lt;br/&gt;designing better polymers for the chemical industry, better drugs&lt;br/&gt;for medical applications, and materials with novel and improved&lt;br/&gt;properties for high-tech engineering of the future.</AbstractNarration>
