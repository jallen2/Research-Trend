    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to build Commugrate, a community-driven &lt;br/&gt;data integration system that capitalizes on the information gained&lt;br/&gt;from the interactions of communities of humans with data sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commugrate tackles key challenges raised by the increase in the&lt;br/&gt;number of information sources used in science, engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;industry, as well as the need for large-scale data integration&lt;br/&gt;solutions to enable effective access to these sources. These challenges&lt;br/&gt;include schema matching and mapping, record-linkage, and data repair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, Commugrate (i) utilizes both direct and indirect&lt;br/&gt;contributions from different types of human communities with a focus on&lt;br/&gt;the latter contributions, (ii) solves key data integration issues using &lt;br/&gt;new evidences like usage and behavior data which have not been previously &lt;br/&gt;used, (iii) adopts a new technique for schema matching, which defines &lt;br/&gt;a new class of its own, namely usage-based schema matching, &lt;br/&gt;(iv) introduces the first of its genre technique for record linkage based &lt;br/&gt;on entities' behavior, and (v) provides an adaptive feedback system to &lt;br/&gt;improve the quality of the data by making the best use of users feedback. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commugrate has a broad impact across multiple segments of society as data &lt;br/&gt;integration is by far the most important and in the same time vexing issue &lt;br/&gt;in many areas in sciences, engineering, and industry. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;leveraging users' interactions with data sources, especially indirect &lt;br/&gt;interaction, may provide several benefits and help solve many intractable &lt;br/&gt;data integration tasks which cannot be done without human intervention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PhD students will pursue research in this project. Publications, technical &lt;br/&gt;reports, software and experimental data from this research will be &lt;br/&gt;disseminated via the project web site at &lt;br/&gt;http://www.purdue.edu/cybercenter/commugrate.</AbstractNarration>
