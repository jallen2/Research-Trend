    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) Program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research project of Prof. Nathan Lewis of California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Prof. Lewis and his students will develop a detailed understanding of the chemical reactivity of well-defined, planar Si surfaces and thereby form the basis for transferring this chemistry to more complex structures; explore and characterize mixed-alkyl monolayers on Si(111) to optimize their electrical properties while retaining the ability to perform further, desirable functionalization reactions; make well-defined, transparent Si/conductive polymer junctions having a variety of barrier heights; and study the fundamental aspects of self-assembly, thus developing methodologies that will enable the spontaneous organization of isotropic semiconductor rod suspensions into oriented electrode arrays. This research project involves manipulating the properties of Si and it is therefore of importance in technologies such as photovoltaics, photoelectrochemical cells, and to processes such as etching and lithography in which the chemistry of Si surfaces is heavily exploited. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who wish to specialize in a cutting edge research area of great relevance to national competitiveness in the renewable energy, information, and optical communications industries.</AbstractNarration>
