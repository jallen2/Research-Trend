    <AbstractNarration>The identification and isolation of genes that lead to adaptation of organisms is a central challenge of modern evolutionary genetics, yet very few adaptive genes have been analyzed at the molecular level. A naturally occurring mutation in the CONSTANS (CO) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana leads to evolutionary adaptation in flowering time. A major goal of this project is to study the origins and spread of this regulatory mutation in natural populations of A. thaliana and to examine the effects of the mutation on CO gene expression. The second goal is to investigate effects of the CO mutation on naturally-occurring mutations in a second gene, FRIGIDA, which acts in a parallel pathway to the CO gene. This research will characterize the functional genetics of an adaptive trait, and examine the role that regulatory change plays in the evolution of a life history trait in Arabidopsis thaliana. All data and biological resources will be made available to the public either through publications or long-term repositories such as ABRC and Genbank&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine how plants adapt to environmental change as well as advance understanding of flowering time, a key trait that is also important in crop adaptation. In addition to training research scientists in molecular genetics and evolution, the project will enhance training in science journalism. Graduate-level journalism students at New York University will join the research team as interns. The journalism students will learn about modern plant genetics while students and postdoctoral researchers in the laboratory will learn how to interact with media professionals.</AbstractNarration>
