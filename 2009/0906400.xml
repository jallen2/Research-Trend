    <AbstractNarration>DSC 2009, an international workshop on Directions in Statistical&lt;br/&gt;Computing, will be held July 13--14, 2009 at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Copenhagen, Denmark. This is the sixth in a series of meetings;&lt;br/&gt;previous meeting were held in Vienna, Austria (1999, 2001, and 2003),&lt;br/&gt;Seattle, WA (2005), and Auckland, New Zealand (2007). The workshop&lt;br/&gt;will focus on, but is not limited to, open source statistical&lt;br/&gt;computing and aims to provide a platform for exchanging ideas about&lt;br/&gt;developments in statistical computing. UseR! 2009 will be held July&lt;br/&gt;8--10 in Rennes, France, and is the fifth in a series of conferences&lt;br/&gt;the use and development statistical methods and software related to&lt;br/&gt;the R system. This proposal is for funding exclusively to provide&lt;br/&gt;support to assist with travel expenses for junior investigators from&lt;br/&gt;US institutions to attend this meeting. Work of young researchers is&lt;br/&gt;often among the most novel, yet often these researchers lack the&lt;br/&gt;travel funds necessary to attend such a conference because they have&lt;br/&gt;not yet established themselves sufficiently to attract external travel&lt;br/&gt;and other funding for their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics is playing an increasingly important role in&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research, and statistical computing is essential as&lt;br/&gt;the means for making new methodology available to researchers and&lt;br/&gt;allowing the best statistical practices to be applied effectively.&lt;br/&gt;Scholarly conferences on statistical computing are an essential&lt;br/&gt;framework for the exchange of ideas and for encouraging the&lt;br/&gt;exploration of new directions in the design of statistical software.&lt;br/&gt;International conferences are particularly valuable as they allow the&lt;br/&gt;exchange of ideas among researchers from around the world who would&lt;br/&gt;not ordinarily come into direct contact. The benefit to young&lt;br/&gt;researchers of a first exposure to the international research&lt;br/&gt;community is particularly important. International meetings also&lt;br/&gt;provide an opportunity to meet with outstanding international graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and encourage them to consider opportunities for further&lt;br/&gt;study in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
