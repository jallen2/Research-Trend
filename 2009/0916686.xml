    <AbstractNarration>Abstract below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphs and networks are a natural representation across a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of disciplines and domains. Statistical tools have recently been&lt;br/&gt;brought to bear on the analysis of graphs, yielding rich dividends in&lt;br/&gt;various application areas. The aim of this project is to use tools&lt;br/&gt;from statistics and graph theory to develop algorithms that generate&lt;br/&gt;similar graphs efficiently. Since graph data is often expensive to&lt;br/&gt;collect, it is desirable to synthetically generate graphs. To be&lt;br/&gt;widely applicable however, the generated graphs need to both preserve&lt;br/&gt;the semantics of the original data (i.e., be drawn from the same&lt;br/&gt;distribution) and be efficient to compute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two key questions form the core emphasis of the current project.&lt;br/&gt;First, how does one measure similarity between two graphs? Second, how&lt;br/&gt;can this notion of similarity be used to generate new graphs? On the&lt;br/&gt;topic of similarity, the project will investigate representations to&lt;br/&gt;preserve global properties, propose new, efficient, representations&lt;br/&gt;for signatures, and explore sampling techniques and their convergence&lt;br/&gt;behavior. On the topic of generation of new graphs, the project will&lt;br/&gt;develop an exponential random graph model using signatures,&lt;br/&gt;investigate feature selection via regularization, propose novel&lt;br/&gt;methods to sample from the exponential random graph model and novel&lt;br/&gt;techniques to produce proposal graphs, and provide rigorous empirical&lt;br/&gt;validation across a range of application areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will facilitate the study of large complex structures of&lt;br/&gt;the kind frequently encountered in domains like theoretical ecology,&lt;br/&gt;social networks, and chemo-informatics, allowing researchers in these&lt;br/&gt;domains to leverage statistical network analysis tools to identify&lt;br/&gt;significant patterns and understand algorithm performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page:&lt;br/&gt;URL: http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~vishy/graphs.html</AbstractNarration>
