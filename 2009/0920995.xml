    <AbstractNarration>Disputants face a variety of options for resolving civil law disputes, including trial, mediation, arbitration, and negotiation. Despite nearly four decades of empirical research on how laypeople perceive and evaluate procedural options, our understanding of the psychology of dispute resolution from the disputant's perspective remains rudimentary due to the striking uniformity of the methodology of past research. First, most field research on how people perceive procedures has surveyed legal actors other than disputants (e.g., lawyers). Moreover, with the exception of just one published study, research has explored the attitudes of actual civil disputants only after they have experienced a procedure, not before. Thus, how civil disputants evaluate their options at the inception of their dispute remains unclear. Moreover, research has failed to investigate perceptions at both the start of the dispute and the end of the dispute to determine whether perceptions for procedures change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research surveys real civil disputants about how they evaluate procedural options for their disputes, both before and after they experience a procedure. This project aims to fill the intellectual gap resulting from the homogeneity in past research: 1) how do disputants evaluate procedural options at the beginning of their dispute?; 2) do their initial preferences for various procedures predict which procedure they ultimately use?; 3) is their ultimate satisfaction with the procedure they use associated with how attractive they initially perceived that procedure? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This kind of comparative analysis is expected to help courts improve their alternative dispute resolution programs. Moreover, to the extent that this research reveals that disputants view procedures differently when they initially consider them as options compared to after having experienced them directly, lawyers will need to consider the pre-experience counseling implications of this phenomenon to minimize post-dispute dissatisfaction.</AbstractNarration>
