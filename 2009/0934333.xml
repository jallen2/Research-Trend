    <AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Wind Energy &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0934321 University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMA); James Manwell &lt;br/&gt;0934333 Old Dominion University Research Foundation (ODU); Larry Atkinson&lt;br/&gt;0934325 James Madison University (JMU); Jonathan Miles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Wind Energy is aimed at enhancing national excellence in wind energy research and development of direct relevance to the industry; and, developing a cadre of diverse undergraduate and graduate students who will support and eventually lead in the design, manufacture, installation, operation, and maintenance of wind energy systems. The academic partners listed above are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UMA as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center is motivated by the possibility of integrating engineering with ocean and atmospheric sciences to support the development of systems with low cost of energy and high reliability. The thrust areas include: oceanography and geology as it relates to preparing wind turbine sites, turbine design, environmental effects, particularly impact on flying wildlife, land use, and system management and integration into the electrical grid. The proposed work has a very good focus on a well-defined area that is of long-term importance to energy generation in the US. The investigators have an excellent background, and will provide the needed expertise to expand the use of wind power for electrical generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work by the proposed Center will make wind energy, particularly off-shore wind energy, more competitive with energy from non-renewable sources. The proposed Center would build on Amherst's wind research program, consolidating all aspects of wind power into a single unit. The Center plans to increase the diversity of participants in wind energy research and industry. Since UMA is the lead institution for the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), the NEAGEP infrastructure will be available to the proposed I/UCRC. ODU has strong research and academic ties with Hampton University and Norfolk State University, both designated as HBCUs. The long standing collaborations with these universities will be leveraged to promote the participation of minority students in wind energy projects.</AbstractNarration>
