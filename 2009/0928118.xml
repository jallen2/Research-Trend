    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to investigate the static and dynamic characteristics of magnetically actuated compliant micromanipulators and to realize innovative design and advanced control, enabling multi-axis scanning of three-dimensional micrometer/nanometer objects. The proposed approaches consist of three phases. First, static and dynamic models of the compliant manipulator will be developed and multi-axis magnetic actuation will be analyzed. The aim is to enable rational design and characterization of multi-axis probing systems. Second, advanced control schemes will be developed to enable multi-axis scanning of three-dimensional objects. The multi-axis scanning scheme can operate at contact mode as well as tapping mode. Third, a two-axis scanning probe microscopic system will be realized. Compared to other attempts to achieve greater access to three-dimensional samples, which use specialized probes and require a priori knowledge of the pose and nominal geometry of the sample, the two-axis scanning probe microscopic system can be employed to scan three-dimensional objects with unknown geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon successful completion, technological innovations created from this award will open up important new research applications in manufacturing. Compared to conventional scanning probe microscopes, which are two-dimensional planar tools, the two-axis scanning probe microscopic system is a three-dimensional surface tool. It represents a transformational change in how scanning probe microscopy can be used in ultra precision manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
