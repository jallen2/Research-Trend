    <AbstractNarration>0902139&lt;br/&gt;McGoron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the 25th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC) to be held May 15-17, 2009 in Miami FL (hosted by Florida International University). The SBEC aims to assemble students, researchers, clinicians, and industry leaders in Biomedical Engineering to disseminate information in this rapidly growing field. The SBEC will provide a multidisciplinary, educational forum for discussing new ideas and future concepts in the field of Biomedical Engineering. The SBEC serves a special purpose of encouraging student participation by providing opportunities for students to present their research through a student paper competition. In keeping with the emphasis on student participation, the SBEC also plans to present student awards based on performances in both paper competitions and presentations. Additionally, this project will sponsor student registration fees and publication support. Due to the venue's location, the conference is expected to have higher Hispanic and Latino student participation. The conference will be of great educational benefit and will inspire junior researchers and students within the Biomedical Engineering field. This meeting will also promote the interaction among US and South and Central American scientists to impact the region and the nation.</AbstractNarration>
