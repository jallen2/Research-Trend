    <AbstractNarration>IP 0934138&lt;br/&gt;University of Florida&lt;br/&gt;Jokela&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Florida (UF) is seeking to join the existing multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled the "Center for Advanced Forestry Systems" (CAFS) which was established in 2007, and now includes the following institutions: North Carolina State University (lead university), Oregon State University, Purdue University, Virginia Tech, University of Maine, University of Washington, and the University of Georgia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UF's expertise, resources and proposed projects will complement and expand upon those represented by current CAFS institutions. UF will build upon and expand the CAFS efforts by providing additional and specialized expertise in the areas of genetics, physiology, silviculture, soils, and modeling. The proposed projects from UF will augment and complement current CAFS projects in the broad areas of production ecology and scaling important genotypic and phenotypic growth traits from the molecular to the whole plant and stand level. Collectively, UF will contribute to the overall goals and needs of the US forestry sector by providing scientific and technological advances to enhance their competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort at UF has the potential to improve the competitiveness of the forest products industry and forest landowners through advances in technology development, through dissemination of research results in scientific, peer reviewed journals, and enhanced technology transfer between Center scientists, industry members and the US citizenry. UF plans to recruit graduate students from under-represented groups, and enhance the interaction between research and teaching activities. UF is also committed to the principle of diversity in the projects and the various activities under this program.</AbstractNarration>
