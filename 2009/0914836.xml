    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Rojkovskaia, Natalia &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0914836 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Kansas State University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Graduate Research Conference in Algebra and Representation Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second Graduate Research Conference in Algebra and Representation Theory will be hosted by Kansas State University (Manhattan) at the end of the Spring semester, 2009. The dates of the event are May 23-May 25, 2009. The conference features two one-hour lectures by keynote speakers in the fields of algebra and representation theory. The rest of the talks will be 20/40 minutes in length and will be presented by graduate students. The organization of the conference is also taken by graduate students from the hosting university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics of the conference cover interactions between algebra and representation theory, in particular, ring theory, commutative algebra and its applications to algebraic geometry, homology theory, representations of finite groups, Hecke algebras, algebraic groups, quantum groups, Lie algebras, vertex operator algebras. One of the main goals of the conference is to increase the interaction of graduate students from different universities. The participants will communicate on the research progress, develop presentational skills, get aquainted with future collegues and find the connections for future collaboration. Women and minorities are encouraged to particiapte in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
