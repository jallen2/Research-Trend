    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even in the US, many regions suffer poor Internet connectivity, due to&lt;br/&gt;high prices, capacity limitations, poor infrastructure, or low&lt;br/&gt;population density. Rural communities may be underserved because of&lt;br/&gt;DSL distance limits and the high cost of bringing fiber optic cable to&lt;br/&gt;low-density regions. Even when businesses or schools can be connected&lt;br/&gt;by DSL, its capacity limits may still provide poor end-user experience&lt;br/&gt;when many people share the connection. This research is addressing these&lt;br/&gt;problems by using intelligent software to enhance network&lt;br/&gt;connectivity. By aggressive data caching and off-peak prefetching,&lt;br/&gt;data can be stored on disk and retrieved locally instead of always&lt;br/&gt;being fetched from the Internet. For environments with many users,&lt;br/&gt;this system can reduce bandwidth consumption by an order of magnitude,&lt;br/&gt;providing higher effective end-user bandwidth, or allow cost&lt;br/&gt;reductions by purchasing less wide-area bandwidth. The expected&lt;br/&gt;outcome of this research is an open-source system that can be deployed&lt;br/&gt;at Internet gateways, which will transparently improve network&lt;br/&gt;performance. Possible locations include schools, small businesses, and&lt;br/&gt;Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In schools, when a classroom full&lt;br/&gt;of students accesses a topic, only one copy is downloaded, and&lt;br/&gt;the rest get it from the cache. For news sites that update during the&lt;br/&gt;day, only the changed portions get downloaded, instead of whole&lt;br/&gt;articles. Prefetching will also reduce latency, by determining user&lt;br/&gt;patterns and preloading content before it is needed.</AbstractNarration>
