    <AbstractNarration>0933563&lt;br/&gt;Ferraris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports the work by Professor John P. Ferraris, Kenneth J. Balkus, Jr., and Inga H. Musselman at the University of Texas at Dallas to design, fabricate and test mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for gas separations. This project will utilize novel materials that simultaneously target selected separations and provide improved interfacial contact with the polymer matrix. We have discovered that high loadings of nanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in polymers can provide the long sought after breakthrough technology. MOFs offer some of the highest surface areas ever reported as well as the selective adsorption of gases involved in industrially important separations including CO2, CH4, O2, and N2. Many of these metal-organic frameworks have exceptional thermal and chemical stability such that MOFs could be competitive with zeolites for commercial separations. This novel class of materials has enabled us to fabricate MMMs with unprecedented loadings [&gt;80% (w/w)], which we believe is the key to finally realizing the promise of mixed-matrix membranes for gas separations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project on energy and the environment include numerous tasks that will lead to the integration of research and multilevel education in the area of membrane science and novel nanomaterials. The success of this potentially high impact research effort will lead to significant benefits to society including replacement of energy-intensive separations with membranes resulting in both energy and economic savings. A strong educational component will coincide with the research activities that will engage students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels as well as students from underrepresented groups and women. The skills acquired by students during this project will enhance their preparation for careers in membrane engineering, nanotechnology, energy, and materials science. In addition to seminars and course development on membranes and their applications, we seek to engage students at all levels in the study of membranes and nanomaterials. We are also committed to high school student research experiences through a number of summer programs and anticipate that this project will also impact the community at large by educating our high school teachers and students.</AbstractNarration>
