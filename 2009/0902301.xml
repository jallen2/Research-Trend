    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Hugh M Sharp, a 146 foot Regional research vessel operated by the University of Delaware as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The request includes two items listed by priority:&lt;br/&gt; 1) Replacement CTD Frame&lt;br/&gt; 2) Network Upgrades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. The addition of the water sampling equipment that was damaged as well as the upgrading of the computer systems will enhance the research effectiveness of the coastal vessel R/V Sharp.</AbstractNarration>
