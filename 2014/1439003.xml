    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul D. Ronney&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day workshop (July31 - August 1, 2014) will be held at the Stanford University campus with experts from around the country to address the research needs for basic combustion and reacting flows. The proposed Workshop is a "grass roots" activity that is intentionally not affiliated with or sponsored by any institution other than NSF, so that the Grand Challenges will be chosen independent of whether the research required to address these Challenges is within the interests of any particular organization or funding agency, thus preserving the fundamental nature of the issues and research needs that will be identified. The participants will be selected from the combustion research community and the target audience for the outcomes of the Workshop is the combustion research community itself.</AbstractNarration>
