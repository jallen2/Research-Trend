    <AbstractNarration>Formal methods have made significant advances during the last decade, and now form the backbone &lt;br/&gt;of formal assurance across hardware and software industries. Underlying many of these techniques &lt;br/&gt;is the capability to effectively reason about system properties, often by describing the properties &lt;br/&gt;as constraint satisfaction problems and delegating the reasoning to a constraint solver. The most &lt;br/&gt;common constraint reasoning engines in use today are satisfiability (modulo theories) solvers (SAT &lt;br/&gt;and SMT). As a rapidly developing field, there is a lack of highly trained users and researchers &lt;br/&gt;that will sustain and further advance the field. The SAT/SMT summer school addresses this issue by &lt;br/&gt;familiarizing young researchers with cutting-edge solver technologies and their applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SAT/SMT summer school addresses this issue by familiarizing young researchers with cutting-edge solver &lt;br/&gt;technologies and their applications. The lecturers at the school are world-renown experts, and the three day &lt;br/&gt;gathering gives the students the opportunity to discuss the lecture topics, their own research, and the &lt;br/&gt;challenges and future directions with these experts. The material is covered rigorously, with depth and breadth, &lt;br/&gt;but at a pace appropriate for a student audience, making the school a unique place for disseminating new research &lt;br/&gt;to the future users and researchers.</AbstractNarration>
