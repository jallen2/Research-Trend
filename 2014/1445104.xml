    <AbstractNarration>To prepare the country's youth more broadly for a globalized world, the U.S. National Commission on Mathematics Instruction (USNCMI) will engage with the international community and assist in improving the state of mathematics education in the country by implementing international education programs, participating in international benchmarking activities, and working closely with other countries and multilateral organizations. As a commission of the Board of International Scientific Organizations, the USNCMI serves as the liaison to the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI), representing the U.S. mathematics education community abroad while learning about the world's best mathematics educational practices. Through a series of local and international activities over the course of three years, the USNCMI will achieve the following goals: (1) advance the U.S. position in the international mathematics education community through continued engagement, leveraging the U.S. strength in research; (2) create opportunities for educators in the U.S. to learn from promising practices in other countries and engage with mathematics educators internationally; and, (3) communicate findings from Goals 1 and 2 to the mathematics education community and policymakers in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USNCMI provides the vehicle through which the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reaches out to, and coordinates international activities with, the U.S. mathematics education community. Further, it takes advantage of the NAS network to disseminate its national and international interests, activities, and products. The USNCMI will continue to provide effective international representation and participation in meetings that involve learning and sharing the world's best practices in mathematics education. The primary activities of the USNCMI over the next three years are as follows: (1) Participate in ICMI leadership meetings, which provide vision and mission for fostering efforts to improve the quality of mathematics teaching and learning worldwide; (2) Participate in the influential ICMI Studies, which is a document that addresses how to better understand and resolve the challenges that face multidisciplinary and culturally diverse research and development in mathematics education; (3) Provide support for a strong U.S. representation at the next ICMI Congress (ICME-13) and the General Assembly in 2016, which foster collaboration, exchange, and dissemination of ideas and information involving the theory and practice of contemporary mathematical education; (4) Support the U.S. bid to host ICME-14 in Hawaii in 2020, an international meeting that develops a scientific program addressing various aspects of mathematics education; (5) Host and facilitate the U.S.-Finland Workshop, which will discuss current mathematics education policies and best practices in the U.S. and Finland; (6) Hold the Park City Mathematics Institute International Seminar, which invites scholars from different countries to discuss viewpoints and other relevant issues related to mathematics education; and, (7) Disseminate opportunities and products of the USNCMI and ICMI to the U.S. mathematics education community.</AbstractNarration>
