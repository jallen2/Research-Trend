    <AbstractNarration>Cells are the basis of our whole bodies, and also communicate with each other. Therefore, cells contain many lessons about populations, change, and adaptations. Developing an artificial cell product that gains entrance into the classrooms of students will benefit their learning and provide expanded choices of teaching tools. More advance artificial cell platforms may impact applied and basic research sectors by also providing expanded choices for looking at dynamic processes. This project aims to commercialize artificial (manufactured) cells and cell platforms for educational, research, and industry needs. The technology will include the use of 3D printers to make these artificial cells, since these printers are becoming increasingly available and cost-effective for construction purposes. The technology developed in this project will be paired with educational and visualization software so that the artificial cells will provide hands-on experiments and testing to students, assisted by the software learning tools. Due to the complex nature and cost of living cells, this artificial cell technology is needed to cost-effectively teach students the dynamics of cellular processes and at the same time let them carry out experiments and test ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technological components of this project will utilize 3D printers to make artificial cells that are hollow and structured to allow for visualization and testing of the dynamic processes of cells in aqueous environments. Plastics will be the initial materials base, since they can be 3D printed, but other materials will also be incorporated into the platforms such as dyes and chemicals that will define the dynamic processes. The artificial cell kits will also include instructional and experimental software based on "predator-prey" and other dynamic processes that will guide experimentation and testing. Constructed artificial cells will be generated initially that are large enough to be held and visualized with digital cameras without the need of microscopes. Future generations of artificial cells will include dynamic processes for more advanced testing to include fluorescence- and microscopy- based measurements. Ultimately a technology "library" of artificial cells and cell components is envisioned for learning and research tools.</AbstractNarration>
