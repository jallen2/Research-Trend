    <AbstractNarration>This REAL project arises from the 2013 solicitation on Data-intensive Research to Improve Teaching and Learning. The intention of that effort is to bring together researchers from across disciplines to foster novel, transformative, multidisciplinary approaches to using the data in large education-related data sets to create actionable knowledge for improving STEM teaching and learning environments in the medium term and to revolutionize learning in the longer term. This project addresses the issue of how to represent and communicate data to young people so that they can track their learning and weaknesses and take advantage of what they learn through that tracking. The project team aims to address this challenge by giving young people (middle schoolers) the tools and support to create, manipulate, analyze, and share representations of their own understanding, capabilities, and participation within the Scratch environment. Scratch is a programming language and online community in which youngsters (mostly middle schoolers) engage in programming together, sometimes to make scientific models and sometimes to express themselves artistically using sophisticated computer algorithms. Scratch community participants are often interested in keeping track of what they are learning, so this population is a good one for exploring ways of helping young people make sense of data that records their participation and learning. The team will extend the Scratch programming language with facilities for manipulating, analyzing, and representing such data, and Scratch participants will be challenged to make sense of their learning and participation data and helped to use the new facilities to do write programs to carry out such interpretation. Scratch participants will become visualizers of their participation patterns and learning trajectories; research will address how such data explorations influence their learning trajectories. Scratch and its community are the place for the proposed investigations, but what is learned will apply far more broadly to construction of tools for allowing learners to understand their participation and learning across a broad range of environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the sixth challenge in the program solicitation: how can information extracted from large datasets be represented and communicated to maximize its usefulness in real-time educational stings, and what delivery mechanisms are right for that? The PIs go right to the learners; rather than looking for delivery mechanisms for communicating the data representations, they give young people tools and support to create manipulate, analyze, and share those representations, bringing together approaches to quantitative evidence-based learning analytics with the constructionist tradition of learning through design experiences. In addition to helping us learn about how to help youngsters analyze data about their perforance and self-assess, the PIs expect that their endeavor will help us better learn how to help young people become data analyzers, an important part of computational thinking. Learners will, in the process of engaging with data representing their development and participation, interact with visualizations, model and troubleshoot data sets, and search for patterns in large data sets. In addition, the tools being developed as part of this project will be applicable for analysis of other types of data sets. The results that will transfer beyond Scratch and the Scratch community, are (1) the kinds of tools that make such analysis possible for youngsters, (2) the kinds of challenges that will get youngsters interested in doing such analyses, (3) the kinds of data youngsters can handle, and (4) the kinds of scaffolding and coaching youngsters need to make sense of that data.</AbstractNarration>
