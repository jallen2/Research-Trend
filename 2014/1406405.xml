    <AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology and semiconductor manufacturing industries are undergoing continued expansion in the Northeast. An example of this expansion is the recent announcement by New York Governor Cuomo that six leading global technology companies are investing $1.5 billion to develop "Nano Utica", the state's second major hub of nanotechnology research and development, spearheaded by the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) and the State University of New York Institute of Technology (SUNYIT), creating over 1,000 new high-tech jobs. A highly qualified technical workforce is needed to continue to support the growth of the nanotechnology and semiconductor manufacturing industries in New York State and Western New England. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Northeast Advanced Technological Education Center (NEATEC) will support the industry workforce needs. NEATEC partners include GlobalFoundries, IBM, General Electric, SEMATECH, Hudson Valley Community College (HVCC), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), CNSE, SUNYIT, Mohawk Valley Community College (MVCC), Fulton Montgomery Community College (FMCC), SUNY Adirondack, regional K-12, and additional community colleges in NY, VT, MA, and CT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEATEC will implement and enable (1) the expansion of cutting-edge semiconductor and nanotechnology related AAS/AS degree programs among its community college partners, (2) on-the-job co-op and internship-based training, (3) distance learning options and just-in-time education, (4) K-12 career pathway development, (5) the coordination of student recruitment, and (6) research studies on emerging workforce trends and education needs. The Center will improve community college student learning in science and engineering by providing a broader range of students access to the educational materials, facilities and faculty of several premier U.S. science and engineering schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation and assessment plans will inform the wider community about the effectiveness of materials developed in educating a qualified entry-level technical workforce, the knowledge transfer from the center to partner institutions, the performance of program graduates in the field, and the value of the collaborative partnerships established.</AbstractNarration>
