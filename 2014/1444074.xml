    <AbstractNarration>PI: Barabino, Gilda &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1444074&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Biomedical Engineering Society&lt;br/&gt;2014 Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)-National Science Foundation (NSF) Special Session in San Antonio, TX on Oct 23-25, 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding to support travel for students, postdoctoral fellows, early career faculty and professionals, inclusive of underrepresented groups and accessible to persons with disabilities, to participate in a BMES-NSF Special Session planned for the 2014 Biomedical Engineering Society Annual Meeting. The 2014 BMES Annual Meeting will be held in San Antonio, Texas, from October 23-25, 2014, and it will feature 19 parallel technical Program Tracks focused on the overall theme of ?Bioengineering Innovations to Catalyze Affordable Health Care.? The BMES Annual Meeting serves as a primary vehicle for scientific sharing and dissemination of the latest advances in biomedical engineering, as well as a facilitator of important cross-fertilizations between the life sciences and engineering technologies, which fosters a multi-disciplinary approach in the practice of Biomedical Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BMES-NSF Special Session in particular builds on the success of a similar session held for the first time during the 2013 BMES Annual Meeting in Seattle, WA. That session effectively increased awareness of NSF-funded research in the area of Biomedical Engineering and allowed investigators to gain a better understanding of NSF funding opportunities and how to prepare successful grant applications. The session also allowed for effective and in-depth interactions among attendees, NSF awardees and NSF program officers who attended the session. The objectives of the session planned for the 2014 Annual BMES Meeting are to 1) showcase NSF funded research and researchers, especially young investigators with CAREER awards; 2) foster collaboration and idea sharing through a networking reception; and 3) familiarize participants with NSF and NSF funding mechanisms and provide insight into strategies for preparing competitive grant proposals. It is expected that this session will recur on an annual basis to contribute to a comprehensive approach by BMES in partnership with NSF to ensure development of a diverse, well educated, and technically competent biomedical engineering workforce.</AbstractNarration>
