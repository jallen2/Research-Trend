    <AbstractNarration>This proposal from the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) includes two workshops for early-career women, the first at the Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM) in San Antonio, January 10-13, 2015, and the second at the SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) in Salt Lake City, March 14-18, 2015. It also includes a named lectureship, the Emmy Noether Lecture, to be held at the San Antonio JMM meeting. The workshops are designed to create sustainable networks, encourage mentoring relationships, and promote research collaborations in key fields of mathematics. The Noether Lecture highlights outstanding contributions by a female mathematician and provides an inspiring role model to more junior women. As such, these events address some of the key issues that frequently inhibit women's participation in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each workshop will focus on an area of mathematics of current interest. The 2015 AWM-JMM workshop will focus on homotopy theory. Homotopy theory, an area of algebraic topology, has close ties to algebraic geometry, geometric topology, number theory, representation theory, and mathematical physics. It is a highly active area and has seen significant progress in recent years. The 2015 AWM-SIAM workshop will focus on mathematical modeling and high-performance computing for multiphysics and multiscale problems. Advances in science and engineering - in disciplines ranging from health to energy and the environment to defense - rely on predictive measurement and analysis of multiscale multiphysics systems. Topics to be addressed at the workshop include physical modeling, mathematical analysis, numerical analysis, algorithms, implementation, performance, and scalability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/workshops</AbstractNarration>
