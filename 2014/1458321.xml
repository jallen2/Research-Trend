    <AbstractNarration>Northern Arizona University Yuma branch campus (NAU-Yuma) has received an NSF Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award for their project entitled Supporting Educational Endeavors for Degrees in Science (SEEDS). The school, a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution, was founded in 1988 and is the only STEM bachelor degree granting institution directly serving southwestern Arizona and is a transfer institution by design. SEEDS will identify and recruit 30 promising, underrepresented, and financially-needy students seeking to study Biology and Environmental Sciences into NAU-Yuma. The project will actively recruit STEM-oriented students from the region, including graduates of nearby 2-year community colleges in Yuma and Imperial, California. Students enrolled through SEEDS will benefit from extended student services including: tutoring in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and writing; comprehensive advising; a cohort-based learning environment; learning outside the classroom; and preparation for relevant post-graduate pursuits such as graduate school or STEM-based employment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEEDS scholars will complete upper division coursework, obtaining baccalaureate degrees, and will be competitively prepared for relevant employment or graduate school. The project's four objectives are to broaden opportunities for university access to underrepresented and financially needy students, to enhance high quality, comprehensive STEM learning, to increase student success, retention, and graduation through student services, and to improve student advancement to relevant employment or graduate school. Career placement services will include institutional support for placement in internships and/or STEM research experiences, paid travel to a job fair, and use of career advising services. SEEDS assessment and evaluation will be comprehensive and ongoing and will be designed to improve student support. The project external evaluator will use both formative and summative evaluations to assess student progress to degree, participation in project activities, and graduation rates. Particular emphasis will be placed on the surveys to assess and improve the elements of the program that include the design and delivery of academic content, resources that enhance student learning, and services that promote success after graduation. The data gathered will inform the larger undergraduate STEM education enterprise's understanding of the resources needed by students to overcome barriers faced in the transfer from a two-year institution to a four-year school and and of the type of academic and co-curricular support that will enable them to complete a B.S. and be prepared for the STEM workforce or graduate school.</AbstractNarration>
