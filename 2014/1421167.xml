    <AbstractNarration>Computer systems are exceedingly complicated, and a major challenge is&lt;br/&gt;verifying that they are correct in all situations. Hardware industry&lt;br/&gt;accordingly spends more effort on verification than it does on actual&lt;br/&gt;design, yet functional design bugs still exist in today's computer&lt;br/&gt;systems, including shipped processor chips from major vendors. This&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to overcome this verification challenge through a&lt;br/&gt;verification-aware design methodology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project designs systems such that they can be verified with existing &lt;br/&gt;formal verification methodologies, rather than expecting arbitrary designs &lt;br/&gt;to be verifiable. Rather than design a system and then try to verify it, &lt;br/&gt;the proposed philosophy is to understand the capabilities of existing verification &lt;br/&gt;methodologies and then try to design the best possible systems that are compatible&lt;br/&gt;with these methodologies. In this work, the verification is performed &lt;br/&gt;with existing verification tools and the innovation is in the design. &lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of this work is the development of computer systems, &lt;br/&gt;or portions thereof, that are formally verified and thus provably correct &lt;br/&gt;in all cases.</AbstractNarration>
