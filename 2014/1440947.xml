    <AbstractNarration>The College of St. Scholastica proposes to develop, implement, and evaluate TeachIT-CSP, a CS10K project designed to provide computer science education professional development to high school teachers throughout the nation. This project will adapt the Mobile Computer Science Principles (Mobile CSP) curriculum developed by Trinity College and offer it to teachers via a summer online course, complemented by ongoing online mentoring and support during the school year. TeachIT-CSP will scale the Mobile CSP professional development to reach at least 180 teachers over three years, and possibly many more. The planned online format will be particularly helpful in allowing teachers from rural and underfunded schools to participate in professional development and a supportive learning community, as they achieve mastery of new teaching content and methods. This project will prepare participants to teach the Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) curriculum in their classrooms and provide support to them in this process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TeachIT-CSP goals include (1) bringing teacher professional development to scale with an engaging and effective open online course that focuses on computer science concepts using Mobile CSP curriculum, (2) providing pedagogical support to help teachers incorporate best practices that improve student learning outcomes in computer science and support underrepresented populations, and (3) developing an open and sharable repository of video exemplars of computer science teachers demonstrating evidence-based practices. The evaluation will compare results between online and face-to-face PD focusing on the significant areas identified by the Mobile CSP project and the CSP framework. The project will evaluate teacher performance using videos and teacher reflections instead of classroom observations. An external evaluator will adapt surveys for use with teachers engaged in online PD.</AbstractNarration>
