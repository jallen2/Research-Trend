    <AbstractNarration>This project will integrate data from multiple sources to permit researchers to examine how various factors such as environmental change and human behavior impacted food resources over a period spanning almost 7,000 years. The research is important and relevant today for several reasons. Faunal data in the form of recovered animal, bird and fish remains provide a valuable tool for understanding human - environment interactions but different data sets can be extremely difficult to integrate because of the varying ways in which they are collected and the varying factors which affect recovery of bone. This project will develop techniques which are generalizable and which can be applied to both prehistoric and recent data. The long term perspective adopted here and which archaeology allows, opens the door to understanding processes which may play out slowly and are not discernable over shorter time intervals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers involved in this project will explore how people living in the forested regions of interior Eastern North American variously used fish, freshwater mussels and waterfowl between approximately 10,000-3,000 years ago during a period known to archaeologists as the Archaic Period. After 7,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers living in some interior Eastern locales intensively utilized these kinds of aquatic animals, while in other places these resources were never heavily utilized. This project's unprecedented integration of faunal data sets, generated by significant archaeological projects over the last half century, will allow analyses at multiple scales and provide insight into the causes of the increased use of aquatic animals in the diets of Archaic hunter-gatherers, as well as contribute to current theoretical debates in archaeology. It also will make significant data on past animal populations and their exploitation by humans available to scientists interested in environmental change, biodiversity and other fields as well as to other archaeologists. Through the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, the creation of a publicly accessible teaching module for undergraduate students as well as public lectures, a magazine article, and an online exhibit about the project at the Illinois State Museum, this project will engage the broader audience, acquainting them with the nature and significance of these zooarchaeological data and what they reveal about the North American past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temporal and spatial variability during the Archaic traditionally has been attributed to environmental diversity and to climatic and other environmental change. Recent challenges argue that this traditional, ecological perspective is outdated, has arrested theoretical development, and has prevented archaeologists from considering the role of cultural or ethnic identities, sociopolitical interactions, and ritual practices in Archaic hunter-gatherer lifeways and in related structuring of archaeological remains. These challenges can be addressed using the datasets collected by this project. At least nineteen extant faunal databases and nearly 280,000 specimens will be preserved in tDAR (the Digital Archaeological Record; http://tdar.org ), an international repository for digital data, images, and documents that provides open access and includes integrative tools for analysis. The record of animal utilization can be studied in detail at local, sub-regional, and regional scales providing perspective on the correlation between environmental, demographic, and cultural variables across time and space. Through the creation of an Eastern Faunal Working Group (EAFWG) of zooarchaeologists who have analyzed key Archaic Period faunal datasets, we will involve knowledgeable specialists in data preservation and integration, explore the comparability of these datasets, and foster methodological and theoretical collaboration. Not only will this project overcome the limitation of current syntheses by using each researcher's original dataset, it also will transform disparate variables into shared classificatory schema without changing the original databases. Thus, this approach will model efficient data integration at multiple scales for other zooarchaeologists, archaeologists and other researchers.</AbstractNarration>
