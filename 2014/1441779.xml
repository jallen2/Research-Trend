    <AbstractNarration>Smith-1441779.&lt;br/&gt;Title: Travel support for U.S. students to attend the 4th International Palaeontological Congress&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funded by NSF Office of International and Integrative Global Venture Fund and NSF Sedimentary Geology &amp; Paleobiology Program &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support for the international travel of 15 US graduate students to attend the Fourth International Palaeontological Congress (4th IPC) in Mendoza, Argentina from 28 September ? 3 October 2014. It is expected that more than 500 professional paleontologists from around the globe will attend the 4th IPC. Students selected to receive travel support will be chosen from across the subfields of paleontology, ensuring that a diverse group of students have the opportunity to attend and present their research results. In addition to sharing their own research, the meeting will provide opportunities for participants to explore new research directions and debate topics with specialists from across the globe. There will be a combination of plenary lectures, symposia on leading issues, interactive workshops, technical sessions and short courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Paleontology is a vibrant discipline that includes such currently relevant topics as the origin and evolution of life, the response of biotas to environmental perturbations, extinction and the nature of preservation of fossil data. It is a completely interdisciplinary field of study that includes researchers from biology, sedimentary geology, stratigraphy, geochronology, geochemistry, and modeling. The STEPPE coordinating office, in collaboration with the Geological Society of America, the Paleobotanical Section of the Botanical Society of America, the Paleontological Society, the Society for Sedimentary Geology-SEPM and the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology will read and evaluate undergraduate and graduate student applications, ensuring that there is equal representation from across the societies? disciplines and that there is balance in terms of gender and participation by those from underrepresented groups. Student participation in the 4th IPC meeting will uniquely contribute to the geological and biological sciences because it will bring together global paleontologists, of all career stages, to share their research methods, findings and experiences in the field. This will lead to new opportunities for collaboration and the creation of novel approaches to studying our world.</AbstractNarration>
