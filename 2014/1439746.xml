    <AbstractNarration>The Howard University Science Teacher Certification Program (HU-STCP) in collaboration with Prince George's Community College will address the national need for more underrepresented STEM talent who pursue careers in teaching. This capacity building project specifically strives to improve science teaching and learning among minority students in both college and K-12 settings. The intended outcomes of the HU-STCP capacity building program design include: (1) the implementation of a teacher certification program that prepares highly qualified biology and chemistry teachers (2) coursework that emphasizes creative pedagogical practices that emphasize authentic science instructions and (3) early field work opportunities. The impact of the HU-STCP capacity building project will grow the number of minority STEM educators in urban school systems as well as the collaborations between universities, school districts, and STEM professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of capacity building project include (1) development of new courses and teacher certification requirements for a one-year intensive teacher certification program, and (2) development of recruitment and retention plans that prepare post-baccalaureate candidates for teacher licensure in the fields of biology and/or chemistry. The HU-STCP project will use inquiry and problem-based learning approaches to engage teacher candidates in promoting critical thinking, problem solving, and collaborative skills needed to conduct authentic, scientific learning experiences in urban classrooms. Inquiry and problem-based learning approaches will provide a framework to convert traditional classroom activities into unique science related experiences for minority students in an urban K-12 educational setting. In addition, this project will further explore the relationship and affects between teacher knowledge, quality instruction, and student achievement in science. The HU-STCP project combines a mix of quantitative and qualitative data in formative and summative assessments to measure outcomes, lessons learned and effective strategies that emerge during the capacity building period.</AbstractNarration>
