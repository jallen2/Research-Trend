    <AbstractNarration>Computation in all its definitions (Computer Science, Computing, Computational Thinking, etc.) is becoming increasingly significant in STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Historically, Mathematics has been the discipline seen as required by all other disciplines. Computer Science faculty are wrestling with determining whether there is a single approach to infusing computation in other disciplines or whether there are many approaches. Coupled with the increased computational ability of students in other disciplines, it is known that interdisciplinary courses are more appealing to underrepresented groups. Ideally, the Computer Science community would be provided with a set of validated approaches to interdisciplinary education. In order to reach this goal, the community must investigate the educational value of various approaches. This workshop seeks to begin cataloging experiences to attain that goal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative proposal a number of PIs from different college level institutions (research university, technology focused university, four-year engineering college, and four-year liberal arts college) will cooperate on holding a workshop where a number of different approaches to cross-disciplinary education will be investigated. This workshop will gather a number of faculty who have attempted such courses. The outcome will be a report that outlines approaches to computational interdisciplinary courses. This report will be made widely available.</AbstractNarration>
