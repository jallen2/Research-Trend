    <AbstractNarration>Researchers propose to develop software for determining the extent of flooding following dam or levee failure. In current models and software, flows are assumed to be one-dimensional flows, which is not valid for natural channels (especially those with flood plains), and the dam is assumed to fail instantaneously, which is not true on real-life projects. Therefore, the results computed may not be accurate and the resulting plans are unreliable. The research team has developed numerical procedures for two-dimensional dam-break flows and compared the computed and experimental results. Small and large scale laboratory tests on gradual failure of dams are being conducted. The proposed software will be user-friendly, utilize state-of-the-art numerical procedures, allow interactive data input and provide options for graphical output and can be used by authorities and consulting engineering firms to develop emergency preparedness plans for possible dam and levee failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the Teton Dam Failure in 1976, all the owners of high dams have been mandated by the US Federal Government to prepare emergency plans for possible dam failure. The proposed innovation can be utilized to simulate flooding resulting from accidental dam and levee failures and planned levee breach to mitigate flood hazards. The proposed model can be used to prepare emergency plans for a catastrophic flooding event and save a significant amount of money and lives and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Preventative measures need to be taken to develop a better estimate of a dam or levee failure flow and our software can provide inundation maps of potential flooded areas for the development of emergency action plans by dam owners and first responders. An extended version of the model will be suitable for simulating flood flows from rainstorm and snowmelt, failure of other hydraulic structures, avalanches and mud flows, and simulation of possible geomorphic environmental impacts.</AbstractNarration>
