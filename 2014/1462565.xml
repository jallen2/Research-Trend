    <AbstractNarration>Telemedicine allows healthcare providers to connect with patients across distances while electronic health records enhance the portability and accessibility of patients' medical histories. Telemedicine is recognized as a method to drive down cost while improving efficiency, quality of care, and patient satisfaction. The use of telemedicine has spread rapidly in the past decade and is now becoming integrated into several sectors of healthcare industry including hospitals, specialty departments, home health agencies, private physician offices as well as consumers' homes and workplaces. Despite all of the innovative products within the telemedicine market today, significant barriers remain including physician acceptance, cost, and integration into health delivery. In this proposal, the team is proposing the development of a completely remote Virtual Physical Examination (VPE) system, a type of telemedicine platform. The proposed VPE platform is an innovative tool that acquires and collects the visual and audio as well as the cardiac examination data of the patients and transfers it securely to a database to be stored for future access. The VPE app can be distributed to multiple technicians including nurses, aides, family members, or primary care providers, creating a rich network of opportunities to participate in telemedicine with improved integration of quality care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed VPE offers convenient and cost effective delivery of care in diverse environments opening new patient markets and enhancing patient satisfaction. The novel software solution will also expand access of care providers to underserved communities. The system is comprised of a digital processing device connected to a computer network comprised of a computer readable storage device and an operating system configured to perform executable instructions. The prototype has been developed and optimized to function on diverse Android devices. The computer program provides executable instructions to create a remote VPE system. The software module efficiently directs a technician to electronically record a complete physical examination in a stepwise fashion that can be comprehensive or focused by a health care professional. The Android app provides technicians with complete visual and auditory instructions on how to properly perform the VPE based upon anatomic landmarks and can incorporate exam maneuvers.</AbstractNarration>
