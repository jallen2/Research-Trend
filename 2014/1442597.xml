    <AbstractNarration>Predicting future distributions of plants on Earth is an urgent and daunting challenge, given the combined effects of climate change and invasive species, along with the fact that science does not fully understand how ecological and evolutionary processes interact across large areas. Southwestern white pine (SWP), a tree that occurs naturally from northern Arizona through central Mexico, is the focus of this project. Understanding its future depends on understanding biological processes at the molecular level, including the movement of genes, adaptations to disease and drought, and other heritable changes, interact in a changing environment interact to govern its overall success. But in addition, sustainability of SWP is threatened by a non-native tree disease called white pine blister rust. This project will develop tools to help forecast and manage the future of SWP, including genomic analyses, common garden trials where seedlings originating from different environments are planted together, screening for disease resistance, engineering and technology innovation to measure drought tolerance, and computer modeling that can integrate landscape ecology and genomics. The approach will also provide a prototype for forecasting complex system behavior that is more generally applicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will contribute to the conservation of SWP and the ecosystems in which it occurs. White pine blister rust causes widespread tree decline and mortality in western North America, including the rapidly expanding area where it overlaps with SWP. It is quite possible that the climate will change too rapidly for SWP to adapt, causing widespread tree death and potential extinction. To help reach its goals, this project will also involve a number of educational and outreach activities, including exhibits and real common garden plantings at Flagstaff Arboretum in Arizona and the U.S. Forest Service Dorena Genetic Resource Center in Cottage Grove, Oregon. A number of postdoctoral scholars and graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and participate in interdisciplinary science that bridges genomics, tree disease resistance testing, landscape ecology, modeling, engineering, remote sensing, and spatial analysis. An outreach website and content will be developed in English and Spanish to provide results to the public, including land managers. Postdoctoral researchers will collaborate on a workshop for students in Mexico as part of their training. Workshops will also be developed for conferences in the Southwest, one of which will be a major cross-border meeting between Mexican and U.S. foresters. In short, this project will strengthen cross-border research, management efforts in forest conservation, and our understanding of how genetics shape life on Earth.</AbstractNarration>
