    <AbstractNarration>This award is to support a workshop at North Carolina State University that will bring together intelligence analysts and practitioners with scholars in Science, Technology, and Society (STS); participants will be from both the United States and the United Kingdom. Among the topics to be discussed by workshop participants is the conflict between studying intelligence communities and the need for secrecy. More broadly, the workshop will focus on research methods for analyzing intelligence communities and de-classified national security documents. It will discuss how to develop and apply STS concepts, frameworks, and methods to understand the production of knowledge in intelligence work. It will also address how to increase opportunities and contexts for professional engagements between STS and related scholars, intelligence practitioners, and civil society members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How a community (country, state, collective) gathers and utilizes intelligence information is both timely and of utmost concern, which means that developing better ways to study secrecy and the influence of secrecy practices on knowledge gathering and utilization is very important. The project has a strong dissemination plan that will enable the workshop proceedings to have a broad impact on multiple communities including intelligence practitioners, policymakers, and the public.</AbstractNarration>
