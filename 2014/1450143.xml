    <AbstractNarration>Technical:&lt;br/&gt;PIs propose to convene a cross-disciplinary workshop that brings together key players and junior researchers from China and the US in paleontology, evolutionary biology, taphonomy and other field related to the Rise of Modern Biodiversity in the Phanerozoic. This workshop will continue a series of bilateral workshops to address Criticial Transitions in the History of Life started in 2005 and co-sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and China National Science Foundation have co-sponsored a series. The workshop will be hosted at the Field Museum in Chicago, and will feature five broad themes chosen to capture recent, high profile research activities. Experts at all career stages will be invited to provide brief summaries of the status of current research followed by extensive, moderated discussions to identify new research directions and initiatives, which will be disseminated to a wider audience on dedicated web sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together a diverse group of Sino-US experts that spans the breadth of paleobiology to address Criticial Transitions in the History of Life started in 2005 and co-sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and China National Science Foundation. The workshop will help identify new research directions and initiatives in paleobiology and the outcomes will be widely disseminated to the paleobiology research community.</AbstractNarration>
