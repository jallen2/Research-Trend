    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on an investigation of the multiscale interaction between African easterly waves (AEWs), Kelvin waves and different types of deep convection over the Atlantic Ocean, Africa and the Indian Ocean. The effort will focus on three research areas: (i) the initiation of AEWs and their role on convective activity, (ii) the impact of different types of deep convection on maintenance, structure and propagation characteristics of AEWs, and (iii) the Kelvin wave variability, including its interaction with AEWs. A novel way of investigating wave-convection interactions and presenting comprehensive analysis of different types of deep convection will be studied. Heretofore-unrecognized changes in convective system organization, i.e., switching of one type of deep convection to another, will be identified as playing a key role in initiating wave activity. The plan includes use of multiple datasets: satellite-based observations from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis, and high-resolution reanalysis data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following key scientific questions will be addressed: (1) How does one type of deep convection transition to another type? What are the mechanisms that determine this transition? What is the role of diurnal cycle and high terrain in the transition process? (2) How do AEWs and associated convection vary across regions of high terrain in Africa? How does AEW-genesis vary in time? What is the impact of MCSs on AEWs? (3) How do Kelvin waves interact with AEWs and what determines this interaction? (4) What is the role of Kelvin wave activity on different types of deep convection?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal has also important educational impacts. This research will help increase the involvement of students from underrepresented groups and will enhance the graduate atmospheric science program at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, a minority serving institution.</AbstractNarration>
