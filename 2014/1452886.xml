    <AbstractNarration>Coastal wetlands provide important ecosystem services, such as flood protection, habitat for wildlife, and water quality improvement. Despite the recognition of their valuable services, local land use and global climate change are driving the loss of coastal wetlands. This project will advance our understanding of coastal wetland structure and function, while answering questions relevant to management that can help prevent wetland loss. This project will determine the capacity of North Carolina coastal wetlands to continue to provide ecosystem services under a changing climate. The project will engage middle school teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and citizen scientists in long-term ecological research by creating new curricula, field based exercises, a graduate course, and a citizen science mobile device application. The project will support three graduate students, five undergraduate students, and four middle school teachers over five years. The project will also advance the career of a young investigator that is a member of an underrepresented group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will adapt recently developed methods to identify 'early warning signals' that will indicate the resilience of forested wetlands and marshes to drought, storms, and increased salinity and help forecast the loss of coastal wetlands. The project will use remote sensing, tree ring analyses, field surveys and experiments, and new statistical methods to examine the effects of droughts, storms, and increasing salinity on forested wetlands and marshes. The proposed research will: (1) Determine the spatial extent, time frame, and biogeochemical consequences of forested wetland retreat using a combination of remote sensing and tree ring and sediment cores. (2) Measure the recovery trajectory of ecosystem processes to disturbances in coastal wetlands in different ecosystem states and with varying degrees of management. (3) Test the resilience of ecosystem processes to disturbance in coastal wetlands by conducting a 5-year field experiment.</AbstractNarration>
