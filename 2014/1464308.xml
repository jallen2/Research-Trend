    <AbstractNarration>1464308&lt;br/&gt;Sonder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER grant will suport exploration of experimental, design, and management concepts for a potential user facility to allow for unprecedented in scale (10-100 m) experimental simulation of terrestrial mass flows (5-10 t of material). An envisioned mass flow apparatus (MFA) on the size scale and with capabilities hoped for (e.g., multiple material release modalities, variable ramp inclination and surface topography as well as a range of ramp embedded sensing modalities) was a concept recommendation of a recent NSF supported workshop that engaged an international community of volcanologists. As such the PIs will first target the considerations necessary to simulate pyroclastic flows though the MFA would be suitable for experimental study of landslides. The MFA would allow for study of mixed phase mass flows where initial boundary conditions are controlled and the resultant deposits would be studied to help improve numerical models of the behavior of mass flows and to ultimately use those models to help mitigate mass flow hazards. Topics to be further studied using EAGER support include: 1) the sourcing, handling, delivery and preparation of suitable starting materials for target simulations; 2) design of the variable inclination ramp, provision for modification of surface morphology and integration of specific sensing modalities and engineering consideration of the ramps structural design and response to dynamic loads of the mass scales envisioned; 3) consideration of management issues (e.g., time and costs of experiment set up and clean up, scheduling, cost recovery estimates for target experiment types and longer term usage considerations ? maintenance.) The envisioned MFA offers a potentially transformative experimental resource for study of hazardous mass flows under controlled settings at unprecedented scales and with sensing capabilities that cannot be applied in situ under natural conditions. This EAGER grant will support the additional exploratory considerations necessary to refine MFA design consideration and management concepts that could result in a tractable MFA that could support broad use by the geoscience community.</AbstractNarration>
