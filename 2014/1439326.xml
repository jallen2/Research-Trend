    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding to subsidize student-related expenses (e.g., travel, registration,&lt;br/&gt;and accommodation) incurred by US students attending the 46th annual North American Power&lt;br/&gt;Symposium (NAPS). NAPS 2014 will be hosted by Washington State University in Pullman, WA,&lt;br/&gt;from September 7 to September 9, 2014. NAPS is a nonprofit event with technical sponsorship&lt;br/&gt;from IEEE and is aimed primarily at a student audience. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority&lt;br/&gt;of papers in NAPS are presented by students. NAPS has been supported by the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation in the past, which has positively influenced student participation. Based on the&lt;br/&gt;attendance trend from previous years, it is anticipated that the subsidy provided through&lt;br/&gt;this grant can significantly increase the number of students participating in NAPS in this&lt;br/&gt;year as well. In addition to providing subsidized accommodation for students, our efforts&lt;br/&gt;to foster and encourage student participation include a comprehensive student program, tours&lt;br/&gt;of nearby attractions, and a student paper competition. Moreover, measures will be taken to&lt;br/&gt;encourage participation of women and underrepresented minorities in NAPS.</AbstractNarration>
