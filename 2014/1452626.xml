    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Rebecca Fischer has been granted an NSF Earth Sciences postdoctoral fellowship to carry out a research and outreach plan at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum for Natural History and the University of California, Santa Cruz. This research will focus on the delivery of carbon to the Earth early in its history and the role of carbon in our planet's formation. Simulations of planetary growth will be used to learn about the timing and source regions of volatile delivery to the Earth. High pressure experiments will provide insight into the effects of carbon on core/mantle chemical reactions that took place during core formation. Modeling of the core formation process will apply results from these experiments and simulations to investigate the effects of carbon on the core's composition. This work has implications for the distribution and abundance of carbon in the deep Earth, the origins of Earth's volatiles, and the composition and formation of its core. Fischer will be involved in mentoring undergraduate students and service activities in the scientific community while supported by this fellowship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will feature a novel combination of experimental and numerical methods. N-body simulations of terrestrial planet accretion in our Solar System will be used to explore the effects of imperfect accretion on resulting planetary chemistry with a focus on volatile delivery. Carbon is known to affect the metal/silicate partitioning of many elements at moderate pressures, but this has never previously been investigated at the higher pressure-temperature conditions of Earth's core formation. Fischer will use laser-heated diamond anvil cells coupled with high precision analytical techniques to study these effects of carbon, and use modeling to determine how carbon affects the composition of Earth's core. This highly interdisciplinary study will create new applications of data and simulations to the study of planetary formation and core segregation.</AbstractNarration>
