    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project will support student participation in the 2014 Graphene Conference, which will be held at the Centre de Congres Pierre Baudis in Toulouse, France from May 6-9, 2014. The conference will address graphene and other 2D materials beyond graphene. There will be sessions covering fundamentals and applications of these materials and participants will represent both the US and European, Asian academia and industry. Participation is expected from around the world, with an anticipated attendance of about 1000. The Conference will address fundamentals of Graphene, other 2D Materials, worldwide Graphene initiatives, theory and simulations, Material Genome Initiative (MGI) approaches to Graphene and 2D materials, manufacturing, workforce development and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will address educational aspects such as curriculum development, web-based learning, exchanges and summer schools. There will be considerations made for exchange programs in research and education, women in science, coordination of future summer schools, and definition of ways to educate the international community on grapheme and 2D materials. This should contribute to a broader use of Graphene and 2D materials in various applications, such as communications, sensing and health.</AbstractNarration>
