    <AbstractNarration>Keeping computers and information systems secure is a major challenge. Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. The Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA; http://www.cssia.org) was founded in 2003 to expand the pipeline of professionals in the emerging field of cybersecurity. Since then, CSSIA has worked with community colleges, educators at all levels, and business leaders across the nation to identify and address obstacles in building successful cybersecurity certificate and degree programs. The center distributes course content to more than 260 institutions and hosts a national faculty development academy that provides workshops to over 500 cybersecurity educators annually. With continued funding as an Advanced Technological Education (ATE) support center, CSSIA will continue to expand the nation's pool of entry-level Information Assurance/Cyber Defense (IA/CD) professionals and to improve curricula and teaching in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSSIA was previously funded as an ATE regional center (NSF Awards DUE-0302612 and DUE-0702872) and as an ATE resource center (NSF Award DUE-1002746). As an ATE support center, CSSIA will focus on four activities:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Increasing the number of minority, female, and veteran students pursuing IA/CD training. An outreach team will provide mentoring and will work with the Association of Computer and Information Science/Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions (ADMI), the Society for Advancement of Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), and Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS) to prepare minorities, women, and veterans to compete in cyber defense competitions, which serve as recruiting sources for cybersecurity employers.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Providing updated, relevant curricula and faculty development opportunities that meet IA/CD business and industry needs. Certification classes for college faculty and National Faculty Development Academy workshops will keep faculty members current with industry trends, help them earn industry-recognized credentials, and ensure that they are able to prepare students to combat current and future cybersecurity threats.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Updating and widely distributing innovative virtual teaching and learning environments. CSSIA's virtual platform, which has been developed and fine-tuned over past years, provides a safe setting for experiential learning, including IA/CD competitions, simulations, and on-site workforce experiences.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Leveraging CSSIA's social media network, which has over 3,500 subscribers, across other ATE cybersecurity education centers and projects. This network will be utilized to assist with business, industry, and academic needs assessments; to expand the impact of the resources offered by the ATE centers and projects; and to boost attendance at national IA/CD events, including the Community College Cyber Summit (3CS), the High-Impact Technology Exchange Conference (HI-TEC), the Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education (CISSE), and the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) conference.</AbstractNarration>
