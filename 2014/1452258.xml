    <AbstractNarration>The award supports student participation at the 51th Annual Society of Engineering Science (SES) Annual Technical Meeting, to be held at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, October 1-3, 2014. Founded in 1963, the purpose of the SES is to promote free exchange of information on all aspects of engineering science and to provide a forum for discussion, education, and recognition of the talents of the engineering science community. The support will have significant impact by encouraging broad participation among students in the activities included in the meeting. In particular, the PIs will actively seek the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering. This will serve individual students by providing an opportunity to present their work at a major professional conference, and it will help to generate interest and participation among new members of the Society, which ultimately serves the broader technical community of researchers in engineering science and mechanics. A student poster competition will be held for both undergraduate and graduate students attending the conference. All students participating in poster competition will also be expected to present their work in regular sessions as well, giving them experience in presenting their work in front of scientists and engineers. National Science Foundation support will help support student travel and registration in order to encourage participation in the presentation competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 51st Annual SES Meetings at Purdue will promote the development and strengthening of the interfaces between various disciplines in engineering, sciences, and mathematics with 5 tracks, 38 symposia and one student poster competition. The following scientific areas are covered: Mechanics of Fluids and Thermal Systems, Biological and Biomimetic Materials, Mechanics of Solids and Structures, Mechanics in Materials Science, Engineering Science in Education, Dynamics and Control. In addition to regular sessions, three symposia in honor of the three SES medalists are also organized. The results of the meeting will be collected in a book of abstracts made available to all registrants. Information about keynote talks and the abstracts is planned to be disseminated through the SES webpage to the engineering science community at large. The poster competition will bring together dozens of top graduate students in the areas of solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, bioengineering, applied mathematics, and other areas related to engineering science.</AbstractNarration>
