    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating integrated sensors and wireless communication technology to fill the need for cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of veterans with mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI). The novel Sensor Integrated Geometric (SIG)-Blocks technology enables fully autonomous and remote administration of the cognitive assessment and training programs that will reduce the cost and broaden accessibility to rehabilitation opportunities. Improved quality and quantity of measurable data and the dynamic nature of this technology-based approach will also lead to improved rehabilitation outcomes. This project will result in a prototype of a fully functioning hardware platform (SIG-Blocks) and user-friendly game software for personalized cognitive assessment and training. The SIG-Blocks technology has the following unique features: fully automated and remote (online) administration of the assessment and training games, dynamic and personalized game items, and improved quality and quantity of measureable data. These features will potentially improve the accuracy of assessment and clinical effectiveness of rehabilitation. Further, reduced cost and possible in-home training will broaden rehabilitation opportunities for TBI patients when compared to the existing cognitive assessment and training instruments in this market space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) lack of the platform technology that can be used for both cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of TBI patients by developing the new SIG-Blocks and assessment/training games building on a current prototype; 2) lack of fun and engaging features in the current technology by embedding visual, sound, and tactile feedback mechanism into the technology; 3) need for improved user interface (UI) to enable end-users to customize the test items or training games by designing a graphically augmented tangible UI; 4) need for in-home training to broaden the accessibility to the service and reduce the cost by developing online programs; 5) need for personalized assessment/rehabilitation to maximize health outcomes by developing a software tool kit that enables personalization of test/training programs; and 6) lack of clinical evidence of the efficacy of such technology-based approach by testing the games using SIG-Blocks on TBI patients in collaboration with the Cleveland VA Medical Center. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project will receive unique learning and training experiences by working with a highly interdisciplinary team for investigating effective strategies of technology translation that is often overlooked in engineering education. The educational activities will also include integration of this project with unique project-based courses that focus on advancing the impact of invention via multi-disciplinary perspectives.</AbstractNarration>
