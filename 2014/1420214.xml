    <AbstractNarration>Notable progress has been made in US girls' participation and achievement in science and math education, yet women still make up just 14% of the engineering workforce and 25% of the computing workforce--occupations which comprise more than 80% of the STEM workforce. The American Association of University Women (AAUW) will conduct a synthesis project to capture and disseminate what is currently known about the factors that contribute to the underrepresentation of women in the engineering and computing workforce, and develop a research agenda for the future. This project will synthesize and publicize what we know, what we have yet to understand, and what we can do to attract and retain more women in these fields. In the first phase of the project, AAUW will publish a report that synthesizes the research on the underrepresentation of women in the technical workforce from multiple disciplines and make evidence-based recommendations for change. In the second phase of the project, AAUW will publish an agenda for future research on the underrepresentation of women in engineering and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With assistance from an advisory committee of experts, AAUW will select 5 to 10 top research findings to feature in the report. Featured findings will be both widely regarded within academic circles as well as relevant to organizational practices and social policy. AAUW will work closely with researchers to translate key findings into simple, compelling prose that will spark the attention of journalists, decision makers, and the public. Building on its network of media contacts, policy makers, AAUW members, and technical employers, AAUW will broadly disseminate the report findings. To form the future research agenda, AAUW will convene a working meeting of prominent researchers in the field. The resulting research agenda will identify questions that are yet to be answered and promising directions for future inquiry. The agenda will be widely disseminated to interested stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>
