    <AbstractNarration>MRI: Acquisition of a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program provides Murray State University with a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA), thus enhancing a rapidly expanding research and educational initiative in polymer and materials science. The DMA is primarily used to determine the strength and elasticity of polymer films and fibers as well as other plastics and materials. Acquisition of this state-of-the-art instrumentation supports a number of multi-disciplinary and collaborative research and education efforts across the Jesse D. Jones College of Science, Engineering and Technology and expands industrial outreach activities in the region. The instrumentation directly impacts research teams within the college, where an understanding of the fundamental mechanical properties of novel plastics and materials advances applications in energy storage, electronic devices and liquid crystalline technologies. The integration of a practical instrument component and "hands-on" training into lecture and laboratory courses for undergraduate and graduate (Masters) students within the college further improves an already growing curriculum in polymer and materials science. Since Murray State is a comprehensive university in rural, far-western Kentucky, many undergraduates are first-generation college students, thus access to this instrumentation is extremely rare and provides a tremendous advantage in gaining meaningful employment or in acceptance into pre-professional school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The Department of Chemistry at Murray State University (MSU) will acquire a TA Q800 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA), complete with humidifier and low temperature capabilities, for the mechanical testing of polymer films, fibers and liquid crystalline materials. The DMA instrumentation immediately enhances the research programs of the three PIs, all of whom have been very active in the promotion and publication of their research. Since 2010, the PIs have collectively mentored 27 students (20 undergraduate, 7 Masters) and published 14 peer-reviewed papers (12 with student co-authors). Specific projects that benefit from this instrumentation include (a) ionic-liquid containing polyester networks for use in electroactive devices (PI Miller), (b) ionic-liquid containing polyurethanes for microfluidic devices and ion selective electrodes (co-PI Johnson) and (c) liquid crystalline materials (co-PI Allenbaugh). In order to enhance these projects, the standard film/fiber tension kits as well as the humidity and submersion features are used to test the mechanical strength of novel materials developed in the laboratory under a controlled environment, while liquid crystalline materials are tested using the parallel plate and/or shear sandwich accessories. Dissemination of the results from these experiments is made in the form of peer-reviewed publications as well as undergraduate student presentations at local, regional and national conferences. Various lecture and laboratory classes, ranging from Polymer Chemistry and Materials Science to Instrumental Analysis, are also enhanced through the integration of this instrumentation and hands-on training. Beyond teaching and research, the DMA instrumentation allows MSU to establish collaborative efforts with regional companies such as Ashland and Estron Chemical, Inc. that aid in the development of commercial products in applications ranging from paints and coatings to construction materials.</AbstractNarration>
