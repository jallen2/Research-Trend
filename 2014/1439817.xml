    <AbstractNarration>This Phase II Monitoring and Evaluation project from St. Edward's University (SEU) intends to spark a systemic change in science and mathematics teacher education in the region. By examining the objectives of an earlier Phase I teacher scholars project at SEU and extending its findings and questions into the future, this project will: (1) illuminate the successful components of the recruitment strategies employed; (2) clarify results of SEU's partnership with Austin Community College in the original Phase I work; and (3) determine the value of the professional development summer institutes held in Phase I. The investigation will also provide insight into building relationships with local STEM community stakeholders to use research as a means to jump-start future teacher leadership in the Austin region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also provides funds to extend the Phase I induction program for three additional years. By doing this, SEU will support the final cohorts of scholars as well as provide additional long-term research data for dissemination. During this time the project will measure: (1) the impact of the project on SEU Phase I Noyce scholar performance as teachers, (2) their completion of the teaching requirement, and (3) their retention in the teaching profession. The principal investigators will also explore the formation and strengthening of community partnerships between the high-tech industry partners and the local STEM teacher preparation enterprise. By examining the professional development growth of early career science and mathematics teachers over an extended period, the findings will uncover important factors related to teacher retention and growth. Ultimately, this study will help fill crucial gaps in the current knowledge base of factors related to the continuum of science and mathematics teacher development from recruitment through the critical induction years.</AbstractNarration>
