    <AbstractNarration>This project aims at (1) precise geometric depictions of digital images arising in biology, medicine, machine vision and other fields of science and engineering and (2) providing their model-independent statistical analysis for purposes of identification, discrimination and diagnostics. One specific application is to discriminate between a normal organ and a diseased one in the human body. Among examples, one may refer to the diagnosis of glaucoma and certain types of schizophrenia based on shape changes. A subject that the project will especially look at and analyze in depth, concerns changes in the geometric structure of the white matter in the brain's cortex brought about by Parkinson's disease, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, autism, etc., and their progression. Important applications in the fields of graphics, robotics, etc., will be explored as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancements in imaging technology enable scientists and medical professionals today to view the inner functioning of organs at the cell level and beyond. For example, in the white matter in the cortex, the coefficients of the 3x3 diffusion matrix of water molecules can be measured. In the absence of a disease or trauma, these matrices show pronounced anisotropy along well organized neural structures, while perturbations due to a disease lead to a decrease in anisotropy in each such location. This is one aspect of the structural change due to a disease that is visible in the diffusion tensor imaging scans. There are others. So far there is no statistical methodology that can precisely associate such a decrease in anisotropy with the particular disease that causes it. The present project will represent the main neural structures in the white matter in terms of elements of a Riemannian manifold and their geodesics. As one specific task, the project will choose appropriate metric tensors on the space of alignments of positive definite matrices along neural structures. The broad goal is to provide a nonparametric statistical methodology based on Fre'chet means for discrimination and diagnostics, extending much further and in novel directions the research that was carried out under earlier NSF supports. In a completely different direction, one theoretical objective of the project is to provide broad conditions for uniqueness of the Fre'chet mean under a geodesic distance. Such conditions are required for statistical applications but are unavailable in adequate generality for Riemannian manifolds with positive curvature. This matter of uniqueness also has surprising implications, for graphics and robotics.</AbstractNarration>
