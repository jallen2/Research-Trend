    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Robert Corn and his research group at the University of California, Irvine are developing novel optical sensors for the simultaneous detection of multiple DNA, RNA and protein molecules at extremely low concentrations that can be used for the early identification and diagnosis of cancers, heart attacks, and other diseases. The development of low-cost, easy-to-use biosensors that can be used for early disease detection, patient status monitoring, and DNA diagnostics has been identified as essential for the improvement of the health of the general population, especially for those who currently do not have access to health care. Additionally, some of the novel materials and sub-microscopic surface structures created in this project exhibit special optical and wetting properties that are similar to those found in biological systems; potentially, these "bio-inspired" surfaces can be used to create inexpensive anti-reflective and self-cleaning surfaces over large areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Two major research efforts are being undertaken in this project: (i) ultrasensitive biosensing via the detection of single biofunctionalized nanoparticles with near infrared surface plasmon resonance microscopy and (ii) the fabrication and application of ordered arrays of gold nanorings, nanowires and nanocones with unique plasmonic, optical and surface properties. The biosensing methods developed in these two projects will incorporate a variety of biomolecular functionalization and surface enzymatic detection chemistries developed previously for planar interfaces. In addition to biosensing applications, novel nanostructured interfaces for applications in near infrared optical metamaterials and biomimetic interfaces including broadband anti-reflective, super hydrophobic and bactericidal surfaces will be developed. The broader impacts of this work include: (i) potential societal benefits from the development of ultra-sensitive multiplexed detection of cancer, cardiac and other disease biomarkers at femtomolar concentrations, and also the development of low cost nanostructured surfaces with unique optical and chemical properties, (ii) the training of students with combined backgrounds in enzymatic bioanalysis, surface biomaterials and surface spectroscopy requisite for jobs in modern biotechnological and next-gen DNA sequencing companies and (iii) the exposure of undergraduates both to the importance of early detection diagnostics and also to possibility of careers in scientific research and biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
