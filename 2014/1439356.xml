    <AbstractNarration>Combinatorial commutative algebra concerns discrete methods or structures that govern or are governed by systems of polynomial equations, for example in algorithmic computations of their solution sets. This field is growing rapidly, to the extent that some of the key researchers in the area have never met in person. The MOCCA conference &lt;http://www.uni-magdeburg.de/mocca&gt;, to be held in Levico Terme, Italy for a week in September, 2014, will rectify this situation with an unusual worldwide portfolio of two dozen invited speakers and a particular focus on early career participants; it is the major event in the area of combinatorial commutative algebra in Europe in 2014. Funding through this grant enables the organizers to support U.S.-based mathematicians traveling to Levico and thus allow these researchers to interact face-to-face with other MOCCA participants, integrating them fully into the international community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MOCCA conference will provide an opportunity for researchers in commutative algebra to interact, exchange ideas, and establish new connections. Developments are expected in the applications of combinatorics to positive-characteristic methods as well as to representation theory and algebraic geometry. The two dozen invited speakers have diverse backgrounds broadly covering combinatorial commutative algebra. Special focus on early-career participants will allow for an active, stimulating, hands-on atmosphere. With an expected 50 attendees other than the invited speakers, the conference is small enough so that people will know each other while at the same time diverse enough to foster innovation. The conference is expected to serve as an inspiration to participating students and as a source of new ideas and new colleagues for speakers and participants.</AbstractNarration>
