    <AbstractNarration>This project, to be conducted by Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, will analyze and synthesize information about education research funding and publication patterns, to increase understanding about the state of science education research as recommended in a 2013 report by the National Research Council (NRC). This project will examine past research studies in terms of methodology. In addition, the project will examine how studies address outcomes related to expanding and broadening participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and the STEM workforce, as well as increasing STEM literacy for all students. The project will advance the work of the Education &amp; Human Resources (EHR) directorate in fostering research on STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education research studies funded or published from 2001 to the present will be considered eligible for review. Questions to be addressed will include the following. What are the number and proportion of experimental or quasi-experimental studies that attempt to disentangle program effects from student selection effects? What are the number and proportion of correlational, experimental, or quasi-experimental studies that attempt to address the effects of context on the teaching and learning process and what context factors are being studied? What are the number and proportion of correlational, experimental, or quasi-experimental studies that address outcomes related to NRC strategic goals for STEM education?</AbstractNarration>
