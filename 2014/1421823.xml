    <AbstractNarration>Big data applications demand high speed, reliable, and energy &lt;br/&gt;efficient data storage systems. Traditional storage architectures have &lt;br/&gt;fundamental limitations because of legacy systems that have centered &lt;br/&gt;on spinning hard disk drives. With rapid advances in nonvolatile &lt;br/&gt;memory technologies such as NAND-gate flash, phase change memory, Memristor, and &lt;br/&gt;magnetic RAM, a great opportunity arises for revolutionizing storage &lt;br/&gt;architectures. The objective of this research is to start a paradigm &lt;br/&gt;shift in storage architecture to meet the increasing demand of big &lt;br/&gt;data applications. It is envisioned that future storage systems will &lt;br/&gt;have machine intelligence that learns, analyzes, predicts, and &lt;br/&gt;controls the system at runtime dynamically. A novel accelerator &lt;br/&gt;architecture is introduced with machine intelligence to enable high &lt;br/&gt;speed processing of storage data operations that are critical to high &lt;br/&gt;performance computing in general and big data computing in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The newly introduced I/O accelerator, residing either in a &lt;br/&gt;many-core CPU chip or on a storage controller board, enables &lt;br/&gt;sufficiently accurate predictions for effective optimization of &lt;br/&gt;storage I/Os. With new architecture features, the proposed I/O &lt;br/&gt;accelerator can carry out complicated I/O tasks in the speed &lt;br/&gt;comparable to the emerging nonvolatile memories, which is critical to &lt;br/&gt;I/O performance because it no longer operates in milliseconds as &lt;br/&gt;spinning disks do. The project will explore and implement the I/O &lt;br/&gt;accelerator that can effectively deal with the complexity and high &lt;br/&gt;dimensionality of factors related to diverse storage technologies, a &lt;br/&gt;large variation of application workloads, different &lt;br/&gt;reliability/availability requirements, and power consumptions of &lt;br/&gt;various storage components. The result is a new heterogeneous storage &lt;br/&gt;architecture that is optimized for future computing infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;With the accelerator as an enabler, comprehensive methodology will be &lt;br/&gt;investigated that proactively learns system behavior to anticipate &lt;br/&gt;long-term trends and to respond quickly to fast changing I/O events. &lt;br/&gt;The new architecture is believed to be the first of the kind providing &lt;br/&gt;dynamic optimizations by means of 1) intelligent data placements and &lt;br/&gt;replacements across heterogeneous devices, 2) optimal resource &lt;br/&gt;allocation and provisioning to applications' workloads, 3) effective &lt;br/&gt;data deduplication based on content locality, and 4) smart policy &lt;br/&gt;decision on data protection and recovery adaptive to different data &lt;br/&gt;types. Furthermore, the new accelerator enables fast in-situ data &lt;br/&gt;analytics in active storage systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is expected to have the following broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;1) In today's cloud computing and big data &lt;br/&gt;applications, servers generate a large amount of I/Os that can take &lt;br/&gt;full advantage of the new storage architecture. 2) The new accelerator &lt;br/&gt;can be incorporated into many core CPUs as a specialized core for &lt;br/&gt;future heterogeneous processors. 3) The new storage architecture will &lt;br/&gt;speed up the adoption of emerging storage class memories. 4) The new &lt;br/&gt;methodology will stimulate more research in applying machine learning &lt;br/&gt;to storage systems. 5) The new CPU-and-data centric Computer Engineering curriculum will train &lt;br/&gt;both graduate and undergraduate students for real world needs. 6) The &lt;br/&gt;outreach program will continue the success stories of prior NSF &lt;br/&gt;projects to help the economic development of the state of Rhode Island and the &lt;br/&gt;nation.</AbstractNarration>
