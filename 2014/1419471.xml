    <AbstractNarration>The Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science and Engineering (INCREASE) is proposed as a way to connect researchers at Minority serving institutions (MSIs), including their students, with each other and with the research community at large nationally funded labs in order to enable collaborations and sharing of facilities to support basic research. The objective is to connect early career faculty from MSIs with successful national laboratory research teams and create a plan for their development into successful authors of competitive proposals and high impact research publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National laboratories such as the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the SLAC National Laboratory (formerly know as the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) have access to specialized research equipment that is frequently too costly for any one educational institution to provide. Through INCREASE, a consortium of institutions will become part of the Department of Energy facility user community, enhancing their efforts to establish research activities at their home institutions. They will be able to utilize highly specialized and unique equipment in support of their research. In turn the equipment will experience increased utilization as it is now accessible to a larger community of researchers at minority serving institutions. Both graduate and undergraduate students at the institutions will also benefit through exposure and involvement in cutting edge research and direct research connections with federally funded laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
