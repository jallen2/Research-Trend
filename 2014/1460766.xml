    <AbstractNarration>The Mathematics Department at Texas A&amp;M University (College Station) will continue their REU Site (Undergraduate Research in the Mathematical Sciences and their Applications), now entering its 16th year. This program provides a novel and accessible entry for undergraduates interested in modern mathematical research. Three parallel summer programs, led by 4 active researchers, will introduce the students to topics chosen from neural codes, algorithms for solving polynomial equations, biochemical reaction networks, complexity theory, models of immune response, and number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is organized around three parallel sessions with different emphases: (1) algebraic methods in computational biology, (2) algorithmic algebraic geometry, and (3) number theory. These thematic areas link naturally with numerous applications in science and engineering, and are of great theoretical interest as well. Students participating in this REU Site will enhance their training as future research scientists by being at a major research university that is also supportive and collegial. Participants will present their results to the entire REU cohort in a locally held conference. They will be encouraged to present at national conferences (e.g., MAA Math Fest, special sessions at AMS meetings), and to publish their results in professional journals. The PIs seek a diverse group of participants and priority will be given to students for whom research opportunities are limited.</AbstractNarration>
