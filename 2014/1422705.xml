    <AbstractNarration>Developing a software protocol stack is a complex task with many parties and products &lt;br/&gt;involved over multiple years. There are many issues that have to be resolved in the &lt;br/&gt;process, and it is incredibly hard to get all of them correct for all platforms and &lt;br/&gt;all possible states of a system. Hence, there are numerous examples of serious errors&lt;br/&gt;that ended up in production, where the cost of fixing them is high. Software protocol &lt;br/&gt;stacks are widely used in many domains, and rigorous methods to improve their &lt;br/&gt;reliability would have a very broad impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops a more rigorous approach to developing and maintaining such complex software&lt;br/&gt; protocol stacks.In particular, formal methods are used to find errors early through rigorous &lt;br/&gt;verification and testing, as well as to assist the analysis in locating reported errors. The approach&lt;br/&gt; is based on automatically learning abstract and succinct protocol models at different layers of the&lt;br/&gt; target software stack. Compositional reasoning is then applied to find errors effectively and &lt;br/&gt;precisely. The generated models are leveraged to help with error localization and diagnosis. The &lt;br/&gt;usability of the approach is assessed through a real-life case study on the Android Bluetooth&lt;br/&gt; software stack.</AbstractNarration>
