    <AbstractNarration>1438477&lt;br/&gt;Cunningham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAGER: Fungal Bioleaching for Recovery of Lithium and Cobalt from Spent Lithium-Ion &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most personal electronic devices (telephones, computers, cameras, MP3 players, etc.) now employ rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, as do electric and hybrid-electric vehicles. The demand for lithium and cobalt to supply these batteries has grown markedly in recent years, to the point where demand may soon exceed available supply. Simultaneously, because rechargeable Li-ion batteries have a finite lifetime, the rate at which these batteries enter the solid waste stream is growing, and will continue to grow in the coming decades. From the standpoint of environmental sustainability, a method for recovering Li and Co from spent Li-ion batteries is therefore required. This project will serve multiple purposes for meeting growing demand for Li and Co, creating a market for the "waste" product of spent batteries (thereby keeping them out of landfills), and reducing environmental harm incurred by mining of virgin Li and Co. Traditional or pyrometallurgical methods for recovering metals from wastes (spent catalysts, spent batteries, ash, etc.) typically emit toxic gases as by-products. Hydrometallurgical methods require extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, and chemical environment. Therefore, biological methods may be preferable for recovery of metals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bacterial leaching of Li and Co from spent batteries has been demonstrated at lab scale, but fungal leaching has not yet been evaluated. The PIs propose fungal leaching for these project because fungi are typically more tolerant than bacteria to low-pH environments, fungal leaching often exhibits faster kinetics and/or more complete extraction than bacteria, and organic acids excreted by fungi can form complexes with leached metals, thereby reducing their toxicity. The principal intellectual merit of this work resides in the assessment of the ability of three candidate fungal species to extract valuable metals from an important "waste" product, and to do so in an environmentally acceptable manner. The overall objective of this project is to conduct preliminarily studies to assess the potential of three fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum, and Penicillium chrysogenum) to extract Li and Co ions from spent rechargeable batteries. The central hypothesis of this project is that fungal strains that have been cultured in the presence of battery materials (and thereby acclimated to otherwise unfavorable conditions) can, under realistic operating conditions, produce organic acids capable of extracting at least 80 % of both Li and Co. The overall objective of the project will be achieved in two stages: (1) Quantify the acclimation/adaptation and growth pattern of fungi in the presence of single and multiple metallic ions; (2) Quantify the production of organic acids and the recovery of Li and Co during bioleaching of spent batteries under "baseline" conditions. For both stages, strains of the three identified fungal species will be assessed. This research will (1) characterize the metal content of spent Li-ion batteries, including the toxicity characteristic leaching potential of those metals. This information will be beneficial in estimating the economic potential of metals recovery from spent batteries, and/or in estimating the potential environmental consequences of landfill disposal of spent batteries. (2) quantify how three strains of fungi acclimate/adapt over time to different concentrations of the toxic metals present in spent Li-ion batteries. This information is likely to be beneficial to fungal bioleaching of many different types of solid wastes, not just spent batteries. (3) contribute to the development of an economic market for a "waste" product, which offers both economic and environmental advantages. (4) disseminate the results (via journal papers, conference presentations, web pages, etc.) to researchers in environmental engineering and to the public.</AbstractNarration>
