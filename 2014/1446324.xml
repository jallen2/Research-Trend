    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is in partial support for the Gordon Research conference on "Thin Film and Small Scale Mechanical Behavior" to be held July 13-18, 2014, at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts. The purpose is enhancing active participation by graduate students and postdoctoral scientists. This proposal is for funding to support GRC/GRS invited speakers and discussion leaders as well as graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty members. The topic of the conference is mechanical behavior at small scales. It is well established that the mechanical behavior of materials changes when they are geometrically confined to a small scale in at least one dimension. The approach is highly trans-disciplinary, involving scientists with backgrounds in materials science and mechanics as well as neighboring areas including condensed matter physics, electrical engineering and even biology. A broad impact on knowledge dissemination, stimulation of new research and cooperation is expected, particularly for young scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is in partial support of the Gordon Research conference (GRC) on "Thin Film and Small Scale Mechanical Behavior" to be held July 13-18, 2014, at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts. The conference will concentrate on physical mechanisms of mechanical behavior at small scales, as linked to basic deformation mechanisms, reaching towards modern applications ranging from optical and microelectronic devices and nano- or micro-electrical mechanical systems (NEMS/MEMS) to devices for energy production and storage. This research area has taken advantage of recent progress in atomistic and micromechanical modeling, as well as materials characterization and in-situ measurements at small length scales. The conference will cover topics of lasting significance to the field such as elasticity, plastic deformation, and fracture in small structures. In addition, it will highlight topics of growing importance. The approach is highly trans-disciplinary, involving scientists with backgrounds in materials science and mechanics as well as neighboring areas including condensed matter physics, electrical engineering and even biology. A broad impact on knowledge dissemination, stimulation of new research and cooperation is expected, particularly for young scientists.</AbstractNarration>
