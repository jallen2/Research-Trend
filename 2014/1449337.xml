    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1449337&lt;br/&gt;Lee, Univ of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to enable the large scale, low-cost manufacturing of nanostructured membranes for fracking wastewater treatment. Fracking wastewater contains unusually high concentrations of both oily components and heavy metal ions, making it extremely difficult to use the conventional membrane technology. Advances in nanostructured membranes present unique opportunities to overcome these issues, but most current methods to generate nanostructured membranes are suitable only for lab-scale production, and this project will explore scalable approaches for manufacturing. The nano-manufacturing approach will be to use roll-to-roll slot coating (R2RSC) of particle-containing suspensions and nanoimprinting of thin film composite (TFC) membranes using roll-to-roll nanoimprinting lithography (R2RNIL). Nanostructured membranes to be manufactured in this study will efficiently remove oily contaminants and heavy metal ions without losing their efficacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to fracking wastewater treatment, providing access to clean water is a Grand Challenge identified by the National Academy of Engineering. Membranes that handle the impurity profiles in fracking wastewater will be widely useful for potable water purification. The project will provide internship research opportunities to undergraduate and high school students from diverse background through existing outreach programs such as Advancing Women in Engineering at University of Pennsylvania and Native American Undergraduate Fellowship program at University of Minnesota. The project will also contribute to curriculum innovations that incorporate nanostructured membrane-based separations into courses that are taught by the PIs. The project will also significantly benefit from strong collaborations with partners in industry and national laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important technical challenge in the project is to isolate the key features that provide for high-efficiency nanostructured membranes that will uniquely enable the reuse and reclamation of fracking water in natural gas production. The PIs propose using a combination of nanostructured amphiphobic membranes (gravity driven oil + water separation) , (NAM) nano imprinted membranes (NIM) with anti-fouling properties, and nanocomposite membranes (NCOM) that have enhanced selectivity and permeability. The intellectual merit of the proposal lies with the science associated with the scale up of the manufacturing of these membranes. Toward this end, four specific directions are proposed: &lt;br/&gt;- To understand the fundamental physics of selective deposition of NPs on porous surfaces using R2RSC to manufacture nanostructured amphiphobic membranes for efficient oil/water separation; &lt;br/&gt;- To understand processing-structure relationship of R2RNIL to manufacture nanoimprinted membranes with anti-fouling and anti- scaling properties. Experiments and hydrodynamic modeling to design nanopatterns that minimize fouling of membrane surface will be performed; &lt;br/&gt;- To understand the critical parameters that lead to the formation of polymer/NP bilayer in R2RSC and to understand the subsequent nanowicking of polymer into the percolating network of NPs. The dynamics of polymer nanowicking and the structure of nanocomposite membranes will be investigated; and, &lt;br/&gt;- To test the separation performance of nanostructured membranes. Fracking wastewater will be treated in three stages involving gravity-driven oil/water separation using nanostructured amphiphobic membranes, dissolved organic matter and fine particle removal using nanoimprinted membranes, and nanocomposite membranes-based heavy metal ion removal.</AbstractNarration>
