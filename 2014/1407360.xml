    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is a form of sea surface temperature (SST) variation in which SSTs over a large portion of the North Atlantic simultaneously warm or cool, with oscillations from warm to cold taking place over a period of 60 to 70 years. The AMO has been shown to influence precipitation over North America and Europe, and is linked to rainfall and drought over Northeast Brazil and the Sahel. The AMO is thought to be linked to the overturning circulation of the North Atlantic, so that slower overturning results in the cold phase of the AMO, while faster overturning leads to the warm phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While previous studies have focused on the impacts of the AMO on precipitation and drought during the summer season, work here addresses the possibility of an AMO influence on Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation and consequent weather and climate impacts during the winter. The particular effect hypothesized here is that the AMO influences the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a large-scale fluctuation of sea level pressure and wind which affects the weather and climate of Europe and North America. The expected relationship is such that the warm phase of the AMO favors the negative phase of the NAO, which is characterized by a more meandering jet stream and increased incidence of cold air outbreaks. Research to test this relationship includes analysis of the 20th Century Reanalysis (20CR) dataset, in which atmospheric weather and circulation fields are reconstructed based on surface barometer readings from 1871 to 2010, along with SST records from the same time period. The observational analysis is augmented with numerical model simulations intended to capture the atmospheric response to imposed AMO SSTs, and these simulations are further compared to the archive of coupled climate model simulations prepared for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5). The research will also consider the possibility that the AMO affects the NAO indirectly, as warm SSTs lead to reduced Arctic ice cover, which in turn affects atmospheric circulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of the effects of the AMO on the NAO is desirable due to the impact of the NAO on the severity of winters in the US and Europe, particularly given that the slow variation of the AMO could imply some level of predictability for winter conditions. In addition to the societal benefit of the research results, the work will have broader impacts by supporting a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in climate research. In addition, the researchers will participate in an outreach program titled "Climate Literacy Empowerment And iNquiry (CLEAN). The program is targeted at elementary and middle school children.</AbstractNarration>
