    <AbstractNarration>The technology described in this project represents a significant leap forward in the development of a neural 'organ-on-a-chip'. The ability to engineer a biomimetic 3D nerve model will allow for rapid screening of neurotoxicity, neuroprotection, as well as the tailoring of the microenvironment to mimic critical disease models. To this point, only 2D in vitro cell cultures and animal models have been available as pre-clinical tools for drug discovery. Unfortunately, neither of these options translates well to in vivo clinical applications, which is apparent looking at the current failure rates of drugs as well as skyrocketing R&amp;D expenses. This advanced model will allow both academic and industrial scientists to further study underlying mechanisms and therapies related to neurodegenerative pathologies in a uniquely cost effective and timely manner. This technology should increase the molecular understanding of axonal degeneration, neurotoxic consequences and neuroprotective mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful commercialization of the proposed technology will result in a service-based product marketed towards pharmaceutical testing. The PI has demonstrated that microengineered peripheral neural tissues conduct electrically-evoked compound action potentials and filed a provisional patent related to the fabrication and application of the cell culture model. With this discovery as a foundation, the PI proposes to validate a prototype by demonstrating pathophysiological signatures in microengineered rat tissues. By contacting potential customers, the PI and his team will assess the readiness of the prototype and identify further benchmarks and design criteria. Two critical components will include refining the most effective outputs utilized for preclinical screenings and identifying maximally exploitable experimental paradigms.</AbstractNarration>
