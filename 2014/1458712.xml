    <AbstractNarration>There is an established need in the United States to increase the number of American scientists in the workforce. The NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at St. Lawrence University (SLU) will address this need and contribute to the national effort to produce more STEM graduates by providing financial, academic, networking, and personal support to twenty (20) (two cohorts of ten each) academically-talented and financially needy students with majors in chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, physics, statistics, or a non-clinical track of biology at SLU. Students will be recruited into the program in their first-year, and can remain eligible for scholarships through their senior year. The investigators will pursue a promising approach towards recruiting, retaining, and graduating STEM majors with baccalaureate degrees by nurturing their interests and scholarly activities in the sciences, establishing a close and caring network of faculty and peer mentors, and creating enhanced educational opportunities. Special attention will be given to underrepresented groups, including women and minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of SLU's Liberal Arts Science (LAS) Scholars Program include: (i) increasing the numbers and percentage of SLU students from underrepresented groups who attain STEM degrees, and strengthening SLU academic support services for low-income and underrepresented students in STEM in the process; (ii) helping the Scholars find and develop their identities as scientists; (iii) creating and correlating a strong network of faculty and peer mentors and support services to help Scholars persist in the critical first two years of undergraduate study; (iv) building a strong sense of community among the Scholars through regular cohort-centered activities; (v) promoting and facilitating an appreciation and understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of STEM fields; (vi) introducing SLU's S-STEM Scholars to research, real world problem solving, and other enhanced educational opportunities; and (vi) exposing the students to a variety of careers in STEM fields as well as assisting them in transitioning from SLU to a STEM graduate program or career. To meet the goals of the project, the Scholars Program investigators will implement several interesting and innovative strategies, which include but are not limited to: (a) a unique orientation experience, "STEM in the Adirondacks," for incoming Scholars; (b) a new first semester course on scientific discovery, complementary cohort courses, and a second semester seminar on statistical reasoning; (c) peer and faculty mentoring; (d) skill-building, professional development workshops, and workshops and seminars to expose students to a variety of careers; and (e) cohort-building activities and enhanced education opportunities to engage participants. These initiatives will work in concert with existing and strengthened support services at SLU. The investigators will research and assess the effectiveness of the various components of the project, considered individually and working in combination with each other. Their findings will add to the overall knowledge base of STEM education and will create a national model leading to productive student intervention strategies, especially related to understanding and improving successes of underrepresented and/or low income students, thereby broadening participation by expanding diversity in STEM fields that can be shared with other institutions, especially at liberal arts colleges. Program partners will help enhance student engagement in research and other endeavors. These partners include Clarkson University, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Cornell Cooperative Extension of St. Lawrence County.</AbstractNarration>
