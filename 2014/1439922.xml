    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1439922, Principal Investigator: Mieczyslaw K. Dabkowski, Tobias Hagge, Viswanath Ramakrishna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conference on Knot Theory and its Applications to Physics and Quantum Computing is to be held at the University of Texas at Dallas in October 2014. Knot theory is the branch of topology that studies the many ways that a circle can be placed within three-dimensional space - a motivating question is whether an apparently knotted circle is genuinely knotted, or whether it looks more complicated than it really is. Techniques that are currently used and under development have been shown to be capable of making that distinction between knotted and unknotted circles, and are opening up new challenges in algebra as well as topology. Connections of knot theory to physics often involve quantum theory, and one of the topics of this conference is quantum computing, the effort to apply the distinctive properties of quantum mechanical systems such as entanglement to obtain computational speedups that greatly exceed the limitations of current hardware. Speakers at this conference are expected to include some of the leading researchers in topological aspects of quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the main topics for the planned conference include: (1) connections between knot theory and quantum computing - such as Temperley-Lieb recoupling, unitary representations of the braid group and entangled states, unitary solutions to the Yang-Baxter equations, GHZ states and extra special 2-groups, fusion algebra of Majorana fermions, (2) invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, including Khovanov homology, skein modules, and related ideas; and (3) applications of knot and link invariants to finding higher order invariants and sharper energy bounds for energy for magnetic and vorticity fields.</AbstractNarration>
