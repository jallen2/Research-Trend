    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this grant is to enhance student participation in the 2014 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium by providing student support. The conference is a forum bringing together top researchers from around the world and numerous graduate students to discuss their research, to exchange ideas, to network, and to develop collaborative relationships centered on additive manufacturing research. The 2014 Symposium will be held at the Thompson Conference Center on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin on August 4-6, 2014. All registering students will receive support based on a reduction in the meeting registration fee. It is estimated that about 90 of the anticipated 240 attendees will be students. Two plenary sessions at the 2014 meeting will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the meeting by dealing broadly with "looking back 25 years" and "looking forward 25 years". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium will be a mechanism for transfer and dissemination of knowledge and understanding in the field of additive manufacturing. Presentations represent state of the art in additive manufacturing research. The networking of world-class researchers with students is strong since the meeting encourages through its pricing structure the involvement of students. Through the heavily cited proceedings, information is widely disseminated to an extensive network of researchers and students around the world. The proceedings of previous Symposia are freely available on line at the conference website, and the 2014 proceedings volume will be similarly available. The societal impact is identification of pre-commercial technologies and sharing of information pertaining to additive manufacturing that will eventually be developed and implemented into machines and processes that will enhance domestic productivity.</AbstractNarration>
