    <AbstractNarration>1437014 &lt;br/&gt;Karagozian, Ann R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the proposed research is to understand and control the behavior of jets in crossflow (JICF). &lt;br/&gt;Since the presence of JICF is prevalent in a plethora of engineering and technological applications related to energy production, propulsion, and combustion, the work proposed here would have a significant impact in engineering JICF systems with tailored behavior. In that case, increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions would have an impact on the national economy and the environment. In addition, the co-PIs will reach students outside of their university with presentations and demonstrations for students at Community Colleges in Southern California. Opportunities for local high school students as well as CC students to gain laboratory experiences in the summer will be provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to study the effects of instabilities on the behavior JICF. These instabilities may develop at the jet?s upstream shear layer depending on the crossflow characteristics (e.g., fluid density, fluid velocity). Experimental evidence indicates that these instabilities can profoundly affect the JICF spreading, trajectory, speed etc. This proposal is a fundamental approach to develop a deeper mechanistic understanding of how the crossflow leads to the instabilities, and what the effects are exactly. Experiments that employ state-of-the-art imaging techniques (stereo-particle image velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluoresence), in combination with theory and modeling of the process are proposed, in order to develop predictive capabilities that allow control of spreading and mixing of JICF.</AbstractNarration>
