    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on bringing to market a low-cost, high-resolution and vertically integrated multi-material 3D printing platform. The platform will enable engineers, hobbyists and prosumers to build innovative multi-material objects and will help bring manufacturing to the US by lowering the cost for short-runs. It will also serve as a powerful educational tool for both universities and K-12 programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a fully functional 3D printing prototype platform ready to be productized by an upcoming startup. The prototype will consist of an innovative low-cost multi-material 3D printer that can print with up to 12 materials simultaneously. The result of the project will be a rich library of inexpensive materials with a wide range of optical, mechanical, electrical and appearance properties. A suite of powerful material design tools that will enable users to fully leverage the capabilities of the underlying hardware and material library will be completed. Current leading 3D platforms can print with one, two or three materials simultaneously. In contrast, this platform will enable full-color 3D printing, use of flexible, rigid, transparent and conductive materials simultaneously and will enable a wide range of functional 3D prints. Existing multi-material 3D printers cost $250,000 or higher. This low-cost solution will target the $5,000 market segment which will make the platform available to a much wider audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) we will finish translating our first-generation printer into a desktop-sized printer, 2) we will complete key modules that will dramatically lower the manufacturing costs of the hardware, 3) we will further enrich our library of materials and develop conductive inks and 4) we will integrate our design tools into existing software pipelines and workflows to enable rapid adoption of our platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-material 3D printing platform is important because it will disrupt the 3D printing market. It will dramatically lower acquisition and usage costs for multi-material printing and enable new forms of multi-material design, functional prototyping and low-cost short run manufacturing. In addition, the potential economic impact is expected to be within the next 18 months, which will contribute to the US competitiveness in 3D printing and manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
