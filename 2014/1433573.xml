    <AbstractNarration>The size of Geoscience datasets is a significant challenge in the study of many Earth processes and systems because sophisticated technology allows us to collect datasets much larger than ever before. An ability to manipulate and analyze these datasets is important because they contain critical information about the state of our world, the impact of natural disasters, and the extent of natural resources. Large geoscience datasets have traditionally been accessible only to those with specialized training in computer programs such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. This project will address obstacles to learning how to use large Geoscience datasets and solve authentic problems without having to master all aspects of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools themselves. This project will create a model curriculum focused on the topic of tropical cyclones: exploring their lifecycle, hazards, and drivers in atmospheric and ocean circulation, with an emphasis on the timely question of possible linkages to climate change. It will develop new investigations on the devastating and scientifically unique cyclones, Typhoon Haiyan and Hurricane Sandy. It will also improve our understanding of how students learn with the powerful analytical and visualization tools of a GIS and how these learning experiences influence their interest in, awareness of, and persistence towards geosciences and other careers that depend upon analysis of large complex data sets to solve important societal problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will facilitate widespread use of GIS as an introductory level analysis tool by providing high quality curriculum that works with both the leading free open source and commercial GIS applications. It makes these GIS tools accessible to novices through modifications to the GIS applications' user-interfaces. To increase accessibility, the curriculum will be published using low cost e-publishing strategies. The new curriculum design model will include workforce skills components that challenge students to think about how choices in data analysis, representation, and visualization impact interpretation and understanding. It will develop students' abilities to reason and solve problems by training students to think critically about how best to analyze and represent data to solve a problem. This project will investigate the extent to which it successfully leads to student improvement of targeted knowledge, technical skills, and scientific thinking abilities by using embedded forced choice questions within the curriculum modules. In addition, students will complete a culminating open-ended investigation testing their ability to apply what they have learned. This will be scored by a set of rubrics developed by the PI team. This project will also investigate the extent to which it is able to influence students' awareness of, interest in, and intent to pursue STEM careers generally, and those in geoscience specifically. This will be accomplished using a pre-test/post-test model to measure changes in students' affective responses to these issues. Previously validated instruments will be augmented with additional questions to specifically measure awareness of and interest in geoscience in general and geoscience careers. Inferential statistics will be used to determine areas of change in the pre-test/post-test answers, indicating likely impact of the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
