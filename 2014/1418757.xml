    <AbstractNarration>The proposal is to enable students from educational institutions in the United States to attend the CPSWeek 2014 collection of conferences, which are to be held April 14-17, 2014, in Berlin, Germany. CPSWeek is an annual international multi-conference for Cyber-Physical Systems, comprising five major multi-day conferences, five one-day workshops, and four one-day tutorials. It moves from country to country each year. Attending the conference will provide students with a unique opportunity to listen and learn from the keynote speeches, presentations, posters and demos on cutting edge topics on cyber-physical systems, and to network with both leaders and other young researchers in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CPS research is expected to have positive societal impacts in many areas, including transportation, energy, agriculture, water/sewage treatment, environmental management and manufacturing systems. These systems must operate safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and respond to events in real time. A key feature of CPS research is the requirement to cooperate across disciplines such as computer science, computer architecture and hardware, material science and sensor design, software engineering, networking, and control engineering. In this inherently interdisciplinary field, where collaborations are essential, meeting other researchers is especially important. This event is especially valuable in this regard, because of the international exposure. There is a very high level of activity and investment in CPS research outside the US including Europe and Asia. For these reasons, strong participation in this event, especially among students (our next generation of researchers) is important to maintaining and advancing CPS research in the US.</AbstractNarration>
