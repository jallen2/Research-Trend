    <AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research, which connects students to culturally and geographically relevant research, is an important step in engaging students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college, it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dine' College will implement several new degrees or certificates in relevant STEM fields. These are: a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental science (the college currently offers an AS degree, which would be expanded with upper division coursework and additional faculty); Bachelor of Arts degrees in math and science secondary education; an Associate of Science degree in pre-engineering; and certification programs in natural resources/GIS and in computer technology. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is found in the expertise of the key leaders, the impressive faculty credentials that will be brought to bear on the degree and program development, and the alignment of the project goals with STEM workforce opportunities and the goals of the nation and the college. Additionally, the project evaluation plan will provide insight into effective strategies for community colleges that seek to strengthen instructional capacity in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
