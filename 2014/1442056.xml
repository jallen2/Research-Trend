    <AbstractNarration>This project adds value to the ongoing 2014 Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx) which designed in support of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite mission and sponsored by NASA's PMM (Precipitation Measurement Missions) Program. This project will conduct a field campaign that will take place in the complex terrain region of the Southern Appalachians to carry out intensive hydrological observations. The research will advance our understanding of the critical pathway of water in several benchmark watersheds across the transition from the Blue Ridge to the Piedmont. The activities will extend and complement IPHEx data collection to include water cycle processes in the lower troposphere, and in the subsurface. The project will introduce 10 graduate and 12 undergraduate students from 14 different academic institutions to use the vast array of instrumentation deployed during IPHEx and provide students training and experience with the use of the instruments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study extends the ongoing study of the 2014 Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx) which designed in support of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite mission and sponsored by NASA's PMM (Precipitation Measurement Missions) Program. This proposal is to conduct a field campaign that will take place in the complex terrain region of the Southern Appalachians to carry out intensive hydrological observations. The proposed research will advance our understanding of the critical pathway of water in several benchmark watersheds across the physiographic and hydrogeological transition from the Blue Ridge to the Piedmont. The proposed activities will extend and complement IPHEx data collection to include water cycle processes in the lower troposphere, and in the subsurface. The project will introduce 10 graduate and 12 undergraduate students from 14 different academic institutions to use the vast array of instrumentation deployed during IPHEx and provide students training and experience with the use of the instruments.</AbstractNarration>
