    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title:A Comprehensive Approach to Interference Cancellation and Spurious Reduction in Broadband Wireless Transceivers.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Texas at Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed effort will make significant contributions to wireless communication systems and will enhance access to the radio spectrum which has been identified as a national priority. If successful it will be transformative and will have major societal, commercial and economic benefits.The architectures and techniques researched here will find wide use in current and future radio technologies that enable broadband wireless access. Additionally, this research will impact multiple applications beyond communications, including safety, sensing, and medical devices. The investigators will collaborate closely amongst themselves, and with current industrial partners. Results of the research will be broadly disseminated through publications. Graduate students will be provided a cross-disciplinary learning experience that spans communication systems, architecture definition, integrated circuit design and measurement techniques. A strong educational program is a key aspect to ensuring the long-term dissemination of the proposed research results. As such, the principal investigators intend to integrate much of the aforementioned research into their regular course work. A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in this and related effort in the research teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadband wireless systems offer a viable approach for enabling ubiquitous high-speed communications. This effort will focus on key hardware challenges in the design of transceivers for such systems. Multiple questions will be addressed including: (a) the ability of the transmitter and the receiver to span a desired frequency range, with minimal hardware overhead and complexity, (b) the ability of the receiver to tolerate and operate satisfactorily in the presence of interference and (c) the ability of the transmitter to minimize its out-of-band spectral emissions, so as to minimize co-existence issues. This proposal seeks to address these considerations by developing a comprehensive approach for interference mitigation in broadband, rapidly tunable, integrated, wireless transceivers. The designs will be engineered to meet future high data-rate needs by enabling devices that allow for flexible, and reconfigurable use of spectrum.</AbstractNarration>
