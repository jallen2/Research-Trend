    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to implement an integrative curriculum in genomics and bioinformatics, by using direct research-based learning approaches based on modern techniques, and to examine the impact of this curriculum on increasing the number of Puerto Rican students choosing to pursue scientific and research career paths. This project will provide a unique platform for studying the effect of the integrated education on career choices in a major underrepresented minority-serving institution with students encompassing the whole socioeconomic spectrum of the Puerto Rican society. The major educational objective of this project is to establish an undergraduate curricular sequence starting from teaching genomics and bioinformatics, through collaborative class project to fostering independent and original research by the undergraduates. Participation in undergraduate research activities and authorship, along with academic achievement are among the significant factors mediating the effect of race/ethnicity in the scientific career choices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major research objective is incorporated into the curricular sequence and will result in an on-line map of human genome diversity across the island of Puerto Rico. The long-term goal is to create independent researchers through implementing dozens of student-initiated projects that will be communicated in various forms, including platform presentation participation in undergraduate research symposia, presentations at national meetings, online reports and peer-reviewed publications. Endpoints and outcomes such as test grades, pre- and post- evaluation of the general knowledge on the topic, perceptions of the research experience, evaluation of the course, mentorship, and recommendations to other students, as well as attitude towards entering graduate schools or other careers related to STEM disciplines, will be recorded for all participants. These outcomes will be correlated with the socioeconomic status and the career choice attitudes before, during and after application of the courses.</AbstractNarration>
