    <AbstractNarration>Excessive alcohol use and alcohol use disorders are a leading public health concern in the U.S. Several vulnerable groups of youth are at elevated risk for mental health symptoms and alcohol use due to their unique experiences and backgrounds. Despite identifying the elevated risk for excessive alcohol use among vulnerable young adults, researchers have yet to understand how modifiable interpersonal (relationship with peers and parents) and contextual (school environment and safety) factors influence their alcohol use. Consequently, there are large gaps in the available research regarding how indicators of risk and protective factors differ between youth groups. Despite the current disparities research documenting the elevated risk of youth alcohol use, studies do not provide adequate information for the development of targeted prevention and intervention strategies that address alcohol use among vulnerable young adults. Thus, opportunities to tailor prevention and intervention strategies to best meet the needs of this at-risk population are missed. Consequently, studies are needed that capture the rich and unique between- and within-group experiences that characterize the lives of t vulnerable populations to determine how these modifiable factors contribute to their short- and long-term alcohol use. The current project applies a multidisciplinary approach to address the current alcohol use disparities present among vulnerable youth groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the above issue, this project: (1) identifies modifiable interpersonal and contextual factors associated with alcohol use; (2) evaluates modifiable interpersonal and contextual factors unique that contribute to elevated levels of alcohol use; and (3) conducts focus groups with selected subpopulations to analyze, critique, and discuss empirical findings from Aims 1 and 2 to help inform prevention and intervention strategies targeting young adult alcohol use. Results identify amendable influences associated with youth alcohol use disparities. Further, findings from within-group studies provide a greater understanding of the factors unique to these groups that contribute to elevated levels of alcohol use. Using advanced longitudinal statistical techniques, the current project progresses the extant literature forward by: (1) expanding the prevalence research to identify how factors influence alcohol use among subpopulations of vulnerable youth groups; (2) assessing these factors in a developmental context by evaluating their influence over time as they transition to young adulthood; and (3) focusing on previously ignored within-group differences that contribute to alcohol use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the current study are used to produce translational research for youth and family program providers, education officials, the general public and other outlets for applied use. Further, findings from these studies aid in the development of community-based prevention and intervention strategies targeting vulnerable young adult alcohol use. In addition, since this project is a postdoctoral Fellowship award, it provides the PI (Fellow) significant professional development opportunities under the mentorship of a reputable senior scholar at the Univeraity of Arizona.</AbstractNarration>
