    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Anja-Verena Mudring of Iowa State University aims to enhance optical and magnetic properties of rare earths to reduce the level of lanthanides required to obtain these functional materials. Rare earths belong to the group of critical elements that are vital for many every day electronics, such as cell phones; green energy technologies, including wind turbines and hybrid cars. Therefore, the use of rare earth compounds constitutes an important strategic and dynamic segment of the electronic, chemical, and energy industries. However, reduced efforts to explore and mine rare earths in the western world in recent years has led to a dependency on international sources, and availability of a number of these elements is limited, in general. Thus, there is a need for new scientific understanding and expanded research capabilities on rare earth chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divalent and trivalent rare earth elements are incorporated in the cation or anion of ionic liquids (ILs). The product purity and identity are determined by a variety of spectroscopic, chemical, and crystallographic techniques. The purpose is to explore the chemistry of rare earth elements in ILs with the goal of using ILs to enhance and control the luminescent and magnetic properties of the rare earth ions and to stabilize rare earths in uncommon oxidation states. The research program aims to develop the chemistry (and physics) of rare earths in totally ionic media, at room temperature and below, which is otherwise not available in conventional solvents. The ILs are used as low-phonon environments and light harvesters to improve the luminescent properties of the rare earth, develop new magnetorheological fluids based on complex rare earth ions with high magnetic moments, and stabilize unusual oxidation states of the rare earths. This project involves a team oriented approach which will provide a fundamental research experience to undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral students. These students have the opportunity to work directly with academic and industrial partners and with business students. A special effort will be made to include women and members of traditionally underrepresented groups in this research.</AbstractNarration>
