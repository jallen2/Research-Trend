    <AbstractNarration>Mutations are the ultimate source of all genetic variation. How organisms interact with the environment to influence the processes that generate mutations is therefore, critical for understanding the origin of all evolutionary change. Scientists are rapidly discovering the integrative role the epigenome, defined as chemical compounds that interact with DNA to modify gene function, plays in mediating responses between the environment and the expression of individual traits. However, the molecular events that underlie these environmentally governed controls remain virtually unknown. This research is designed to characterize the influence of environment induced epigenetic state on the frequency, types and genetic location of mutations to better understand their influence on the health and fitness of organisms, populations, and evolution. The waterflea, Daphnia pulex, offers a unique opportunity for these studies, because it is well established as a model of environmental stress, its genome is well characterized, and its reproductive strategy that includes clonal reproduction allows for control of both genetic and epigenetic background. This research through outreach programs at both Indiana University and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory will benefit the development of young scientist, especially related to the novel bioinformatics and computational approaches that will be developed in this proposal. The knowledge gained through this research stands to have profound implications for society and the long-term health of populations, which are living longer in the presence of a large diversity of chemicals that can modify DNA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will leverage preexisting D. pulex mutation accumulation (MA) lines bottlenecked ~10,000 total generations and propagated in the presence and absence of cadmium. Cadmium is used here as a model environmental stressor, because it is a powerful mutagen in spite of not interacting directly with DNA, and it has been shown to profoundly affect heritable chromatin packaging and epigenetic state of DNA. However, it is expected that the epigenetic affects due to cadmium and the subsequent influence on mutation will be generalizable across any stressor. These MA lines have already undergone whole genome sequencing, the spectra of all mutations (de novo copy number variants, base-substitution mutations, and gene conversion processes) are established, their fitness quantified over the course of multiple generations, and the mutational consequences on fitness determined. The goals of this research are to: 1) determine the environment's influence on DNA packaging by identifying nucleosome occupancy within chromatin from individual MA lines, 2) characterize the role of stress on epigenetic state by identifying stress induced post-translational modifications of histones, and 3) investigate the role epigenetic state plays in regulating access to the genome, thereby potentiating mutations, and influencing organismal fitness. Thus, these studies will elucidate how the epigenome communicates with the genome to provide an interface between the genome and the environment.</AbstractNarration>
