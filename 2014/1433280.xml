    <AbstractNarration>The Acquainting Metro Atlanta Youth with STEM (AMAYS) program is designed to engage traditionally underserved middle-school students in performance-based relevant experiences that: (1) incorporate the STEM-related skills, knowledge and practices represented in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) workforce and (2) motivate and build participant interest in pursuing related ICT career trajectories. In summer and afterschool AMAYS programs in five sites, participants will create ICT products as preparation for statewide ICT competitions. Students will collaborate with each other and with mentors from business and industry, who will be recruited through a partnership with the Technology Association of Georgia. The project will be implemented through the After-School All Stars program in Atlanta, which operates in multiple sites in the Atlanta, Georgia in close collaboration with the public schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMAYS is a design-based research project involving the creation, implementation and evaluation of a unique ICT-rich informal learning environment (ILE) that combines elements of culturally relevant pedagogy, informal STEM learning and the use of computer game design principles. The project will iteratively design program experiences and resources and investigate to what extent the project: (1) positively affects participant perceptions of and interest in STEM-ICT careers and (2) develops related disciplinary knowledge and skills. Intended outcomes will be assessed through cognitive measures of participant ability to think scientifically and affective measures of participant affinity for the field/profession. Qualitative methods for data collection and analysis will also be used for formative evaluation of the project. Research findings and resources (including curriculum and research/evaluation tools) will be broadly disseminated to educational researchers and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
