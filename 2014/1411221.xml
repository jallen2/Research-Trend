    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides support to offset the costs for 40 students to attend the 6th CIRP Conference on High Performance Cutting, which will be hosted at the University of California, Berkeley from June 23-25, 2014. This conference provides an international forum for manufacturing researchers and companies to review and discuss developments in advanced manufacturing technology. Topics that will be covered by the conference include: additive manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing, and data-driven manufacturing (e.g., interoperability and big data). Selected students will attend technical presentations and interact and network with peers and senior manufacturing researchers. These students will be selected based on the following criteria: presenters of papers selected for the conference; quality of submitted research statement; membership in traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering and the sciences; and co-authors of papers accepted for the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proceedings of the conference will be made freely available online through Elsevier Procedia CIRP. Furthermore, selected students will be able to present, discuss, exchange, and develop their research ideas in the area of advanced manufacturing. They will also be able to interact with local industries and learn more about recent trends in advanced manufacturing technology. These experiences can help develop the students' technical and communication skills as well as provide opportunities for strong collaborative ties with other peers and researchers in the community. This can help foster new ideas and enable attending students to use their talents and skills to drive continued American efforts that strengthen the competitiveness of manufacturing in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
