    <AbstractNarration>Populations around the world are increasingly dependent on the global economy to ensure their economic livelihoods. In communities that lack strong economic assets, such as industry, tourism, or natural resources, people often turn to selling commodities that derive global value from their local, regional, or national cultures. However, maintaining a cohesive cultural reputation for a commodity on a global scale requires highly coordinated efforts by producers who are often have complex histories and may have competing individual interests. Thanks to Elinor Ostrom's Nobel Prize-winning research and that of anthropologists who worked with her, we know a great deal about how communities collectively manage natural resources (such as water, fisheries, and forests). However, we know very little about how communities, in the United States and abroad, collectively manage the value of cultural resources and cultural commodities. Therefore, this project focuses on a newly emerging global commodity -- South African rooibos tea -- whose value is dependent on cultural status. The researchers will investigate how a diverse group of producers (farmers, marketers, processors, and workers) implement and use collective governance strategies to promote the cultural value of their product on the global market as a way to bolster their local economy and secure their livelihoods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken by Arizona State University doctoral student, Melissa Beresford, under the supervision of Dr. Amber Wutich. The research will be conducted in South Africa's Western Cape province among, first, rooibos tea farmers and their workers in the rural rooibos growing region and, second, among rooibos processors, marketers, and their workers, in the industrial districts of Cape Town. This is a particularly apt research site for two reasons. First, rooibos tea is a newly emerging global commodity (becoming widely available on the world market only after 1994) that grows only in the rural areas of the Western Cape province, a region with very few other economic prospects. Among cultural commodities, it is a noted success story, being awarded a geographic indicator status by the European Union in July 2014, becoming the first African commodity to acquire this coveted distinction. Second, the investigators have done research in the region since 2012, and therefore have the local cultural knowledge of the region that is necessary for ethnographic work, as well as the professional contacts necessary to leverage the support needed to make significant research impact with a small amount of funding. Using a mixed-methods research strategy that includes participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and surveys, the researchers will assess the following: (1) how cooperative governance for the value of rooibos is perceived, contested, and negotiated by different industry actors (farmers, marketers, processors, workers); (2) how material, social, and cultural factors aid or detract from cooperation; and (3) how differing levels of cooperation enhance or hinder producer perceived and actual ability to create global value for rooibos. Findings from this research will provide insight into how diverse groups of farmers and marketers no matter where they are located are able to produce and maintain value for a cultural commodity on the global market.</AbstractNarration>
