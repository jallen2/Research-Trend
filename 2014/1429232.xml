    <AbstractNarration>Non Technical: In order to address many challenges in energy, health, climate change, and nanotechnology, scientists need to study the underlying chemical or physical reactions at scales down to a few atoms. Fortunately with the advancement of electron microscopy techniques, it is now possible to visualize such atomic or subatomic scales in specimens with great accuracy. On the other hand, the development of micro and nano fabrication techniques has allowed the use of specialty-made specimen holders that enable the application of liquid/gas or electrical/mechanical fields in the electron microscopes for real time monitoring (or in situ studies). In this project, a high-resolution transmission electron microscope will be combined with advanced in situ specimen holders. This combination allows the study of materials that are relevant to rechargeable batteries, medical sciences, small-scale electronics, and energy technologies. The new instrument is located in a shared user facility allowing full access to on-campus and off-campus researchers. New courses and hands-on training workshops are planned to educate the graduate and undergraduate students about the newest developments in the field of electron microscopy and its applications for materials analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This project seeks funding for the acquisition of a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) for in situ electron microscopy of materials under electrical field, mechanical loading, electrochemical conditions, high temperatures, and liquid/gas environments. This instrument substantially impacts the research projects that are national priorities such as energy storage, nanomaterials synthesis, biomineralization, photovoltaics, graphene, and nanoelectronics. Examples of the research projects that can be enabled with the use of the HRTEM are: (1) study of lithiation/sodiation reactions in cathodes and anodes; (2) biomineralization and crystallization processes in ferritin particles; (3) phase transitions and resistive switching in strongly-correlated materials; (4) mechanical/electrical probing of heterojunctions; and (5) mixing state mechanisms of aerosol nanoparticles. In addition, the new TEM substantially enhances the interdisciplinary research and teaching efforts carried out by Michigan Tech faculty and students. Furthermore, this instrument in conjunction with our in-situ TEM holder capabilities would place Michigan Tech at the forefront of in situ high-resolution electron microcopy in the Northern Midwest region. The undergraduate and graduate students gain hands-on training on advanced imaging techniques and spectroscopy mapping practices as part of the new microscopy courses. To engage college/precollege students in scientifically stimulating ideas related to electron microscopy, several outreach activities for underrepresented and community college undergraduate students are planned.</AbstractNarration>
