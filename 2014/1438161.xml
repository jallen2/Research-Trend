    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of US-based participants of the international workshop "Recent Developments in Adaptive Methods for Partial Differential Equations" to be held on August 17-22 in 2014, on the campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland, in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. Funds are directed towards students, junior investigators, and researchers from groups under-represented in the sciences to attend the workshop. The workshop is motivated by the increased interaction and collaboration between computational mathematicians and applied researchers in engineering and science. Driven by the need for robust and efficient numerical simulations, this workshop strives to bring together researchers currently involved in numerical simulations for real problems with experts in adaptivity. The workshop consists of three distinct but uniquely connected components. The first is a two day short course on adaptive methods for partial differential equations. The second is research level talks given by experts in adaptivity and applied researchers with a need for adaptive simulation techniques. The last is breakout interactive sessions coupling short course participants, adaptivity experts and applied researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will facilitate greater interaction between researchers in adaptive methods for partial differential equations and applied researchers in engineering and science. Moreover, the workshop will provide great opportunities for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young researchers to acquaint themselves with research frontiers, present their own work, and interact with experts in the field. Furthermore, the workshop will provide strong motivation for interdisciplinary collaboration between computational mathematicians and applied researchers in dynamical systems, Earth sciences, and medical imaging. Finally, the workshop will play an active role in motivating mathematics and strengthening applied mathematics groups at universities in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop web site: www.math.mun.ca/anasc/workshop.html</AbstractNarration>
