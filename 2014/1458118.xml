    <AbstractNarration>The Computer Science Academic, Retention, and Enrichment (CARE) program at Kutztown University will address a common challenge in computer science programs, namely creating a student body that is representative of the general population. The CARE program will recruit highly capable academically talented students who have financial need, and will provide academic support and resources to retain and graduate these students. Extra-curricular activities will encourage skill development that will prepare students for their profession, and will create a culture that is more welcoming to a diverse community of students. The project will generate evidence regarding what actually attracts and retains students in computer science, which can then be used by other programs to address the challenge of attracting and retaining woman and underrepresented groups to computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CARE will provide an opportunity to study how to recruit more academically talented students, including underrepresented students, into computer science, how to help them persist, and how to graduate them as competent and confident professionals. The primary focus will be on retention and graduation, which will be supported by building a sense of community among scholarship recipients. The program will be structured to include "High Impact Educational Activities," expanding existing student supports, such as the Computer Science learning community, and building upon outreach activities for high school students. Students will receive advising, mentoring, tutoring, supplemental instruction, internship and externship opportunities, and research opportunities. The lessons learned from the curricular and co-curricular activities will be of value to other STEM disciplines, especially those with little diversity.</AbstractNarration>
