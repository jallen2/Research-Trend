    <AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this project addresses the Nation's growing need to recruit and prepare secondary STEM teachers, but also to provide new teachers with the support that they need to ensure that they remain in the teaching profession. The data show compelling needs in the State of North Dakota. Both urban centers and rural areas of the state are increasing their populations at rates resulting in increased demands on the supply of qualified STEM teachers that are needed for the schools. In addition, 59% of North Dakota Schools are classified as Title I, requiring special resources to meet the needs of low-income and at-risk children. Finally, the state Educational Standards and Practices Board has declared all content areas except elementary and physical education as critical shortage areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a partnership among North Dakota State University (NDSU) and over 40 school districts of the South East Educational Cooperative. As a Phase II Scholarship and Stipend project, it will apply what was learned during the Phase I Noyce project to continue the recruitment plus mentored retention of talented STEM students into high needs secondary schools within North Dakota and adjacent regions of Minnesota and South Dakota, especially rural and tribal settings. The successful Phase I project supported 27 students. This Phase II project will prepare 36 new teachers. The evaluation of the Phase I project provided knowledge that informed the design and development of the current project. Based on what was learned, the project PI team will recruit students earlier in their academic careers, supporting new inservice teachers by providing funds to purchase classroom supplies, and implementing on-line mentoring for new teachers separated by great distances. Recruitment efforts will include paid, full-time summer and part-time academic year internships to allow freshmen and sophomores opportunities to explore and to encourage them to opt for secondary STEM teaching as a career. Project evaluation will use surveys, interviews, document analysis, and observation to assess teacher candidates and to evaluate the success of the project. The knowledge learned will inform the recruitment and support in preservice and inservice teachers in programs across the country.</AbstractNarration>
