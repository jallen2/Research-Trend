    <AbstractNarration>Multi-agent robotics is increasingly important as society moves toward greater automation. Because they are more inexpensive than more complex robots and can cover a greater area, teams of simple robots (also known as swarm robots) can be very useful for applications such as mapping, search-and-rescue, or precision agriculture. In many situations, human control of a robot swarm is necessary; however, the method in which this happens is difficult to define. The question about how the operator should control the swarm (individual vs controlling the leader) remains unanswered. If the operator controls the leader, it becomes difficult to understand how the operator could also control other factors, such as the formation of the swarm. Solutions to this problem will be situation-dependent, and the problem becomes more difficult as the number of robots in the team increases. This project will explore control strategies for large-scale multi-agent robot teams and analyze the corresponding effect on the controllability of the system. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jun-Ichi Imura of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, an expert in large-scale networked control systems who has developed novel model reduction techniques that will be used in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When working with a complex networked system, ideally the system should be reduced to a more manageable model in order to assist human comprehension and facilitate interactions with the system. However, when standard methods are used for this process, the input-output relationship is approximated and the internal network topology is lost; this would be detrimental for applications of multi-agent systems such as formations or mapping in which the network structure is very important. Thus, clustered model reduction methods were developed, resulting in a nested network model which is more easily understood while still retaining the underlying network topology. The project will apply clustered model reduction to large-scale robot teams for ease of control by a human operator. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
