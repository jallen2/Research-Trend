    <AbstractNarration>1434696 - Nikolla&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A shift toward environmentally friendly, renewable energy sources such as the sun and the wind will require major advancements in energy storage technologies especially for the transportation sector. The utility and customer appeal of electric automobiles would be greatly enhanced by development of lighter-weight, lower-cost, rechargeable batteries. Lithium-air (Li-air) batteries are among the most promising energy storage technologies because they can theoretically provide very high energy density (amount of energy the battery can store for a given weight) at a low cost. The theoretical energy density of Li-air batteries is comparable to that of gasoline, and much higher than that of any other energy storage technologies. While these systems are very promising, their performance is significantly limited by a number of factors, including the activity and stability of the oxygen (O2) electrode. In this proposal, we employ a systematic approach to develop active and stable oxygen electrodes for Li-air batteries. We anticipate that the proposed controlled experimental studies will lead to fundamental insights that can guide the development of highly active and reversible Li-air batteries. Development of stable, reversible Li-air batteries that operate near the theoretical limit will provide a major breakthrough in the energy storage technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed worked is to develop multifunctional oxygen electrodes for Li-air batteries that target two important chemical steps that govern their activity and stability: (i) Li+ diffusion, and (ii) the activation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during the charging process. Controlled electrochemical and spectroscopy studies will be utilized to obtain important fundamental insights on the effect of the targeted electrochemical/chemical steps on the electrochemistry at the oxygen electrode of Li-air batteries. We anticipate that the proposed work will have a significant impact toward the development of stable and efficient Li-air batteries. The systematic approach on developing molecularly engineered, target electrodes can be extended to other electrochemical systems. In addition to the scientific impact, the proposed research will become a learning tool for undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities at Wayne State University (WSU). The PI has also partnered with local K-12 schools to involve K-12 students with the research through summer internships and inspire them to pursue careers in science and engineering. In collaboration with the NSF-sponsored Gaining Options-Girls Investigate Real Life program, the PI also proposes to organize ?Energy and Environment? day camps, where middle and high school girls will be introduced to research related to energy and environment. The PI plans to use the fundamental electrochemical insights obtained from this project to design a course for senior undergraduate and graduate students focused on the Fundamentals of Electrochemistry.</AbstractNarration>
