    <AbstractNarration>NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and provide them an opportunity to establish international collaborations and take advantage of research facilities and opportunities abroad. Forging strong international collaborations is mutually beneficial to the U.S. and the foreign hosts. This fellowship to Robert Muscarella supports research and training in evaluating determinants of demographic variation across tree species ranges to be conducted at two host institutions, Aarhus University in Denmark under the sponsorship of Dr. Jens-Christian Svenning and the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands under the sponsorship of Dr. Frans Bongers. The research project contributes to knowledge on tropical forest dynamics across broad environmental gradients. This fellowship is jointly funded by the Office of International and Integrative Activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project focuses on understanding climatic and other factors that influence the range limits of tropical tree species. It integrates existing data from long-term forest plots across the Neotropics to evaluate how regional climate and local conditions jointly affect demographic rates, such as growth and mortality, of tropical tree species. By examining variation in demographic rates across a broad spatial scale, this research is clarifying the relative strength of local and regional processes in setting species range limits. The project also explores several central assumptions of commonly used methods to model species distributions, including the idea that demographic performance is positively correlated with abundance. By integrating data on plant functional traits, additional insights are gained on the mechanisms underlying demographic variation across various environmental gradients. To further broaden the impact of the research, the Fellow conducts training workshops in statistics and species distribution modeling at the host institutions for other researchers and students. Training goals include quantitative modeling techniques, which have extensive utility for both basic and applied research.</AbstractNarration>
