    <AbstractNarration>This is an award to continue supporting management, operations, and scientific activities at the Sondrestrom Geospace research facility located near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. The activities include technical support of the incoherent scatter radar (ISR), Rayleigh lidar system, and two all-sky imagers, as well provide observational service and data to the national and international geospace science communities, including education and outreach efforts relevant to facility operations and science. To foster new ideas in geospace research, facility staff advances instrumentation to promote scientific discovery, ensure data are of high research quality, and maintain expertise in the related sciences conducted at the facility. Over the years, the number of complementary instruments at the site has risen dramatically and the capabilities of the radar itself have been considerably enhanced. As a result, the research supported by the facility has diversified and evolved to meet the changing needs of the community of scientific users. Non-geospace activities, such as solid earth research, stratospheric research, and environmental research are supported as part of broader community outreach. The IS radar will be operated for 1800 per year at least in response to the evolving needs of the research community, providing flexibility in radar operations to capture space weather events, and make data available for retrospective analysis. To take advantage of these extensive observations, facility staff will focus on collaborative studies with other existing and planned high-latitude radars. The facility's data handling and processing tools are readily available in a timely manner. The facility staff will also maintain relationships with the Greenland Home Rule Government and Danish Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland to ensure effective management and operation of the Sondrestrom Geospace facility.</AbstractNarration>
