    <AbstractNarration>Energy efficiency is the key challenge facing computer systems. To improve&lt;br/&gt;performance under a limited energy budget, systems are becoming increasingly&lt;br/&gt;parallel, featuring many smaller and simpler cores, and heterogeneous,&lt;br/&gt;featuring cores specialized for certain tasks. Even with these improvements,&lt;br/&gt;two critical challenges remain. First, without reducing data movement, memory&lt;br/&gt;accesses and communication will dominate energy consumption. Thus, limiting&lt;br/&gt;data movement must become a primary design objective. Second, these systems&lt;br/&gt;will be highly complex, and will need powerful abstractions to shield&lt;br/&gt;programmers from this complexity. Current systems are designed in a&lt;br/&gt;computation-centric way that is a poor match for these challenges. Memory&lt;br/&gt;hierarchies are hardware-managed and opaque to software, which needlessly&lt;br/&gt;increases data movement; and runtimes lack the proper hardware mechanisms and&lt;br/&gt;software policies to manage heterogeneous resources efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project takes a holistic approach to addressing these challenges, by&lt;br/&gt;co-designing an architecture and runtime system that efficiently run dynamic&lt;br/&gt;parallel applications on systems with heterogeneous cores and memories.&lt;br/&gt;Redesigning hardware to be directly exploited by a dynamic runtime enables (a)&lt;br/&gt;many more opportunities to reduce data movement, (b) better usage of&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous resources, and (c) much faster adaptation to changing application&lt;br/&gt;needs and available resources. Three key components underlie this design.&lt;br/&gt;First, a scalable memory system incorporates combinations of heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;memory technologies to improve efficiency, and exposes them to software, which&lt;br/&gt;can divide these physical memories into many virtual cache and memory&lt;br/&gt;hierarchies to finely control data placement. Second, specialized programmable&lt;br/&gt;engines orchestrate communication among cores, accelerate intensive runtime&lt;br/&gt;functions such as load balancing, and monitor how tasks use hardware resources&lt;br/&gt;to guide runtime decisions. Third, a hardware-accelerated runtime leverages&lt;br/&gt;this novel architectural support to place data and computation to minimize data&lt;br/&gt;movement, use the most suitable core for each task, and quickly respond to&lt;br/&gt;changing application needs. This runtime targets a high-level programming model&lt;br/&gt;that lets programmers express fine-grained and irregular task, data, and&lt;br/&gt;pipeline parallelism. These techniques build on an analytical design approach&lt;br/&gt;that makes hardware easy to understand and predict, and enables runtimes to&lt;br/&gt;navigate multi-dimensional tradeoffs efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will make heterogeneous systems more efficient,&lt;br/&gt;more broadly applicable, and easier to program. It will especially benefit&lt;br/&gt;applications with dynamic and fine-grained parallelism, advancing key emerging&lt;br/&gt;domains where these workloads are pervasive, such as graph analytics and online&lt;br/&gt;data-intensive services. In addition, the infrastructure developed as part of&lt;br/&gt;this project will be publicly released, enabling others to build on the results&lt;br/&gt;of this work.</AbstractNarration>
