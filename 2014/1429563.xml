    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides funding to the Western Kentucky University to acquire a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for education and research at undergraduate and graduate levels. The instrument will support a broad range of cutting-edge and innovative research projects spanning multiple disciplines of natural sciences and engineering. Additionally, the instrument will allow the integration of a hands-on training and research component into the curriculum for various undergraduate courses. The new instrument will allow students, researchers and educators to obtain high-resolution images of a wide variety of samples ranging from complex micro-features in electronic and aerospace materials to organic nano-particles and biological species. The new instrument will also impact the research experience and education of Gatton Academy Math and Science high school students, as well as secondary and middle school students from minority and underrepresented groups in Appalachian counties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scanning electron microscope with extended capabilities including secondary and backscatter imaging, high and low vacuum control, and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer analyzer will impact a number of research projects from multiple disciplines including advanced manufacturing, mechanical engineering, geology, chemistry, and biology. The focused research and education areas include: (i) analyzing dimensional accuracy, surface finish, and crater sizes of micro and nano features machined using advanced manufacturing processes, (ii) surface morphology characterizations of nanostructures and their thin films, (iii) characterization of antibiotic coated gold nanoparticles for antimicrobial applications, (iv) characterization of structural and physical properties of advanced nanocarbon-based materials for energy-related applications, (v) morphological characteristics of stoneflies (Insecta, Plecoptera), and (vi) chemical, mineralogical (diagenetic) and morphological analysis of rocks and minerals from oil and gas reservoir. The high vacuum mode of the scanning electron microscope will enable imaging and analysis of micro and nano scale features in metallic and electronic materials. Low vacuum mode will be used for characterizing not only inorganic and organic nanoparticles, but also biological systems in various environments such as wet, dry, oily, porous, out-gassing, hydrated, or contaminated. In addition, the instrument will support a number of courses on electron microscopy; materials characterization; mechanical properties of materials; geology; and earth sciences. Overall, the new instrument will impact the research productivity of a core group of researchers to continue building a multidisciplinary, comprehensive program in materials science and advanced manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
