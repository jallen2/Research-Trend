    <AbstractNarration>The Midwest Topology Seminar for 2014 to 2017 is the continuation of a regional conference series in algebraic topology that meets three times per year and rotates between universities in the Midwest and Great Lakes areas. The next two meetings are at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (April 2014) and Northwestern University (Fall 2014). The Midwest Topology Seminar has been running continuously since the early 1970s, with at least one of the yearly meetings held in Chicago, the hub of the network. Algebraic topology has always been broadly construed to include homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, geometric group theory, and high dimensional manifolds; more recently the series has explored connections to algebraic geometry, representation theory, number theory, low dimensional manifolds, and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Midwest Topology Seminar is a long-standing, reliable, low-key, and low-cost way for participants to keep up with the field. The Midwest is a traditional and continuing center of algebraic topology; hence there is a strong source of local speakers. Programs are augmented with featured speakers from around the country. The audiences are always large and diversified, drawing faculty and graduate students from a broad range of institutions. The Midwest Topology Seminar serves as a nexus for a vibrant community of research mathematicians, optimizing the distribution of new ideas through the field, especially among early career research mathematicians and mathematicians away from the traditional centers of research. This award supports travel expenses for approximately twelve seminar participants, primarily graduate students and other active research mathematicians with limited means of support, per year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: www.math.wayne.edu/~rrb/MTS/</AbstractNarration>
