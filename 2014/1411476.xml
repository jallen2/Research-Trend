    <AbstractNarration>Unraveling the mechanism with which natural selection influences the evolution of dispersal is the key to understanding the life history of organisms. A key component in the study of species sorting is to understand how local abiotic factors influence the behavior as well as composition of resident communities. For instance, how does the increase in turbulent diffusion in water columns affect the persistence of phytoplankton populations? Can a river organism persist with increased river discharge? If it persists, how will its range limit be changed? Understanding the answers to these questions can facilitate the development of better management strategies for natural resources. The investigators study these and related questions in this project under the framework of evolutionary game theory. Since its inception in the 1970s, evolutionary game theory has proven itself to be invaluable in explaining many complex and challenging aspects of biological processes. However, most studies in evolutionary game theory have, until recently, ignored the effect of space. This is partly due to the mathematical difficulty arising from the analysis of spatially explicit models. The investigators and their colleagues will undertake the investigation of the evolution of dispersal, via discrete as well as continuous mathematical modeling approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, this project studies the evolutionarily stable strategies in dispersal models. An evolutionarily stable strategy is a strategy which, if adopted by a population in a given environment, assures that the population cannot be invaded by a mutant that is initially rare. This project focuses on finding evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies in homogeneous or heterogeneous environments in two distinct directions: (i) Previous studies have shown that a balanced dispersal strategy for continuous-time and discrete-space models can replace any other unbalanced dispersal strategy. On the other hand, studies have also shown that a balanced dispersal strategy for discrete-time and discrete-space models may not be able to replace some unbalanced dispersal strategies. This project seeks a unified approach to study the evolutionary stability of balanced dispersal in discrete, continuous and nonlocal models, and to resolve the disparities between different modeling approaches; (ii) Unidirectional flow in water columns often pushes individuals away from favorable environments and also induces a net loss of individuals from the habitat. Previous studies show that advection often puts slow dispersers at a disadvantage. The investigators will study whether larger dispersal rates will always evolve or if some intermediate dispersal rate will be selected, in homogeneous or heterogeneous, open or closed environments. Connections between the evolution of dispersal and range limit of species will be investigated. The mathematical tools include variational method, elliptic and parabolic regularity theory, monotone dynamical system theory, and numerical simulations.</AbstractNarration>
