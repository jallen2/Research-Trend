    <AbstractNarration>1403339&lt;br/&gt;Atreya&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a novel and desirable combustion technology for high temperature furnaces used in the manufacturing of steel, aluminum, glass, and others. The conventional burning process in furnaces relies on the heat reflection from furnace walls to achieve heating purpose, thus requiring the isolated flames, much like candles, to be at a higher temperature than at the wall. High temperature flames generate high level of pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) that are responsible for ozone depletion and smog. The proposed work is to have more evenly distributed flames over a larger volume to achieve the same amount of heating. Because the distributed flame volume can be generated at lower temperatures, the pollutant emission level can be greatly reduced. A higher energy efficiency and lower emission levels of greenhouse gases are expected. This project will also provide training in innovative and industrially relevant research to graduate and undergraduate students. Students will also have industrial site visits and present their research results at technical conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept is based on establishing a Radiation from Homogeneous Combustion (RHC) zone through intense mixing, dilution and preheating of initially separated fuel and oxidizer streams. The proposed work will: (i) Experimentally determine the RHC operating regime; (ii) Quantify the energy efficiency and pollutant reduction benefits of intense radiation; and (iii) Develop a theoretical/computational framework to enable designing and controlling industrial furnaces. Measurements of spectral and total radiation along with NOx, CO2, CO, O2, soot, and total unburned hydrocarbons will be made to quantify the efficiency and pollutant reduction benefits. This experimental and theoretical work will firmly establish the non-dimensional controlling parameters and the operating domain of the RHC furnace. The proposed RHC furnace technology is expected to have a tremendous impact on energy efficiency and pollutant formation in the manufacturing industries. It will yield considerable financial benefits for industries and will make them more competitive. A significant reduction in greenhouse gas emission is also expected. Moreover, if 100% O2 is used, the furnace efficiency is further increased and carbon sequestration can be easily accomplished.</AbstractNarration>
