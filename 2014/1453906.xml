    <AbstractNarration>1453906&lt;br/&gt;Rosario-Ortiz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Impact of Effluent Organic Matter on Photochemical Processes in Surface Waters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of Environmental Photochemistry is currently one of the major focus areas within environmental engineering science. Specifically within this field, the PI is aiming to understand the impact of wastewater effluent organic matter on photochemical processes within wastewater-dominated surface waters, focusing on the formation of reactive intermediates (e.g., reactive oxygen species and excited triplet states) and their ultimate reactivity in aqueous media. To this end, the research objective of this CAREER proposal is to develop a long-term successful academic program focusing on the environmental photochemistry of effluent organic matter. The educational objectives of this CAREER proposal are to improve the retention of Latino students and to implement inquiry-based learning in undergraduate education at the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU Boulder), in addition to mentoring graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the research plan, the PI will explore emerging areas of interest in the study of wastewater effluent organic matter photochemistry, focusing on the following topics; (i) Quantify the photochemical production of reactive intermediates, including hydrogen peroxide, and excited triplet states, from effluent organic matter and sub-components; (ii) Quantify the antioxidant capacity of effluent organic matter and its impact on the inhibition of oxidation of organic compounds, and; (iii) Evaluate the dynamics of effluent organic matter photochemistry in surface waters (e.g., photo-bleaching) and the impacts on reactive intermediate formation. The results from this project will be applicable to different areas of environmental engineering, including the photochemical degradation of trace organic contaminants and pathogen inactivation in wastewater-dominated surface waters. The results from this project will offer important fundamental information with respect to effluent organic matter photochemistry, which will in turn improve our understanding of the efficacy of photochemical processes in wastewater-dominated surface waters. Given the importance of wastewater effluents in urban water cycles, and the interest in photochemical processes as effective alternatives to more costly engineering treatment alternatives for the oxidation of organic contaminants and pathogen inactivation, a better understanding of effluent organic matter photochemistry is needed.</AbstractNarration>
