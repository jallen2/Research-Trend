    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a summer school on complex random systems, to be held at the University of Wyoming, May 27--June 6, 2014. Understanding and ability to predict the behavior of complex random systems is critical, for example, to weather and climate predictions and to nanoscale technology. The summer school will focus on the ongoing development of theoretical methods and applications in these areas. The aim is to provide a stimulating intellectual environment for interactions among researchers with different backgrounds. The school is primarily oriented towards PhD students, young and experienced researchers and professionals working in related areas. This summer school is especially aimed at encouraging female students and early career researchers in mathematics. The interest and enthusiasm of these young students are the motivating factor in organizing this summer school. This school will further advance this development throughout the region, while training U.S. junior mathematicians and students for international collaborative research. The summer school materials will be widely distributed by the publication of a textbook. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking stochastic effects into account is of central importance for the development of mathematical models of complex phenomena that affected by uncertainty. Macroscopic models for these systems can include randomness in several ways. The theories of random dynamical systems and stochastic differential equations provide fundamental ideas and tools for the modeling, analysis, and prediction of complex phenomena. The associated research, ranging from pure to applied, is extremely broad, with many active groups in the U.S. and abroad. The summer school will treat key topics related to the theory and application of stochastic differential equations, in particular, to turbulent flow simulations: Malliavin calculus, Monte Carlo methods, multiscale models, molecular dynamics, stochastic methods for turbulent flows, porous media, weather prediction, and uncertainty quantification. The summer school will serve as a venue for developing communication and establishing collaborative research among different research groups. Moreover, it will provide an educational component for graduate students and early career researchers. The award supports participation of six invited speakers and forty other participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer school web site: www.uwyo.edu/math/colloquia/summer-school.html</AbstractNarration>
