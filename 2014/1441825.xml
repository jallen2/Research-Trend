    <AbstractNarration>This research-initiation grant seeks to fundamentally change how students learn programming using Second Language Acquisition and Blended Learning (SLA-aBLe). This approach can be easily transferred to K-12 curricula, increasing access to STEM learning for diverse student populations. By developing an engineering faculty member's expertise in engineering education research, it will enhance communication and collaboration among faculty members and student researchers in different disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to apply well-developed cognitive frameworks in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) to develop a new Blended Learning (aBLe) approach to teaching programming languages. This approach will accommodate a variety of learning needs and abilities, while potentially increasing student engagement in online components. It will provide better preparation for face-to-face classes that will emphasize the problem solving needed in other general education courses instead of just keywords, syntax, and symbols. It will also encourage the development of problem solving skills students need to persist in a lifetime of learning.</AbstractNarration>
