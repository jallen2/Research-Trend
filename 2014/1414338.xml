    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on integrating and translating two new innovations in materials science to fill the need for a more efficient and adaptable broad-spectrum light source. The project will result in a proof-of-concept, optical-fiber-based light source for spectroscopy applications. This miniature light source has the following unique features: the device is fabricated directly on an optical fiber; the material system is highly efficient; and the light spectrum of the system can be tuned to a desirable output. These features provide advantages of smaller size, lower power consumption and less heat generation when compared to the leading competing spectroscopy light sources in this market space. This project addresses important technology gaps in the translation from research discovery toward commercial application. These gaps include: the demonstration that newly discovered carbon nanotube-based materials can significantly improve lighting efficiency in an electroluminescent device structure; that the new device structure can be integrated directly onto optical fiber; and that the resulting device meets the requirements of a light source for battery-powered spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages Duke University, Wake Forest University and Zenalux Biomedical, Inc. to build the devices and carry out application-specific testing in this effort to translate a new technology from research discovery toward commercial reality. This new miniature light source is important due to the need for light sources in numerous medical diagnostic applications such as the detection of cancer cells. In addition, it is ultimately expected to have even broader impact because all the requirements being addressed in the project are directly applicable to developing cheaper, more efficient and more adaptable lighting for everyday household needs.</AbstractNarration>
