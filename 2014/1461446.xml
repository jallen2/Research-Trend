    <AbstractNarration>The conference Seminar on Stochastic Processes (SSP) 2015 will be held at the University of Delaware in Newark DE on April 1-4, 2015. The conference will provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research in the theory of stochastic processes, and to enable participants to discuss their work in an informal atmosphere. In addition to talks by invited speakers on key recent themes in stochastic process research and their important connections to other parts of mathematics and the sciences, there will be opportunities for new researchers to present their research, and for the discussion of open problems, as well as a tutorial on major recent developments in probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic processes are basic building blocks of the way that randomness exhibits itself in the real world, and are used to model a wide range of physical, biological, ecological, and financial phenomena. The Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and many of the most prominent probabilists make a habit of attending it every year. The morning invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments in the field. Moreover, the informal format of the afternoon sessions gives graduate students and young researchers a unique opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends by engaging in high level open discussions, and by offering the opportunity to present their own research to leaders in their field. The synergy made possible by this original formula is very rarely found in more traditional meetings. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details are available at the conference website &lt;br/&gt;http://www.mathsci.udel.edu/events/conferences/ssp/Pages/default.aspx</AbstractNarration>
