    <AbstractNarration>Aquatic organisms not only swim in water, they use the flow patterns generated by other organisms and objects to orient themselves, to catch prey, to find mates, and to save energy. To understand how animals use and sense flow scientists must integrate fluid dynamical, sensory, and locomotory research. In recent years, fluid dynamic analysis and neuromechanics of aquatic locomotion have made large methodological progress. This symposium will facilitate and enhance the exchange of expertise at an exciting frontier of cross-disciplinary research. This symposiums will bring researchers together to integrate research across multiple systems (copepods, jellyfish, fish), organizational levels (from flow dynamics to sensory systems to muscle mechanics) and approaches (computational modeling, flow analysis, robotics). By bringing together experts in all these areas and disciplines, the symposiums will enable participants to better understand the mechanics behind complex behaviors that rely on flow sensing and flow use. The symposium is designed to offer a synthesis of ideas while highlighting the work of emerging investigators. Each of four symposium sessions comprises two talks by senior speakers and three talks by junior colleagues. Senior speakers will provide a broad context and build a shared foundational understanding for all the participants across disciplines. The speakers have been selected to offer a mix of disciplines and expertise that has not yet been brought together and that is unlikely to be assembled at the usual annual meetings. The symposium will bring together scientists who share an interest in fluid-structure interaction and flow sensing, yet come at this problem from many different angles, ranging from oceanography to robotics. Additional engagement opportunities at the symposium will be provided during breakout discussions, networking sessions, and coordinated discussions of research opportunities and limitations. Conference proceedings and publications will be used to disseminate the workshop outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
