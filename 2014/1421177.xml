    <AbstractNarration>Computer systems process and store information, including&lt;br/&gt;instructions, inputs, and outputs. Computers represent, or "encode",&lt;br/&gt;this information with bits -- zeros and ones -- such that a given&lt;br/&gt;sequence of bits can describe a number, an instruction, a character to&lt;br/&gt;print to the monitor, etc. The choice of bit patterns used to encode&lt;br/&gt;different types of information impacts the performance, reliability,&lt;br/&gt;and energy-efficiency of a computer. This project -- which is an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary collaboration between a computer systems architect&lt;br/&gt;and an expert in information coding -- will develop new information&lt;br/&gt;representations that improve performance, reliability, and&lt;br/&gt;energy-efficiency. This project will have both technical impact on&lt;br/&gt;computer system design and information coding, and it will impact&lt;br/&gt;society through its training of students (both graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate) and an outreach program that brings under-represented&lt;br/&gt;minorities to Duke for summer research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make technical advances in four main avenues.&lt;br/&gt;First, the project will develop new representations for the&lt;br/&gt;information that is stored in write-limited storage media like Flash,&lt;br/&gt;with the goal of extending its lifetime. A key coding technology in&lt;br/&gt;this research thrust is coset coding, in which the system has multiple&lt;br/&gt;choices for which codeword to write to the storage and can choose the&lt;br/&gt;option that incurs the least wear. Second, the project will develop&lt;br/&gt;new codes, based on existing locally repairable codes, for writing to&lt;br/&gt;all types of storage that can suffer permanent failures. These codes&lt;br/&gt;can enable efficient, local repair of failures by minimizing the&lt;br/&gt;number of storage locations that must be accessed to perform the&lt;br/&gt;repair. Third, the project will develop new representations of&lt;br/&gt;instructions to improve performance and energy-efficiency. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the project will develop new encodings of instructions for&lt;br/&gt;GPUs that enable useful work to be done even in the presence of branch&lt;br/&gt;divergence. Fourth, the project will develop and apply network coding&lt;br/&gt;techniques to improve the performance and reliability of communication&lt;br/&gt;between processor cores.</AbstractNarration>
