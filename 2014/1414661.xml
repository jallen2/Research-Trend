    <AbstractNarration>Currently there is a great deal of interest in microscale robotics for many applications, such as drug delivery. From literature, it is clear that the main reasons why microrobototics has not yet been developed for clinical use is the lack of sufficient energy and propulsion systems, as well as a lack of control systems needed for precise manipulation of these devices. Although material synthesis and processing have been rapidly advancing, no man-made material exhibits the diverse array of robustness and function inherent in many biological systems. A possible resource for such active materials exists within many microorganisms, namely bacterial flagella. One potential application of flagella is the use of these biomaterials as mechanical motors in robotic microswimmers. This research aims to fabricate and control bacterial-inspired robotic microswimmers. Dr.Jinseok Kim, at the Center of Bionics at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) is currently investigating the use of such microrobots for minimally invasive surgery and targeted drug delivery. The researchers at KIST have expertise in studying microswimming behavior as well as capability to control microswimmers though various stimulations such as magnetotaxis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flagella are an ideal system to use for a variety of microbiorobotic systems because they can convert rotational motion into translation motion. Also, as mechanical devices, flagella have extraordinary properties, allowing them to act as mechanical transducers. Furthermore, billions of flagella are readily available through inexpensive cell culturing techniques. Expertise and equipment, along with equipment to record, track, and analyze bacterial behavior is also present at KIST. Using KIST's equipment for high resolution fluorescence imaging of micro size objects, flagellated artificial bacteria will be developed and investigated for their ability to swim at low Reyonds number. In addition, the ability of these robotic swimmers to navigate controllably in biologically realistic fluids will also be investigated. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>
