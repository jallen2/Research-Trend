    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating NSF sponsored fundamental research in arsenic determination and its chemical speciation to fill the need for on-site real-time arsenic determination of ground water to determine whether or not it is contaminated with toxic levels of arsenic and to determine the type. The project will result in a portable, hand-held, "green" field-ready arsenic analyzer prototype. This instrument has the following unique features: (a) it can differentiate between the more toxic arsenite from the less toxic and more easily removable arsenate (b) it can measure both down to sub parts per billion levels, (c) it is a true green analyzer that uses air, water and electricity, with a small amount of sulfuric acid that can be recycled, and (d) it offers robust performance within a very low form factor. These features provide the advantages of low cost and portability, high sensitivity, low power consumption and very low cost of consumables when compared to the electrochemical instruments for arsenic currently available in this market space. This project addresses the technology gap of converting the original bench-top proof-of-concept to an instrument with a small, attractive form factor in a user-friendly form as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages Chipotle Business Group Inc. to augment their water analysis capabilities, provide field testing environment for the device during development, conduct a market study to identify customer segments, and develop pathways to commercialization for the instrument in this technology translation effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This green analyzer for arsenic is important because it bridges the gap between an academic analytical instrument and a low-cost commercial device that will help humanity. This technology will help the millions of people, especially from the developing countries across the world, who are at the risk of being affected by arsenicosis, which is caused by chronic arsenic exposure through drinking water. Arsenic is the 20th most abundant element in the earth?s crust. Even in developed countries there are many areas where groundwater arsenic concentration is high; this technology will be helpful in implementing water quality control regulations and monitoring the efficacy of arsenic removal efforts.</AbstractNarration>
