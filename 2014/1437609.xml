    <AbstractNarration>Materials science consistently delivers game changing advances in the way we live and the disciplines of applied and computational mathematics are increasingly central to these developments. Motivated by this exciting synergy the Symposium on Mathematical and Computational Aspects of Materials Science will be held from 12/1/2014 through 12/4/2014 at the Materials Research Society Fall 2014 Meeting in Boston Massachusetts. The symposium will bring together investigators working at the interface between materials science, mathematics and computational science. This NSF Grant will support graduate students and early career researchers to attend and participate in this symposium. The symposium offers a special opportunity for increasing diversity and breadth of participation by actively engaging a much broader base of younger applied mathematicians than in more standard symposium formats. This symposium format allows graduate students and young investigators to directly interact with the greater research community on interdisciplinary problems coming from the frontiers of materials science and applied mathematics. This feature increases diversity and full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. It exposes graduate students and early career applied mathematicians to contemporary and fundamental theoretical problems challenging materials science; enabling future breakthroughs through interdisciplinary collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goals of the Symposium on Mathematical and Computational Aspects of Materials Science to be held at the 2014 MRS Fall 2014 Meeting in Boston Massachusetts will be to:&lt;br/&gt;1. To foster new scientific collaborations between applied mathematicians and materials scientists in order to address contemporary problems at the frontiers of materials science.&lt;br/&gt;2. Increase diversity and breadth of participation in STEM fields by exposing graduate students and early career applied mathematicians to contemporary and fundamental theoretical problems challenging materials science; enabling future breakthroughs through interdisciplinary collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;3. To expose investigators with expertise in materials science disciplines to the latest applied mathematical and computational frameworks useful for the solution of challenging problems in materials science.</AbstractNarration>
