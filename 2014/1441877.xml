    <AbstractNarration>Polypropylene is the 2nd largest petrochemical commodity and 5th largest produced material in the US. The key step in propylene production is propylene/propane separation achieved by energy intensive cryogenic distillation method. Membrane separation technology is a more energy efficient solution to the separation problem, but propylene perm-selective polymer or inorganic membranes are not stable for this application. Recent study in the principal investigator's laboratory shows a new group of membranes, zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF), to have desired separation properties and stability for the application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ZIFs are highly tailorable with a wide range of chemical, textural, and crystalline properties that can be implemented into a number of other technological applications. The activities proposed in this project are directed towards development of membranes that can be scaled up for industrial olefin/paraffin separation. This project will gain much insight into the fundamental nature of material selection for membrane supports and synthesis and properties of ZIF membranes on scalable supports. The project will increase learning and understanding in membrane science and engineering to the academic community, while also delivering valuable information on how to transition such novel materials into useful industrial applications.</AbstractNarration>
