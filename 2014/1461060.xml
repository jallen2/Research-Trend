    <AbstractNarration>This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a new REU Site at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Each summer, undergraduate students from across the nation will work on challenging research problems related to human computer interaction (HCI) and privacy. Students will work with faculty mentors to use tools and techniques to solve problems that are timely and important. The students will investigate threats against human-action modalities, such as using cameras to spy on touch input or other common everyday interactions with technologies pervasive in our society. This site should help develop computing professionals who can build future computing systems and applications that are secure and trustworthy and that we can all use with confidence. This REU experience provides students with the foundations and inspiration to pursue computing careers and research in areas that are rapidly evolving and impacting all of our citizens. This project is co-funded by the Cyber Corps (R): Scholarship for Service Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and with non-research universities to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science. The site includes a significant research component combined with professional development opportunities for the participating undergraduate students. New HCI technologies create new venues of threats to user privacy and security. Students will investigate defense related approaches to mitigate these threats using techniques such as a secure finger mouse and other countermeasures. The resulting research may contribute to the body of research related to sustaining secure and trustworthy cyberspace. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a diverse scientific workforce with expertise in areas critical to national security in the evolving global society of the future.</AbstractNarration>
