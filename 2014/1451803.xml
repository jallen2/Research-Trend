    <AbstractNarration>Executive function refers to a range of abilities involved in focusing and maintaining attention, and planning actions to achieve goals. The mastery of these abilities influences children's cognitive and social success. Research suggests that infants' movements, such as reaching, crawling and walking, may be important for the development of executive function. The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of locomotor experience on the development of executive function in typically developing, pre-crawling infants. The research uses new technology that lets a baby "drive" a robot by leaning in the direction that the baby wants to travel. This gives babies an early opportunity to develop enhanced locomotor experience which may accelerate the development of executive function. If enhanced locomotor experience also enhances executive function, this may provide an important avenue of support for individuals with conditions that involve motor impairment, such as Down syndrome, developmental coordination disorder, spina bifida, and cerebral palsy, who often exhibit poor executive function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five-month old infants will be randomly assigned to an experimental group that drives the robot during each session or to a control group that does not. Infants will complete twelve 20-minute sessions, followed by a battery of tasks including versions of a Visual Cliff, Means-End, A-not-B, and Switch Task that assess aspects of executive function using eye gaze technology. The hypothesis is that infants who have experience with independent locomotion using the robot will show higher levels of executive function than those without this experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research will provide insight for understanding basic mechanisms involved in the development of executive function. The outcome of this research may also provide a rationale for reconsidering the role of mobility experience for very young children with delayed or limited independent locomotion. Because the research is being conducted at an undergraduate-oriented institution, the project will provide significant hands-on research experiences for numerous undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
