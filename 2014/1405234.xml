    <AbstractNarration>Fundamental Investigations of Nanolaser Physics: Statistical Properties, Thermal Stability, and Temporal Dynamics of Light Emission&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscale lasers, with dimensions smaller than their operating wavelength, have the potential to offer unprecedented communication, sensing, and illumination functionalities, due to their incredibly small footprint and energy budget. However, the fundamental properties of nanolaser light emission are poorly understood, in particular their statistical properties. The objectives of this research are to develop a theoretical model describing the dynamics of nanolasers based on a rigorous set of measurements and to demonstrate electronically controlled nanolasers operating at room temperature. These nanoscale lasers would find applications in quantum communications and computation networks for secure communications and for modeling of complex systems like the Earth's climate. In addition, nanolasers have the potential for sensing bio-chemical agents in extremely small volumes for healthcare applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall significance of the proposed effort is to further advance the fundamental knowledge of nanoscale lasers. Nanolasers, which are formed from metallic, insulating, and semi-conducting materials, have temperature-dependent properties. The thermal stability of these lasers is intricately coupled to their emission properties. Additionally, the light emission and thermal properties generally evolve in time. Therefore, a theoretical model describing the dynamics of nanolasers, coupled with their statistical and thermal characteristics will be developed. The Purcell effect in quantum dissipative systems will be investigated to describe the sub-threshold behavior in nanolasers. Experimental objectives of this project include the design and analysis of second and/or higher order coherence measurements tailored for semiconductor telecom wavelength nanolasers at various temperatures. Electrically pumped coaxial nanolasers for continuous wave operation at room temperature will be fabricated and characterized. Results of these experiments will lead to construct more accurate models of nanolaser dynamics.</AbstractNarration>
