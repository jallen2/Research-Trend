    <AbstractNarration>This project, submitted in response to the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) announcement, is jointly funded by the Condensed Matter Physics and Ceramic Programs in the Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project has a number of objectives. The first objective is to involve up to 40 undergraduate students in publishable research in glass science over the duration of the project. New oxide glasses are being prepared using novel techniques such as fast cooling, laser heating and new chemical pathways. As well, they are examining the intermediate range order of glass on the level of a handful of atoms. Finally they are producing glasses that have new technical applications. For example, one family of glasses is being developed to detect neutrons for medical and national security purposes. The project has broad impact by training undergraduate students in many aspects of glass research, ~75% will continue to graduate school; running workshops to inform colleagues how to conduct high level research at small colleges, and inviting high school students to join this work and working with pre-college students of all grades in eastern Iowa on science programs at Coe College and in local schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: It is likely that the most transformational part of this work concerns the determination of the intermediate range order of oxide glasses of up to ten atoms or so. This outstanding scientific problem concerns such phenomena as ionic conduction, the mixed-alkali effect, and viscosity and relaxation effects. The experimental means for this study include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with a focus on boron using both of its isotopes separately as well as isotopic dilutions and boron Double Angle Rotation NMR, neutron scattering, dual atomic force microscopy/Raman spectroscopy, and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Physical property determinations complement these measurements. Simultaneous to this work is the development of novel glasses using rapid cooling, laser levitation, and alternative chemical means. One application for this is the development of semiconducting lithium borovanadate glasses for neutron detection. Broader impacts include the thorough training of up to 40 undergraduate students in research, including their daily use of many state-of-the art instruments, the involvement of high school students and their teachers in research, outreach to younger students, and leadership service within the glass science field. A new and important component of this project is the mentoring and hosting of workshops for colleagues at other colleges interested in doing high-level research with their students.</AbstractNarration>
