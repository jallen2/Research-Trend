    <AbstractNarration>Many questions in mathematics concern the behavior of curved objects. In a discrete setting, certain of these questions date to antiquity and take the form of seeking integral solutions to Diophantine equations, which can also be viewed as points lying on a "curved" variety. In a continuous setting, such questions can take the form of asking how an operator transforms a function when it averages the function over a curved submanifold. This proposal considers a broad class of questions in number theory and harmonic analysis involving objects with curvature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will develop methodological advances for the circle method, character sums, and sieves, leading to applications to a wide array of number theoretic questions that can be interpreted as counting solutions to systems of Diophantine equations. In addition, the PI will investigate polynomial Carleson operators of Radon type, for which the presence of curvature introduces both new difficulties and beautiful new structure. Finally, the PI will apply number theoretic and analytic methods to prove operator bounds for discrete arithmetic operators involving curvature. At the heart of all these problems lies the investigation of oscillatory integrals and their discrete cousins character sums. Throughout the duration of the research program, the PI will promote mathematics to the broader community and encourage the participation of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
