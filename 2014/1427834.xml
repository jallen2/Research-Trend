    <AbstractNarration>a non-technical explanation &lt;br/&gt;This project will evaluate whether advanced environmental assessment tools can be used in a remote and ecologically stressed agricultural watershed. A new international collaboration will be formed through a project designed to evaluate suitability and geographic transferability of current strategies for measuring occurrence and ecological effects of non-point source contamination. The project will train U.S. graduate students and future Kazakh scientists and engineers in methods for studying contaminants and effects and also will advance environmental science by developing a geographically-neutral framework for assessment of non-point source contamination.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop and pilot project will help build a framework useful in Kazakhstan and other developing countries promoting agricultural development while maintaining or improving environmental quality. Graduate students will have a chance to work together and will gain valuable international experience. The outcomes of this workshop and pilot project will benefit Kazakhstan and other developing countries thus improving international environmental security. The workshop and pilot project will enhance educational modules of existing graduate courses taught by project investigators. An interactive website will compare water monitoring activities and outcomes of the workshop and pilot project with efforts from Nebraska Watershed Network whose mission is to involve students and local stakeholders in projects that focus on the environmental stewardship of freshwater resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a technical description&lt;br/&gt;While developing countries move toward modern agricultural practices, they often do not have the infrastructure to monitor and evaluate impacts to water quality. Ecological degradation can accelerate to levels impacting agricultural productivity and environmental security. This workshop and pilot project will permit investigators to identify research questions related to water and sediment quality and ecological effects of nonpoint source contaminants that will help sustain productivity, while maintaining environmental quality. Few watersheds have sustained the degree of ecological and chemical impact in the Syr Darya river basin. Close study using state-of-the-art tools to study occurrence and effects of currently- and historically-used agrichemicals will help better evaluate and minimize future impacts. Moreover, initial results from this study will help form a framework for the assessment of the occurrence and ecological impacts of nonpoint source contaminants in Kazakhstan and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;A team from the U.S. will build on their current research in the fields of environmental chemistry and bioavailability to improve our understanding of chemistry and ecological effects of organic contaminants in aquatic environments. Objectives are to: 1) Hold an international workshop to present and compare approaches for measuring and predicting the ecological effects of biologically active contaminants in the Syr Darya river basin; and 2) Using a pilot project approach, develop a framework for measuring occurrence and ecological impacts of nonpoint source contamination in a remote ecosystem in Kazakhstan. Project participants in Kazakhstan are affiliated with al-Farabi Kazakh National University in Almaty, KZ and include Mukhambetkali Burkitbayev, Bolat Uralbekov, Omirzha Taukebayev and Nadir S. Mamylov.</AbstractNarration>
