    <AbstractNarration>Using physical buildings as a metaphor for software systems is a well-established idea, dating back at least to Fred Brooks' book, The Mythical Man-Month, from the mid-1970s. A recent paper by Landwehr suggests that software systems on whose security we rely might be more trustworthy if the software analog of a building code were developed and applied to them. This proposal is to support planning and participant travel for a workshop that aims to develop both (1) an initial draft for a building code for a specific domain of software-controlled systems, medical devices, which compose a domain of cyberspace in which security and trustworthiness are particularly critical, and (2) a related agenda for research into assuring desired security properties of such systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop is to advance the adoption of proven techniques for assuring that software controlling medical devices is free of common sorts of vulnerabilities and to develop a research agenda that will provide the basis for continuing improvement of the security of future medical device software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop could lead to significantly less vulnerable medical device software systems and could also motivate appropriate research in the area. The techniques for using a building code structure can be used to extend the approach to other possible software domains where security is a critical consideration.</AbstractNarration>
