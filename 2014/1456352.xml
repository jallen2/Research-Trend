    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of&lt;br/&gt;surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and&lt;br/&gt;reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000&lt;br/&gt;procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of&lt;br/&gt;these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into&lt;br/&gt;longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision&lt;br/&gt;surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,&lt;br/&gt;while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as&lt;br/&gt;the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are&lt;br/&gt;avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has&lt;br/&gt;the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image&lt;br/&gt;guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally&lt;br/&gt;invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a&lt;br/&gt;novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during&lt;br/&gt;surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than&lt;br/&gt;fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with&lt;br/&gt;surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical&lt;br/&gt;inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by&lt;br/&gt;showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a&lt;br/&gt;variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)&lt;br/&gt;confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an&lt;br/&gt;ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a&lt;br/&gt;system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus&lt;br/&gt;fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these&lt;br/&gt;objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,&lt;br/&gt;regulatory clearance and commercialization.</AbstractNarration>
