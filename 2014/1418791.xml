    <AbstractNarration>The workshop Statistical Analysis of Neural Data (SAND7) will take place May 27-29, 2015, at the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, run jointly by the Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, in Pittsburgh PA. Major advances in neural recording and imaging technologies have put into the hands of investigators wonderful tools for conducting previously unimagined experiments, yielding rich data sources that can shed new light on basic neuroscience and its clinical implications. The data sets are, however, often large and complex, so that novel methods of analysis are needed if the wealth of new information is to be turned into useful knowledge. (SAND7) will bring together euro-physiologists, statisticians, physicists, and computer scientists who are interested in quantitative analysis of neuronal data. The scientific lectures will be given by 6 keynote speakers, and 12 junior investigators. Each keynote lecture will be followed by an invited discussion of the topic. There will also be a poster session. Authors will be encouraged to submit papers to the Journal of Computational Neuroscience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAND7 is the seventh workshop in a series that began in 2002. The objectives of the workshop are to define important problems in neuronal data analysis and useful strategies for attacking them; foster communication between experimental neuroscientists and those trained in statistical and computational methods; and provide further dissemination of the findings presented at the workshop via a set of peer-reviewed articles. Other objectives are to encourage young researchers, including graduate students, to present their work; expose young researchers to important challenges and opportunities in this interdisciplinary domain, while providing a small meeting atmosphere to facilitate the interaction of young researchers with senior colleagues; and include as participants women, under-represented minorities and persons with disabilities who might benefit from the small workshop environment.
