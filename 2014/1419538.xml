    <AbstractNarration>This award is being made to organize a special workshop to discuss successful approaches for development of novel instrumentation for biological research and to realize the full potential of such instrumentation through broad dissemination and outreach. The workshop agenda will identify successful approaches for (1) Interdisciplinary collaborations of biologists and instrument developers, (2) Inclusion of students and postdoctoral researchers in biological instrumentation development, (3) Opportunities for U.S. interagency collaboration to promote synergistic instrument development efforts (4) Entrepreneurial activities that allow the first proof-of-concept prototype to be transformed into commercial instrumentation (5) Best practices for education and outreach, and (6) Feedback from current Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program principal investigators (PIs) on the effectiveness of the IDBR program. The workshop will bring together: 1) active researchers representing diverse branches of biological sciences; 2) physicists and engineers who are experts in relevant instrument development technologies; 3) National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health program managers; 4) successful entrepreneurs; 5) university personnel responsible for graduate training and for technology transfer and commercialization; and 6) graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting organizers and invited speakers are diverse in terms of career stage, gender, type of institution, and geographical region. The PIs will recruit and actively encourage participation of early-career investigators, students, and members of underrepresented groups in the fields of engineering and biology. To do so, the PIs will use email, word of mouth, society newsletters, announcements, and advertising. The PIs will communicate/disseminate results of the workshop by compiling in a detailed report the highlights of the presentations and discussions as well as meeting outcomes and future directions and recommendations. The report will be submitted to NSF and a modified version will be submitted for publication in a biotechnology journal(e.g. Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology, Biotechniques, etc.). The goals of the workshop are aligned with goals of the Instrument Development for Biological research (IDBR) program, which seeks to develop and disseminate instrumentation that is potentially transformative for biological research.</AbstractNarration>
