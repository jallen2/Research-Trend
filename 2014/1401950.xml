    <AbstractNarration>In this CNIC program, Dr. Tarl Prow (Deputy Director, Dermatology Research Center, University of Queensland) and the PI propose an innovative mechanism for minimally invasive and in situ detection of melanoma progression using novel microscale devices that contain microneedles as well as microarrays, which detect chemical processes specific to melanoma. Three graduate research assistants (US citizens or US permanent residents) will travel to Dr. Prow's laboratory for four month periods to perform the following tasks: (1) synthesis of microneedle devices for transdermal detection of melanoma, (2) microneedle-skin characterization and mechanical characterization, and (3) studies to assess the functionality of microneedle-microarray devices for detection of melanoma. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed effort is to catalyze new international collaborations between the PI and Dr. Prow, who are uniquely qualified to achieve the program goals. Dr. Prow's lab has pioneered efforts involving microneedle-based detection of melanoma. The PI?s lab has pioneered research efforts involving rapid prototyping of microneedles for transdermal drug delivery and sensing. The project will contrbute to improved melanoma treatment by enabling small samples to be repeatedly obtained from single lesions over time, thus allowing molecular mechanisms involved in melanomagenesis to be better understood. The PI is leading a series of lectures and scientific demonstrations in Raleigh for young people in the broader community; these "Science Saturday" events take place at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. The PI and students will incorporate results and demonstration materials from the project in these events.</AbstractNarration>
