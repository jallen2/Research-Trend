    <AbstractNarration>Building on our previous research and educational work in online privacy, this project proposes to develop a Teacher's Kit that supports high school educators and undergraduate instructors in teaching fundamental principles and best practices for online behavior to protect privacy. The proposal plans to develop classroom-ready teaching modules to teach young people why and how to protect their privacy online, and a Teacher's Guide with background information, suggested lesson plans, and guidance on how to employ the modules in the classroom. The project's 5- to 10-minute videos, featuring experts explaining important concepts and effective protection techniques in accessible terms, will be accompanied by classroom discussion guides and stand-alone activities in which students explore how the structure of the Internet affects online privacy. The team for this effort consists of privacy researchers, who have a track record of privacy-related technical publications, curriculum developers and hands-on educators. The project team will include educators and interns from the Berkeley Foundation for Opportunities in Information Technology (BFOIT) that nurtures computing talent in local minority and female high-school students. The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program funds proposals that address Cybersecurity from a Trustworthy Computing Systems perspective; a Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences perspective; and proposals focusing entirely on Cybersecurity Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the lack of comprehensive set of field-tested teaching materials to meet current U.S. curricular standards related to privacy. It grounds higher-level privacy concepts and best practices for behavior by providing students with a solid grasp of how the technical architecture of the Internet affects online privacy. The project emphasizes individual protective behaviors sets as oppose to government regulation or industry policy which dominate practical applications of privacy research. The project will develop classroom-ready teaching modules to provide students with an understanding of some basic technical and social principles underlying how online privacy works, knowledge of effective techniques they can use to protect their privacy, and the motivation to use those techniques when they go online.</AbstractNarration>
