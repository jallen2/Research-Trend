    <AbstractNarration>This grant partially supports 20 students at institutions across the U.S. to participate in the Doctoral Consortium at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern 2014 Recognition (CVPR). CVPR is the premier annual conference with about 2000 senior and student participants in computer vision, held in North America and attended by members of the international research community. The Doctoral Consortium is to highlight the work of senior Ph.D. students, who are close to finishing their degrees, or recent graduates, and to give these students the opportunity to discuss their research with senior researchers matched with their expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project enables top-quality Ph.D. students to present, discuss, and receive feedback on original research within the broader community are all critical components of graduate student development. The opportunity to receive advice on their research and career plans from experts from different institutions, and with potentially different perspectives, in many cases is not available internally within one's own institution. This project supports the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computer vision, contributes to the computer research community and related fields in general by drawing attention to an important aspect of graduate student development, and potentially increasing the number of active researchers and teachers in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
