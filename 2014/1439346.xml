    <AbstractNarration>The stability of DNA allows an organism to live and reproduce, but changes in the genome provide a means for the evolution of a species in response to a changing environment. Plant breeding has always relied on changes in DNA for generating the genetic variation needed to develop new varieties. Some of these changes in the genome occur in a controlled manner during normal seed development, but this can also occur following DNA damage after exposure to excessive light, ozone and UV. Biotechnological manipulation of the plant genome has allowed us to induce controlled genomic changes in plants, providing a huge potential for molecularly designed plant breeding. Research by the more than 80 laboratories in this field continues to rapidly expand the understanding of how plants deal with environmental and endogenous threats to their growth, development, and genomic stability, to advance the long-standing goals of gene targeting and site-directed mutagenesis of plants, and to develop technologies for the acceleration of plant breeding. Individuals with previous training and experience in repair and recombination, who have moved into plant models, have created a dynamic and productive new discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to help support travel for 10 young scientists to attend a conference on Plant Genome Stability and Change is scheduled for July 17-20, 2014 at the Asilomar Conference Center, in Pacific Grove, California. The meeting plans to bring together an international group of senior and junior investigators, postdocs and graduate students working in or interested in the area of DNA repair and epigenetics and expose them to cutting-edge science via talks and posters. The meeting venue is also expected to promote lively and wide-ranging discussions that include all attendees, after talks and in more informal settings. The organizers plan to encourage, to the fullest extent possible, participation by women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
