    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop 3D virtual replicas of common engineering laboratory experiments that can improve learning impact and broaden access to engineering laboratory materials for undergraduate students. The virtual laboratory improves the learning impact in that users have a safer means to explore the experiments and can view the experimental equipment and setup in ways that are not possible in real-world laboratories. Additionally, users are free to repeat the experiments as many times as they want without consuming additional real-world materials or laboratory time costs. Further, the virtual laboratory allows users to make mistakes safely and learn from both successful and incorrect experiments; such "learning by exploring via negative examples" is currently not feasible in real-world laboratories due to safety and time constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research team aims to continue developing interfaces for engineering labs, specifically four 3D virtual gaming strength of materials laboratories including Beam Bending, Column Buckling, Fatigue, and Pressure vessel tests. Together with the three completed virtual simulations developed in the first phase of the project, they cover all the learning outcomes of the Strength of Materials Lab course and complete the transformation of the improved learning experience for this specific lab. This learning model could easily be expanded to include interfaces for other subject labs such as mechanical engineering, chemistry, biology, physics, and others.</AbstractNarration>
