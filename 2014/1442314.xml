    <AbstractNarration>All animals must sense their environment and other organisms to find food, avoid threats, and find partners. The ability of some individuals to locate food and mates more effectively than others can open opportunities for them to leave many more descendants. And yet, multiple advanced sensory systems seldom evolve in the same species despite the advantages they may confer, suggesting there are physical limits to developing several specialized senses. This project focuses on a diverse group of tropical bats in which various species evolved acute, specialized hearing, supersensitive eyes, the ability to smell subtle plant chemicals, or highly developed vomeronasal systems (thought to contribute to mating and social hierarchy). This project will compare approximately 2000 genes involved in vision, hearing, olfaction and the vomeronasal system in more than 150 bat species. To find out how some of these genes contribute to developing distinct sensory systems, their actions will be studied in the lab. This research will uncover the role of specific genes in the acquisition of specialized senses, test whether the size of the head limits the number of specialized sensory structures a species can have, and discover how sensory adaptations contribute to the diversity of species through time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will uncover the evolution of genes and structures of the auditory, visual, and olfactory and vomeronasal systems in a large superfamily of bats characterized by diverse sensory adaptations associated with specific diets. Analyses of gene evolution will be used to test the hypothesis that sensory innovations arise through gene duplication and positive selection. Measurements of gene expression from tissues collected in the field, and experiments to express key bat genes in developing embryos will be used to elucidate how genes shape adaptive sensory structures. Comparative analyses of detailed measurements of the size of sensory structures will evaluate trade-offs between sensory systems and the way these may limit diversity of diets or species. State-of-the art methods to quantify relationships between gene and trait evolution and species diversity will be used to discover the impact of sensory adaptation on species diversity through time. This research will illuminate the main biological forces in the genome, during embryonic development, and in anatomical structures that contribute to the success of species in adapting to their ever-challenging environment.</AbstractNarration>
