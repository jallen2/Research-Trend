    <AbstractNarration>PI: Goldfarb, Jillian L.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1125754&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shifting our dependence from fossil fuels to carbon-neutral sources is a gradual process. Co-combustion of biomass in existing coal-fired power plants is an attractive option to increase the share of renewable fuels in the energy market. Designing equipment for these blends requires knowledge of pyrolysis and combustion characteristics to maximize energy output, reduce emissions and optimize fuel ratios. The objectives of this research are to: obtain thermal evolution profiles (kinetics and devolatilized compounds) of region-specific coal-biomass blends and probe the effect of heating rate, particle size, and coal to biomass blend ratios on pyrolysis and combustion behavior. A systematic study on locally available second generation feedstocks (agricultural wastes - woods, wheat and corn stalks, and local manufacturing wastes - cocoa shells, barley, hops, fruit pits) blended with coal used by regional power plants will provide knowledge for the incorporation of locally-sourced organic refuse into power generation, and a broader understanding of optimizing such blends for energy generation. The proposed work aims to bridge the gap between fossil fuel dependency and a green energy future while expanding opportunities for students from underrepresented groups to ensure our future engineering workforce is as diverse as the population it serves.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Given infrastructure already in place for coal, the most likely avenue in the immediate future for biomass utilization is as a blended feedstock in coal-fired power plants. Coal-biomass blending has the potential to limit the overall cost of fuel for a power plant, assuming the costs to process the biomass (transportation, drying, milling, etc.) are lower than the coal while lowering the carbon footprint of energy production. This proposal explores the thermodynamics and kinetics behind coal-biomass blend combustion to maximize process efficiency, while simultaneously monitoring devolatilized compounds to ensure the co-combustion of biomass and coal represents an improvement in the emissions profile. The knowledge garnered from this work is immediately applicable to state air resource permitting agencies, and directly addresses the EPA's debate over the next three years on how to regulate biomass emissions. The proposed work also provides fundamental data on the behavior of U.S.-specific biomass-coal blends to assist in the transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources; the design of an effective thermochemical conversion unit requires knowledge of the chemical composition, thermal behavior, and reactivity of the fuel in question.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Altering our workforce to more accurately mirror the composition of our society is a gradual process, requiring strong mentors and role models. If we are broadly inclusive -seeking out contributions from all perspectives - we can solve issues surrounding energy and the environment for future generations. The potential benefits of the proposed project to society are twofold: first, by investigating the blending of biomass with coal we can potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining current energy production. Second, by actively seeking students (graduate and undergraduate) from traditionally underrepresented groups, we better leverage our human capital to facilitate a diverse, competitive and globally engaged workforce. As many UNH students choose to remain in New England after graduation, a project that specifically addresses local energy needs prepares them to understand regional issues when competing on the job market. To engage the public and industry, the students and PI will present findings from this research at academic conferences and in peer-reviewed publications, and in technical reports to assist in policy-making and industrial energy production schemes. As part of her Broadening Participation Plan, the PI proposes to implement a seminar series called "Engaging Your Future" to the science and engineering community at UNH to work with students on overcoming challenges they face as underrepresented groups, building a resume, and identifying career opportunities. As a woman with a disability, the PI is in a unique position to mentor students from traditionally underrepresented groups through building a research agenda with direct applicability today?s challenges in energy and the environment.</AbstractNarration>
