    <AbstractNarration>This project proposes to increase, within the NSF?fs broadening participation initiative, the number and quality of SBIR/STTR proposals submitted to the NSF by entrepreneurs from the Central Illinois Region, with a specific emphasis on women scientists that tend to be underrepresented in many STEM fields (National Science Foundation, 2013). This proposal also seeks to leverage regional diversity knowledge, experience, efforts, and programs to attract a strong cadre of participants and support their successful completion of the program. Members of other underrepresented groups will be a secondary focus of our targeted efforts, but no less important. The ultimate, long term goal is to foster broad--?]based, sustainable economic development in the region. Currently, as with most engineering and entrepreneurial programs, women--?]led teams comprise a smaller than desired percentage of our participants. Through the programs outlined in this proposal we plan on developing a model that can be used in central Illinois and elsewhere to build a pipeline of future women entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs from other underrepresented groups, training current entrepreneurs, and supporting existing entrepreneurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed project will take a new approach to encourage the participation of female entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs from other underrepresented groups. This is done through taking a new approach of providing resources that encourage those from underrepresented groups to participate in the available entrepreneurial ecosystem and then surrounding them with support. Such resources include making available an entrepreneur--?]in--?]residence familiar with the needs of those from underrepresented groups and providing small proof--?]of--?]concept grants to qualified teams. Once the teams are in the system they will be supported through training and curriculum that introduces teams to the skills to not only submit a high quality SBIR proposal, but also to launch and execute a successful STEM--?]related new venture. The skills that teams will be introduced to during the courses include: product development, evaluating opportunities, and putting together a successful application.</AbstractNarration>
