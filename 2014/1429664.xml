    <AbstractNarration>The University of Montana (UM) College of Humanities and Sciences (CH&amp;S) will utilize NSF-MRI funding to acquire a Breuckmann SmartScan 3D Scanner for the purpose of education and research among faculty, staff, and students in various departments, including Anthropology, Computer Science, Biology, and Geosciences. The research applications of this equipment include high resolution digital capturing of prehistoric and historic artifacts, fossils, and biological materials for the purpose of morphometric examination, preservation, and curation. Educational applications include teaching morphometric analysis and digital forensic reconstruction techniques. The 3D scanner will be located in the Social Science Research Laboratory (SSRL), which is operated and maintained by the CH&amp;S. The SSRL offers a computer-oriented teaching environment and a technical research laboratory to faculty, staff, and students in the College of Humanities and Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition of this instrument offers significant intellectual merit. The PI, co-PI, and other UM faculty use the high resolution 3D scanner to expand their research capabilities as well as the educational offerings available to students. The quality of ongoing research is greatly enhanced by this technology and it provides an impetus for students and staff to pursue new research directions. Investigation and development of standardized methods for improving the overall quality of research associated with artifacts, fossils, and other items are already underway at UM. However, the capabilities offered by this instrumentation permit this research to grow to its full potential. The ability to perform high resolution 3D scanning in-house allows UM scholars to be on the leading edge of three dimensional object imaging and analysis based research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant transforms 3D imaging research and the education capabilities currently available at the UM and thus offers a range of broader impacts. The faculty and researchers involved in this grant project are committed to diversity and have a reputation for working with a diverse student body that includes underrepresented populations such as Native Americans, women, non-traditional, and special needs students. Involvement with research projects utilizing technological equipment fosters interest and encourages these students to seek careers in the science and technology fields by offering better opportunities for advancing their education. Acquisition of the Breuckmann SmartScan 3D Scanner allows UM the ability to capture unique and fragile artifacts in a high precision digital format that can be made readily available for educators and researchers through digitally rendered files. This increases the availability of special materials and allows pieces to remain safe while exact replicas are in use, bolstering K-20 outreach efforts by producing items that can leave the laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
