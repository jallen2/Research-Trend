    <AbstractNarration>In this project, a group of investigators participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will measure profiles of actinium-227, a naturally-occurring radioisotope that can be used as a tracer of oceanic water movement, in the Arctic Ocean. In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. The isotope measured as part of this study, actinium-227, has a 22 year half-life, making it well-suited as a tracer of mixing and solute transport in the Arctic Ocean. This study will involve educational opportunities in scientific research for high school and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantifying the biogeochemical dynamics of the deep sea is necessary to understand the ocean carbon cycle. Despite having a half-life that is well suited for the study of both vertical and lateral transport in the deep ocean, few actinium-227 measurements have been made in the deep sea. Recent advances in instrumentation facilitate this analysis, and the synergy provided by the GEOTRACES program will provide an ideal opportunity to obtain additional data that will serve two purposes. The measurements of actinium-227 from this study will aid in defining the rates of boundary exchange, particularly when combined with estimates based on radium-228 (measured as part of a separate award) and will be useful for deducing the transport and the dynamics of other solutes measured by GEOTRACES in deep waters. By using multiple tracers with different half-lives, the separate roles of these processes may be distinguished, allowing a more complete understanding of the dynamics of solute behaviors.</AbstractNarration>
