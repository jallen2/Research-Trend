    <AbstractNarration>There is a need to transform supercomputer and other cyberinfrastructure (CI) resource provisioning procedures and practices on campuses with federated, hybrid cloud services handled by specialized expertise of a CI Engineer. The CI Engineer complements campus system/network engineering personnel, and leads the seamless orchestration of provisioning local and remote resources (e.g., cyber-enabled scientific instruments, public clouds) to meet data-intensive research and education needs of faculty and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates roles, tools and policies that enable the viability and sustainability of the CI Engineer position. More than just exploration, the project involves several pilot experiments with domain-application workflows. The experiments consider connectivity and communication procedures necessary for transitioning interdisciplinary collaborations from experimental environments to production systems. To automate the provisioning of application-specific resources, custom templates are being developed for diverse data-intensive (web-based) applications. The custom templates abstract the high-level policy and performance throughput requirements of data-intensive applications, and personalize them to lower-level control specifications implementable in an on-demand manner by virtualization technologies such as OpenStack and OpenFlow. Lastly, case studies, best practices and open-source software applications are to be generated to foster hybrid cloud service models in research and education, while avoiding many layers of co-ordination. Significant attention is being paid to broadening participation of underrepresented groups, and to the CI Engineer interaction with peer communities that are addressing challenges of next-generation campus cyberinfrastructures.</AbstractNarration>
