    <AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;The NSF-IRES program Nanomaterials undergraduate Research in Germany (NanoRING) will provide 10-week nanoresearch opportunities at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany for five US undergraduates from the combined student pool of Northwestern University (NU) and the Univerity of Texas in San Antonio (UTSA), a minority serving institution and partner of NU. The specific research focus is on nanomaterials covering the subtopics of nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, and nano-biomaterials. This thematic base leverages TUM?s International Graduate School of Science and Engineering (IGSSE).&lt;br/&gt;The research opportunity will be for undergraduates only, in order to motivate and inspire young US researchers to invest in a future research career. Particularly at UTSA, specific efforts will be made to reach out to underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines so that the cohort?s constituency will meet or exceed NSF?s goals for representation. Individual German collaborators from within IGSSE have provided letters of collaboration to host visiting student researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;Unique materials science expertise outside of the U.S. is particularly strong in Germany. Electron transport experiments, crystal growth, heterostructure design, graphene characterization, quantum dot spectroscopy, biosensor nanotechnology, and photonic emitters / detectors all represent topics of research expertise and mentorship that will benefit U.S. students. By training U.S. graduate and undergraduate students at these facilities, students can learn unique skills to advance their education and training. Furthermore, since they are researching&lt;br/&gt;abroad, students will develop an identity within the international scientific community, building up a professional network and getting a first-hand perspective of larger scope of a research career. The administrative structure of NanoRING will leverage existing infrastructures at German universities through TUM?s graduate school for international students IGSSE where the administrators have exhaustive experience hosting international student research visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the greatest intended payoffs of a student research-abroad experience is career retention. By developing engineering and science skills in a supportive and engaging multicultural environment, undergraduates will recognize their place within an international peer community and will be motivated to continue their positive experience in a career in STEM research. This is particularly important for underrepresented groups within STEM disciplines. To enhance participation of underrepresented groups, outreach to target student groups will meet or exceed NSF goals for representation by coordinating with minority student groups at both NU and UTSA. After the visit abroad, students will make a scientific presentation to their home institution, and to their underrepresented group, where applicable. The will also have the opportunity to apply for an additional Publication Award to publish or present their scientific work at a conference, promoting broad dissemination of results. A post-program assessment will assess program structure &amp; content, track career choices, and a questionnaire will discern the impact that these research-abroad experience had on the students, their peers, and the broader scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
