    <AbstractNarration>This award will support 13 US participants, both indigenous and non-indigenous early career researchers, to attend the "Connecting Early Career Researchers and Community-driven Research in the North" workshop organized during the Arctic Science Summit Week and the Arctic Observing Summit (AOS) from 5 - 11 April 2014 in Helsinki, Finland (www.assw2014.fi), with the workshop scheduled for April 7th and 8th. The workshop is listed as a line item on the ASSW registration form and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) has set up a workshop webpage containing information on the workshop itself &lt;http://www.apecs.is/research/apecs-norden/apecs-norden-workshop&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Helsinki workshop is part of a larger research project APECS is currently conducting, "Bridging Early Career Researchers and Indigenous Peoples in Nordic Countries," which is partially sponsored by the Nordic Council of Ministers Nordic Council (NORDEN). The research project is designed to "leverage the research, education, and outreach experience of the APECS network to identify ways to enhance the engagement between Early Career Researchers and Indigenous peoples in Nordic regions." As noted during the Indigenous Peoples' Global Summit on Climate Change in Anchorage (2009), the knowledge and contributions of indigenous peoples in addressing climate change have largely been ignored. One of the outcomes of the Summit was the recognition that incorporation of indigenous knowledge into Arctic research, as well as efforts to better connect and facilitate communication between Northern residents and researcher, are crucial to help develop climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. The research project was in part a response to the Summit and this proposed workshop is one part of the larger project to better engage early career researchers (ECRs), Indigenous communities, and Arctic residents in dialogues that foster active working relationships where knowledge and experience can be shared and contributed to shaping the future of Arctic research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is planned for 60 participants including indigenous and non-indigenous early career researchers, mentors and experts. APECS has strong experience in organizing career development and thematic workshops and believes that connecting the "Bridging" workshop to ASSW and the AOS will increase attendance as well as provide an excellent platform to bring together ECRs, senior scientists, Indigenous Peoples, representatives of International organizations, and media in order to educate and train participants about the interaction between the scientific community and indigenous communities. Among others, experts attending ASSW 2014 will serve as mentors for the workshop, and together with representatives from Indigenous peoples organizations will provide advice and help to thoroughly develop the program.</AbstractNarration>
