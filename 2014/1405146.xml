    <AbstractNarration>A group is an algebraic structure capturing the abstract properties of the collection of symmetries of a geometric object or of a physical or mechanical system. The project will concentrate on the study of free-by-cyclic groups. These groups are natural counterparts of the fundamental groups of fibered 3-manifolds, which are important mathematical objects playing key roles in Topology, Differential Geometry, Ergodic Theory, Number Theory, Computational Complexity, and other branches of Mathematics. Compared with the 3-manifold groups, the free-by-cyclic groups are much less well understood, even though they exhibit a considerably wider variety of interesting features and behavior. The project aims to study the geometry and dynamics of free-by-cyclic groups, particularly through exploring new polynomial invariants of these groups. This research should help better understand both the differences and the similarities between the free-by-cyclic groups and their 3-manifold "cousins", and lead to new insights about the interactions of algebra and dynamics in group theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will build on the new work of the proposer, joint with Leininger and Dowdall, studying the properties of free-by-cyclic groups by means of a "folded mapping torus", associated to such a group. The folded mapping torus comes equipped with a natural semi-flow of continuous transformations, and it encodes in a particularly useful and accessible form key algebraic, geometric and dynamical information about the group. Another key object, associated to the folded mapping torus, is the "McMullen polynomial", which is a free-by-cyclic analog of the Teichmuller polynomial for fibered 3-manifolds. The main overall research goal of the project is to understand algebraic, geometric and dynamical features related to the many possible ways in which a free-by-cyclic group G can split as a free-by-cyclic group and as an ascending HNN-extension of a free group, and to gain new knowledge about free group automorphisms. Specific problems to be studied include: understanding the relationship between the "cone of sections" of folded mapping torus with the BNS-invariant of the group, uniformizing the stable trees and the Cannon-Thurston maps associated with different splittings of G, studying irreducibility properties of monodromy automorphisms associated to different free-by-cyclic splittings of G, developing an analog of the homological zeta-function for G, and others.</AbstractNarration>
