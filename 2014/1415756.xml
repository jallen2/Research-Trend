    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project's broader/commercial impact is to create a shift of the national educational paradigm in education so students succeed and employers have a ready pool of highly skilled, math and science fluent employees; especially, students that can graduate career and college ready to fill and thrive in professional technical positions. A primary focus of this project?s programming is to attract minorities, girls/women, students with disabilities and other underrepresented populations and to actively influence these populations toward educational attainment; especially in STEM skills. The project outcome will result in scalable technology/know-how that will impact the broad arena of education and will have sustaining economic, commercial and societal benefits to populations not being reached on a large scale currently. The commercial outcome of the proposed SBIR project leads to a marketable product and/or process that warrant significant NSF support. This SBIR project will create scalable technology and know-how that will impact a broad arena of education leading the way to practical solutions for both students and teachers in math and science skill enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to renovate the current educational model in instructional technology using innovative design to transform students' declining interest and proficiency in mathematics and science; cultivating a foundation for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) expertise in learners of all ages. The project will develop and deploy compelling educational technology that promotes student interest, skill and proficiency in mathematics and science. To achieve this, the developers will fabricate, deploy and commercialize hybrid experiential educational technology through instructional kits comprising developed apparatus, curricula and methodology. Curricula will be focused on STEM-targeted activities and projects specifically designed for high interest, multi-sensory, hands-on student lessons. Employing curriculum that is highly engaging using teaching strategies developed specifically for an alternative presentation of math and science instruction that is innovative, intensive, and integrated will be the primary objective of this SBIR project. This project is designed to offer practical solutions to both students and teachers in math and science educational enhancement by providing learning tools applied to real world life skills. Embedded in the instructional technology are approaches for students to increase confidence, competence, and self-esteem especially for underserved and underrepresented students; increasing their college and career readiness.</AbstractNarration>
