    <AbstractNarration>Abstract Title: A New Detector for Measuring Polarized Light: Modeling, Characterization, and&lt;br/&gt;Testing for Significantly Improved Imaging Capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Abstract: Current polarized light photodetectors suffer from low spatial and/or temporal resolution, &lt;br/&gt;or they experience systematic error. This is due to multiple detectors needed to fully characterize polarized light,&lt;br/&gt;which often require measurements at different times. This limits high-resolution polarized light imaging; a process&lt;br/&gt;that is critical for applications ranging from astronomy to biomedical imaging to pharmaceuticals. The research&lt;br/&gt;under this grant will investigate the development of a polarized light detector (polarimeter) capable of overcoming&lt;br/&gt;existing limitations, as well as adding new functionality not currently available. This will be achieved by taking&lt;br/&gt;advantage of the unique optoelectronic properties of polymer semiconductors. Multiple semitransparent organic &lt;br/&gt;photodetectors will be processed at a single spatial location and the multicell stack will be optimized to develop&lt;br/&gt;a polarimeter with advanced capabilities. This grant also provides an opportunity to develop outreach activities &lt;br/&gt;to interest high school students, both locally and nationally, in optical science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: The objective of this proposal is to investigate the use of organic photovoltaic modules as&lt;br/&gt;inherently polarization sensitive detectors. Current methods of polarization imaging or detection rely on either&lt;br/&gt;time-sequential or instantaneous measurements taken after light transmits through polarization sensitive elements. &lt;br/&gt;These, often complex, optical systems are necessary because there are no current detector technologies capable of &lt;br/&gt;measuring the complete polarization state, at a single spatial location, within a single integration time. &lt;br/&gt;This results in several disadvantages associated with existing technologies; chief among them are temporal and/or &lt;br/&gt;spatial misregistration that causes errors in the sensed polarization elements. To alleviate these errors, this&lt;br/&gt;proposal details a novel strain-aligned polymer-based photodetector that is inherently polarization sensitive.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives are to: (1) Create an optoelectronic model of multi-layer organic photovoltaics (OPVs); &lt;br/&gt;(2) Create a free-space polarimeter design, using multiple semi-transparent SOPD proof of concept devices; &lt;br/&gt;(3) Design and create an experimental proof of principle multi-layer monolithic polarimeter based on S-OPDs;&lt;br/&gt;(4) Leverage the model and concept to create calibration procedures; and (5) Explore multi-spectral and&lt;br/&gt;multi-Stokes detectors, including their incorporation into arrays and unique geometrical structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer semiconductors commonly have a primary optical dipole transition that is&lt;br/&gt;parallel to the conjugated backbone. Thus, uniaxially aligning the polymer in one-direction results in&lt;br/&gt;anisotropic optical detection. The intellectual merit of this proposal is through the study of the device&lt;br/&gt;performance opportunities enabled by aligned polymer based polarimeters with inherent polarization&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity. Merit is found in: (1) The optimization of OPV structures, biasing, and circuitry for use in&lt;br/&gt;photodetection processes; (2) Developing insight into how alignment and anisotropy influence&lt;br/&gt;energy conversion; (3) Establishing advanced optoelectronic modeling of complex multi-layer&lt;br/&gt;anisotropic organic photodetectors at various angles of incidence; and (4) Calibration procedures,&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and techniques for using OPVs as polarization-sensitive photovoltaic detectors. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed endeavor has the potential to create broad new areas of research in multi-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;monolithic optical sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has significant commercial potential, benefiting the fields&lt;br/&gt;of telecommunications, remote sensing, and biomedical imaging. This project will also provide&lt;br/&gt;support for two graduate student researchers in polarimetry and device fabrication. Dissemination of&lt;br/&gt;research results will occur through publications and outreach efforts to the general public will also be&lt;br/&gt;conducted by both PIs. For instance, online tutorials to garner excitement for polarimetric imaging&lt;br/&gt;will be produced that include fabrication tutorials and software development that would place&lt;br/&gt;polarimetric imaging at the hands of amateur hobbyists and students. Additionally, the PIs will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to a week-long high school summer camp held at NC State to attract students to&lt;br/&gt;engineering careers. In this camp, outreach modules related to polarized light in nature will be&lt;br/&gt;created and disseminated.</AbstractNarration>
