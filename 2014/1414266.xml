    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating recent research accomplishments in II-VI material-based Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors into the market place to fill the need for robust, cooler-free, high-speed, mid-infrared light detectors for applications in environment, health, and security. The project will result in a prototype of a photodetector based on the novel II-VI quantum well-based unipolar light detection concept. This detector at its best has the following unique features: it will detect light over a much wider mid-infrared wavelength range than prior detectors, it will be robust, compact, cooler-free, and operate at high speed; all features that are enabled by the use of the novel II-VI material system. These features provide system advantages of compactness, broad usability, performance, and cost-savings when compared to the leading competing semiconductor mid-infrared photodetectors in this market space. This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (i) device and package lay-out will be newly designed so that the basic detector chips can be packaged for market-ready, robust, cooler-free, and high-speed performance; (ii) new quantum designs of the detectors will lead to cooler-free detectors at long mid-infrared wavelengths, and especially broad-wavelength coverage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The joint project between Princeton University and City College of New York engages small business partner Boston Electronics Corp., a leading distributor of single pixel mid-infrared photo-detectors to provide insights to customer and market needs and to guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The II-VI material-based Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector is important because mid-infrared detectors are widely used in many commercial, medical, security, and environmental systems and applications, especially point-sensing of chemicals and thermal imaging; with improved detectors, these systems and applications benefit, and so will their users, the everyday consumers. Furthermore, the introduction of a potentially disruptive detector technology into the somewhat staid mid-IR detector market will beneficially drive cost and performance competition, again leading to more favorable outcomes for users. A diverse group of students working on and alongside this project will first-hand experience prototype development and showcasing, gaining valuable experience in technology translation from the academic research lab into the market place. The potential economic impact is expected to be significant in the next decade and beyond, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this mid-infrared single-pixel light detector and imaging technology space.</AbstractNarration>
