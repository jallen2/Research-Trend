    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to help support meeting costs and travel expenses of approximately 20 US students, post docs and young scientists for the International Conference on Mathematical Geophysics to be held in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico during 2-6 June of 2014. The funding priority will be given to under-represented groups (women and minorities). The Conference on Mathematical Geophysics (CMG) is sponsored by the Committee on Mathematical Geophysics of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. The conference website can be found at http://eventos.iingen.unam.mx/IUGG2014/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference brings together applied mathematicians, computational scientists, engineers, and researchers from geophysics, physical oceanography, material sciences, and atmospheric and climate dynamics, to discuss advances and challenges of the present understanding of the Earth sciences. This year's program provides a strong emphasis on Applied Mathematics and Computational Geophysics, in combination with more traditional for CMG topics of Seismicity, Oceanography, and Climate. The meeting will make a particular emphasis on the advances in computational methods of geosciences and mathematical and numerical methods of enhanced oil recovery. This meeting provides a unique multi-disciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas and techniques across the disciplinary boundaries in the Earth sciences. It allows interactions among Earth scientists from disciplines that do not normally communicate, such as oil engineers, physical oceanographers and geophysicists.</AbstractNarration>
