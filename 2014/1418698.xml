    <AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin-Madison is awarded a grant that will allow its Trout Lake Station to purchase and deploy four fully-instrumented buoys (plus one spare) and associated telecommunication and data management equipment. The system is designed to allow year-round collection of high-frequency limnological data from four long-term study lakes. The data will be made publically available in near-real time. The Trout Lake Station is a year-round field station operated by the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Located in the Northern Highland Lake District in northern Wisconsin, the Station has a long history of research on the region's aquatic resources dating back to the 1920s. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumented buoys will make high-frequency measurements of weather (air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction, and precipitation), water temperature throughout the water column, and near-surface dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, and colored dissolved organic matter. During the open water season the data will be telemetered to the Station in near real time, run through an automated range check and posted to a publically available database. The four lakes to be instrumented differ in their size, depth, trophic status, color, water chemistry, hydrology, and biotic communities. All are long-term study lakes of the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research program and have more than 30 years of comprehensive limnological data available. The lakes are within 10km of each other (and the Trout Lake Station), so data from the buoys will be used to compare differential responses of lakes to nearly identical weather conditions. Such comparisons are powerful in predicting climatic responses of lakes in general. The buoy data will be used by a myriad of researchers who require background environmental data for their research projects on the study lakes. In addition, the data will be used widely within the Global Lakes Ecological Observatory Network in comparative studies of lake processes worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumented buoys resulting from this award will help create new knowledge that has societal relevance, provide research opportunities and training for students, and increase the scientific literacy and interest of the general public. The buoy data will be used to address the likely effect of climate change and variation on lakes and to provide environmental context for population-, community-, and ecosystem-level studies. Two summer research experiences for undergraduates will be provided by this award. Finally, the buoy data in public engagement activities including an annual Trout Lake Station open house and a very popular and well-attended Science on Tap-Minocqua series held at the local community microbrewery.
