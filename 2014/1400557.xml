    <AbstractNarration>Automate! responds to local and global needs of both industry and education. For industry, the Metropolitan Community College (MCC) BAS IT degree option is preparing skilled technicians for a variety of careers demanding strong foundations in IT concepts and skills - from critical facilities operations to advanced manufacturing, network security, energy management, and continuous commissioning. Upon completion of the BAS option IT Associates, graduates are prepared for a wide range of IT-enhanced careers such as managing interoperable facilities systems, advanced manufacturing operations, network security, general IT systems, and critical facilities such as data centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MCC and partners are developing, field testing, and delivering learning resources for technician training through a new Building Automation Systems (BAS) option within an Information Technology Associates Degree. The primary audiences for the developed resources are two-year college students, dual credit high school BAS Academy students, and dual credit high school and college students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight new BAS-contextualized IT courses will be developed, including lesson plans, assessments, hands-on kits, video, and other visual based elements. Access to Automate! resources will be available through the cloud and through open online venues such as YouTube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is examining the effectiveness of the process of materials development; the impact of the BAS contextualized IT learning on student enrollment, performance and retention in the BAS option and the IT Associates degree track; and the value of the BAS technician training to industry.</AbstractNarration>
