    <AbstractNarration>North Carolina Central University (NCCU) proposes to examine the effect of self-regulated learning training and development on student success in STEM. The researchers propose to structure an intervention around units of a physics, chemistry, and calculus course and conduct a three-phase research project. Phase I will entail a pilot study to determine what learning strategies the STEM students currently use and a detailed analysis of the pilot data to identify gaps in effective self-regulated learning development. In Phase II, the researchers will develop and adapt a self-regulated learning training system for the students. Phase III will be an experimental study to investigate the effect of self-regulated learning training on student outcomes. Currently, little is known about the extent to which STEM students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) use self-regulated learning strategies or develop the skills and competencies to do so. The proposed project will contribute knowledge to gain a better understanding of that phenomenon in the context of HBCUs with broader implications for minority students in STEM generally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental aim of the research is to determine if improving self-regulated learning results in improved academic achievement in STEM at NCCU. A quasi-experimental design will be used to answer three research questions: (1) What learning strategies are NCCU STEM students currently using? The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire will be used to collect student motivation and self-regulated learning strategy data at the course/subject-specific level. (2) What gaps in effective self-regulated learning development exist for NCCU STEM students? The Pintrich model of self-regulated learning will be used to analyze the data collected in response to the first question to answer the second research question. Researchers will use the results of a synthesis of relevant literature to determine the best methodology and instructional strategies for conducting the self-regulated training - inside or outside the regular classroom. (3) Does self-regulated learning training enhance NCCU students' effective use of self-regulated strategies and change academic performance outcomes? Researchers will conduct a pre-post comparison of trait-oriented measures of self-regulated learning strategies using a questionnaire. The treatment group will complete surveys about their learning behavior during the study by receiving messages on their smartphones from SurveySignal®. This research will produce data-driven information to create intervention models based on literature specific to the effects of self-regulation and motivation on student performance.</AbstractNarration>
