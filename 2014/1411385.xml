    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Professor Peter Vikesland of Virginia Tech is examining the role of particle properties on the dissolution kinetics of metallic nanoparticles. Metal nanoparticles are being developed for incorporation in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, yet many questions remain about their longevity in diverse environments. Results from this integrated research and education effort will be disseminated in scientific publications and via presentations at relevant conferences. In addition, the results will inform outreach activities organized by Professor Vikesland, the Virginia Tech Sustainable Nanotechnology (VTSuN) Program, and the NSF-EPA Center for the Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEINT). Professor Vikesland, VTSuN, and CEINT will engage K-12 and other members of the general population using hands-on activities and inform these audiences about the societal implications (both positive and negative) of nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Vikesland will utilize a highly sensitive atomic force microscope to examine how surface coatings, nanoparticle size, and metal identity affect metal nanoparticle dissolution rates. Arrays of surface adhered nanoparticles of variable consistency will be produced via nanosphere lithography and their dissolution will be probed over time. This approach enables investigation of dissolution kinetics in the absence of aggregation using realistic nanoparticle concentrations - severe limitations of many alternative methodologies. Findings from this study will aid efforts to engineer environmentally benign nanomaterials and to predict their environmental impacts.</AbstractNarration>
