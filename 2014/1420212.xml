    <AbstractNarration>How does our visual system transform the light patterns impinging onto the retina into a meaningful three-dimensional world of objects and movement? Over the last few decades we have made enormous progress in our understanding of brain functions. Yet, the fundamental computational and biological principles underlying visual information processing remain elusive. Like other species, we humans do not simply sit back and passively accept the sensory data that flows around us. Instead, we actively seek out useful information by coordinating sensory processing with motor activity on multiple scales. The hypothesis of this project is that visual perception in humans is an intrinsically sensory-motor process, in which the observer's behavior plays a key computational role. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To investigate this hypothesis, the project brings together researchers from the Netherlands (Dr. Brenner at VU University in Amsterdam), the US (Dr. Rucci at Boston University), and the UK (Dr. Rushton at Cardiff University), who have developed critical expertise on the analyses of different types of motor activities in humans. These researchers and their teams will investigate the mechanisms by which people use motor/proprioceptive signals to accomplish visual tasks. Understanding the impact motor activity has on perception is critical to advancing our knowledge of how the visual system functions. Additionally, understanding the interplay between our senses and motor processes will help us to replicate those mechanisms in artificial systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the potential for advancing our understanding of visual perception, this research also has several broader impacts. Many pathological conditions that feature abnormal motor activity also present visual impairments. Understanding the role of behavior in the extraction and processing of visual information could point towards potential treatments for such visual impairments. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of this research offers new opportunities for training students. By collaborating with the PI, students at Boston University will have an opportunity to combine experimental and theoretical research.</AbstractNarration>
