    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Eric Sharpe at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The goal of this project is to further develop technical tools and methods used to help extract real-world physics from string theory, the leading contender to unify general relativity with quantum field theory, two of the most significant developments of twentieth-century physics. The price one pays for that unification is a prediction that the world has more than four spacetime dimensions. One standard proposal to resolve that discrepancy is via a `compactification' of string theory, in which the extra dimensions are rolled up on some small compact space. It can be shown that the geometry and topology of that small compact space determine low-energy four-dimensional physics. This project will further develop tools and techniques for understanding compactifications of string theory and the predictions of various compactifications for low-energy four-dimensional physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically, Professor Sharpe will study `gauged linear sigma models' (GLSM's), one of the most powerful tools used to study string compactifications. These tools have undergone a striking series of advances within the last few years. One part of that effort will revolve around extending the technology of supersymmetric localization in two-dimensional theories. As another part, Professor Sharpe will study dualities in nonabelian (2,2) and (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories in two dimensions. Professor Sharpe will also continue developing quantum sheaf cohomology, a mathematical generalization of ordinary quantum cohomology that determines stringy nonperturbative corrections to charged matter couplings in heterotic string compactifications, with a special focus on understanding quantum sheaf cohomology in Grassmannians and other objects built via nonabelian GLSM's, as a stepping-stone to computing quantum sheaf cohomology in compact Calabi-Yau manifolds.</AbstractNarration>
