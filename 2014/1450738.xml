    <AbstractNarration>Workshop on Research Directions for Cyber Physical Systems Related to Future Energy and Power Grids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning and development of the future grid requires additional research, particularly research that can be used within the next 5-10 years. Many organizations such as NSF, DOE, EPRI, ARPA-E, and NIST have focused on different aspects of the research ranging from a short-term, two to three year horizon, to a long term, strategic, 20-30 year horizon. Many workshops, symposia, and conferences have supported the exchange of research and development results. However, the research efforts are not currently well coordinated for the time horizon of 5-10 years where tangible and innovative commercial solutions could be deployed. This proposed workshop will focus on this 5-10 year time horizon with a goal of bringing together national industry and research community leaders, as well as the executives from the end-user and manufacturing industry, to discuss and coordinate a research strategy and related action plan to meet industry needs for new solutions in response to the new developments affecting the grid.&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives are to actively involve major players from various industry sectors, government organizations, and universities to create a common understanding of and map out the appropriate directions in research priorities and associated activities. An important initial step will be to convene a broad and representative assembly of the stakeholders to initiate this effort, which this workshop will accomplish. Spacific activities include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Invite a key industry figure to open the workshop, outline the motivation, and set the discussion stage for how the goals and objectives may be achieved over the horizon of interest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Invite CEOs of major utilities and manufacturing industries to state their requirements and expectations regarding research needs and technology deployment over the next 5-10 years&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Involve CTOs and CIOs of major companies seeking their views on what advancements in the control, communication, and information infrastructure are needed over the 5-10 year horizon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Attract top managers at NSF, DOE, EPRI, ARPA-E and NIST, other appropriate agencies to articulate their plans for the 5-10 year horizon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Assure participation of recognized experts from academia and research organizations who can add to the discussions or answer questions as needed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Formulate a prioritized and achievable list of expected research accomplishments over the 5-10 year period with measurable improvements for the energy cyber-physical system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Formulate an action plan to secure adequate funding to achieve the targeted goals, laying the foundation for a new collaborative funding opportunity for industry-university partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
