    <AbstractNarration>The project will develop an offline and then a real-time brain computer interface to detect rhythms that are imagined in people's heads, and translate these rhythms into actual sound. The project builds upon research breakthroughs in electrocorticographic (ECoG) recording technology to convert music that is imagined into synthesized sound. The project researchers will recruit from a specialized group of people for this project, specifically patients with intractable epilepsy who are currently undergoing clinical evaluation of their condition at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, and are thus uniquely prepared to use brain-computer interfaces based on ECoG recording techniques. This is a highly multidisciplinary project that will make progress towards developing a "brain music synthesizer" which could have a significant impact in the neuroscience and musical domains, and lead to creative outlets and alternative communication devices and thus life improvements for people with severe disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use surface-recorded electrophysiological measurements such as surface-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG). However, while some useful signals can be extracted from such surface techniques, it is nearly impossible to accurately decode from such signals the intricate brain activity involved in activities such as language with the detail needed to achieve a natural, transparent translation of thought to device control. On the contrary, intracranial electrodes such as ECoG are closer to the source of the desired brain activity, and can produce signals that, compared to surface techniques, have superior spatial and spectral characteristics and signal-to-noise ratios. Research has already shown that intracranial signals can provide superior decoding capabilities for motor and language signals, and for BCI control. Because complex language and auditory signals (both perceived and imagined) have been decoded using intracranial activity, it is conceivable to decode perceived and imagined musical content from intracranial signals. This project will attempt to similarly use ECoG to decode perceived and imagined musical content from intracranial signals as has been done for language and auditory signals.</AbstractNarration>
