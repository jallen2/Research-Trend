    <AbstractNarration>Most current solar cell panels are made by complex processes using expensive materials. Lower costs and higher efficiencies have driven product decisions and the result is most panels are rigid, heavy, and with a dull, black appearance. As a result of their non-architectural aesthetic appearance and weight, they are primarily installed on rooftops so as to minimize the negative building appearance, and large surface areas of the buildings are not utilized for potential power generation. The team proposes to develop a new hybrid solar cell technology that is based on low cost materials and manufacturing processes; most importantly, they offer appealing visual effects, e.g. the panels can be designed to reflect or transmit desirable colors, or display colored images. They can also be made semi-transparent and can be structurally flexible for either a permanent specific shape or thin enough to be rolled and unrolled for many multiple events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technologies that can provide significantly improved energy efficiency are in high demand in our world today. The team hopes that the multi-functional PV technology will be of significant and transformative value to the community by providing a new way of thinking of deploying photovoltaics. The new technology can be applied to existing and new high-rise commercial buildings or residential houses. The transmissive type colored or semi-transparent panels can be used as power-generating windows or shades, and the reflective type colored panels for outdoor architectural glass walls with specific designs, or interior colored/display type furnishings, and both can provide electric energy by utilizing the absorbed portion of the light spectrum. Another potential application is for greenhouses using the technology on glass to absorb green light for electric power generation while passing through blue and red light to be absorbed by the Chlorophyll for plants' growth. The video rate large format photodetector array made based on the hybrid structure can also lead to potential application in medical imaging.</AbstractNarration>
