    <AbstractNarration>This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Stephen F. Austin State University (SFASU) will provide academic, social, career preparation, and scholarship support to approximately twenty (20) financially deserving mathematics and biology majors with high academic potential. The goals of the Science and Mathematics Attraction, Retention, and Training for Texas (SMART Texas) program are to: (1) increase the number of students entering and completing a mathematics or biology major; (2) prepare mathematics and biology majors for the workforce or graduate study; and (3) investigate and identify key elements of a replicable model for STEM student success with a special focus on first generation low-income and other underrepresented groups of undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SMART Texas project will incorporate a combination of innovative and established best practice strategies to increase recruitment and retention, as well as improve student success and graduation rates. The scholarship students will engage in a STEM living learning community where they will be involved with STEM peers and STEM faculty in both academic and non-academic settings. S-STEM students will have access to cohort mentoring, dedicated academic mentoring by faculty in their discipline, internships and undergraduate research opportunities (including laboratory research), and a variety of networking opportunities including support to attend and participate in discipline conferences. The planned combination of strategies will be implemented and investigated to determine obstacles students face and best practices to help overcome these obstacles to increase participation, retention, graduation, and overall student success, especially for underrepresented groups. A paired longitudinal study will be conducted to examine the effects of these interventions over time when compared to nonparticipating STEM majors. Results will be disseminated throughout the STEM community.</AbstractNarration>
