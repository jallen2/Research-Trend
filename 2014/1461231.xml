    <AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Extreme Ultraviolet Engineering Research Center (EUV ERC), a partnership between Colorado State University (CSU), the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU Boulder), the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) and 20 corporate affiliates, will provide summer research internships to 30 undergraduate students from colleges and universities across the United States through a 3-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) [Division of Engineering Education EEC-1461231]. Students who are accepted into the program will participate at one of the 3 campuses in a 10-week program that involves conducting research in a cutting-edge engineering project, attending scientific seminars and industry tours, and presenting their results. The Center recognizes the importance of students in academic research to be able to interact and appreciate the industrial culture. As a result, a goal of this grant is to leverage these partnerships to enable alumni REU interns to be placed into industry internships. The Center also has active partnerships with minority serving institutions and is committed to providing opportunities for students from underrepresented minority groups. The Center will broaden participation by joining efforts with, Professor Willie Rockwood of Morehouse College, a Historically Black College/Univ. (HBCU), who has a &gt;10 year history of working with the Center and is co-PI of this grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Light in the EUV region of the spectrum (wavelengths approximately 5 - 50 nm) is the key enabling technology of critical importance to the semiconductor industry and national economy. The EUV ERC will provide summer research internships that involve EUV science and technology topics such as laser systems, nanoscience (quantum dots), electronic (printed board) circuit design, photonic techniques (ellipsometry, phase shifting interferometry and both ambient condition and low-temperature vacuum spectroscopy), optics design (Brewster's Angle plate beam splitter), lithography (essential to next generation computer processor manufacturing), chemistry and material science (photo resists), and high voltage systems. Titles of possible projects include: Nanoscale resolution mass-microscope by EUV laser ablation mass spectrometry; Photoelectron dynamics using high harmonic EUV light; and, the Design and construction of a new vacuum chamber test bed for characterizing magnetic materials at the nano-scale with ultrafast time resolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center has an active partnership with Industries in the development of EUV-technologies that derive from research conducted at the Center. The Center recognizes the importance of students in academic research to be able to interact and appreciate the industrial culture. As a result, a goal of this grant is to leverage these partnerships to enable alumni REU interns to be placed into industry internships.</AbstractNarration>
