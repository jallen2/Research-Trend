    <AbstractNarration>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are rapidly bringing the computing&lt;br/&gt;power traditionally associated with massively parallel supercomputers&lt;br/&gt;into the mainstream devices we use today. They have the power to&lt;br/&gt;revolutionize computing by enabling orders of magnitude faster and&lt;br/&gt;more efficient execution of many applications. Unfortunately, many&lt;br/&gt;modern applications and users cannot take advantage of the computing&lt;br/&gt;capability present in today's GPUs because today's GPUs are used as&lt;br/&gt;secondary devices to the much less powerful CPUs. As a result, the massive&lt;br/&gt;computing power of GPUs gets wasted and underutilized for a large&lt;br/&gt;number of important applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to take a fresh and comprehensive look at GPU design&lt;br/&gt;with the goal of enabling GPUs as first-class computing engines that&lt;br/&gt;can benefit an overwhelming majority of real-world applications and&lt;br/&gt;users. To this end, this project systematically investigates the&lt;br/&gt;hardware/software design space of three new execution models, which&lt;br/&gt;progressively turn a GPU into an independent, first-class compute&lt;br/&gt;engine in a hybrid computing system: 1) an enhanced master-slave model&lt;br/&gt;where the GPU is able to perform multiple-application execution, 2) a&lt;br/&gt;new peer-to-peer model where the GPU is autonomous of the CPU, 3) a&lt;br/&gt;hybrid model where GPUs and CPUs are integrated on the same die and&lt;br/&gt;are equals from the applications' and system's viewpoint. The project&lt;br/&gt;comprehensively develops software, hardware and software/hardware&lt;br/&gt;cooperative scheduling, resource management, and system design&lt;br/&gt;techniques for all three models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project can pave the way to making GPUs&lt;br/&gt;first-class computing engines used in all aspects of our everyday&lt;br/&gt;lives for a majority of applications. Doing so is not only expected to&lt;br/&gt;lead to much higher degrees of energy efficiency and user productivity&lt;br/&gt;but can also potentially enable new applications and devices that can&lt;br/&gt;take advantage GPUs.</AbstractNarration>
