    <AbstractNarration>Emerging Storage Class Memory (SCM) technologies combine the non-volatility of storage devices like hard disks and solid state drives (SSDs) with the ability to access data at byte granularity rather than at a block level. Application developers can focus on a single fine-grained storage abstraction, rather than deal with word-granularity access for DRAM memory and a block interface for file-based disk storage. Accessing data directly from SCM instead of software-arbitrated block access has significant performance advantages, especially for modern data intensive applications based on graph and relation processing. However the use of direct SCM access places a significant burden on the application to achieve transactional and robust execution in the presence of unexpected machines failures and software aborts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will identify lightweight, scalable architectural and software techniques for developing robust SCM-based software. The goal is to make the development of software for persistent memory comparable to programming conventional DRAM main-memory by relieving the programmer from the complexities of managing transactional atomicity and persistence. Both hardware solutions based on enhancements to the processor and memory-controller architecture, and software approaches in the form of a lightweight persistence library will be developed. The techniques will be scaled up to handle multiple threads and cores, and scale out to multiple CPU sockets and to distributed clustered architectures.</AbstractNarration>
