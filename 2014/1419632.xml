    <AbstractNarration>Femto-aided cellular networks appear to be one the best solutions to achieve multi-fold capacity needed for future wireless networks. However, Femto-aided cellular systems have an information architecture that is very different from current planned and centrally managed cellular architecture. In this project, both the design of information architecture to acquire network state information and the optimal use of the resulting NSI will be addressed. The project is organized into three symbiotic research thrusts on network-aware physical-layer (PHY) coding schemes, network protocols and algorithms leveraging advanced PHYs, and their architectural prototypes. The first thrust utilizes recent innovations in deterministic models of wireless networks and develops novel physical-layer cooperative encoding and decoding schemes that operate with delayed, inconsistent, and erroneous NSI. The second thrust builds on the new physical-layer coding schemes to design network-scheduling algorithms to address performance issues. Finally, the third thrust utilizes the WARP programmable radios and studies implementation challenges of the protocols. The project goals of foundational design for Femto-aided cellular networks will have significant impact on industry practice. The PIs will facilitate technology transfer through their established industry affiliate program. A broad range of education and outreach activities will also complement the research agenda, including integration of research findings into the courses, promoting underrepresented and undergraduate populations, and engaging with the middle/high school community to raise the level of interest in engineering and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
