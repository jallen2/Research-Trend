    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, will provide research training for eight students for ten weeks during the summers of 2015- 2017. The program provides advanced training in the manipulation and analysis of proteins. The program provides students with a better understanding of laboratory research, insights into protein biochemistry, and an appreciation for the broader context of research. Students work on projects under the guidance of faculty in the Department of Biochemistry. Students can select from a variety of projects including the elucidation of enzyme mechanisms, post-translational protein modifications, proteomics, protein-nucleic acid interactions, epigenetic gene regulation, plant development, and renewable energy research. The first three days of the program introduce key concepts in protein biochemistry and experimental design. The remainder of the program emphasizes full-time research supplemented with weekly sessions on ethical conduct in research, professional communication, GRE preparation, and the graduate school application process. Students present their results at a departmental symposium and a university-wide poster session. Assessment of the program will include pre- and post-surveys, poster presentation evaluations, and the BIO REU common assessment tool (SALG URSSA). The program will recruit life science and chemistry undergraduates with at least four semesters of college who have an interest in research and are members of underrepresented groups in STEM fields or attend institutions with limited research opportunities. Applications should be submitted online by early February for full consideration (see website) but will be accepted until all positions are filled. Selection of participants will be based on academic performance, demonstrated interest in research, and the potential for outstanding research careers in the life sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, improve their scientific communication skills, and have the opportunity to present the results of their work at scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.
