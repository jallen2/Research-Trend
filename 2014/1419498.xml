    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support of the US participation in the conference &lt;br/&gt;"Stochastic processes and high dimensional probability distributions" &lt;br/&gt;which will be held at the Euler Mathematical Institute, Saint Petersburg, &lt;br/&gt;on June 16-20, 2014. The main theme of the conference is the insights &lt;br/&gt;into stochastic processes which arise in the light of high dimensional &lt;br/&gt;phenomena. It will focus on several closely related directions including: &lt;br/&gt;Geometric problems about Gaussian and linear stochastic processes;&lt;br/&gt;Typical distributions, concentration and other high dimensional phenomena;&lt;br/&gt;Optimal transportation, associated Sobolev-type and information-theoretic &lt;br/&gt;inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of this forum is to consolidate and further encourage &lt;br/&gt;investigations in the above mentioned directions. There will be talks by &lt;br/&gt;internationally known speakers on a wide variety of topics. The organizers &lt;br/&gt;expect about 12-15 participants from USA, out of the total number of 40-50 &lt;br/&gt;scientists representing different schools. It provides an opportunity to &lt;br/&gt;review the latest results in the field and to meet several generations of &lt;br/&gt;researchers including postdoc and graduate students. Broadening participation &lt;br/&gt;of women and junior scientists from under-represented groups is anticipated. &lt;br/&gt;The results of the meeting will be disseminated and contribute to the &lt;br/&gt;enhancement and improvement of scientific and educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Website of the conference: http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/EIMI/2014/Sppd/index.html</AbstractNarration>
