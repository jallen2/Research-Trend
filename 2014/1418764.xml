    <AbstractNarration>The University of Texas Marine Science Institute (UTMSI) http://www.utmsi.utexas.edu, established in 1941, has a long history of excellence with respect to innovation and application of stable isotope techniques in biogeochemical and ecological studies. This project will improve research infrastructure for stable isotope analyses at the UTMSI through acquisition of instrumentation as well as renovations to existing space that will house the instrumentation. A new isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) and peripheral components will be purchased to improve natural abundance stable isotope analysis capabilities. In addition, a unique Ammonium Isotope Retention Time Shift (AIRTS) high performance liquid chromatography system that is used for measurements of 15N-enriched ammonium in nitrogen process studies at the Institute will be upgraded. Improvement of stable isotope analysis capabilities at the UTMSI will advance scientific discovery by supporting more investigators, using a wider range of stable isotope techniques in their work. The new instrumentation will enable development and application of a variety of stable isotope techniques that are pushing the frontiers of biogeochemical and ecological studies, while enhancing our ability to support internal and external users that rely on existing analysis capabilities at the Institute. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to education, the improvements will 1) promote greater training of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists in stable isotope analysis and application techniques, and 2) support additional opportunities for undergraduates to employ stable isotopes in research projects. A new undergraduate education program (Semester by the Sea) initiated in spring 2013 is bringing more undergraduates to the Institute. This program includes a major research component, and students in the program are encouraged to consider stable isotope applications as they develop research projects. The project also includes a commitment to public outreach. Project personnel will work with ongoing programs at the Institute to share their knowledge and interest in stable isotope applications with a broader audience. This will include development of a new food-web oriented module for the Summer Science Camp at UTMSI that highlights how stable isotopes help scientists understand dietary relationships.</AbstractNarration>
