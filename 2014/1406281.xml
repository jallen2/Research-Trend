    <AbstractNarration>The project will concentrate on the moduli of geometric structures on manifolds. This subject arose from several threads in the 19th century: (1) symmetries of crystals, which developed into the theory of crystallographic groups; (2) conformal mapping, and the corresponding holomorphic differential equations and their monodromy groups, which led to the classical theory of uniformization; (3) classical differential geometry of surfaces, generalized to Riemannian geometry, and later to Lorentzian geometry influenced by Einstein's theory of gravitation. The notion of a geometry itself was algebraicized by Felix Klein, who interpreted a geometry as the properties invariant under a transitive action of a Lie group. The present study investigates the possible ways of putting a geometric structure on a topological manifold in terms of the fundamental group and the Lie group. The goal is to describe when a given topology (often described by a combinatorial object) can be given the given geometry. In several cases, there is a complete classification of geometric structures, and the moduli space itself enjoys both a rich geometry of its own and symmetries of its own, which lead to intricate dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals and scope of this project involve flat projective and conformal structures, especially in dimension three. The recent classification of complete affine 3-manifolds leads to many questions about more general structures. In particular the proposal asked which groups which admit proper affine actions; at present the only known hyperbolic groups are free groups. The methods involve a combination of dynamical systems, algebraic group theory, topology and geometric group theory and representation theory. Other important questions include finding obstructions for a 3-manifold to admit a projective structure; at present only one such closed 3-manifold is known. Computer experiments can help in this direction, and projects in the Experimental Geometry Lab can suggest new examples of geometric structures.</AbstractNarration>
