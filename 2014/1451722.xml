    <AbstractNarration>The ability to process phonological information (i.e., the sounds of one's language) is critical in language and literacy development. Phonological processing is important for literacy development, and in turn, literacy experience promotes phonological skills. Phonological retrieval and encoding in spoken word production is an important component of phonological processing; however, little research has been conducted to examine how literacy experience influences phonological retrieval and encoding. The functional phonological units refer to the units that speakers use to organize and construct a spoken word, and investigation in this area can inform researchers on how speakers retrieve and encode phonological information. This research aims to investigate the development of the functional phonological units and the influence of literacy experience. The results of this research can help educators develop educational methodologies to promote children's language development, particularly those with disfluency or other speech-related difficulties. Involving literacy training that is consistent with the nature of a language may help improve children's speech fluency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be conducted among native Mandarin speakers. In Mainland China, children first study an alphabetic writing system called Pinyin in Grade 1, and begin to study morphosyllabic Chinese characters afterwards. Five groups of participants will be recruited, including 1) preschool children at 4 years of age, 2) Grade 1 children at 7 years, 3) Grade 2 children at 8 years, 4) Grade 4 children at 10 years, and 5) adults. For each group, three experiments will be conducted. In each experiment, a simple picture naming task with the form preparation paradigm (the names of a list of pictures may share the same onset, same initial syllable or nothing systematically in common) will be conducted. Experiment 1 examines the onset preparation effect (i.e., faster naming latency when the picture names share the same onset) using monosyllabic picture names. Experiment 2 examines the onset preparation effect using disyllabic picture names. Experiment 3 examines the syllable preparation effect (i.e., faster naming latency when the picture names share the same initial syllable). An onset preparation effect would suggest that the functional phonological unit is the segment, whereas a syllable preparation effect would suggest that syllable is the functional unit. It is expected that the syllable is the unit preschool children naturally access for planning a spoken word, so preschool children selects the syllable as the functional phonological unit. Grade 1 children are extensively exposed to Pinyin, and the alphabetic characteristic of Pinyin will lead them to shift the functional phonological unit from syllable to segment. Higher-grade children and adults read characters which correspond to syllables directly, so the functional phonological unit for these age groups may change back to syllable. The findings of this research will improve the scientific understanding of the influence of literacy experience on the development of phonological representation and processing. Furthermore, based on the results of this research, educators may be able to develop more efficient educational methodologies to improve children's development of phonological skills by combining children's phonological training and their literacy experience. For example, children who learn Chinese as a second language may benefit from language training involving character instruction that emphasizes the syllabic unit.</AbstractNarration>
