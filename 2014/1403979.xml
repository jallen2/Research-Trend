    <AbstractNarration>1403979&lt;br/&gt;Ellison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team at the University of Colorado will investigate how some typical molecules in biofuels break down prior to burning, a process known as pyrolysis and one that is still poorly understood. This is important because the type of products due to this breakdown has implications in how the later combustion process will proceed. The proposed research effort involves teaching and learning at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and ensuring that opportunities are accessible to all students. Graduate student research assistants are full participants in research projects and are supported by appropriate course work and in depth mentoring by senior project personnel. They have the opportunity to travel to other collaborating laboratories, attend scientific meetings, and present and publish their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research addresses questions regarding the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of the thermal decomposition of carboxylic esters, R1COOR2. Carboxylic esters commonly appear as the main components of biofuels. They form fuels that are similar in combustion properties to petroleum-based fuels. The thermolysis chemistry of many of the large organic molecules encountered in biofuels is poorly understood or completely unknown. In addition to exploring the pyrolysis reaction mechanisms of these molecules, the principal investigators plan to measure rates of reaction for determination of kinetic mechanisms. The experimental approach involves the use of miniature (0.6 mm x 2 cm) tubular reactors. These reactors will be equipped with molecular diagnostics: photoionization mass spectroscopy (PIMS), matrix infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR), resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI), and microwave spectroscopy. The work should have a significant impact on understanding of the first steps in the reaction of carboxylic ester based biofuels and find immediate applicability in engineering simulations. The research will lead to technology improvements in the area of renewable biomass derived fuels that can replace petroleum-derived fuels.</AbstractNarration>
