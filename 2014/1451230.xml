    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will support U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics the opportunity to share their knowledge and interact with each other and more senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within robotics, to meet potential employers, and to become apprised of new technology that will be demonstrated by vendors. This goal will be accomplished by partially supporting the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS). IROS, sponsored by IEEE and the Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ), is one of the two premier annual conferences, along with IEEE ICRA, in the robotics field. The location of IROS rotates among North America, Europe, and Asia. The conference attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders. The meeting is a unique environment that allows participants to exchange ideas, interact with leaders in the field, meet up-and-coming engineers, network, develop collaborations, and generate new ideas on the leading edge of robotic technology.</AbstractNarration>
