    <AbstractNarration>Advances in technology have made it possible to accommodate an increasing number of &lt;br/&gt;transistors on a die, enabling Multicore Accelerators like Graphics Processing Units&lt;br/&gt;(GPUs) by integrating diverse components on a single chip. GPUs have recently gained &lt;br/&gt;attention as a cost-effective approach for data parallel architectures, and the fast scaling of &lt;br/&gt;the GPUs increases the importance of designing an ideal on-chip interconnection network, &lt;br/&gt;which significantly impacts the overall system performance.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we propose to develop a framework for high-performance and&lt;br/&gt;energy-efficient on-chip network mechanisms in synergy with Multicore Accelerator &lt;br/&gt;architectures. The desirable properties of a target on-chip network include re-usability&lt;br/&gt;across a wide range of Multicore Accelerator architectures, maximization of the use of&lt;br/&gt;routing resources, and support for reliable and energy-efficient data transfer.&lt;br/&gt;This project will make significant advances in understanding the interplay between &lt;br/&gt;Multicore Accelerator and Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, which leads us to&lt;br/&gt;scalable solutions for performance, area and energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the major communication of Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) systems is core-to-core&lt;br/&gt;for shared caches, major traffic of Multicore Accelerators is core-to-memory, which &lt;br/&gt;makes the memory controllers hot spots. Since Multicore Accelerators execute many&lt;br/&gt;threads in order to hide memory latency, it is critical for the underlying NoC to provide high bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;The key contributions expected from the project are: (1) building a &lt;br/&gt;simulation testbed and analyzing the behavior of on-chip traffic workloads in Multicore&lt;br/&gt;Accelerators; (2) proposing mechanisms for a high-performance and energy-efficient &lt;br/&gt;NoC by utilizing emerging memory and NoC technologies in addition to novel topologies&lt;br/&gt;and routing mechanisms; (3) developing methodologies at the NoC level that will &lt;br/&gt;support data prefetching mechanisms in the Multicore Accelerators; and (4) providing&lt;br/&gt;multicast support and packet coalescing in the on-chip network to guarantee better&lt;br/&gt;system throughput. The results from this project are likely to foster new research directions in several&lt;br/&gt;areas of Computer Architecture and Parallel Computing. Also, high-performance and &lt;br/&gt;energy-aware computing and communication research is applicable to other areas,&lt;br/&gt;such as Embedded Systems and Cloud Computing. We will develop web-based tutorials to &lt;br/&gt;present and disseminate the results of this project, including tools and techniques, to a broad audience.</AbstractNarration>
