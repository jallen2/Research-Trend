    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: IIA - 1434142&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Dongming Mei&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of South Dakota Main Campus&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Workshop on Underground Science Applications for Germanium-Based Detectors and Technologies &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Science investigations in undergound research facilities have enabled pivotal discoveries about the dark matter that comprises over 80% of the total matter in the universe. This project will provide support for an interdisciplinary workshop to examine the status of detectors and technologies that can be used in characterizing dark matter. The workshop will be held in South Dakota, the home of the deepest underground research facility in US. The workshop participants will explore challenges, critical measures, and research and development opportunities related to detector technology development and experimental design. The national and international experts, faculty, researchers, students, and industrial partners who participate in the workshop will identify critical research needs and define a path forward. The workshop will serve to foster broader inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) in the emerging directions of particle physics, research using underground facilities, and dark matter exploration. The workshop outcomes can lead to novel training programs for young researchers, undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. Economic drivers for the workshop include potential commercial opportunities for manufacturing detectors and sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Germanium-based detectors and technologies are proving to be key enablers for detecting dark matter and neutrino-less double beta decays. This workshop brings together experts, practitioners, faculty, and students to share ideas on the status of crystal-growth techniques and low-threshold detectors. The workshop participants will learn about current and planned activities at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota including ton-scale dark matter, neutrino-less double beta decay, long baseline neutrino, and other large-scale experiments. Workshop activities will leverage the capabilities of SURF; catalyze the commercial fabrication of Germanium crystals, detectors, and wafers; and provide a forum for engaging and inspiring next-generation researchers. Workshop products include: a plan for formalizing a research consortium, white papers that identify critical research and development needs, and a road map for future experiments. It is also anticipated that the workshop will foster stronger ties between academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>
