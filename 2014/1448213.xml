    <AbstractNarration>Epigenetics (literally, "above the gene") is a field of science which studies stable alterations in gene expression which occur through modifications which do not alter the sequence composition of DNA, yet which produce stable alterations in phenotypes (the physical expression of the genome). There is growing evidence that these epigenetic factors are responsive to environmental exposures both pre- and post-natally in animals, including humans; very importantly, these factors influencing gene expression include aspects of the social and behavioral environments. Factors such as varying aspects of the nurturing environment for infants and young children, socioeconomic circumstances, degrees and forms of stress experienced by individuals, and substance abuse, for example, are implicated in long-lasting biological and behavioral effects which may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms - and these effects may not only persist into and throughout adulthood, but some may transcend generations, the effects being seen in offspring and grand-offspring of impacted individuals. As these social, behavioral, and psychological environmental influences on the epigenetic programming of biological and behavioral functioning can substantially impact human well-being and resilience, the science constituting the field of social and behavioral epigenetics is critically important. The societal benefits of the research in the field potentially will extend to impacts in areas such as human development and aging; memory, cognition, neuropsychology, stress, and learning; nutrition and nutritional issues such as obesity; substance abuse; violence; human biological functioning/variation and its adaptive/evolutionary significance; adaptation/maladaptation to rapid social and environmental change; and 'downstream' impacts on human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complexity of the science, including the need to integrate fields of social science, as well as those sciences with aspects of the biological sciences, supports the need for synthesis of a research agenda that can most effectively advance the field, including both short- and long-term goals. This workshop is specifically designed to develop this agenda and thereby guide the targeting and the breadth of funding required to advance social and behavioral epigenetic research. The international scope of the workshop - bringing together the most active and influential members of the US and UK research communities developing this science of global interest and importance - also will provide opportunity to compare perspectives, approaches, and resources which can be leveraged to move the field forward.</AbstractNarration>
