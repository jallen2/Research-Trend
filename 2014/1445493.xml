    <AbstractNarration>The project will provide financial support for NSF CAREER Awardees in Photonics to participate in a workshop to be held in San Jose, CA on June 13, 2014. The goal of the workshop is to bring together many recent CAREER Award winners supported by the ECCS division to discuss their progress in photonics and to promote development of their research careers. The workshop will be co-located with the Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO) 2014 meeting being held in San Jose, CA during June 8-13, 2014. CLEO serves as the premier international forum for scientific and technical optics, uniting the fields of lasers and opto-electronics by bringing together all aspects of laser technology, from basic research to industry applications. The main objective goal of the Workshop is to assist NSF CAREER Awardees in photonics to improve their experience as junior faculty members who are establishing their academic careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Workshop, recent NSF CAREER Awardees will present their research activities in photonics. Technical discussions will span a broad range of areas of photonics research, from materials to devices, including integrated photonics, non-linear optics, microstructure and specialty fibers, optical sensors, optical manipulators, metamaterials, and Mid IR photonics. The meeting will facilitate an open technical exchange to establish new collaborations, determine future research strategies and infrastructure needs as well as opportunities to pursue larger award opportunities, including NSF Engineering Research Centers. In addition, the workshop is expected to provide a special venue for NSF CAREER Awardees to interact with leaders from both academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>
