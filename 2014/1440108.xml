    <AbstractNarration>PI: Eden, Mario R.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 1440108&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Auburn University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design (FOCAPD-2014)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to provide funds for partial support of graduate students, postdoctoral associates and US academic junior faculty speakers to attend the 8th International Conference on Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design, FOCAPD-2014, which will be held at the Suncadia Resort, Cle Elum, Washington July 13-17, 2014. The conference is sponsored by CACHE and the AIChE CAST Division. The major theme of FOCAPD-2014, "Innovation for Sustainability at the Interface of Process and Product Design", reflects an ongoing emphasis of chemical process and product design on sustainability both within traditional chemical processes and at the interface of traditional processes with non-traditional areas. The primary goal of FOCAPD-2014 is to create an academic and industrial dialogue, a critical assessment of existing enabling technologies, a discussion of research, education, and industrial needs, and a forum for new directions, challenges and opportunities in product and process design. The FOCAPD-2014 conference will feature two keynote lectures, 25 plenary lectures by world-renowned experts, a future challenges session featuring eight junior faculty, and three contributed paper sessions. The conference aims at attracting over 150 participants and over 100 contributed papers. It is expected that the FOCAPD-2014 conference will be an exciting meeting that will have a lasting impact for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;1. FOCAPD-2014 will bring together and foster interaction among world-renowned experts from academia and industry, researchers and practitioners from government laboratories and several industries, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates.&lt;br/&gt;2. FOCAPD-2014 will create a technical and scientific forum for the topics of integrated product and process design; enabling technologies in design: modeling, simulation, optimization methods and applications, operations; product and process design for energy and the environment; education, training and industrial needs in product and process design; and challenges and opportunities in frontiers of product and process design that include systems biology.&lt;br/&gt;3. A special session on Thursday afternoon will feature eight outstanding junior faculty focusing on defining the new challenges and opportunities at the frontiers of sustainable chemical product and process design.&lt;br/&gt;4. FOCAPD-2014 will foster the definition of new problems and challenges in the areas of sustainable chemical product and process design that will be motivated by changing industrial needs and feedstock availability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;1. FOCAPD-2014 will aim at attracting the next generation of researchers in the product/process design area that is reflected in the graduate students and postdoctoral associates.&lt;br/&gt;2. The conference will serve as a vehicle for dissemination of the state of the art in sustainable chemical product and process design through its fully indexed and citable proceedings that will include the plenary and contributed papers, its website, and more importantly through the informal discussions on research, education, training and industrial needs.&lt;br/&gt;3. The chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, and services/software industries will benefit by the introduction of new approaches, problems and technologies for discovery through computer-aided product and process design. Such technologies will lead to better products, faster response to consumer demands and more efficient utilization of manufacturing facilities, which has a direct benefit to the US economy.</AbstractNarration>
