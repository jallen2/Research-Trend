    <AbstractNarration>Broader Significance and Importance&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to support the travel of students and post-doctoral fellows (PDFs) to attend the 4th International Conference on Advances in Bio and medical Sciences (ICCABS). These students and PDFs will get to meet experts in Bioinformatics and listen to their research results. Not only the attending students and PDFs but also their friends will benefit since when the students and PDFs return to their schools they will communicate their experience with their friends. The conference proceedings will be of great use to students, researchers, and practitioners. Portions of the proceedings could be used in different courses as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description of the Project&lt;br/&gt;Computational techniques are revolutionizing the way in which research is conducted in science and engineering. Unsurpassed advances have been made in various areas. This is particularly true in the domains of biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Given that these areas are of utmost importance to the society at large, it is imperative that every effort be made to enable research advances in them. It is not enough if advances are made in these areas in isolation. These communities have to work together to help each other and come up with the best possible diagnosis tools, treatment procedures, drugs for various diseases, etc. Even though a number of conferences exist today in the general area of bioinformatics, they focus on computational biology to a large extent. The proposed conference has the goal of bringing together scientists in all the three areas and hence serving as a platform for bridging the research efforts in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its goal of bringing together scientists in various areas of bio and medical sciences and fostering collaborations among them.</AbstractNarration>
