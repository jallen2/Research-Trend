    <AbstractNarration>The marine organisms living on or in the sediment in the Nueces Delta Marsh, Texas have been adversely affected by increasing salinity. The salinity has been increasing because freshwater flow has been reduced through the construction of dams. In an effort to reduce the salinity a pipeline was constructed to pump freshwater directly into the marsh. To determine the optimum pumping conditions, with regard to these organisms, copepods will be collected at three sites within the immediate area of the pump outflow. Copepods are a good choice because they are the second most abundant group of animals within their size class, are affected by salinity changes, and are often preferred food for juvenile demersal fish, shrimp, and polychaete worms. However, there are very few remaining scientists who study this size class of benthic animals and even fewer copepod taxonomists in the United States. Therefore, this research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Wonchoel Lee, a noted expert on copepod taxonomy, at Hanyang University in South Korea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide decision makers with information to better manage the local environment, increase the number of taxonomically trained scientists in the United States, and possibly new genetic and taxonomic data for copepods. Core samples and water measurements are being collected from 3 stations quarterly and from the station nearest the freshwater inflow every two weeks. To this end the following information will be determined during the different pumping patterns: the abundance of copepods, the taxonomic composition of copepods, and the dominate species. All taxonomic data and species descriptions generated will be uploaded to the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative Information and Data cooperative (GRIIDC). This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>
