    <AbstractNarration>1437933&lt;br/&gt;Williams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primary Emissions and Atmospheric Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation from Coal Combustion and Coal-Biomass Cofiring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been recently discovered that along with known emissions from coal combustion and coal-biomass cofiring (e.g., greenhouse gases, refractory particles), organic aerosol can also be directly emitted as primary organic aerosol or produced in the atmosphere as secondary organic aerosol from aging of volatile organic compounds emitted from inefficient combustion/pyrolysis processes. Atmospheric organic aerosols have a significant impact on human health and global climate, and increased emissions in developing nations will have transport-driven implications, even for those nations that have employed improved emissions technologies. Before a prediction can be made on the extent of future organic aerosol emissions, it is first required to understand associated particle formation mechanisms and secondary organic aerosol formation potential at a fundamental level across a range of fuels, combustion efficiencies, and photochemical atmospheric ages; this understanding is the objective of this project. To meet Missouri's need for increased science and engineering education (MO is an EPSCoR state), a novel STEM-based Peer Mentoring Pipeline Program will be established to activate Grade 6 through PhD level research and education of ambient air quality and control technologies. Research projects involving air sampling (using custom sampling kits) in the presence and absence of a control technology (portable air purifiers) and subsequent sample analysis, data processing, and reporting will educate all participants on the science, technology, and impact of pollution and control technologies. Here, students gain mentoring experience and observe the strength and impact of outreach activities, increasing their likelihood of incorporating these types of activities in their careers as they move up the mentoring pipeline. A new Peer Mentoring Pipeline Program for research and education on air quality and pollution control will be implemented for underrepresented youth in St. Louis schools. Research and outreach results will be broadly disseminated through: national conferences, student groups, and graduate/ undergraduate courses in Aerosol Science &amp; Technology / Atmospheric Science / Climate / Thermodynamics, and results will be made publicly available through peer-reviewed publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives of this project are aimed at characterizing new particle formation mechanisms from combustion/pyrolysis of coal and coal-biomass mixtures, determining associated secondary organic aerosol formation potential and organic aerosol evolution in the atmosphere, and to increase education and awareness of the need for pollution control technologies. Methods involve a novel suite of lab-scale furnaces/flames operating together with a novel suite of chemical and physical measurements on gas and particle emissions for a range of fuels and combustion/pyrolysis conditions. Additionally, a photochemical reactor will be employed to test the secondary organic aerosol formation potential of emissions over a range of atmospheric ages. Models for new particle formation and atmospheric oxidative evolution will be constructed. At the conclusion of this project, metrics will be available for new particle formation in combustion/pyrolysis systems operating with various fuels and at various degrees of efficiency. Atmospheric secondary organic aerosol formation potentials and regional/global climate impact will be better understood for a major global source of emissions that has not been previously investigated at this fundamental level, yet evidence for its strong environmental impact has already been observed and will continue to increase in developing regions of the world.</AbstractNarration>
