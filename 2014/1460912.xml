    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL PART: The National Science Foundation "Back to the Future" Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology provides research experiences focused in metallurgical engineering for a diverse group of students from all over the nation including students from two-year and tribal colleges with limited research opportunities. Students conduct research on projects that improve the responsible and efficient use of domestic metal resources and improve the materials and manufacturing methods used in the transportation, medical, and energy sectors. Students are engaged in an innovative series of workshops and seminars on the importance of metals throughout history (the Back to the Future theme) that enhance the student understanding of the impact of research on society. In addition, students participate in an integrated professional development and technical communications program that will give them the capabilities to become the next generation of young professionals and researchers in science and engineering. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site is supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL PART: The REU Site: Back to the Future III at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology is a 10-week summer program that provides research opportunities in metallurgical engineering that enhance the global competitiveness of the nation in the areas of advanced materials and manufacturing, mineral beneficiation and resource recovery, strategic metals, and energy-efficient materials. The program addresses the challenges faced by future engineers by providing a research experience within a unique cultural and holistic framework. This framework is provided by projects that have historical significance and innovative programmatic activities led by faculty from engineering, science, and the humanities that explore the interface between engineering, history, and art (the Back to the Future theme). Students participate in an integrated supplemental training program that nurtures their research skills and career development. This program includes advanced technical communications training, workshops to give historical context for current trends in research, as well as activities that connect students to each other and the community. Data suggest that the diverse nature of program activities attracts students of varied background and intellectual typology. The Site will provide opportunities for underserved students in engineering with an emphasis on two-year community and Tribal Colleges. The site will also strengthen ongoing Native American initiatives in the region including the NSF All Nations Louis Stokes, Tiospaye, and OSSPEEC programs. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site is supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
