    <AbstractNarration>The main thrust of this 1-year project is to debug and optimize the existent codes that are used to process data from the Imaging Vector Magnetograph (IVM) gathered during 1992-2006 (1.5 solar cycles). Historic data from the IVM have contributed to major advances in understanding the photospheric vector magnetic fields of active regions on the Sun. The main goal is to advance those data-processing codes of IVM data, so that the released archive of IVM data is of as high quality as possible for use by the broad solar community. Upon completion of this project, the available IVM data archive will be treated consistently, and it will ready for scientific analysis. This research project will contribute to improved community knowledge on handling imaging spectro-polarimetric data, which will have an impact on analyzing data from the future DKIST (formerly known as the ATST). The project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A consistently produced archive of IVM data presents a unique data source for studying the long-term behavior of the Sun, since it allows for inversion-independent determination of magnetic field strengths in sunspots over 1.5 solar cycles. The IVM data have featured prominently in novel investigations of solar flares and their prediction --- a topic with societal impacts that range from communications disruptions to power-grid outages. The IVM data would contribute to the large statistical samples needed for further progress, complementing present data from SDO/HMI. Predicting solar flares, and quantitatively understanding the inter-cycle behavior of our Sun, are questions with potentially major impacts on today's society.</AbstractNarration>
