    <AbstractNarration>PI: Xu, X. Nancy&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1450936&lt;br/&gt;Title: BRAIN EAGER: New Tools for Real-Time Imaging of Molecular-Resolution Connectomics of Synapses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance&lt;br/&gt;The successful outcome of this EAGER project will have a broad impact in neuroscience. The proposed project will offer new insights into the roles and functions of neurotransmitters in synaptic plasticity and regeneration. This will lead to the development of innovative tools for molecular identification and characterization of roles and functions of multiple types of neurotransmitters, their receptors, and their interactions and dynamics in synapses at the spatial and temporal resolution level. These powerful new tools are expected to become extremely valuable in addressing a wide range of pressing biological, biochemical and biomedical questions related to molecular and real-time characterization of functions of single live cells (neurons). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The brain comprises large number of neurons, which are not continuous. Synapses enable them to communicate complex and specific commands with each other by passing specific electrical or chemical signals to another cell. Each synapse contains extensive arrays of molecular machinery that links the membranes of the coupled partner neurons, an array of neurotransmitters and their receptors. The aims of this project is to develop a novel imaging platform, including next-generation multicolored far-field photostable optical nanoscopy (PHOTON) with photostable multicolored single molecule nanoparticle optical biosensors (SMNOBS). This platform will quantitatively image and molecularly characterize roles and functions of multiple types of molecules (neurotransmitters, receptors) at individual live synapses in real time at nanometer (nm) resolution. These capabilities will enable the identification of the roles and functions of single neurotransmitter-receptor interactions, identify and characterize their roles in modulating and regulating functions of single synapses and neurons in real time. They will use the multicolored PHOTON: (i) to quantitatively and simultaneously detect and map diffusion and molecular dynamics of multiple types of neurotransmitters, their receptors and their interactions on each synapse with both spatial and temporal resolutions; (ii) to construct the connection of individual neurons at individual synapses at the molecular resolution; (iii) to explore the possibility of creating connectomics to determine the functions and related molecular pathways of synapses and their roles in neuron and brain functions at the molecular resolution level.</AbstractNarration>
