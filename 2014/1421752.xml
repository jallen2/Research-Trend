    <AbstractNarration>Configuration updates are a common source of instability in networks&lt;br/&gt;today, frequently leading to outages, disruptions, and even security&lt;br/&gt;vulnerabilities. A key factor that makes updates difficult to&lt;br/&gt;implement is that networks are complex systems with many interacting&lt;br/&gt;components. A typical datacenter network consists of&lt;br/&gt;thousands of devices, a significant challenge for network administrators&lt;br/&gt;is that each of these devices must be reconfigured after an update. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop new mechanisms for implementing &lt;br/&gt;network configuration updates using techniques based on software synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet this goal, the research is developing (i) new synthesis&lt;br/&gt;algorithms based on efficient incremental model checking techniques;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) extensions that model bandwidth and fault tolerance using&lt;br/&gt;quantitative constraints and objective functions; and (iii)&lt;br/&gt;theoretical foundations based on connections to concurrent and&lt;br/&gt;distributed programming. The project will have broad impact by&lt;br/&gt;discovering new techniques that automate a difficult network&lt;br/&gt;administration task and by training undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;students with interdisciplinary skills in formal methods and&lt;br/&gt;networking.</AbstractNarration>
