    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Liquid crystals are unquestionably one of the most commercially important forms of condensed matter. They are widely used in displays, electro-optic and photonic devices and for energy conversion. This usefulness arises from the ability to control the orientation of these cigar shaped molecules with electric and magnetic fields. New materials allow ever more complex structures to be engineered and increase the functionality of liquid crystalline materials. The Principal Investigator (PI) and his team will develop new types of liquid crystals consisting of tiny colloidal particles dispersed in a liquid crystal medium. The colloidal particles will have different shapes (topologies) which will determine the types of structures that the liquid crystals will develop when subjected to electric and magnetic fields. They will study the behavior of these 'topological colloids' to learn how the interactions between the nanoparticles and the liquid crystal molecules determine the structure with the goal of developing a "recipe book" to organize the particles into precisely controlled structures. Understanding of fundamental underpinnings of this 'topology-guided' self-assembly may enable development of new electrically- and optically-controlled materials with unique properties needed for practical devices of importance to society, such as flexible displays and data storage devices. The PI will integrate this research with a broad range of synergistic educational and outreach activities, including 'Light, Color, &amp; Matter' Wizard Shows in elementary and secondary schools, Science Tours for high school students, advising student chapters of professional societies and providing research experiences for students and faculty from minority-serving institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The PI seeks to develop a new soft matter system dubbed 'topological colloids' and identify the fundamental organizing principles behind topology-dictated self-assembly of colloidal particles in liquid crystals (LCs). This research will involve the design of methods for scalable fabrication of topologically distinct colloidal particles of different sizes and their dispersions in LCs, experimental study and modeling of the interplay between the topology of particles, director fields, and topological defects, as well as explorations of switchable colloidal self-assembly and alignment controlled by electric and magnetic fields and light. The emerging interdisciplinary scientific frontiers are at the nexus of nanoscience, condensed matter physics, and topology/mathematics. From subatomic particles to cosmology, many phenomena arise from the topological interaction of fields, surfaces, and monopole or string-like defects. This topological interplay is constrained by theorems from topology but is hard to be probed experimentally. The model system of topological colloids may enable direct experimental studies of such topological interactions, thus impinging on many scientific fields, well beyond the specific goals of the proposed research activity. The research activity is transformative in nature and expected to lay the groundwork for new research directions ranging from topology-constrained self-assembly to experimental studies of low-dimensional topology. Beyond the exploration of physical underpinnings, the experimental arena PI and his students are developing may enable scaffolding of nanoparticles, self-assembly of reconfigurable topological memory devices, as well as new electro-optic effects based on switching between different multi-stable director fields and orientations of particles. The fundamental phenomena will be examined in contexts of self-assembly-based fabrication of novel nanostructured composites and may lead to practical LC devices of importance to society, such as novel displays. The research is integrated with a broad range of synergistic outreach and educational activities ranging from Wizard Shows in elementary and secondary schools to teaching short courses for liquid crystal industry and to organizing international conferences and summer schools.</AbstractNarration>
