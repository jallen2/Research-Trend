    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NONTECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The organizers propose an interdisciplinary graduate student oriented two half-day symposium at the March 2014 meeting of the ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry and the ACS younger Chemists Committee. The symposium is intended to provide recognition of outstanding graduate students engaged in polymer research, to foster fundamental scientific exchange, networking, and to help develop the careers of future leaders in polymer science and engineering. University departments in the US and Canada were invited to submit nominations for one outstanding graduate student each to speak on his/her's original research at this special symposium. Research presentations selected by the organizing committee will cover interdisciplinary topics in polymer science and engineering, encompassing novel synthetic strategies, structure/property evaluations and performance in rapidly emerging technologies.</AbstractNarration>
