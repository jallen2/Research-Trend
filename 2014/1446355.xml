    <AbstractNarration>The Sixth World Conference on Structural Control and Monitoring (6WCSCM) will be held on the campus of Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, July 15-17, 2014. The WCSCM is recognized as the premier interdisciplinary global gathering of experts working in the theoretical, numerical, experimental and practical advancements of monitoring and control technologies for dynamic structures in a wide range of civil, infrastructure, mechanical, aerospace and energy systems. This international meeting occurs once every four years, and brings the world's leading experts together with young researchers and students. The previous editions of WCSCM were held in Pasadena, CA (1994), Kyoto, Japan (1998), Como, Italy (2002), La Jolla, CA (2006) and Tokyo, Japan (2010). This award will enable attendance by new faculty and graduate students from US institutions, and will broaden participation by underrepresented groups. US participants will receive a special invitation to visit laboratories at UPC and meet with local researchers as a field trip from the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference serves the disciplines of Structural Control, Structural Health Monitoring, and Smart Structures and Materials. Application areas of interest include control and monitoring of bridges and buildings, earthquake engineering, damage detection and structural control for aircraft, spacecraft, surface vessels and submarines, structural engineering for robots and other mechanical systems, and structural monitoring and control of large wind turbines. This award will be used to cover between one-third and two-thirds of total travel costs, which will assist between 7 and 14 US participants. Eleven highly qualified individuals have been tentatively identified, including four women.</AbstractNarration>
