    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Fayetteville State University (FSU) seeks to adapt a Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) and establish a Hi-Tech Studio classroom as an active and collaborative learning environment to enhance the quality of undergraduate STEM education and to stimulate students' learning in STEM fields. The goals of the project are to: (1) implement SCALE-UP and Flipped Education in a technology-rich, highly collaborative, hands-on, interactive learning environment; (2) reduce students' failure rate and increase student interest in STEM courses; and(3) build a community of STEM educators at FSU to replicate Hi-Tech Studio Classrooms in other STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SCALE-UP will be implemented in the Hi-Tech Studio Classroom at FSU where about 90% of class time is spent in student-led and hands-on activities. Through a partnership with Norh Carolina State University and the Vernier Company, faculty will be trained in implementing this learning approach during the three-year project. Numerous research studies have shown that if students are more engaged in the learning process, their problem-solving ability and understanding of material are improved. Through this project, technology and hands-on activities in the classroom will engage students and enhance their learning in STEM fields. Additionally, the inquiry-led approach will increase their problem-solving and critical thinking skills. One of the project outcomes is that students will obtain a sense of discovery that motivates them to remain in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FSU is an HBCU with a student body that is 66% African American. Females make up 70% of the student population. By summer 2017, more than 1000 students (50 class sections) will be impacted by the project. Even more students will benefit from the project by further implementation of the Hi-Tech Studio classroom in other STEM and non-STEM courses on campus in the near future. In addition, one Postdoctoral Teaching Associate and at least 50 Learning Assistants will be mentored. The project will be evaluated both formatively and summatively to assess the effectiveness of the implementation at FSU. Evaluation results and lessons learned will be disseminated through published papers, presentations, and seminars through linkages to other STEM institutions, including area K-12 schools. Potentially, the results of the evaluation and dissemination activities will further contribute to the current body of literature on the SCALE-UP/Flipped Classroom pedagogy, particularly at minority-serving institutions, in addition to producing highly engaged undergraduate STEM students in chemistry and physics classes.</AbstractNarration>
