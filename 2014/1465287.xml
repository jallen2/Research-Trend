    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Christopher M. Beaudry of Oregon State University is developing efficient methods for the construction of molecules with complex architectures that contain nitrogen. Since the vast majority of biologically active molecules are nitrogenous, this research will create new opportunities for the identification of biologically active molecules. Synthetic molecules are being tested for their ability to serve as pharmaceutical lead compounds, biological probes, and selective inhibitors of cellular proteins. Researchers contributing to this work represent a diverse multiracial, multicultural, multi-gender group of scientists. Professor Beaudry supervises formal weekly and monthly research meetings where scientists are trained for experimentation and dissemination of the work. Moreover, the diverse Beaudry group actively participates in community outreach and lifelong learning with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, "Science Pub," a locally-organized discussion of science, and organization of the Pacific Northwest Undergraduate Research Symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, the project focuses on study and development of new chemical reactions of carbon-centered radicals that bear two nitrogen atoms. Such aminal radicals are used to create new carbon-carbon bonds in molecules containing heteroatoms, such as pharmaceuticals and natural products. The use of these radicals allows efficient syntheses of target molecules while avoiding acid-base chemistry of nitrogen, and as such represents a new strategy for chemical synthesis.</AbstractNarration>
