    <AbstractNarration>EAPSI: Investigating ocean territory and resource sovereignty through seabed mining in South Pacific Island Nations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As land-based resources are diminishing, the world is looking offshore to satisfy growing appetites for food, fuel and minerals. The deep seabed is being targeted for large-scale mining, which has only recently become possible with changes in global markets and advancing technologies. However, mining rare metals and minerals from the deep seabed present a number of significant challenges to resource managers, and push the limits of scientific knowledge, technical ability and institutional capacity. This project will investigate the emerging management strategies in New Zealand and other South Pacific Island Nations as they lay the groundwork for deep seabed resource development. New Zealand is a prominent economic force in the South Pacific and has considerable influence in the region. It is also one of the first nations exploring seabed mining, which makes it a critically important site for this research. In collaboration with Dr. Nick Lewis at the University of Auckland, this project will employ a mixed methods approach utilizing archives, interviews and spatial planning data. It will examine emerging resource management strategies in New Zealand, as well as its role within the regional governance context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) give coastal nations a form of resource-based sovereignty up to 200 nautical miles from shore. Managing these vast ocean territories has proved challenging to institutions historically developed to govern land. Pacific Island Nations are presumed to have the most to gain from developing seabed resources because their EEZs are much larger than the resource-limited island nations. Results of this investigation will be important to developing island nations, as they struggle to advance concrete seabed management strategies with fewer economic and governmental resources. Additionally, this work will address a significant gap in critical geography scholarship on processes of territory, environmental governance and the commodification of nature in the context of marine-based resource management. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>
