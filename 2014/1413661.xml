    <AbstractNarration>The quest to detect and measure ultra-high-energy neutrinos (&gt;100 petaelectronvolts, PeV) is at the forefront of particle astrophysics and has been going on for many years. Detectors that exploit photomultipliers, like the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at South Pole, have made significant progress detecting neutrinos up to 1-2 PeV, but to instrument realistic larger target mass volumes, one needs to turn to techniques like the radio detection of high-energy neutrinos in media where radio waves can easily propagate ? like an ice sheet or shelf. The neutrinos being searched for can bring essential information about their origins, where and how they were made, and thereby shed light on the origins of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The nature of cosmic accelerators is one of the key questions of modern high-energy astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antarctic Ross Ice-Shelf ANtenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA) is one of the proposed detectors for ultra-high energy astrophysical neutrinos, which is designed to measure coherent radio Cherenkov emissions from particle showers produced by neutrino interactions within ice. ARIANNA can be built on the Ross Ice Shelf just off the coast of Antarctica (~100-km south from McMurdo Station), eventually covering about 1000 square-km in surface area. There, the ice-water interface below the ~600-m thick shelf reflects radio waves, giving ARIANNA sensitivity to downward going neutrinos and improving its sensitivity to horizontally incident neutrinos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this award is to complete the deployment of the remaining four stations for the pilot 7-station Hexagonal Radio Array (HRA, approximately 2-km distance between sides) that can serve as a "building block" for a much larger ARIANNA project, ultimately consisting of ~960 stations. Upon completing the HRA deployment, the focus will be on analysis tasks: carefully examining the data collected by the HRA stations, characterizing the sources and properties of non-thermal contributions, and monitoring the robustness of the HRA stations in its year-round operation. These stations operate autonomously, using solar power for about 7 months and going to sleep for austral winter months. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anticipated broader impacts from this project include training graduate students, furthering international scientific collaboration and cooperation in Antarctica, and providing data that will be of significant importance and use by the neutrino astrophysics community.</AbstractNarration>
