    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Representation Theory, Number Theory, and Invariant Theory," taking place June 1-5, 2015 at Yale University, New Haven, CT. Representation theory of Lie groups is a central subject in current mathematics. The theory is motivated on one hand by physics and on the other by the theory of automorphic forms, with deep roots in classical analysis and with strong ties to differential equations. Thanks to the diversity of motivations, goals, and methods involved, it has broad applications to a variety of branches of mathematics, bridging many areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will review the role of representation theory in various disciplines such as automorphic forms, harmonic analysis, and invariant theory developed over the past half a century, present recent progress in this field, and chart future developments in the subject. The meeting will feature lectures from world experts, discussion sessions among participants, and problem sessions. The broad spectrum and great current interest of the topics will make the conference inspiring for young mathematicians and stimulate further progress in the field. A volume of proceedings, intended to make these results more accessible and applicable, will be produced.
