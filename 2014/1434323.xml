    <AbstractNarration>The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) will take place at the University of California, Berkeley on April 11-13, 2014. USTARS is an annual symposium designed to bring together student researchers in algebra and topology, focusing on and showcasing research by underrepresented students and providing mentorship for the participants through critical educational and career transitions. In 2010, 29% of the mathematics doctorates were awarded to women, while less than 4% were awarded to minority students. USTARS promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. USTARS exposes all participants to the research and activities of underrepresented mathematicians, encouraging a more inclusive and collaborative mathematics community. Graduate students who attend USTARS are better equipped to seek academic positions and continue the cycle of mathematical research and collaboration. Undergraduate students are exposed to a wide variety of current research, ideas, and results, often more comprehensive than the topics available at their home institutions. A one-day workshop at the start of USTARS focuses on specific stages in professional careers and the critical transitions associated with each stage. Participants have the opportunity to network with underrepresented professors and students who may become future collaborators, colleagues, and/or mentors. USTARS participants continue to influence the next generation of students in positive ways by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events. More information is available at: www.ustars.org&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is a project proposed and guided by a national group of underrepresented mathematicians. At USTARS, student researchers convene in a structured meeting, along with professional mathematicians. Students deliver 30-minute research talks in structured parallel sessions. Graduate students give 75% or more of these presentations. Two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour presentations. A poster session features invited undergraduate researchers. Topics of presentations given in prior years include: combinatorics, braid groups, graph theory, knot theory, representation theory number theory and algebraic geometry.</AbstractNarration>
