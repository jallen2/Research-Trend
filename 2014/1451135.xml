    <AbstractNarration>The 2014 International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM 2014) seeks to create opportunities for advancing science, technology, and education to a varied and diverse audience, including students, faculty, scientists, and engineers, and to provide a platform for the cross-fertilization of ideas. This focus on educating the next generation of bioinformatics, systems biology, and intelligent computing experts with up-to-date technologies and knowledge creates limitless opportunities for the advancement of research and development within computer scince as well as complex biomedical systems and translational medical research, as well agricultural, environmental, pharmaceutical, and zoological sciences. Now is the time to promote the fundamental concepts of molecular biotechnology, genomics, and systems biology for researchers seeking to understand living organisms at multiple levels, to explore complex and dynamic functions and regulation in cellular systems, and to improve algorithms, computational tools, and biotechniques for better diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICIBM 2014 will continue in the successful tradition of facilitating training and informational programs catering to various levels of research expertise in computer scince and computational biology fields. New researchers can utilize resources to gain higher levels of training and information from experts and innovators, while established researchers will have continued access to collaborative communication and new opportunities. Through increased dialogue, educational activities, collaborative opportunities, and interactions throughout the event, ICIBM 2014 will fuel advancements and cutting-edge research within these fields and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
