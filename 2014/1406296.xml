    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at Iowa State University (ISU) entitled, "RET Site in Engineering and Computer Science: Energy and Sustainability-To Develop the Green Collar Workforce for the 21st Century", under the direction of Dr. Eric W. Cochran. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical focus of this Site is sustainable energy and materials. Faculty mentors represent a diverse array of backgrounds supporting this theme and are affiliated with a number of ISU centers and institutes including the NSF Center for BioRenewable Chemicals (CBiRC) Engineering Research Center. Research opportunities will include a broad spectrum of specialities within the theme of energy and sustainability: from the production of fuels, chemicals, and polymers from renewable feedstocks; to advances in photovoltaics and fuel cells; and to novel water purification systems. These projects highlight the efforts at ISU to develop technologies that will allow a continuation of current living standards without jeopardizing the environment. Such topics are especially relevant for an RET Site since they address needs that directly connect with students served by participating teachers. Project Lead the Way (PLTW)-trained and Career and Technology Education (CTE) high school instructors will receive authentic research experiences in engineering disciplines for 7 weeks during the summer plus additional activities during the academic school year. These experiences will enable participants to prepare and inspire their students to become part of the 21st century "green-collar" workforce. A total of 39 participants (13 per year) will be selected from Iowa's pool of PLTW-trained high school teachers as well as CTE instructors who are not yet part of the PLTW program. The objectives of this Site are to: provide technology and pre-engineering instructors immersion in engineering research and applications; help teachers learn to translate this experience into increased student engagement in the STEM fields; leverage the research experience into enhanced curriculum delivery designed to recruit and prepare students for future careers in engineering and technology fields; and form personal connections between ISU Engineeirng Faculty and Iowa PLTW and CTE teachers, ultimately helping to raise the level of student preparedness for the transition to college. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project include increased professional development for high school PLTW and CTE teachers; increased opportunity for teachers to catalyze their efforts in curriculum development to be able to share with their students the rewarding and exciting opportunities associated with a career in engineering; benefits to the U.S. economy resulting from a well-trained, globally competitive workforce; and the introduction of RET participants to the ISU Program for Women in Engineering (PWSE), Student Role Models.</AbstractNarration>
