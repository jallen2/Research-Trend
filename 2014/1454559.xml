    <AbstractNarration>1454559 (Zhang). Increasing water demand, accompanied by water scarcity and the likely impact of climate change on water supplies, has created complex challenges for sustainable water management, demonstrating the need for integrated wastewater management that promotes and facilitates resource recovery. This research aims to determine the optimal sustainable configurations for integrated wastewater management under a given context through an innovative decision framework that integrates multi-discipline methods and tools and context-based learning. The objectives of this research are to (1) innovate a decision framework, WasteWATER, that integrates methods and tools from multiple disciplines including reverse logistics, life cycle analysis, and economic valuation; (2) examine the impact of demographics, geography, climate, and urban form on the optimal degree of decentralization; and (3) create context-based learning to train future practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WasteWATER framework considers wastewater systems as a reverse supply network in which nodes are treatment facilities, pumping stations, and pipe junctions and links are pipelines. The framework uses compact model formulation through unique process and distribution pipeline mode representation. Triple bottom line sustainability indicators (specific net present value, carbon footprint, eutrophication, and social value of recovered resources) are formulated in the objective function to optimize the trade-off and identify the most sustainable configuration of integrated wastewater systems. Placement-based and hypothetical scenarios will be generated and simulated to identify the factors impacting the optimal degree of decentralization. The Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) approach will be used to develop a web application of the WasteWATER framework and redesign two existing engineering courses using microblogging and utility partnerships as a stakeholder communication platform. The CDIO learning outcomes will be evaluated using several assessment methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Past research has identified that a primary challenge for integrated wastewater management is the lack of a planning and design methodology to evaluate and identify the most sustainable solution under a given context. This project addresses this critical challenge and will advance knowledge in (1) quantifying the sustainability of integrated wastewater systems driven by resource recovery; (2) understanding factors that impact the degree of decentralization; and (3) effectiveness of context-based learning environment for students' proficiency in disciplinary knowledge, interpersonal skills, and product, process, and system building skills. The project also will develop a new framework through the perspective of reverse logistics, a web tool, and a microblogging communication platform for stakeholder participation. Realization of integrated wastewater management will provide societal benefits that enhance community well-being in terms of reliable water supply, resource conservation, environmental restoration, and regional and local economic development. The project will leverage support from the Alfred P. Sloan Minority Ph.D. program to recruit and support under-represented minority graduate students. The research and education activities will be woven together to provide a context-based learning environment to train postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students. Stakeholder participation and wide dissemination of research and education findings and products will be achieved through microblogging, a web tool, and utility partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
