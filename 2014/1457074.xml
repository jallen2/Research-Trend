    <AbstractNarration>The Named Data Network (NDN) project team will hold the First NDN Community Meeting (NDNComm) on September 4-5, 2014, on the campus of the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA). The NDN project is one of three Future Internet Architectures-Next Phase (FIA-NP) projects funded by NSF. This meeting is organized in response to growing interest from the broader networking community participating in the NDN architectural design, testbed building, platform implementation, and application development. The planning for this workshop has been directly influenced by academic, industry, and government sector interest in the NDN project, and intentions from a wide range of parties to contribute more productively to, and influence its, evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental goal of the meeting is to engage the broader community in NDN development, and more specifically to achieve the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;1. Elaborate on the current state of the NDN software platform and supporting libraries and applications.&lt;br/&gt;2. Describe the state of current operational NDN testbed, and the procedures of participation.&lt;br/&gt;3. Debate existing and proposed functionality to support security and privacy at different layers of the architecture.&lt;br/&gt;4. Share examples of educational use of NDN, including tutorial material, and provide an opportunity for interested members of the community to engage in hands-on-training to use NDN software or testbed platforms.&lt;br/&gt;5. Provide a forum to guide the evolution of the NDN architecture, key implementation artifacts including APIs, and facilitate feedback proposing potential protocol design changes based on implementation and deployment experience.&lt;br/&gt;6. Discuss a vision/roadmap for the community interested in advancing NDN deployment and usability, and how to accelerate deployment, both from research and commercial perspectives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NDN project team is providing a leadership role in guiding an increasing range of community efforts in NDN design and development. This two-day meeting is the first in a series that the NDN team plans to organize in coming years. Through its testbed and outreach efforts, the NDN research community is expanding beyond its original set of NSF-funded PIs and students. A successful meeting will provide this growing community with a forum to exchange the latest research results, discuss architectural directions, articulate open challenges, and jointly review and revise plans for future efforts.</AbstractNarration>
