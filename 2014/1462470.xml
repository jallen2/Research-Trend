    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial funding for the AWM Research Symposium 2015, organized by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), to be held April 11-12, 2015, at the University of Maryland in College Park, MD. The Symposium is aimed at helping to increase participation of women in the mathematical sciences in academia, government, and industry. It is part of a series of interconnected conferences and workshops designed to create ongoing networks, encourage research collaborations, and build a stronger sense of community among women in the mathematical sciences. The conference is expected to draw about 200 participants from all over the country, including many women in the early stages of their career. While the speakers and funded participants will all be women, the conference will be open to the whole mathematical community, both men and women. Located in the greater Washington area, the Symposium will also provide a unique opportunity for local businesses and government agencies to reach out to a talented pool of graduate students and recent PhD recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2015 Symposium will feature four plenary lectures by distinguished women mathematicians, thirteen special sessions on a broad spectrum of mathematical topics, poster sessions for graduate students and recent PhDs, and a networking event. The plenary speakers are leaders in the fields of symplectic geometry, harmonic analysis, graph theory, and wavelets. Accompanying the plenary talks are special sessions in related areas. Nine other special sessions will cover a wide range of topics including algebraic geometry, number theory, topology and geometry, probability theory, and mathematics education. One session will feature work by under-represented minorities from the EDGE program. Events of this kind are essential for building community among women in the field, decreasing the sense of isolation, and establishing new research and mentoring relations. In addition, connections made at these events lead to future speaking invitations, increased participation at other research conferences, and hence better integration into the broader mathematics community.
