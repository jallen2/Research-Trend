    <AbstractNarration>Core-collapse supernovae dramatically announce the death of massive stars&lt;br/&gt;and the birth of neutron stars, pulsars, and black holes. They are the&lt;br/&gt;sites where most of the heavy elements of Nature are created. Viewed as a&lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics laboratory, core-collapse supernovae produce some of the&lt;br/&gt;highest densities and energies in the Universe, and during this violent&lt;br/&gt;process a combination of nuclear physics, turbulent hydrodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;radiation transport, and neutrino physics determines whether and how the&lt;br/&gt;star explodes. However, to date the puzzle of the precise mechanism of&lt;br/&gt;explosion has not been cracked. A thesis of this team is that a&lt;br/&gt;fundamental impediment to progress over the last few decades may have been&lt;br/&gt;the lack of access to codes, computers, and resources with which to&lt;br/&gt;properly simulate the collapse phenomenon. This could explain the&lt;br/&gt;agonizingly slow march since the 1960's towards demonstrating a robust&lt;br/&gt;mechanism of explosion. However, with the state-of-the-art computer code&lt;br/&gt;this team has recently developed, the time may now be ripe to make a final&lt;br/&gt;assault on this central problem in astrophysics. Going to fully&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics and employing the best&lt;br/&gt;neutrino and nuclear physics may together be the keys to demonstrating and&lt;br/&gt;understanding the generic core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;Since these supernova simulations lend themselves easily to public and&lt;br/&gt;school outreach, the team plans to generate video products for public&lt;br/&gt;talks and web-based distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Core-collapse supernovae probe the nuclear and particle physics of matter&lt;br/&gt;at super-nuclear density, high temperature, and at extremes of isospin.&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the experimental nuclear physics program of the NSF&lt;br/&gt;by exploring nucleosynthesis in astrophysical explosions, the properties&lt;br/&gt;of the neutrino, and the equation of state of nuclear matter. The &lt;br/&gt;numerical simulations connect directly with the lower-energy programs of&lt;br/&gt;FRIB and FAIR, the high-energy experiments carried out at RHIC and the&lt;br/&gt;LHC, and the hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon programs of JPARC, GSI,&lt;br/&gt;JLAB, and NICA. In addition, a solution to the core-collapse supernova&lt;br/&gt;problem will benefit ongoing efforts of observers and instrument&lt;br/&gt;designers in the U.S. and around the world engaged in projects to&lt;br/&gt;determine the origin of the elements, measure gravitational waves (LIGO),&lt;br/&gt;and interpret laboratory nuclear reaction rate measurements in light of&lt;br/&gt;stellar nucleosynthesis.</AbstractNarration>
