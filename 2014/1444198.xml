    <AbstractNarration>Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a promising alternative energy technology that uses a fuel like hydrogen to produce electricity. The main byproduct of this electricity generation is water, which can 'flood' the fuel cell and severely limit its efficiency if not managed appropriately. Addressing these water management issues in PEM fuels cells will lead to better performance, longer lifetimes, and a higher likelihood of use as an economically viable source of electrical power. Fuel cells are not transparent, so visual observation inside a fuel cell is not possible. As a result, it is difficult to manage the water produced since it is not clear where water droplets are or what is causing them to stay trapped. One way to 'see inside' the fuel cell is to use X-ray techniques. This research will establish collaboration between Montana State University and the University of Saskatchewan, which is home to a sophisticated X-ray facility for scientific measurements. The experimental data will better inform computer models and ultimately lead to better fuel cells. Broader impacts include integrating research into the classroom, placing women and minority students in the lab, and scientific presentations for elementary through high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transport of water in a PEM fuel cell remains an unresolved issue because the system is reacting, multiphase, multi-scale, porous, and not amenable to direct visualization. Connecting transport phenomena with performance currently relies on indirect approaches or models with insufficient data for full validation. Collaboration with the University of Saskatchewan provides access to Synchrotron X-ray radiography, allowing this research to identify exactly where water accumulates in a fuel cell to understand how to manage it effectively. The research will study fundamental fluid transport in fuel cells from experimental and numerical perspectives. Knowledge generated on multiphase flow will advance fuel cells and provide additional insight into microfluidics, multiphase heat exchangers, and porous media flows. The project will (1) allow travel to Saskatchewan to share expertise and schedule time with the Synchrotron facility; (2) collect and analyze initial X-ray radiography data; (3) establish an experimental and modeling approach; and (4) continue the collaboration by leveraging these results for continued research.</AbstractNarration>
