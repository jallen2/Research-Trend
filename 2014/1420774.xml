    <AbstractNarration>Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are transforming the way we explore the ocean, allowing longer explorations in a variety of ocean conditions. Biological-based designs could enhance the mobility and efficiency of future AUV's. In particular, flexible ribbon-fin propulsion represents an ideal propulsion mechanism for highly maneuverable vehicles. However, the hydrodynamics, fluid-fin interaction and maneuvers using elongated fin propulsion are still poorly understood. The outcome of this research will provide insights into the hydrodynamics of flexible ribbon fin-base propulsion during different maneuvers. Two students, one graduate student and one undergraduate, will be supported by this award to research possible ribbon-fin propulsion designs. The principal investigator will also present the research to a group of K-12 students participating in a local ocean science camp program and develop a new graduate and undergraduate course that will focus on the hydrodynamics of animal locomotion in the broad context of ocean exploration, biology, underwater vehicle design and fluid mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will study the hydrodynamics of a flexible undulating ribbon fin using a robotic fin as a model. In particular, the objectives are: 1) examine the effect of flexibility and morphology in the hydrodynamics performance, 2) investigate the interconnection of flow structure, propulsion efficiency and actuation control, and 3) study maneuvers and flow control. The series of experiments will include measurement of fin kinematics, propulsive forces, and flow measurements using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The experiments will be performed at the Hydrodynamics Laboratory at Florida Atlantic University.</AbstractNarration>
