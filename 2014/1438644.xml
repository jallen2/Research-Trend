    <AbstractNarration>1438644 &lt;br/&gt;Assaf-Anid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is for partial support of a workshop entitled "Clean Water Matters: Challenges and Research Perspectives Workshop," to be held in Beijing, April 18, 2014. These funds will be used to support plane fares and subsistence for the U.S. delegation. The overarching goal of this workshop is to initiate joint research collaborations among scholars in China and the United States to address pressing water challenges affecting both nations, with potential applicability to other regions of the world. Specific objectives are to: 1) build a research platform for collaboration across the US and China that supports active engagement and joint approaches to clean water challenges facing both nations and 2) form a U.S. - China water research and education community and set the grounds for the establishment of a joint research consortium. The proposed collaboration will enhance scientific cooperation between Chinese and US scholars and junior fellows, and provide students from both nations opportunities for international research experience. The event is structured to favor dialogue and collaborations among participants with various perspectives and backgrounds. It will bring together lead water protection and management scholars, seasoned policy professionals, agencies that support sciences and research advances, together with young investigators in their early stages of their careers, and post-doc fellows and graduate students interested in pursuing research in this area. This grant is co-funded by the Global Venture Fund (GVF) of NSF's International Science and Engineering section (ISE) as well as the Environmental Sustainability program in the CBET division of NSF's Engineering Directorate.</AbstractNarration>
