    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the University of New Mexico will provide scholarships and support services to academically-talented students who are pursuing degrees in engineering and computer science and who demonstrate financial need. This project is called Thematic Scholarships in Engineering Education (SEE): A Project Focused on Retention and Graduation through Student Support and Career/Professional Development. The students will include both first-year students and students transferring from community colleges. A total of 24 students will be supported each year. The scholars will participate in one of four learning communities created around the topics of Bioengineering, Green/Renewable Energies, High-Tech Materials, and Aerospace Engineering. Talented engineering graduates skilled in these areas of emerging technology help US industries to compete and innovate in a global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Thematic Scholarships in Engineering Education Project will identify, select, and evaluate talented students entering engineering or computer science majors. The program will provide academic support services such as advising, mentoring, and tutoring to ensure that the S-STEM program students maintain satisfactory academic progress. Students will participate in at least one learning community in areas of technological focus within the College of Engineering. The learning communities will be directed by faculty members with expertise in the learning community topic. Activities will include discussion groups and guest speakers. Students have the option of participating in research experiences or internships with industry. Professional career development will form an integral part of the program. These activities foster student progress and interest in their chosen fields of study. Program assessment will monitor participant need, the type and amount of services to meet that need, and semester goals and objectives. Lessons learned and best practices that emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated widely to the engineering education community and help enlarge the knowledge base regarding attributes and practices of successful scholarship programs of this type.</AbstractNarration>
