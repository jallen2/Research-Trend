    <AbstractNarration>Environmental governance is increasingly shifting from a top-down approach, in which bureaucrats and scientists make decisions, to a 'participatory' approach, in which representatives of diverse stakeholder groups make decisions collaboratively. However, implementing the goal of giving all stakeholder groups a voice has proved challenging. Much work remains to develop an adequate conceptual model of what egalitarian decision-making would actually look like and how it might be implemented. Most studies have focused their analysis either on the stakeholder meetings where decisions are negotiated, or on the broader interactions among networks of stakeholders that influence those meeting decisions. On their own, each of these approaches has serious limitations. The goal of the proposed pilot study is to develop a new methodological approach that integrates the analysis of meetings and network interactions. The proposed study is high risk due to the complexity and novelty of the planned methodology, which brings multiple, interdisciplinary perspectives to bear on a multilevel analysis. If successful, the proposed study will have high payoff in its enhanced ability to adequately theorize participatory decision-making by giving equal consideration to both the meeting context where actual decisions are made, and the broader set of network interactions that shape meeting participants' understandings of the issues and relationships with each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed pilot study will launch a research trajectory with the potential to benefit society by conceptualizing and disseminating more effective practices of 'participatory' environmental governance, thereby reducing the number of intractable conflicts among stakeholders that result in further damage to the environment. Findings could also benefit other fields that espouse 'participatory' decision-making, such as international development and community-based health. Improvements in decision-making practices could benefit the many Americans whose lives are affected by environmental and other challenges that are being addressed by local task forces, committees, and councils.</AbstractNarration>
