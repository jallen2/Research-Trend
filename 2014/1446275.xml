    <AbstractNarration>PI: JoAnne Shatkin&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CBET - 1446275&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano Risk Analysis (II): A Workshop to Explore How a Multiple Models Approach can Advance Risk Analysis of Nanoscale Materials, September 15-16, 2014, George Washington University, Washington, DC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for support of the Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) to convene a public, multi-stakeholder workshop exploring the integration of a multiple-methods approach into screening level risk-assessment of ENM, to be held September 15-16, 2014 at George Washington University in Washington, DC. Despite a decade of effort to use toxicology and exposure research to aid the assessment of health and environmental risks of nanomaterials, major gaps remain in our ability to understand and quantify such risks from engineered nanoscale materials (ENM). One pressing gap is the need is to develop reliable approaches for evaluating and classifying novel ENM substances through screening techniques. Alternative Testing Strategies (ATS), which can include high throughput screening methods (HTS), and other methods, have the potential for rapid screening of large numbers and types of materials. However, existing and emerging ATS are not yet reliable enough for quantitative estimation of ENM risk. This workshop is to explore ways in which the different ATS may be combined to create a multiple models approach that can increase the confidence in vitro tests so that they can be relied upon for deciding whether more extensive testing of novel ENM are needed in specific cases. In addition to technical experts and representatives from research and industry, diverse environmental, consumer, labor, and animal rights groups, as well as other professional societies and their members are also invited to participate. The participation of such broad, horizontal sectors associated with ENM risk assessments will assure the rapid dissemination of results of the discussions, results that can inform and aid the progress of assessment of health and environmental risks of nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of the workshop are to: (i) assess the state of the science on HTS and ATS from a "multiple models" perspective; (ii) evaluate the ability to use data from ATS/HTS methods for screening purposes; (iii) assess the ability to use a suite of ATS methods to amplify the Weight of Evidence; (iv) characterize and address uncertainty associated with predictive relationships; (v) elicit the perspectives of diverse stakeholders about the use of HTS/ATS for screening purposes in risk analysis of ENM; and (vi) develop a set of recommendations for these alternative approaches to become more widely adopted for environmental, health and safety decision making about ENM across the product life cycle. The unique contribution of this workshop is the translation of research into a Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach using ATS for screening-level decisions in risk analysis. The output of the workshop will be a set of recommendations reported to the OECD WPMN and via peer reviewed publications about ways in which these approaches may be practically applied in the near term to improve environmental decision making by governmental and industrial organizations. Such an output holds potential for transformation through risk screening approaches that promote safer and more sustainable substance and technology development.</AbstractNarration>
