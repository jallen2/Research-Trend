    <AbstractNarration>Programming for and leveraging the benefits of scalable and highly&lt;br/&gt;parallel computer architectures is becoming increasingly&lt;br/&gt;challenging. In order to ease programmer and user effort in achieving&lt;br/&gt;efficient use of parallel architectures and to enable optimal usage of&lt;br/&gt;parallel hardware both within a single chip and across a data center,&lt;br/&gt;this project explores the co-design of a fine-grain configurable (down&lt;br/&gt;to the ALU, FPU, Cache bank, fetch unit, etc) architecture along with&lt;br/&gt;a software optimizing runtime system which controls the architecture's&lt;br/&gt;configuration. This runtime management system understands high-level&lt;br/&gt;goals and constraints such as optimizing for power, latency, cost, or&lt;br/&gt;complex mixed-goals and dynamically allocates fine-grain resources to&lt;br/&gt;meet the constraints. This project will evaluate and design a configurable&lt;br/&gt;manycore-inspired architecture and a self-adapting runtime system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the creation of a complete, scalable,&lt;br/&gt;self-adaptive computing system; and will push the boundaries of&lt;br/&gt;adapting systems by utilizing hardware that is configurable and&lt;br/&gt;monitorable below the processor core level. By providing such a&lt;br/&gt;flexible and highly monitored architecture to the adaptation runtime,&lt;br/&gt;this project will explore the scalability of adaptive runtime&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to handle a game-changing increase in the number of&lt;br/&gt;controllable parameters. This project will explore the extent to&lt;br/&gt;which it is fruitful to configure a parallel architecture.</AbstractNarration>
