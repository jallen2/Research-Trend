    <AbstractNarration>Part I&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF CAREER award will support Professor David Miller, at the University of Chicago, in seeking to answer questions about the fundamental structure of matter at a new energy frontier. Specifically, Prof. Miller will extend and enhance his research program using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), to conduct measurements that will seek out the existence of new TeV-scale particles, and characterize the particles and forces of the Standard Model with greater precision. This will be achieved by developing novel analysis algorithms to search for these new massive particles and advanced high-speed electronics that enhance the performance of the ATLAS detector in key domains. For broader impact, the PI will be leading the Lane Tech High School U. Chicago Outreach Program and the Enrico Fermi Summer Interns Program for 7th graders. In addition, he will bring high-energy physics concepts into undergraduate classrooms, by providing college students with concrete examples of how the core physics curriculum is being used by active researchers at the forefront of science today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF CAREER award will extend the PI (Professor David Miller)'s research program, which is focused on developing a comprehensive approach to recognize the most complex hadronic final states in search of new TeV-scale particles. This research includes development of novel analysis algorithms and advanced high-speed electronics. His goal is to search for evidence of Supersymmetry in final states characterized by Lorentz-boosted massive particles using distinct signatures in the ATLAS calorimeter system, and to better understand the Standard Model processes involved that form a large background to these new states. The particles sought should generate multi-jet final states, and new algorithms will be introduced to recognize them. In addition, this effort will be integrated into the development of high-speed electronics for new triggering systems, vital to the future running of Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The PI's group will perform detailed measurements of Standard Model processes that will help to better understand the backgrounds these represent to the new signals sought. Timing of this program corresponds to the higher center of mass energy of Run II at the LHC which should increase the yield of processes such as collinear emission of a W-boson, the intermediate carrier of the weak force and a prime target of study in this work. For broader impact, the excitement and results of this physics program will be communicated through K-12 and undergraduate education programs. These programs will include community outreach activities that target underrepresented students in the City of Chicago. The PI will be leading the Lane Tech High School U. Chicago Outreach Program and the Enrico Fermi Summer Interns Program for 7th graders.</AbstractNarration>
