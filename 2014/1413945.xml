    <AbstractNarration>In this project co-funded by the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) and Chemical Catalysis (CAT) programs of the Chemistry Division, Professor Dan Mindiola of the Department of Chemistry of the Indiana University - Bloomington will explore dehydrogenation reactions of cyclic, linear, and branched alkanes with transient and unsaturated titanium and vanadium complexes having metal-carbon multiple bonds. Also to be studied are (i) the chemistry of a masked and unsaturated vanadium(I) complex in group-transfer reactions; and (ii) the chemistry of low-coordinate and early-transition metals (mainly Ti, V, Cr, and Nb) using a bulky aryl oxide ligand (OAr). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As natural resources such as crude oil dwindle, novel chemical transformations are needed to produce synthetic fuels in a environmentally friendly manner. A potentially important application of the proposed research is to produce higher hydrocarbons (fuel molecules) based on the volatile paraffins such as methane and ethane. Students and research associates will be involved in synthesis, catalysis and kinetics study all in combination to provide a strong foundation to become a competitive scientist. Professor Mindiola will be working with students from underrepresented groups through his association with the IU chapter of the NOBCChE (National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers).</AbstractNarration>
