    <AbstractNarration>This travel grant will provide partial support to about 10 U.S.-based graduate students to participate in the Doctoral Consortium at the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) 2014, to be held be held July 14-18, 2014 in Chengdu, China. This is the first time the Doctoral Consortium is organized at ICME. The selected students will have the opportunity to present their work at the Doctoral Colloquium, receive feedback from senior researchers, attend the conference sessions, and interact with other graduate students as well as hundreds of other leading international researchers in the area of multimedia information systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia &amp; Expo (ICME) has been the flagship multimedia conference sponsored by four IEEE societies since 2000. It serves as a forum to promote the exchange of the latest advances in multimedia technologies, systems, and applications from both the research and development perspectives of the circuits and systems, communications, computer, and signal processing communities. Multimedia data generally refer to audio, image, video, 3D, newer sensor data (e.g. depth) and related multi-modality data. In 2014, an Exposition of multimedia products, prototypes and animations will be held in conjunction with the conference. In addition, a number of workshops will be organized by the sponsoring societies. To further foster new emerging topics, ICME 2014 will also hold industrial exhibitions in parallel with the main conference.
