    <AbstractNarration>The University of Illinois research efforts support the Center for e-Design?s long-term goal of developing a new design paradigm. The specific focus areas include: 1) business-based design methods, 2) optimization of corporate product delivery processes, 3) industry-based design education and training, 4) robotics and human-automation interaction, and 5) design for sustainability. This site addition strengthens the presence of the Center and increases its capability for achieving the following results: 1) inclusion of a multi-disciplinary viewpoint needed to ensure the development of a new paradigm of excellence in the design of engineered products and/or systems; 2) realization of conceptual modeling tools aimed at reducing design cycle time and ensuring maximum achievement of design goals for human use; 3) realization of an environment for economic and supply chain design optimization; 4) establishment of a critical mass of expertise focused on the development of an e-Design modeling and simulation software platform and virtual prototyping tools, as well as strategies for achieving simulation based acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort will contribute to the development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students across both engineering and business colleges. Results of this research effort will be integrated into the educational curriculum to enrich the student learning experiences in strategic business-based design, modeling and simulation, decision analysis, and industry-based design courses. Students associated with the Center for e-Design will receive career development opportunities, that include laboratory and field studies, attendance and presentations at interdisciplinary conferences and workshops, and participation in interdisciplinary activities and journal publications. The addition of the University of Illinois to the Center contributes to the diversity of the Center with the leadership team and several participating faculty being women. The PI and other U of I faculty will emphasize recruitment of women and minority graduate and undergraduate students. Research and educational findings will be disseminated nationally and through industrial collaboration and technology transfer.</AbstractNarration>
