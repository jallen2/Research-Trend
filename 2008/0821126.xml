    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a novel, reconfigurable microgrid test bed that will promote research and education in the area of resilient and sustainable energy infrastructure systems. The microgrid is a promising paradigm to integrate a heterogeneous set of distributed energy resources and may eventually become the building blocks of future utility power grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The unique instrument developed in this project does not currently exist. The developed microgrid test bed provides a critical research infrastructure to verify, validate and demonstrate innovative power system concepts and control technologies for microgrids, which otherwise could not be readily done in a real utility power grid. The efforts based on this instrument will greatly advance our knowledge and understanding in large-scale, safe deployment of alternative and renewable energy resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The success of this project will provide a significant platform for research in the effective integration of distributed energy resources that includes physical and control interface requirements, and in bounding the performance of those standards and interfaces through demonstration. Several current research projects and a number of potential projects will directly benefit from this research instrument. Three PhD students and several undergraduate students are directly involved in this project and a large number of other undergraduate and graduate students will benefit from this instrument. In addition to scientific research, this instrument will be used for the educational programs of undergraduate and graduate students, especially the large population of minority students, at the University of Miami.</AbstractNarration>
