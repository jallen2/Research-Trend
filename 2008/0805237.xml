    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project is to study metal contacts to semiconductor nanowires and thin films at the nanometer scale. The systems to be investigated include (1) metal contacts to semiconductor nanowires, (2) metal contacts to advanced oxide films in metal/complex oxide/semiconductor junctions, and (3) metal contacts to organic films in metal/organic-monolayer/semiconductor junctions. Contacts are critical for injection of charge and spin in electronic devices, but in these emerging materials the energy band alignments and microscopic transport process are still poorly understood. Ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM), internal photoemission spectroscopy, and three-dimensional electrostatic modeling are used in this project, aiming to obtain a quantitative understanding of these important topics. The emphasis of the project is on metal contacts to semiconductor nanowires. Schottky barrier contacts to nanowires in both the ?end-on? and the more conventional ?side? contact geometries will be studied using BEEM, in order to determine how the nanowire energy band alignment to the metal Fermi energy (i.e., the Schottky barrier height) depends on the nanowire diameter, on the metal work function, and on the electrostatic environment around the nanowires.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance, and is expected to provide new scientific understanding of metal contacts to semiconductor materials, a knowledge that is critically needed for the development of nanowire-based electronic devices of the future. This project provides highly interdisciplinary and collaborative training for graduate and undergraduate students and enhanced research opportunities for students and a faculty member from an undergraduate-only institution. The PI will continue active involvement with curriculum development to better integrate laboratory experiments, group work and problem solving into introductory physics courses, science outreach, teacher mentoring, and outreach activities aimed at providing information and advise about nanotechnology to middle school students.</AbstractNarration>
