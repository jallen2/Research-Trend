    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is intended to be a workshop to disseminate the goals of Cyber-enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI) to the Operations Research community at the INFORMS Annual Meeting which will be held in Seattle, November 3-7, 2007. The PI will invite key speakers who will provide insights into the types of research projects which will be appropriate for the CDI solicitation. NSF program officers will also be present to provide guidance to this research community. The venue of the workshop was chosen to make the workshop easily accessible to the roughly 4000 participants at the INFORMS meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is a timely undertaking, and will greatly enhance the quality of proposals received by NSF. The presentations and the frequently asked questions will be posted on the web (www.datadrivendecision.osu.edu), thus allowing others to also benefit from the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
