    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed centers on investigations of the structures of sets and&lt;br/&gt;functions ordered by relative complexity of computation. Particular emphasis&lt;br/&gt;will be placed on issues of definability and automorphisms. Also included in&lt;br/&gt;this area is the analysis of the relations between the difficulty of computing&lt;br/&gt;functions and other issues such as rates of growth, complexity of their&lt;br/&gt;definitions in arithmetic and the strength of axiom systems needed to prove&lt;br/&gt;their existence (reverse mathematics). The emphasis in reverse mathematics&lt;br/&gt;will be on analyzing basic combinatorial, model theoretic and set-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;principles that seem to lie outside the scope of the standard theories&lt;br/&gt;studied. In addition, a new approach to the issue of classifying the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of mathematical constructions based on computability theoretic&lt;br/&gt;notions will be developed. This approach should allow applications to&lt;br/&gt;uncountable and higher order structures that are either out of reach of&lt;br/&gt;current approaches or (as in the case of analysis on the real numbers) only&lt;br/&gt;handled through coding into countable structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project includes research into a broad range of topics in&lt;br/&gt;computability theory and logic both theoretical and applied to other areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and computer science. At the foundational level, this work will&lt;br/&gt;illuminate the nature of relative complexity of computation, the strength of&lt;br/&gt;axioms needed to prove standard mathematical theorems and the relations&lt;br/&gt;between these areas. In practical terms, results in this area (computable&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and model theory as well as reverse mathematics) at times indicate&lt;br/&gt;that there are no algorithms for certain important tasks or that more&lt;br/&gt;information than might have been expected is needed to write programs&lt;br/&gt;calculating the desired results. The work related to automata theory and&lt;br/&gt;automatic structures is based on a very resource-limited model of computation&lt;br/&gt;that is often relevant to practical computing problems. The theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;foundational analysis of structures whose basic relations and functions are&lt;br/&gt;computable by such automata should also eventually be of practical&lt;br/&gt;significance. The primary focus in the most applied areas to be investigated&lt;br/&gt;will be the logical and mathematical foundations of hybrid (continuous and&lt;br/&gt;discrete) control theory as well as the practical implementation of algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for these subjects based on the theoretical work being done. Here the issue is&lt;br/&gt;to understand how to mathematically model systems that include both digital&lt;br/&gt;(discrete) input and logical constraints as well as analog (continuous)&lt;br/&gt;information and constraints.</AbstractNarration>
