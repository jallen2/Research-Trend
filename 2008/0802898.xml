    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates the relationship between spatial abilities, map use tasks, and training-based performance effects by persons who are blind or visually impaired. Because the study is theoretically grounded in the areas of spatial cognition, tactile mapping and use, and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), the results will identify both the behavioral-based and the biological-based impacts resulting from systematic tactile map use and spatial thinking training. In addition, previous research has identified the neural patterns associated with spatial ability and map use task performance in sighted population, which will allow analysis of the similarities and differences between sighted and blind subject groups in the performance of similar tasks. The experimental design, itself, reveals a novel methodological approach in behavioral geography and cartographic research. Past research has focused on tactile map use from psychophysical-based, cognition and performance-based, training-based, and neural-based approaches. However, these diverse methods have not yet been integrated. This research is based on the assertion that a mixed methodological approach will provide a more holistic measure, not only of spatial and map use tasks, but also on the effects of training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will have broader impacts by creating an infrastructure for research on orientation and mobility training. The project will create and provide a new training tool in the form of a tactile map reading protocol, which will be evaluated by faculty at the Oregon School for the Blind, and be provided to the public free of charge. The project brings together a research team of teachers, orientation and mobility specialists, students and researchers to develop a curriculum-enhancing tool through an empirical study. This model of a collaborative team of researchers and educators will enhance the building of the tactile map reading protocol proposed for the blind and visually impaired. From an intellectual standpoint, the project integrates concepts, theories, and experiment design approaches from three fields: behavioral geography, cartography, and fMRI. Not only will the results enhance the literature in each of these areas, but they will also provide one of the first integrations of these fields. In doing so, the experimental design will provide a model to integrate methods and illustrate a truly cross-disciplinary methodological approach.</AbstractNarration>
