    <AbstractNarration>Nearly all animals reproduce sexually, but a handful exhibit asexual reproduction in which mothers produce genetically identical daughters without input from males. This project investigates the consequences of such asexuality in the Bynoe's gecko (Heteronotia binoei). By measuring the activity of genes and quantifying mutations in these asexual geckos, this project will provide important data that will address one of the longest-standing questions in evolutionary biology: why does sex exist at all? This project will examine the expectation that asexual lineages deteriorate genetically compared to their sexual relatives, and examine whether there are mechanisms that can help prevent this deterioration. An integrative approach to this question is being taken that includes genomic analyses, physiological experiments, and biochemical assays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes to an integrative, international (Australia-United States) endeavor to understand the origin and evolution of asexuality in the Bynoe's gecko. This project has provided and will continue to offer research experiences to talented undergraduate students in both countries. Its outreach component is designed to educate the general public in ecology and evolution in the primary schools, as well as via workshops and through discussions with station managers in the Australian outback.</AbstractNarration>
