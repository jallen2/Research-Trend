    <AbstractNarration>ExPert: dynamic analysis based fault location via Execution Perturbations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is studying dynamic characteristics of runs of faulty programs and&lt;br/&gt;designing promising dynamic analysis techniques to identify executed program&lt;br/&gt;statements where a fault lies, i.e. the fault candidate set. To narrow the set of&lt;br/&gt;statements in the fault candidate set, an array of automated dynamic analyses are&lt;br/&gt;being used in conjunction with each other. These analyses consider not only the&lt;br/&gt;failed run but also execution perturbations of this faulty run. The goal of this&lt;br/&gt;work is to focus the users attention on a small subset of statements in the&lt;br/&gt;fault candidate state. Identification of fault candidate set is based upon&lt;br/&gt;uncovering of two types of evidence: negative evidence and positive evidence. &lt;br/&gt;A negative evidence is considered as an indicator that leads to the conclusion &lt;br/&gt;that a value encountered during a failed program run is related to the program's &lt;br/&gt;failure. Positive evidence on the other hand indicates that some of the values &lt;br/&gt;computed during a failed run are in fact correct. Through a combination of negative&lt;br/&gt;and positive evidence we aim to produce a small fault candidate set. As part of &lt;br/&gt;this work we are identifying new sources of evidence. We are also carrying out a &lt;br/&gt;systematic integration of above dynamic analyses technology into a practical &lt;br/&gt;debugging environment.</AbstractNarration>
