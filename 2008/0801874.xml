    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to investigate and quantify the fundamental constraints, limitations, and tradeoffs in the design of networked control systems. We focus on the essential characteristics of communication channels (capacity constraint, quantization effect, data rate limit, etc) and at-tempt to develop intrinsic system measures, fundamental performance limits, and inherent design limitations for multivariable, multi-channel systems. In particular, we attempt to develop analytical expressions and bounds for the optimal tracking and regulation performance, with respect to&lt;br/&gt;prevalent channel models employed in the communications and control research. We also attempt to develop multivariable Bode and Poisson integral relations in the networked control setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networked control presents several fundamental differences and challenges unlike those found in conventional control. These differences need to be addressed, and should be exploited to advantage in the design of networked control systems. This program seeks to address key challenges and has its goal in quantifying the fundamental performance limitations and design tradeoffs in networked control. The program brings together experts in communications and control, and seeks to fuse ideas and advances in these fields. The proposed work, which is believed to be theoretically significant and practically feasible, has the potential to lead to the discovery of fundamental constraints and limits in networked control design, and to improved design methods and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful execution of this project will benefit researchers and practicing engineers in the broad areas of communications and control. The program also seeks to integrate a strong educational component in a concerted, systematic way. The synergistic activities include the offerings of Freshmen Discovery Seminars, development of instructional controls lab, projects for senior design courses, and direct participation of graduate and undergraduate students in the project. Outreach activities seek to provide local K-12 students' and teachers' research exposure by hosting visits to the PI's lab and&lt;br/&gt;active participation in open house activities such as Engineering Day, and to provide high school students research experience by engaging the students in summer internships and special engineering programs. Our educational initiatives encourage especially participation from underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>
