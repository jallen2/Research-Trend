    <AbstractNarration>This particular project is aimed at the development of novel manufacturing techniques for fabrication and surface functionalization of arrays/forests of high-aspect-ratio composite magnetic nanofibers (nanowires) with variable (optimized) density. These materials promise numerous micro and nanofluidic applications involving the transport of liquids, suspensions and particles, microfluidic agitation and mixing, alternation of wetting and adhesion. As a strategic goal of this proposal we envision the assembling of hybrid magnetic nanofibers into ordered nanostructures by combination of: (a) Template method for nanofiber fabrication, (b) Colloidal lithography for regulation of nanofiber density in the forest, and (c) Surface functionalization of nanofibers to achieve controlled interactions with the surrounding environment. The uniqueness of the materials to be developed is revealed in that the nanofibers should have a core-sheath morphology with a flexible magnetic metallic core and an organic sheath, and also in that the density of the nanofibers in the arrays is optimized. &lt;br/&gt;Development of the proposed approach will directly impact the implementation of recent advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology to industrial technologies with broad applications, including analytical chemistry, medicine, bionanotechnology, optics. Another priority of the proposed project is the involvement of the brightest high school, undergraduate and graduate students in modern nanotechnology oriented research. The project will result in the training of these students in the areas of nanofabrication and various micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems, and surface science. Students will greatly benefit from the interdisciplinary nature of this project. Significant effort will be directed toward increasing the numbers of students--especially minorities and women--who are pursuing advanced degrees in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
