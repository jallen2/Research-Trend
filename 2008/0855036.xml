    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: II-New: OpenVMI: A Software Instrument&lt;br/&gt;for Virtual Machine Introspection&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 07/09/09&lt;br/&gt;This project develops the OpenVMI, an open-source, software-based research&lt;br/&gt;instrument for virtual machine introspection (VMI). VMI is important to certain research&lt;br/&gt;areas such as distributed computing, automated system management and&lt;br/&gt;configuration, and computer security.&lt;br/&gt;Virtualization technologies have created new momentumfor a number of research areas&lt;br/&gt;such as distributed computing, automated system management and configuration, and&lt;br/&gt;computer security. One basic yet powerful instrumentation function in&lt;br/&gt;virtualization-based research is virtual machine introspection (VMI): observing a VM?s&lt;br/&gt;semantic states and events from outside the VM. VMI is hard to implement, mainly&lt;br/&gt;because of the semantic gap between the external and internal observations of the VM.&lt;br/&gt;Thus a generic VMI software instrument becomes highly desirable to virtualization&lt;br/&gt;researchers.&lt;br/&gt;This project develops and deploys OpenVMI, an open-source, software-based research&lt;br/&gt;instrument for VMI at Purdue University and North Carolina State University. OpenVMI&lt;br/&gt;can be thought of as a ?fluoroscopic? instrument for VMs. Through the OpenVMI API, a&lt;br/&gt;user will be able to obtain the VM?s semantic states and events in both kernel and user&lt;br/&gt;spaces without modifying or instrumenting the VM.&lt;br/&gt;Three research areas are identified at the PIs? institutions that will benefit from the&lt;br/&gt;development and deployment of OpenVMI:&lt;br/&gt;-Management of hosted virtual environments: This research involves monitoring,&lt;br/&gt;provisioning and regulating autonomous virtual environments running in a shared&lt;br/&gt;distributed hosting infrastructure. Open- VMI will enable non-intrusive, semantic&lt;br/&gt;monitoring of VMs, which will trigger VM management operations at runtime such as&lt;br/&gt;VM migration, resource adaptation and access control.&lt;br/&gt;-Monitoring, detection and investigation of user-level malware: This research is&lt;br/&gt;concerned with OSlevel policies and mechanisms for malware detection and&lt;br/&gt;investigation. By using OpenVMI, these policies and mechanisms can be moved out of&lt;br/&gt;the target VM, achieving stronger tamper-resistance without losing VM observability.&lt;br/&gt;-Monitoring of OS integrity: This research addresses the integrity of the guest OS&lt;br/&gt;against kernel-level attacks. It also involves detailed profiling of kernel-level attacks for&lt;br/&gt;future detection and recovery. OpenVMI will provide a unique vintage point to observe&lt;br/&gt;runtime state changes of kernel objects, which will help reveal details of an OS integrity&lt;br/&gt;violation.&lt;br/&gt;Six research projects in the above areas are designated for OpenVMI deployment.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0855141 PI Name:Xu, Dongyan&lt;br/&gt;Printed from eJacket: 07/25/09 Page 1 of 1</AbstractNarration>
