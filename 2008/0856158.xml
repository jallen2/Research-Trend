    <AbstractNarration>The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (SUMSRI) is a program conducted under the guidance of Miami University's Department of Mathematics and Statistics. Each year, SUMSRI prepares 15 nationally selected students to enter graduate education in mathematics by involving them in an intensive research experience in mathematics and statistics and participating in four short courses in Real Analysis, Advanced Algebra, GRE preparation and Mathematical Writing. In the year following their participation in SUMSRI, each participant is asked to present their research at regional and national meetings, with financial support from SUMSRI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;African American and Hispanic citizens, now over 25% of the US population, received less than 5% of the 500 mathematics PhDs awarded to US citizens in the 2006 academic year. Approximately a third of mathematics PhDs earned by US citizens went to females. Because of the shortage of minorities and women mathematical scientists, the program is especially interested in, but not limited to, underrepresented minorities and women. In the past 10 years, SUMSRI has proven its effectiveness in preparing students for the challenges of graduate education. Seventy percent of SUMSRI's former participants have gone on to graduate education. Seventeen percent are still finishing their undergraduate degrees. Of the minority participants who have completed their bachelors degree, 88% have continued into graduate school. Former participants now in the work force are teachers, professors and researchers in the nation's schools, universities, government agencies and business.</AbstractNarration>
