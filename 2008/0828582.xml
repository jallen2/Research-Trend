    <AbstractNarration>PI and Co-PI: Cecilia Menjivar and Jennifer B. Arney &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Direct to consumer advertising of psychotropic medications: Effects for consumers, physicians, and society at large&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES - 0828582 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project examines the advertising of prescription medications toward consumer audiences, a practice referred to as direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA). The primary goal of the study is to inform debates regarding current drug advertising regulations by providing insight into the benefits, consequences, and processes associated with DTCA of antidepressant medications. The doctoral student explores the effects of DTCA on consumers, attitudes and behaviors, their experiences with the institution of medicine, and the production and perpetuation of broader understandings of physical and emotional experiences. Inquiry is guided by the following research questions: How does DTCA affect consumers? interpretations of their physical and emotional experiences and their decisions about health care? How does DTCA affect consumers? experiences with the institution of medicine? Does DTCA facilitate the gendering of mood disorders? If so, how is this achieved? This project uses a multi-method, triangulated research design in order to combine qualitative and quantitative data. Data to be analyzed include 1) print advertisements for antidepressant drugs collected from the 1997-2006 issues of three female-directed magazines, three male-directed magazines, and four common readership magazines, 2) a total of 50 one-hour interviews with physicians, psychiatrists, and consumers residing in the southwestern U.S., and 3) the Attitudinal and Behavioral Effects of Direct-to-Consumer Promotion of Prescription Drugs patient and physician surveys (US FDA 2002). This holistic analysis is expected to advance understanding of how environmental factors, like advertisements, shape individuals? identities, their health care decisions, and their interactions with others. The project provides insight into one of the factors that shape public perceptions about mental illness and treatment. The study advances theories associated with DTCA and methods used in its analysis. Findings contribute to new understandings and applicability of sociological theories involving identity, self-labeling, physician-patient interactions, medicalization, social control, and gender roles and identities. The project is central to the training and education of the co-PI, and involves the mentoring and training of an undergraduate research assistant. Findings will be presented to the scientific community at several national and regional meetings and conferences, and the project is expected to render several publishable journal articles. At the broadest level, this investigation provides a point of departure for an assessment and critique of the current organization of the American health care system. Results help inform suggestions to improve the organization and delivery of health care in America, a very timely topic in policy circles.</AbstractNarration>
