    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;Geotechnical engineering is a standard part of the civil engineering curriculum across the nation. While most geotech courses have a laboratory component, the soil mechanics concepts are sufficiently complex and are not easily understood in the classroom. Since the laboratory session is frequently delayed or slightly out of phase with the classroom explanations, students often do not understand the fundamental concepts as they are learning them. Through this project, compact, desk-top devices are being developed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in soil mechanics so that students can visualize and explore these concepts as they are learning about them. The Geotechnical Concept Tools (GCT) being developed include devices that demonstrate soil structure, seepage, and effective stress and consolidation. The use of visual and interactive aids such as the GCTs and their impact on student learning is being rigorously assessed throughout the project. The results from the evaluation is informing engineering educators regarding the desirability of the use of visual aids in the classroom for demonstrating complex theories. The devices are also being used in planned outreach activities through the Girl Scouts and through a workshop for middle school teachers.</AbstractNarration>
