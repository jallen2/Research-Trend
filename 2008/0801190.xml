    <AbstractNarration>Groups are basic objects in mathematics - expressing symmetries of&lt;br/&gt;various objects. The groups themselves can be described by generators&lt;br/&gt;and relations - so called "presentations of groups". Given a group, one&lt;br/&gt;may want to understand its "representation" i.e. the way to present&lt;br/&gt;the group as a group of matrices over the field of complex numbers.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will focus on quantitative questions of both&lt;br/&gt;aspects: How e±ciently can a group be presented? How many genera-&lt;br/&gt;tors and relations are needed and what is their length? The motivation&lt;br/&gt;for these questions comes from computational group theory: an efficient&lt;br/&gt;presentation is important for efficient computation.&lt;br/&gt;The quantitative aspects of representation theory deal with questions&lt;br/&gt;of the form: What is the rate of growth of the number of representations&lt;br/&gt;as a function of the dimension? It is an elaboration of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;subgroup growth which deals with permutational representations.&lt;br/&gt;Usually presentations and representations are very much disjoint in&lt;br/&gt;their studies. One of the interesting features of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;is a connection between the two. If successful, it can shed new light on&lt;br/&gt;the representation theory of the automorphism group of the free group&lt;br/&gt;and of the mapping class groups.</AbstractNarration>
