    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0829199&lt;br/&gt;Ely&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biosolar hydrogen (H2) production is a promising sustainable energy alternative. The major feedstocks, sunlight and water, are widely distributed and abundant, and amounts of H2 that could be produced far exceed current and projected energy demand. The light harvesting capabilities of cyanobacteria offer potential efficiencies that are tremendously high compared to production of carbonaceous biofuels, like ethanol and biodiesel, from primary production. A solid-state matrix that encapsulates cyanobacteria to create a biocomposite material may offer some significant design and operational advantages over conventional bioreactors while also reducing operation and equipment costs. Biocomposite material engineering is a very new and rapidly growing field, but before its potential can be fully realized for this or other, similar projects, an improved understanding of interactions between the solid matrix and encapsulated cells is needed. Using Synechocystis PCC 6803 as a model, the ultimate goal of this project will be to develop fundamental knowledge pertaining to design and construction of biocomposites while exploiting several advantages of cell encapsulation in silica sol-gel and achieving maximal H2 production per unit mass of encapsulated cells. The objectives of this research are to (1) determine the optimal gel composition and immobilization approach for desired viability, longevity, and metabolic activity of encapsulated cells; (2) determine and describe molecular-level interactions between the sol-gel and the encapsulated cells; and (3) characterize photosynthetic activity and H2 production from the encapsulated cultures to optimize gel geometry and optical properties for H2 production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a critical step toward developing sustainable biophotolytic H2 production systems that can sustainably meet energy demands. Knowledge derived and applications resulting from the research could help to develop biomimetic models to create biobased generators to produce molecular H2 from water and light, which would have enormous impacts on all sectors of society. Since water would replace fossil fuels as the feedstock, fossil fuel use, exposures and health-related effects would all decline. Such generators could be incorporated into integrated H2 energy systems, providing generation, storage, and utilization of H2 in one unit. Finally, we will provide a unique opportunity for training graduate, undergraduate and high-school students with multi-disciplinary knowledge and skills.</AbstractNarration>
