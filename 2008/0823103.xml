    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a flexible, double-sided, dry adhesive "tape" that is applicable to science, space, industry and home use. The thermally and electrically conductive tape will be detachable and reusable, and, will not have the disadvantages associated with other adhesion methods. Surfaces will not require being smoothed, clean, non-porous, nor ferro-magnetic for adhesion, nor will it require special fixtures for attachment. This project will permit tape to be directly applied as the intermediary between any two surfaces that require 1) high thermal heat transfer from one surface to the other, and/or 2) strong adhesion. The project will explore manufacturing aspects, as well as preparation for production of prototype double-sided adhesive tape with superior thermal and adhesive properties. The coexistent mechanical, thermal and electrical properties, makes this innovative adhesive tape advantageous to many applications including semiconductor chip mounting, heat sinking and systems that require a rapid mount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will mean significant improvements in thermal performance of many electronic devices and time-savings in manufacturing by removing the need to bolt down (sub-) assemblies. The true commercial value of using this innovation, in terms of superior performance, streamlined designs, ease of manufacture, trouble-free operations and simplified assembly, could very well run in the millions of dollars in cost savings.</AbstractNarration>
