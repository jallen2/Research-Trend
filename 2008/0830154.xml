    <AbstractNarration>This is a workshop meeting of the NSF Future Internet Design (FIND) program that the PI will host and coordinate on April 8-9 in Los Angeles, California. This meeting is a chance to bring both the FIND-funded researchers and externally funded researchers with related projects together. The goals are to learn about each others' work and to develop concepts for large scale network architecture and systems. Large scale network architecture and systems increasingly seems as though it is an emerging field, and the researchers are trying to come to grips with its possibilities for transformative research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary intellectual merit of the proposal is the provision of the meeting, because the meeting will result in community building for the emerging future internet and large scale network architecture and systems field, and in researcher contribution and understanding for FIND Phase 2. This is a very important contribution that can benefit networking research at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FIND programmatic area of the NeTS program requires that PIs attend three FIND meetings per year. This will be the fifth of these meetings, taking place at the midpoint of most of the PIs? three year grants for Phase 1 of the FIND program. The goal of this meeting is a deep discussion of the nature of a second phase of FIND, in which researchers will go from exploring future internet design without constraints or assumptions from the present Internet to researching and designing large scale network architecture and systems using the same degrees of freedom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FIND meetings encourage the FIND research community collectively to rise to the challenges of creating new internet architectures for societal demands of the 21st century. Both the FIND-funded and externally funded researchers are actively engaged with broader impacts. Phase 2 of FIND will create larger internet architectures and these will address such pressing demands as 1. security and privacy that work, because trust in the network must underlie so much future development; 2. availability for critical communications, because inexorably critical infrastructures have complex dependencies on our fallible internet systems; and 3. evolvable capabilities that enable economic models and that allow economic growth that the present internet may currently block. There are many areas of potential broader impact of future internet design. The meeting's discussions of Phase 2 and of large scale architecture and systems design will bring the FIND program closer to its realization of broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>
