    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Rupali Chandar (University of Toledo) will use space- and ground-based data to make a detailed study of the properties of star clusters in 20 star-forming galaxies, covering most types and environments found in the nearby universe. This program will explore a new hypothesis, based on preliminary results from two very different galaxies, that the basic physical processes of star cluster formation and disruption are essentially the same, whether they operate on open, super-star, or globular star clusters, and regardless of the type of galaxy or environment in which they form. If correct, this picture revises some long-held beliefs about the formation and disruption of star clusters. Regardless of the outcome, this research will take a major step forward in understanding the physics of star and cluster formation, the life cycle of clusters, and the stellar content within galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Chandar will make the extensive set of reduced, integrated-light spectra of star clusters in nearby galaxies which will result from this research available to the public in order to enable many follow-up projects. As part of this program, Dr. Chandar will also develop two new education initiatives: (1) "Girls in Science", an outreach event aimed at middle school girls, will incorporate data from the research portion of this proposal into hands-on activities, and (2) "Beyond the Solar System", a new teacher training initiative focused on topics related to this proposal and aligned with State and Federal science standards.</AbstractNarration>
