    <AbstractNarration>This proposal involves three projects. The first concerns modeling and&lt;br/&gt;efficient simulation of heteroepitaxial growth using kinetic Monte Carlo &lt;br/&gt;and will build from prior NSF support which resulted in the&lt;br/&gt;development of a Fourier multigrid method for the fast solution of&lt;br/&gt;discrete elastic equations for complex geometries. This work will be &lt;br/&gt;extended to develop methods for obtaining inexpensive upper bonds on&lt;br/&gt;rates, the use of local computations for elastic equations, and the inclusion of&lt;br/&gt;intermixing of multiple species. The second project involves the &lt;br/&gt;simulation of grain boundary motion in two and three dimensions using&lt;br/&gt;a recently developed multiphase variational level set framework which&lt;br/&gt;allows one to systematically deduce level set equations for a network of&lt;br/&gt;grains moving under curvature flow. We plan to extend this formulation to &lt;br/&gt;allow the simulation of thousands of seeds by using only a few level set&lt;br/&gt;functions. The efficient computation of high frequency wave propagation &lt;br/&gt;and the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation is the third&lt;br/&gt;project. The proposed algorithm is based on the observation that most of &lt;br/&gt;the time, in these limiting regimes, the solutions are very localized &lt;br/&gt;in the wavenumber domain. This can be exploited by solving the equations in this&lt;br/&gt;domain using a fast local convolution. It is planned to update the solutions&lt;br/&gt;by the computation of the matrix exponential using a Krylov subspace&lt;br/&gt;approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the proposed projects has the potential to have a significant impact &lt;br/&gt;on problems that are both fundamental and technologically important. &lt;br/&gt;Heteroepitaxial growth is scientifically interesting since it has effects&lt;br/&gt;on both nanoscales and mesoscales. It is technologically relevant since&lt;br/&gt;quantum dot materials are made in this way. Our proposed techniques will&lt;br/&gt;greatly increase the simulation speed thereby facilitating model development.&lt;br/&gt;The study of grain boundary motion using curvature flow is a classic problem &lt;br/&gt;in applied and computational mathematics which has importance in material s&lt;br/&gt;cience. Since there are no robust simulations of a large number grains in &lt;br/&gt;three dimensions the proposed project should have significant impact. &lt;br/&gt;The efficient computation of high frequency wave propagation has important &lt;br/&gt;facets ranging from antenna design to seismic sensing. On the other hand,&lt;br/&gt;fast simulation of the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation &lt;br/&gt;could provide deeper insight into chemical reaction dynamics, &lt;br/&gt;molecular-surface scattering, and photodissociation, for example.</AbstractNarration>
