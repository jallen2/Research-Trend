    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of the workshop is two fold: first to deliver an invigorating&lt;br/&gt;educational program and second is to provide an outstanding&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to bring together women students from different departments,&lt;br/&gt;across the country (and possibly internationally), so as to foster a&lt;br/&gt;sense of kinship and camaraderie. And to provide access to the role&lt;br/&gt;models in this area by having senior and junior faculty present.&lt;br/&gt;Further enhancing this initial relationship with a long time mentoring&lt;br/&gt;program which will be organized by Anne Condon. Our long term goal is&lt;br/&gt;that these efforts will help widen the pipeline of women doing theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there are groups for "Women in Computer Science" and "Women in&lt;br/&gt;Engineering" at both the university and national level, our objective in&lt;br/&gt;creating a "Women in Theory" workshop is to enable meaningful technical&lt;br/&gt;interactions among the participants. There will be significant overlap&lt;br/&gt;in research interests in this group to facilitate a technical program&lt;br/&gt;that is interesting to everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;List of confirmed technical speakers:&lt;br/&gt;Dorit Aharonov, Hebrew University, Shuchi Chawla, University of Wisconsin,&lt;br/&gt;Madison, Julia Chuzhoy, TTI,&lt;br/&gt;Irit Dinur, Weizmann Institute, Cynthia Dwork, Microsoft Research, Joan&lt;br/&gt;Feigenbaum, Yale,&lt;br/&gt;Shafi Goldwasser, MIT and Weizmann Institute, Tal Malkin, Columbia&lt;br/&gt;University, Eva Tardos, Cornell,&lt;br/&gt;Lisa Zhang, Bell-Labs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will also have talks by the participating students and sessions&lt;br/&gt;devoted to discussions on issues that are especially relevant to&lt;br/&gt;female scientists such as finding a job and salary negotiations,&lt;br/&gt;communicating with your advisor, and work-life balance, etc.</AbstractNarration>
