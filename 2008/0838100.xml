    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EPS-0838100&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Survey of Networking Infrastructure Capabilities of EPSCoR, Minority Serving, and Rurally Located Higher Education Institutions &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Educause&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals: Educause will design and conduct a survey to assess the current bandwidth network connectivity available for academic research at EPSCoR, minority serving, and rural institutions, as well as the perceived needs bandwidth needs of these institutions. The University of Michigan will aid Educause in the conduct of the survey and the compilation of data. In addition, Educause will host a workshop to which higher education leaders of these institutions will be invited to discuss the survey findings. In addition, Educause will produce a comprehensive report of the data collected and submit the report to the National Science Foundation (NSF), NSF will used the findings to inform the Foundations? response to Section 7020 of the America Competes Act. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This is a timely project and recruits the appropriate expertise and methods to conduct the survey, and to collect, analyze, and summarize the data. The information collected will be essential for any Foundation level strategic planning in the area of connectivity for academic research. The results of the activity will enable the Foundation to meet one of its obligations under the America Competes Act. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The ?digital divide? remains a critical issue in national cyberinfrastructure. Bandwidth is one of the limiting factors affecting access to information and computing capacity at EPSCoR, minority serving, and rural institutions. Any effort that can assist in developing implementation plans that can expand broadband access of these institutions will improve their research and economic competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>
