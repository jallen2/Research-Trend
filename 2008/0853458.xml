    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0853458&lt;br/&gt;Zhang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of this research are to understand the reactions, schemes, and pathways for the decomposition of Printed Wiring Board (PWB) wastes, through which clean and useful fuel products are to be obtained; to find suitable and efficient catalysts for the combustion and pyrolysis of PWB wastes in order to control the emission of toxic gas and heavy metals; and to propose green processes for the recycling of PWB wastes at industrial scale. Both combustion and pyrolysis will be investigated. The ultimate goal is to create an efficient and environmentally friendly thermal treatment process for PWB wastes to recycle the energy contained therein by extracting fuels, recovering precious metals, and avoiding pollution from the process. Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research. A homepage on "Recycling of Electronic Wastes" will be built, and a course on the recycling of materials will be taught every spring semester.</AbstractNarration>
