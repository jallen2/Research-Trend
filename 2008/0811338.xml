    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT 0811338&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delaware State University has developed a BS degree in Forensic Biology, which accepted its first students in the fall of 2006. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in student interest in pursuing careers in or related to science, especially forensic biology, with over forty television shows directly or indirectly incorporating forensic science. The use of DNA technology in identifying human remains after mass disasters and the recent exoneration of individuals convicted of crimes they had not committed has further fueled student interest in careers in forensic science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Targeted Infusion project is focused on strengthening our new forensic biology degree by revamping the current curriculum to meet the accreditation standards set forth by the American Academy of Forensic Science/Forensic Science Education Programs Accreditation Commission (AAFS/FEPAC). We are developing new courses and strengthening existing courses with new instrumentation and equipment needed for optimal training of students. The newly-developed and strengthened courses provide educational and technological training in current forensic DNA methodologies and will prepare students to enter the growing forensic workforce and/or graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delaware State University is a minority serving institution that attracts students from within the state of Delaware and surrounding states. Our aggressive pursuit for accreditation for this program makes DSU one of the few institutions (and the only HBCU) within our region to offer an accredited program in forensic biology, thus increasing the number of minority or underrepresented students receiving degrees in STEM related fields. The appeal of our program is evident by the 25% increase in the number of students choosing majors in biology since the advertisement and implementation of our forensic program in 2006.</AbstractNarration>
