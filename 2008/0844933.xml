    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Efficient fuel cells, reverse-osmosis membranes, and ?artificial muscle? actuators require new polymeric materials with finely controlled molecular and nanoscale structures. Developing new classes of energy-related materials represents a pivotal step toward sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;Madsen (PI) will undertake characterizations of molecular alignment and nanoscale morphology in phase-separated ionic polymers, focusing on the critical hydrophilic phase that allows fast transport. This project will build models relating mesoscale transport and alignment to important bulk properties such as proton conductivity using advanced NMR methods in combination with electron microscopy, conductivity measurements, and transport simulations. Madsen will additionally develop methods for controlling morphology using various solvents, annealing, and electric and magnetic fields. These investigations will critically inform processing protocols and rational synthetic strategies.&lt;br/&gt;Madsen?s university education program will bring advanced polymer NMR to Virginia Tech via novel lab sessions and a graduate course. A K-5 program will bring faculty and students together with girls and parents to develop scientific intuition, thus initiating future scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogen fuel cells form a promising link in future sustainable energy production and distribution cycles, while clean water needs worldwide are increasingly demanding advanced purification techniques. Water and energy represent our most pressing needs for sustainable life on this planet. Advanced polymers can fill these roles, but require further development to enter everyday use.&lt;br/&gt;This project, directed by Prof. Louis Madsen at Virginia Tech, will focus on revealing new and pivotal aspects of advanced polymers used in water purification and in fuel cells. In order to understand these materials in depth and improve performance, Madsen will apply a broad range of analysis and computer modeling techniques. These fundamental studies hold promise for greatly enhancing power and clean water production.&lt;br/&gt;Madsen?s project plans encompass education of promising university students, and also outreach to K-5 girls and their parents. The latter program aims to build strong future scientists from a group still under-utilized in today?s workforce. Madsen plans to use the relevance of these basic research issues to all citizens as well as his familiarity with ?how things work? all around us to drive participant engagement.</AbstractNarration>
