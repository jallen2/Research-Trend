    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to acquire a cutting-edge commercial multi-function instrument for electrical, magnetic, and thermal measurement of nanostructured materials. The establishment of this Cryogen-free Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) for research and education will support and enhance the rapidly expanding research infrastructure in the field of nanostructured materials at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM). The proposed PPMS is an automated cryogen-free system for the measurement of a variety of physical properties, over a range of temperatures from 1.6 ? 325 K, and with magnetic fields up to 8 Tesla. The instrument provides for measurement of the magnetic moment, AC susceptibility, electrical transport, magnetoresistance and Hall effect. These are physical property measurements and materials characterizations which are relevant to most fields in materials science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;This cryogen-free system will incur low operating costs in low temperature measurements. Usually for such measurements, the cryogenic liquid helium must be conveyed from the US mainland, since no local source is available in Puerto Rico. The long distance transport by sea results in high cost and wasted research time. The cryogen-free PPMS is a good match for our existing research infrastructure at UPRM, and will provide significant cost savings in the long term while also providing a great opportunity for new research directions and for the education of our students. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed instrument will support diverse and interdisciplinary ongoing research projects. Specific research activities supported by the proposed PPMS system include: &lt;br/&gt;1. Magnetism and thermoelectricity of clathrate materials with magnetic nanostructured arrays.&lt;br/&gt;2. Nanostructured materials for spintronics applications.&lt;br/&gt;3. Nanostructured magnetic materials for data storage media of high-coercivity metallic and ferrite nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;4. Magnetocaloric effect using a magnetic monodisperse nanofluid with a Low Curie temperature for electronic cooling applications&lt;br/&gt;5. Magnetic nano-composites for electro-magnetic interference applications. &lt;br/&gt;6. Biomedicine application of magnetic nanoparticles. &lt;br/&gt;7. Structure-property relationships of surface modified carbon nanotubes.&lt;br/&gt;8. Two-gap superconductivity in MgB2: doping and disorder effects. &lt;br/&gt;9. Flux pinning in the rare-earth doped high-Tc superconducting single crystals. &lt;br/&gt;10. Response of magnetic nanoparticle suspensions to oscillating and rotating magnetic fields.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed education activities aim to increase and enhance the education and participation of Hispanics, especially undergraduate and graduate students attending the UPRM. Research activities requiring PPMS are intimately linked with teaching at UPRM. This instrument will immediately support the interdisciplinary research and materials science and engineering training for over 20 undergrads, 20 graduate students, 2 postdoctoral researchers and 7 faculty. Pre-existing courses and new developed courses will immediately benefit from the instrument. Approximately 15% of the instrument operating time will be dedicated to education and training. In addition this proposal will generate a broader impact on education of pre-college students and their teachers in underserved Puerto Rico areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to acquire a multi-function instrument for electrical, magnetic, and thermal measurement of nanostructured materials.
