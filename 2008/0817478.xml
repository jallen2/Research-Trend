    <AbstractNarration>The 6th USENIX Symposium on File and Storage Technology (FAST) is scheduled&lt;br/&gt;for February 2008. FAST is a leading forum for innovative research in storage&lt;br/&gt;systems, bringing in researchers and practitioners from both industry and&lt;br/&gt;academia. Topics include reliability, performance, mobility, power management,&lt;br/&gt;measurement, and other topics germane to file and storage systems. This NSF&lt;br/&gt;proposal requested funding to support the attendance of US-based graduate&lt;br/&gt;students. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part&lt;br/&gt;of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with&lt;br/&gt;more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. The support&lt;br/&gt;requested in this proposal makes possible the participation of students who&lt;br/&gt;would otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention will be paid to&lt;br/&gt;directing support towards underrepresented minorities including women,&lt;br/&gt;African-Americans, and Native Americans.</AbstractNarration>
