    <AbstractNarration>Interest in solid-state chemistry as a discipline has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area. The 2008 MRS Symposium PP on Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic Materials is a major international meeting. The goal of the conference is to facilitate collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in solid-state chemistry areas that address issues such as novel synthesis methods, crystal chemistry, electronic , magnetic and optical properties of new classes of materials, computational solid state chemistry, chemistry of nano-scale materials, surfaces and interfaces/catalysis, solid state ionics, microporous materials and framework structures, dielectric materials inorganic/organic hybrid materials, and composite materials. These topics play key roles in the preparation and characterization of novel materials for important applications. The NSF support will go to students, post-doctoral scholars, and early career faculty, as well as senior U.S. session chairs and invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this conference is to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss the latest advances and challenges in the area of solid-state chemistry with the intent to promote an exchange of ideas and to build strong relationships among academic, industrial, and government researchers. Internationally known speakers and poster presentations from students, post-doctoral scholars, and early career faculty will emphasize technical advances, the presentation of unpublished work, and the discussion of new ideas and future directions emerging within the solid-state chemistry community. The speakers represent academic, industrial, and government laboratories, and there will be strong international participation. Leading scientists working in various areas of solid-state chemistry are expected to draw the interest of many researchers in the field. Current frontiers to be highlighted include synthesizing, characterizing, and investigating the properties of novel classes of inorganic solid compounds. The area impacts the entire field of solid-state chemistry and much of materials chemistry research since it spans all materials types and a wide variety of exploitable properties. As a result, this MRS symposium on solid-state chemistry will draw the interest of those working on diverse classes of compounds important to advancing new technologies.</AbstractNarration>
