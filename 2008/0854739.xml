    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the 2009 Conference on Quantum Fluids and Solids. The conference brings together both experimental and theoretical expertise in an interdisciplinary framework to resolve outstanding problems in condensed states of matter including superconductivity, superfluidity, and supersolids. The connections between vortex structure and dynamics, manifest in cold condensates of atoms, superfluids, and superconductors will be presented. Quantum effects that have recently been uncovered in mechanical systems, and in systems of low dimensionality in liquid and solid helium, as well as in novel materials will be a focal point. The significance of the breadth of the topics in this conference is to provide an exceptional educational opportunity for young scientists and students. Additionally the most promising new research directions and their applications will be established through active discussions and workshops organized within the conference program. The conference will be held on the Northwestern University campus, August 5-11, 2009 with the expectation of 250 participants. This project is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Physics.</AbstractNarration>
