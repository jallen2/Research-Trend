    <AbstractNarration>How can you tell whether a knot is really knotted or &lt;br/&gt;whether it is possible to find a formula for the &lt;br/&gt;solutions of certain equations or how to make sense&lt;br/&gt;of the nature of the elementary particles of physics &lt;br/&gt;or why there are only 17 really different wall paper &lt;br/&gt;patterns? These and many other such questions depend &lt;br/&gt;on an algebraic structure called a group. Groups arise &lt;br/&gt;in many parts of mathematics and in science. They provide, &lt;br/&gt;in particular, the means to understand and exploit&lt;br/&gt;symmetry. This makes it possible for them to help&lt;br/&gt;in our understanding of the nature of the space we live &lt;br/&gt;in, the structure of crystals and various molecules &lt;br/&gt;and in the design of new cryptographic protocols. Indeed &lt;br/&gt;the security of information transmitted electronically &lt;br/&gt;over the internet depends crucially on a particular kind &lt;br/&gt;of group called a finite group. This group provides a way&lt;br/&gt;to encode messages using the product of two very large prime&lt;br/&gt;numbers. The encoding is the easy part of the process.&lt;br/&gt;The hard part is the decoding and this is where group theory&lt;br/&gt;is used. The present proposal deals with the current state of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of certain groups, called finitely presented groups.&lt;br/&gt;These finitely presented groups hold in many instances the keys&lt;br/&gt;to solving important problems in mathematics and science&lt;br/&gt;and the primary objective of this conference is for a number&lt;br/&gt;of very prominent mathematicians to map out future directions &lt;br/&gt;of study.</AbstractNarration>
