    <AbstractNarration>Institution: Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Marilyn Lombardi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's graphical user interfaces continue to rely on WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointing device) technology first developed in the 1960's. High performance computational science is still commonly performed in batch mode, since today's HPC architectures and software do not support real time interaction between scientists and HPC applications. How can cutting edge 21st century interaction mechanisms enable high performance science and discovery? How can new technology make science come alive for students and the general public? Jointly sponsored by the NSF Office of Cyberinfrastructure (OCI) and the Computing and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorate, this two-day, invitation-only workshop will bring together a select group of thought leaders from industry and the academy to develop a guiding vision and a cross-cutting research agenda for human-centered interface and interaction design over the next decade. The workshop represents a critical step in moving beyond independent research projects toward coherent application of national resources in the area of human-centered interface and interaction design. Invitees drawn from computer science, engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, the cognitive sciences, perceptual psychology, neurobiology, architecture, design, and the interactive arts will work together to address a set of key questions: Where do we want to be by the year 2018? How do we plan on getting there in a scalable and sustainable fashion? What are the major trends in the field? Which forces are driving change? What impedes further progress? What are the technical, social, psychological, and legal issues requiring further study? What are our beliefs about human-computer interaction research and its goals? What are the funding priorities over the coming decade and what are the respective roles of the federal, non-profit, and commercial sectors in shaping the group's vision of a human-centered future? Workshop results will be captured in a workshop report and disseminated to the National Science Foundation and the research community.</AbstractNarration>
