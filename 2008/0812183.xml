    <AbstractNarration>With widespread attempts to apply data mining methods to real life&lt;br/&gt;problems, there is an increasing realization that real life data is&lt;br/&gt;often multi-relational, involving observations connecting multiple&lt;br/&gt;entities through a set of relations. A central problem in several&lt;br/&gt;applications involving multi-relational data is to simultaneously find&lt;br/&gt;clusters of objects across related entities, e.g., customer clusters&lt;br/&gt;and related product clusters in e-commerce, movie clusters and related&lt;br/&gt;user clusters in recommendation systems, communities and shared&lt;br/&gt;content in social networks, etc. The key novel aspect is that the&lt;br/&gt;clustering of objects in an entity, such as the set of movies or&lt;br/&gt;users, depends on its relationships with objects in other entities,&lt;br/&gt;e.g., users are similar if they like similar movies, and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of of this project is to develop a unified&lt;br/&gt;statistical approach to multi-relational clustering and related&lt;br/&gt;problems in multi-relational data analysis. Towards this end, the&lt;br/&gt;project investigates a family of novel statistical multi-relational&lt;br/&gt;mixture models, with focus on additive and multiplicative models for&lt;br/&gt;multi-relational clustering. Due to modularity of design, both&lt;br/&gt;additive and multiplicative models can incorporate domain specific&lt;br/&gt;semantics as well as automatic model selection using appropriate&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian priors. Further, the project investigates efficient&lt;br/&gt;variational inference methods appropriate for discovering latent&lt;br/&gt;multi-relational clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project significantly empowers the knowledge discovery component&lt;br/&gt;of data mining. Crucial clues to understanding observed data in&lt;br/&gt;several disciplines, including social, biological, and information&lt;br/&gt;sciences, are often spread across multiple related observations. The&lt;br/&gt;project enables a statistical approach to detecting latent structure&lt;br/&gt;in such multi-relational data, which is an important step towards&lt;br/&gt;knowledge discovery from multiple related data sources. The project&lt;br/&gt;plays an important role in developing closer collaboration across&lt;br/&gt;disciplines and broaden participation in computer science. Building&lt;br/&gt;on the increasing awareness regarding the ubiquity of multi-relational&lt;br/&gt;data, the project contributes to the development of appropriate&lt;br/&gt;educational material for the next generation work-force.
