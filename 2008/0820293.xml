    <AbstractNarration>Torque and rotation are of paramount importance in many essential cellular processes including transcription. Transcription is the first step in gene expression and a major point of gene regulation. It is carried out by RNA polymerase which functions as a highly processive molecular motor that moves along the DNA template transcribing genetic information from DNA to create messenger RNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase is known to transcribe against DNA supercoiling. The mechanism by which RNA polymerase carries out transcription under torsional stress remains one of the most fundamental and intriguing problems in biology. The PI's lab will carry out a comprehensive set of single molecule experiments to investigate the regulation of E. coli RNA polymerase under a well-defined applied torque using an angular optical trap that has been developed in the PI's lab. Although the proposed project focuses on E. coli RNA polymerase, the general methodology and approach are readily extendable to viral and eukaryotic polymerases as well as many other DNA-based molecular motors. This project should prove to be a powerful cross-disciplinary approach for tackling important problems in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of our work will be well disseminated through publications, presentations, and broader education to the community. The project will involve graduate students, undergraduate students, and even high school students in research. The PI also plans to involve undergraduate students to construct an optical tweezers mobile exhibition for the ScienCenter, a hands-on science museum in Ithaca, and to participate in various outreach activities organized by Cornell Nanobiotechnology Center.</AbstractNarration>
