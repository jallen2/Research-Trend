    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduate Site at the University of Toledo &lt;br/&gt;provides a unique opportunity for 10 undergraduate students to perform &lt;br/&gt;supervised research and obtain rich experiences in a diverse and &lt;br/&gt;multicultural environment. In this program, each student carries out an &lt;br/&gt;independent research project under the close guidance of a faculty mentor &lt;br/&gt;during 10 weeks of summer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects cover a wide range of research topics in the field &lt;br/&gt;of Information technology such as computational algorithms, software &lt;br/&gt;engineering, architecture, graphics, optimization, information security, &lt;br/&gt;image processing and multimedia. Supervised research experience has been &lt;br/&gt;shown to motivate students and encourage higher levels of academic &lt;br/&gt;achievement leading to increased retention and graduation for &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students, especially for underrepresented minorities. The &lt;br/&gt;participants are also strongly encouraged to present their research at &lt;br/&gt;regional and national scientific meetings. In addition to gaining &lt;br/&gt;research experience, students will participate in other activities &lt;br/&gt;designed to promote other skills such as communication skills, technical &lt;br/&gt;writing skills, as well as presentation skills. This program will also &lt;br/&gt;expose participants to the possibility of graduate study and encourage &lt;br/&gt;them to choose this step in their career paths, which will increase their &lt;br/&gt;employment prospective. The end result will be a strong set of graduates &lt;br/&gt;who can satisfy at least some of the needs for Engineering and IT &lt;br/&gt;professionals in research and industry. The undergraduate participants &lt;br/&gt;in this program will be recruited nationwide, particularly from &lt;br/&gt;minority-serving and other small colleges. Also, underrepresented groups, &lt;br/&gt;including minorities and students from small colleges and universities &lt;br/&gt;with little research opportunities are strongly encouraged to apply.</AbstractNarration>
