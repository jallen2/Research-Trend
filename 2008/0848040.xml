    <AbstractNarration>This project will use existing Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models describing collision-dominated, fully ionized electron-proton plasmas to generate equilibrium solutions for the diffusion region of 1.5D current sheets, and then determine how these solutions evolve in time when subjected to 3D linear perturbations. The research will apply the Principal Investigator's (PI) models to the ranges of density, temperature, and magnetic field strength that characterize the Sun's transition region and lower corona, where plasma transport processes are collisionally dominated. The researcher has previously determined that thermoelectric currents are as important as electric field-driven currents in determining the current density and heating rate in this zone. This research will ascertain whether the equilibrium structure of diffusion regions significantly affects magnetic reconnection rates at the Sun. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will expand the ongoing collaboration with the Department of Physics at Fairmont State University (FSU) in West Virginia. The PI will advise undergraduate students at FSU on computational science research projects and serve as a mentor for FSU undergraduate interns working at his institution, the West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation, as well as at other local companies. The PI will also assist FSU with the development of computational components for physics courses and the potential development of a computational science degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).</AbstractNarration>
