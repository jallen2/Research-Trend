    <AbstractNarration>This three-year REU site program located at Cornell University, Center for Nanoscale Systems in Information Technologies (CNS) will provide an opportunity for twelve undergraduate students each year to participate in hands-on research in the interdisciplinary field of Nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the program are to motivate the student participants to pursue graduate education in nanoengineering and nanoscale science, and to encourage them to pursue post-graduate careers in the nanotechnology area, in either industry or academia. To enhance the research experience, a variety of activities have been incorporated. These include a series of seminars and workshops designed to introduce the students to, and inform them about "hot topics" in nanotechnology, and about career opportunities in both academic and industrial nanotechnology research. Students will take short "NanoCourses" on topics that are not addressed in the standard undergraduate engineering and science curriculum, including a two-day "Introduction to Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) Lab Techniques Course". Some of the topics covered in this Lab Techniques NanoCourse include scanned probe instrumentation, lithography, and pattern-transfer. The students will also participate in an ethics workshop, a workshop on research presentation techniques, and various community-building activities; (i.e. group dinners, field trips, and week-end social events). At the end of the summer, each student will present an oral report on his/her research project at the REU Research Symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will focus recruitment efforts on students from underrepresented groups in the engineering and science fields. Students will be encouraged and motivated to pursue graduate education and a professional career in nanotechnology or a related technical field.</AbstractNarration>
