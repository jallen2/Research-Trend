    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology through mentorship. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Irene G. Newton is "Investigating host genes that control growth of an intracellular bacterial symbiont." The host institution for this research is Tufts University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Ralph Isberg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolbachia are parasitic bacteria that are estimated to inhabit the cells of 15-20% of insect species. Given that these bacteria are harmful to insect host cells as they can change male hosts into females or even kill male offspring, it is surprising to find Wolbachia regularly residing within host cells without harming the host. This research is investigating how the host may limit the growth of this bacterial symbiont. Using host cell lines, factors contributing to control of parasite densities are being investigated, and the function of proteins in the context of parasitism are further characterized in the whole host organism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training objectives include techniques in intracellular bacterial lineages and host interaction, handling both adult insects and cell lines harboring Wolbachia, as well as RNA interference (RNAi). The results will impact research on Wolbachia, and show insight on persistent symbiotic bacterial infections through understanding why these invading bacterial lineages can be stably maintained in the insect hosts without generating disease.</AbstractNarration>
