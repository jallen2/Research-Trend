    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0805785 &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Alexander A. Voronov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to solve a number of important&lt;br/&gt;problems in the rapidly developing fields of Topological Field&lt;br/&gt;Theory (TFT), Symplectic Field Theory (SFT), and Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory. The first part of the project will span from higher&lt;br/&gt;category theory, to cobordisms and to quantum field theories. The&lt;br/&gt;plan is to place cobordisms of manifolds with corners within an&lt;br/&gt;appropriate n-category framework and describe TFTs as n-functors&lt;br/&gt;from the n-category of cobordisms to that of n-vector spaces, as&lt;br/&gt;well as show that physical models, such as gauge&lt;br/&gt;(Wess-Zumino-Witten), Yang-Mills, Chern-Simons, Seiberg-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theories, and sigma-model may be described as such higher&lt;br/&gt;TFTs. The second part of the project consists in bringing&lt;br/&gt;together algebraic geometric and symplectic methods to construct&lt;br/&gt;a full solution to the so-called Quantum Master Equation in&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory. This equation describes the topology of the&lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces of holomorphic curves and relevant algebraic&lt;br/&gt;structures, providing important invariants in symplectic and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. The third part of the project aims at lifting&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory to the (Floer) chain level and developing a&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial version of Gromov-Witten theory, thus bridging the&lt;br/&gt;areas of enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic Floer theory,&lt;br/&gt;and graph homology. The last, SFT part of the project will result&lt;br/&gt;in constructing a new compactification of the moduli space of&lt;br/&gt;Riemann surfaces, which would govern the algebraic operations and&lt;br/&gt;invariants arising in SFT. This compactification will be an SFT&lt;br/&gt;analogue of the Deligne-Mumford compactification relevant to&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims at discovering and studying new algebraic&lt;br/&gt;structures in topology suggested or motivated by mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physics, in particular, string theory, Symplectic Field Theory,&lt;br/&gt;and Gromov-Witten theory. Another long-term goal is to build a&lt;br/&gt;bridge between several mathematical cultures working on problems&lt;br/&gt;related to mathematical physics. These cultures include&lt;br/&gt;algebraists, algebraic topologists, symplectic geometers,&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometers, and geometric topologists, to name a&lt;br/&gt;few. The algebraic structures is a mathematical reincarnation of&lt;br/&gt;such fundamental structures of physical theories as correlators&lt;br/&gt;and relations between them (Ward identities). Understanding this&lt;br/&gt;structure is crucial for understanding the physical theory. From&lt;br/&gt;the point of view of mathematics, the project leads to new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical ideas, new algebra, geometry, and topology,&lt;br/&gt;motivated by physics.</AbstractNarration>
