    <AbstractNarration>ARRA statement: This CAREER proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and meets the requirements established in Section 2 of the White House Memorandum entitled, Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, dated March 20, 2009. I also affirm, as the cognizant Program Officer, that the proposal does not support projects described in Section 1604 of Division A of the Recovery Act. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER plan integrates research and educational activities to reduce the risk of bridge scour, the number one cause of bridge failures. &lt;br/&gt;The research activities combine the development of innovative sensors with advanced simulations, and aim to overcome the limitations of the existing theories and testing methods. The research program is expected to make significant scientific contributions in development of 1) innovative laboratory and field sensors to monitor bridge scour and understand the dynamic damaging mechanisms involved, specially the effects of turbulence on processes of sediment transport and 2) a capability to accurately predict bridge scour under turbulent conditions incorporating multi-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods and analysis. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The sensors and cyber computational tools will improve the design of scour countermeasures thus ensuring safety and economy through protection of critical transportation infrastructures. The CAREER research plan will be implemented through a strong partnership with governmental agencies and professional organizations.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This integrated research and educational career development program also includes activities that would enrich the engineering classroom experience of undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students and teachers. These will include the development of new course materials related to infrastructure engineering, an area of focus of Civil Engineering program at Case Western University. Students and K-12 teachers will be provided with research-based learning experience. Students at all levels will also be encouraged to participate in real or simulated engineering case studies to be showcased to the communities on the local level and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
