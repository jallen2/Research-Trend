    <AbstractNarration>McLaughlin&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0852516&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and her collagues organize a series of five&lt;br/&gt;workshops in five different application areas of inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems. All of the represented fields are advancing rapidly&lt;br/&gt;and in all cases the mathematical advances, the engineering&lt;br/&gt;advances and the new experiments enabled by new technology or&lt;br/&gt;innovative ideas combine together to make a rich opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;new research projects at the interface of disciplines. It is&lt;br/&gt;expected that research projects will be inspired, and in some&lt;br/&gt;cases be newly developed, as a result of the workshops. The&lt;br/&gt;presentations include state of the art techniques in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;sciences and engineering; an important addition in some of the&lt;br/&gt;workshops is the inclusion of experimentalists who describe their&lt;br/&gt;latest advances, the data sets that are obtained from those&lt;br/&gt;experiments, and their anticipated results from that data. Early&lt;br/&gt;career participants, including a strong representation of&lt;br/&gt;participants from underrepresented groups, are targeted. The&lt;br/&gt;Inverse Problems Center, IPRPI, provides an ideal environment to&lt;br/&gt;hold these workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The problem areas being targeted all impact quality of life&lt;br/&gt;and safety of individuals. Two of the workshops specifically&lt;br/&gt;target medical imaging; one is in imaging of biomechanical tissue&lt;br/&gt;properties, a new, very fast moving area with significant success&lt;br/&gt;anticipated, and another considers diffusion optical tomography,&lt;br/&gt;which also has a great deal of promise. Successes in these two&lt;br/&gt;areas significantly impact human health. Two other workshops&lt;br/&gt;emphazize identification in geosystems and waveform tomography. &lt;br/&gt;Both target understanding the effects of earthquake dynamics, as&lt;br/&gt;well as the identification of new energy sources. As such, the&lt;br/&gt;safety of individuals and quality of individual life is strongly&lt;br/&gt;affected. Finally, the microlocal analysis workshop emphasizes a&lt;br/&gt;broad set of application areas, including radar imaging, which is&lt;br/&gt;an important homeland security component. Much of the grant&lt;br/&gt;supports participants who are students, postdocs, junior faculty,&lt;br/&gt;women, and other under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
