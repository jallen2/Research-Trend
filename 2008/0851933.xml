    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS)-Duke University REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2014. A diverse group of 10 students will be selected each year to participate in an intensive eight-week mentored research program at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. The OTS REU Program is crafted to guide undergraduate students toward independent field-based research in biology. The program fosters student-to-researcher and student-to-student interactions, while improving student understanding of the scientific method and practices, as well as providing a window into the social and cultural life of Costa Rica. Under the supervision of research mentors at La Selva, students will design and develop an individual research project. The objectives of the program are to: (1) encourage a diverse group of students toward careers in field research and tropical biology; (2) establish a clear understanding of all aspects of the scientific method; (3) introduce students to the importance of tropical ecosystems and facilitate a more complete understanding of ecology and evolutionary biology; and (4) increase student awareness of the ethical context of research in the tropics.
