    <AbstractNarration>This project explores the impact of geographically distributed 3D tele-immersive environments on dancers' creativity and their perception of themselves and each other. More specifically, the project will study the impact of digital options, such as scale and multiply, on the dancers' creative expression and improvisation. A formal notation, called a creativity graph, will be derived from a Laban movement analysis of the dancers' movement. A dancer develops a creative dance, a new sequence of phrases, when he/she generates a new association between two movement states (e.g. a new association between two Laban positions) based on some feedback from the immersive environment due to either invoking digital options or due to some unexpected performance of the system. This project will have a fundamental impact on our understanding of dancers' creativity within tele-immersive dancing environments and computing and will contribute a new concept of transformational movement graphs as a computational representation of dance creativity in distributed multi-site 3D tele-immersive spaces.</AbstractNarration>
