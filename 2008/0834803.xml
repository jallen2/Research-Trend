    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to request funds for the support of travel awards for graduate students and untenured junior faculty participation in the 2008 Solid Sate Sensors and Actuators Workshop to be held at Hilton Head from June 1-5, 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The purpose of the workshop is to disseminate research results in the area of MEMS technology amongst a group of attendees which are primarily from the Americas. The agenda of the workshop includes plenary speakers from academia and industry to discuss stat-of-the-art in research areas on the fringe of micro/nanosystems. There will be 27 contributed papers and approximately 60 contributed posters. The whole workshop is in a single session format. The Hilton Head workshop is very selective, and with travel student presenters, advisors of the students are much more likely to send their students. It is especially useful for the young faculty to get financial support for travel to this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The knowledge gained and experiences shared from the workshop are planned to be captured electronically and broadly disseminated via website. It will benefit the students and the young faculty to make the presentation and /or present posters. They will get feedback from the attendees which will be very fruitful for their continuing research.</AbstractNarration>
