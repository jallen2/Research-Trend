    <AbstractNarration>The synergistic assembly of block copolymers and small molecules combines (a) the possibility and nanoscopic self-assembly of block copolymers and (b) the rich chemical functionality and molecular assembly of small molecule which can lead to hierarchical functional materials. A fundamental understanding will be developed on the assembly processes of diblock copolymer-based supramolecules in thin films and the interplay between the assembly processes of diblock copolymer and the small molecules on two different length scales. Specifically efforts will focus on the phase behavior of block copolymers in the presence of small molecules in thin film and the self assembly of the small molecules within the bock copolymer microdomains and their effect on the copolymer microdomain orientation in thin films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies add a new dimension to our existing knowledge of hierarchical assembly of soft materials and will improve our understanding of the interplay between self-assembly processes of two different length scales namely tens of nanometer and sub-nanometer (molecular) level. Since the built-in functionalities can be readily incorporated and the fundamental principles underpinning the synergy are general, the proposed studies will open mew avenues to functional hierarchical thin film materials.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Visualization of nanostructures effectively demonstrates the bridge between polymer science and nanoscience and will stimulate viewers? interests in fundamental sciences. Supramolecular assemblies produce a large library of fascinating images at different length scales. Programs will be developed to use these images to promote polymer science among different non-technical groups. During the funding period of this proposal, efforts will be initiated in the following three areas. &lt;br/&gt;1. For undergraduate and graduate students, class modules will be developed for the polymeric materials course to educate students with different backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;2. For aspiring students from under-represented groups, summer research opportunities will be crated. The students will collect images from his/her experiments to help their peers appreciate polymer science.&lt;br/&gt;3. For the general public, a seed program will be initiated on the West Coast to promote science using arts.</AbstractNarration>
