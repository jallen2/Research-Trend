    <AbstractNarration>0824288&lt;br/&gt;Gymama Slaughter, Virginia State University&lt;br/&gt;BRIGE: Nano-Pattern Modified Microelectrodes for the Improvement of Continuous in Vitro Glucose Monitoring Detection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE) solicitation, NSF 07-589. The intellectual merit lies in the integration of successful pedagogical techniques from K-16 education into the Virginia State University, Department of Engineering &amp; Technology environment of research. The project is based on an interdisciplinary research and development plan focusing on the design, fabrication, and in-vitro characterization of an amperometric biosensor for therapeutic drug monitoring. The biosensor design integrates soft-condensed, bio-smart hydrogels with solid-state microfabricated electrodes, and coupling of enzymes and nano-pattern microelectrodes. Furthermore, empirical experimentation and research experience for undergraduates, high school students, and teachers will be coalesce in the proposed work. The research will introduce emerging biosensor technology, expose undergraduates, high school students, and teachers to research experiences and practical instrumentation methods, hence providing the opportunity to create and incorporate effective modern teaching methods (team-based and experience-based learning, etc.) into the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts lie in the current disconnect between engineering research and education, which may be bridged by the development of a flexible curriculum through outreach programs, such as the Richmond Area Program for Minorities in Engineering. In this ongoing project, the high school teachers will be equipped to build on their research experience to develop even more effective Life Science Engineering efforts in their home school. Every effort has already been made to recruit students from under-represented groups to ensure a diverse range of talents. The research developed by utilizing Richmond Area Program for Minorities in Engineering will be made readily available on the PI's web site, so that it may be utilized (and modified) by other institutions, thus fostering collaboration. The proposed work will enhance infrastructure through the generated research materials that are easily portable to many institutions. Findings of the research will be disseminated at national societal conferences as well as on the PI's web site. Additionally, results will be published in traditional peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
