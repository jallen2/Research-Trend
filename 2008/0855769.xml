    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to generate a greater understanding of UV (ultraviolet) bonding in order to develop new abrasive tools that are more efficient and environmentally friendly than current abrasive tools. This research will investigate the interaction between abrasive, filler and UV-curable resin during the UV curing process on both mechanics and UV light energy translation. In order to meet the special needs of abrasive tools, modification and reinforcement of the composite characteristics will also be investigated. Specifically this research will (a) develop an optimized resin as the base of a UV-curable bonding agent, (b) develop a UV light energy translation model to analyze UV energy absorbing to the resin, (c) develop and optimize a model of the composite including resin, abrasive and other fillers, to analyze and predict the characteristics of the abrasive tools, and (d) validate and modify the resulting models with abrasive processes experiments. Two unique apparatuses for UV bonding of wire saw and for UV bonding of dicing blades will be designed and assembled. The model will be validated using experimental results obtaining using these two apparatus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this project will revolutionize the fabrication of abrasive tools for the semiconductor industry. The project will enhance the performance and cost effectiveness of wire saw, dicing and lapping, which are very important processes in semiconductor industry. These applications can also be extended to different precision engineering applications. Societal impact initiatives include summer research activities for grammar and high school students and teachers in Northwest region of Ohio. The project will create special opportunities for underrepresented communities in greater Toledo area. Also, new collaboration activities in education and research will be created between The University of Toledo and The Zhejiang University of Technology in China.</AbstractNarration>
