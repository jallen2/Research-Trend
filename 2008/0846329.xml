    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: Chiral Nanostructure Hybrid Materials for Applications in Terahertz Reso-nator and Magnetic Storage Devices&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is the design, fabrication, investigation and optimization of novel chiral nanostructure hybrid material devices for applications in Terahertz emitter/receiver systems and magnetic memories with increased storage capacity. The approach is to compose metal chiral sculptured thin films deposited by glancing angle deposition. Hybridization is ob-tained by filling low viscous monomers into nanostructures pores, and subsequent polymerization will transform the composite materials into functional hybrids. The educational/outreach program consists of a nanotechnology mini-course for middle school students, female student e-mentoring, development of a new materials research program graduate course; and international student exchange in cooperation with the University of Linkoping in Sweden.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research plan will lead to breakthrough advances for revolutionary new electromagnetic devices from chiral nanostructure hybrids. The potential three-dimensional non-volatile magnetic storage media may reach capacities far beyond the currently available sto-rage densities, and the active Terahertz resonator structures may be incorporated in Terahertz sources and detectors.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Expanding non-volatile direct-access computer memory beyond current limits will revolutionize data storage management. Development of Terahertz devices will en-able medical and security screening. Communication, computing, security, and health will immediately benefit from enabling this device technology. The female student electronic mentoring system closes an identified gap between female school students and engineering students, and enables female student commitment to engineering majors. The nanotechnology summer course to be developed fulfills recently identified gaps within the summer student outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
