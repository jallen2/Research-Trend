    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative RUI award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor Henry J. Tracy at the University of Southern Maine, Professor Nicholas Benfaremo at St. Joseph's College, and Professor Jerome L. Mullin at University of New England to synthesize and characterize group 14 metalloles, metalla-fluorenes, and their derivatives. The research is focused on the photophysical characterization of these compounds, especially aggregate-induced-emission (AIE) behavior, and the development of chemical sensors, immunoassay schemes, and electroluminescent devices constructed using the most promising of the new compounds. Theoretical and experimental studies will explore AIE in detail, in order to gain improved insight into the origins of this unusual behavior, and thus guide synthesis of additional compounds in an effort to produce even more highly efficient candidate species for use in optoelectronic devices. Efforts will be directed toward the synthesis of derivatives with varying solubilities, enhanced native luminescence, and targeted emission wavelength characteristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel compounds produced may prove to be useful in the production of OLEDs and other devices. The overall project theme takes advantage of the diverse and complementary strengths of the collaborators and their institutions, building on existing collaborations that have led to enhanced research opportunities for undergraduate students. This research initiative will build research capacity at all three institutions and expand the scope of research experiences that are available to students at the three primarily undergraduate institutions. Research opportunities for women, who make up 57% or more of the chemistry and biochemistry majors at each institution, will be particularly impacted.</AbstractNarration>
