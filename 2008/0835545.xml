    <AbstractNarration>Prof Philip Andrews from the University of Michigan is supported by the NSF Chemistry Division Integrative Chemistry Activities and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at NIH to organize an "NSF/NIH Joint Workshop on Instrument Development". This meeting will examine paths to develop innovative new instrumentation in the chemical/biological sciences and provide increased competitive advantages for the analytical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. The meeting will bring together users and instrument developers that will focus on creative approaches to instrument design applicable to both mature and emerging fields of research of common interest to both NSF and NIH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of modern instrumentation is a corner stone of research. Exploring paths to development of innovative new instrumentation is essential for advancement of research, education and science. The workshop is viewed as having potentially broad impact not only within chemical and biological fields but other disciplines as well.</AbstractNarration>
