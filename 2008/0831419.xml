    <AbstractNarration>The works of Thurston and Jones revolutionized low dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology. Thurston established the ubiquity of hyperbolic structure in&lt;br/&gt;low dimensions. Jones' work, via such physical notions as quantum&lt;br/&gt;groups and path integrals, led to vast families of topological&lt;br/&gt;invariants associated with diagrammatic descriptions of topological&lt;br/&gt;objects. The investigators have striking experimental evidence for a&lt;br/&gt;direct link between these disparate approaches. Establishing such a&lt;br/&gt;link is of fundamental importance to low dimensional topology. This&lt;br/&gt;proposal aims to establish this link, with particular focus on the&lt;br/&gt;generalized volume conjecture, which relates the most important&lt;br/&gt;geometric and quantum invariants: the hyperbolic volume and&lt;br/&gt;Chern-Simons invariant, and the colored Jones polynomials of a&lt;br/&gt;knot. The theory of L2-invariants provides a combinatorial framework&lt;br/&gt;to study hyperbolic volume. Deforming this construction along the&lt;br/&gt;curve of representations given by the A-polynomial involves the&lt;br/&gt;twisted Alexander polynomial and the colored Jones polynomials. Tree&lt;br/&gt;entropy of graphs provides the bridge between L2-torsion and colored&lt;br/&gt;Jones polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The volume conjecture relates classical geometric invariants of&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional spaces with topological invariants motivated by&lt;br/&gt;ideas from quantum physics. This conjecture originated in the theory&lt;br/&gt;of quantum gravity, which cannot yet be verified experimentally. The&lt;br/&gt;mathematically rigorous verification sought by this project of this&lt;br/&gt;and related conjectures will support the internal consistency of&lt;br/&gt;quantum gravity. Unifying quantum and geometric invariants is also of&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic mathematical importance, which will yield important new&lt;br/&gt;insights in other fields. Computer programs to study geometric&lt;br/&gt;invariants and tabulation of knots and their invariants are&lt;br/&gt;essential tools for this research. Undergraduate and graduate students&lt;br/&gt;involved in this project will be exposed to sophisticated mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and computer tools.</AbstractNarration>
