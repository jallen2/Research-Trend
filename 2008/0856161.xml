    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to understand the failure mechanisms of polyurea-coated metallic structural systems when subjected to blast loads. Polyurea, a class of polymeric materials, was shown to exhibit outstanding properties in mitigating impact and blast hazard in structures. This research will result in the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind the blast resistance properties of polyurea-steel composite systems. This fundamental understanding is needed for innovation of advanced structural protection systems. Deliverables of the project include state-of-the-art computational models to predict the response of polyurea-steel composite system under blast loads, novel structural designs for improved blast protection, dissemination of research results as well as education of graduates and undergraduate students with particular emphasis on minorities and underrepresented groups in science, engineering and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigations will lead to better protection systems for global and national energy supply routes, such as oil and gas pipelines against natural disasters and terrorist attacks; civilian and military vehicles against improvised explosive devices, and ship hulls in the event of an under or above water explosion. Polyurea-steel composite structural systems will offer the advantages of low cost, and easy implementation to new and existing structures. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from this project through participation in research activities and new courses. Graduate students will broaden their education by exposure to faculty, classes and facilities at the collaborating universities. Undergraduate students, with particular focus on minorities and underrepresented groups, will contribute to and gain from this project through programs already established at the participating universities.</AbstractNarration>
