    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0836700&lt;br/&gt;PI: Patrick H. Winston&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Lead&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop on International Strategy and Policy for Cyber Security&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is organizing a workshop to involve the community on research problems at the intersection of policy (International and associated with industry), individuals? privacy, and security. Future cyber threats are likely to come from nation states, terrorist organizations, organized crime, or adversaries bent on industrial espionage, all of who are likely to be well funded, aware of their targets? weaknesses, and cyber-intelligent. Defenses against attacks will be driven by the needs of the organizations the target of the attack, including Government and industry, but also must respect privacy needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop is to involve the communities concerned with security and privacy research, international policy (which will help determine the kinds of cyber defense needed), legal issues, economics (to help determine under what conditions security defense ? and privacy needs ? are likely to be implemented by industry). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the workshop will stimulate discussions and research on technological and diplomatic options for mitigating cyber threats and reducing security-related vulnerabilities.</AbstractNarration>
