    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The strong magnetoelectric coupling and the many recent breakthroughs in magnetoelectric composites comprising both ferri/ferromagnetic and ferroelectric phases have made this area extremely exciting. However, the magnetoelectric coupling is far from strong enough, particularly for the microwave magnetoelectric composites used in RF/microwave signal processing devices. This is due to the lack of a suitable microwave magnetic material with combined properties of low loss tangent at microwave frequencies, large magnetostriction constant and high permeability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purposes of this project are: (1) to investigate novel FeGaB microwave magnetic films with large magnetostriction constant and narrow ferromagnetic resonance linewidth; and (2) to explore novel tunable microwave magnetoelectric composite materials and devices with these FeGaB microwave magnetic films. This project will lead to a whole new class of highly magnetostrictive FeGaB microwave magnetic films and magnetoelectric composite materials, which will enable novel electrostatically tunable magnetoelectric signal processing devices critical for RF/microwave integrated circuits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The novel FeGaB films and FeGaB films based magnetoelectric composite materials and devices will lead to new functionalities on RF/microwave integrated circuits that ferroelectric or magnetic materials alone do not possess, and will have great impacts on many industries and on society. The education plan includes establishing the Magic of Magnetism program for the Museum of Science, Boston for informally educating the general public; and an extensive K ~ graduate education plan including graduate and undergraduate education, research experiences for undergraduates, high school students and teachers, emphasizing participation of underrepresented groups, particularly women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>
