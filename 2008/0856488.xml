    <AbstractNarration>The Effect of Surfaces on the Strength of Nanoscale Structures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration between an engineering and a chemistry laboratory will develop an understanding of fracture at the atomic scale using a newly developed technique capable of accurately measuring the strength of tiny (nanoscale) samples of material. Previous research by the collaborators has shown that a single layer of molecules can significantly improve the strength of nanoscale silicon beams, whereas atomic-scale roughness can lead to strength degradation. A combination of experiments and computer simulations will be used to understand the origins of these effects. This understanding will enable the development of chemical coatings and processes for the production of very strong and very stable nanometer-scale mechanical devices.&lt;br/&gt;By integrating research and education, this interdisciplinary project will educate undergraduate and graduate students in an area of increasing technological and economic importance the production of high strength, long-life micro- and nano-electromechanical devices (MEMS and NEMS) and will prepare these students for subsequent careers in education, industry and public service. The project will contribute to the advancement of technology by developing new commercially-viable processes. To attract more students to careers in science and technology, particularly students from traditionally underrepresented groups, members of the research team will participate in a variety of educational outreach activities to K-12 students and teachers. In addition to new activities, the researchers will continue their involvement with the Cornell Institute for Chemistry Teachers and Project High Jump two programs designed to improve high school education.</AbstractNarration>
