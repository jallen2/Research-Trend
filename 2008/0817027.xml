    <AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the economically important trout species and other associated freshwater fishes of Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental, an aquatic ecosystem that is home to at least 20% of the world's trout species, including the only trout species adapted to warmer temperatures. Preliminary work in this region suggests a high level of endemism, several new species unknown to science, and a high level of habitat destruction and species endangerment. The research will provide a complete faunal inventory of the ecosystem, formal descriptions of all newly described species, databasing of all new collections and associated ecological data, and dissemination of results through a new web system for research, training and education.&lt;br/&gt; Effective conservation and educational programs will involve local communities, teachers, and fish culture professionals, helping them to develop sustainable practices that do not destroy habitats and aquatic communities. New training activities will include a broad community of students (high school, college), as well as local citizens. Directors and scientists of the Mexican Fish Culture system, hatchery managers, and fish culture scientists will collaborate with U.S. scientists on this project. The comprehensive E-Life system developed in conjunction with this research will provide a worldwide educational platform for distributed learning environments in biodiversity, conservation, and ecology.</AbstractNarration>
