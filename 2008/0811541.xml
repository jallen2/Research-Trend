    <AbstractNarration>Proposal No.: 0811541&lt;br/&gt;Title: Model-based Test Generation for Embedded Software with Simulink/Stateflow or Hybrid Automata Models&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ratnesh Kumar and Changyan Zhou, Dept. of Elec. &amp; Comp. Eng., Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A model-based test generation approach for embedded software systems that are reactive (interact with their environment), possess hybrid behaviors (continuous dynamics mixed with switching logics), and can be modeled using Simulink/Stateflow or hybrid automata models, is proposed. Simulink/Stateflow is a graphical modeling, analysis, and simulation tool for embedded software development, and is widely used in industries such as automobile, aircraft, and medical devices. The intellectual merits of this research include: (i) Translation of Simulink/Stateflow models into hybrid automata models (to the extent possible), (ii) Test generation for hybrid systems based on discrete-behaviors preserving abstractions and system identification techniques, and (iii) Development of supporting software to be integrated with the Matlab Simulink/Stateflow environment. The proposed research is likely to have an impact in application domains where Simulink/Stateflow is routinely used for embedded software development. Some of the techniques developed as part of the project may find application in other areas such as verification or monitoring for fault identification. The project will support two new researchers who will be trained in model-based approaches to embedded software testing. The research outcomes, including software tools, will be made available through PIs' homepages and journal/conference publications. The PIs are committed to recruiting minority students for the project.</AbstractNarration>
