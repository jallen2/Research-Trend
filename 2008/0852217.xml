    <AbstractNarration>The main goal of the 2009 Gordon Conference on Coastal Circulation to be held in June 2009 at Colby-Sawyer College is to accelerate the rate of advance of understanding of coastal ocean circulation and to enhance the development of junior scholars. The intent is to bring together a diverse (in gender, seniority, race, geographic location) group of scholars to share the latest discoveries and theories in both formal presentation and informal settings. This conference series is widely held to be the most important meeting in the community. The Gordon Foundation is providing substantial cost sharing and infrastructure support and additional contributions are being solicited from other sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;A diverse organizing committee has identified the international leaders in the field to present critical summaries of a range of important problems and to highlight the latest developments. Inquisitive discussion leaders have also been recruited to provoke and moderate discussion among the participants. Almost a half of the conference time is allocated to informal interactions among participants. This format has proven to be very effective in meeting the objectives. The Conference Chair served as the Vice Chair and program committee in the previous meeting and is therefore has the experience to ensure the success of the upcoming meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The program committee has ensured that the invited speakers list includes members of groups traditionally under-represented in the field to provide role models and advice for junior scholars and students. The mix of formal and informal meetings in the program facilitates the exchange of ideas among people in different sub-areas of the field, geographic region, age etc. Past conferences have lead to the formation of new research collaborations. Among the most valuable outcomes of the conference is the establishment of relationships between senior scholars and students.</AbstractNarration>
