    <AbstractNarration>Quantum computers, if built, will have great impact on defense and&lt;br/&gt;commerce in the area of secure communication. They will also allow&lt;br/&gt;simulation of complex quantum systems, providing an important tool&lt;br/&gt;for nanotechnology. The principal challenge in actually building&lt;br/&gt;quantum computers is finding a way to tolerate imperfections. In&lt;br/&gt;fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), the faulty operations that&lt;br/&gt;cause computational errors must be used to detect and correct those&lt;br/&gt;errors. A radical approach to FTQC is to base the computational&lt;br/&gt;scheme on topology. Computation is performed by braiding&lt;br/&gt;topological structures; fault-tolerance arises naturally due to the&lt;br/&gt;invariance of large-scale topology to small, local distortions&lt;br/&gt;caused by random errors. Until recently, implementation of this&lt;br/&gt;rather abstract idea has demanded exotic, unobserved physical&lt;br/&gt;particles or unrealistically high-dimensional structures. However,&lt;br/&gt;it was recently shown that topological FTQC may be achieved in a&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional lattice of quantum bits in a scheme relying on a&lt;br/&gt;novel form of quantum entanglement called a cluster state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates the conversion of topological&lt;br/&gt;cluster-state-based FTQC into a realistic, scalable, solid-state&lt;br/&gt;hardware architecture. The particular hardware studied relies&lt;br/&gt;critically on computation via communication, enabling reasonably&lt;br/&gt;sized quantum processors to be connected to form quantum&lt;br/&gt;communication networks or large quantum multicomputers. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators experimentally develop semiconductor-based quantum&lt;br/&gt;memories in optical microcavities, optimized for quantum logic&lt;br/&gt;mediated by light in integrated optical waveguides. The research&lt;br/&gt;includes the development of experimental methods to fabricate and&lt;br/&gt;characterize large arrays of these qubits, while detecting and&lt;br/&gt;compensating for fabrication defects. These experimental efforts&lt;br/&gt;are supported by theoretical development of scalable, topologically&lt;br/&gt;fault-tolerant architectures designed around the observed hardware&lt;br/&gt;limitations.</AbstractNarration>
