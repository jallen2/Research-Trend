    <AbstractNarration>This interagency transfer to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supports a study by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on international transport of atmospheric pollution, including impacts on air quality and climate. This is a pressing issue for both atmospheric science and the regulatory community, with obvious international implications. We are now at a point where it is worthwhile to take stock of recent work in this area and to identify new areas of study in order to ensure future progress. This study is being supported by the EPA, NSF, NASA, and NOAA and will focus on intercontinental transport and chemical transformation. The need for this study was identified by the Air Quality Research Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council and agreed on by the participating agencies. This transfer covers one fifth of the cost of the NAS study, as agreed upon by all parties.</AbstractNarration>
