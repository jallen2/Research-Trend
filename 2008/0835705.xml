    <AbstractNarration>This exploratory project will restructure the Freshman Engineering Program (FEP) in the College of Engineering at the University of Cincinnati (UC) to include new approaches to teaching, emphasize engineering applications of material being taught concurrently in courses such as Calculus and Physics, and provide students with information regarding career opportunities in various fields of engineering through interaction with leading engineers from local industries. This is expected to increase the graduation rate of students in FEP. The effect of restructuring FEP will be evaluated by comparing the performance in Calculus and Physics of students who have participated in the restructured program with that of students who participated in FEP before the restructuring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a long-term program to transform undergraduate education in the College which will include formation of a Department of Engineering Education (DEE) to lead and coordinate undergraduate education in the College, especially during the critical first two years. The results of this project will help determine the effect that teaching methods, advising, and mentoring have on retention to graduation and on performance in the workplace for students at UC. The knowledge and methods developed will help address the growing need for engineers in Ohio and in the nation.</AbstractNarration>
