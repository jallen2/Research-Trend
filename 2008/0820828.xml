    <AbstractNarration>DNA sequence is the primary means by which information is propagated from generation to generation. However, information can also be propagated as chemical modifications of both DNA and proteins, such as histones, that are associated with DNA. Heritable variation not associated with changes in the primary DNA sequence is called epigenetic variation. What makes epigenetic variation particularly intriguing is that it involves changes that can be both heritable and reversible. The rules governing how and why those changes occur remain poorly understood. Transposons, or "jumping genes", exhibit an extraordinary degree of easily identifiable epigenetic variation, making them ideal models for understanding its causes and consequences. Among transposons, Mutator elements in maize have proved to be particularly useful. Using a series of genetic resources, particularly a maize line that carries a single active Mutator transposon, it has been possible to induce and propagate a wide variety of distinct epigenetic states. The goal of this project is to determine the molecular correlates to each of these states. Particular emphasis will be placed on the ways in which epigenetic states can change over time, either over the course of the development of an individual plant, or over the course of multiple generations. These data are meant to complement global analysis of DNA and histone modification by providing functional assessments of particular patterns of these modifications in the context of a well-defined model system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A sophisticated understanding of the means by which epigenetic information is retained, stored, inherited and altered has implications for fields as diverse as development, ecology, human disease and evolutionary theory. In addition, because the Mutator system is a primary means by which genes are mutated in maize, an ability to modulate Mutator activity will benefit the entire maize community. Material and information having to do with the use of Mu killer will be made freely available via web sites (http://tinyurl.com/6xftvh and http://tinyurl.com/59fdwo), the Maize Newsletter and the Maize Cooperation Stock Center. The project will benefit from participation in project SEED, a program designed to expose historically under-represented high school students to research environments. Through a collaboration with Berkeley High School, the project will also host two students as interns each summer. Each student will work in close collaboration with the primary investigator on a specific problem, and each will present the results of their work at the end of each field season.</AbstractNarration>
