    <AbstractNarration>This project, administered through a chemistry and biochemistry department, provides a scholarship program for annual cohorts of up to 20 academically talented undergraduates who are pursuing baccalaureate degrees in closely allied biology, chemistry, and engineering disciplines. Program functions are to: 1) increase the number of STEM graduates from underrepresented groups, 2) decrease time-to-degree, and 3) provide support services that improve retention of students to degree achievement and placement in STEM careers. The program addresses the first two years of the college curriculum as a foundation for retention of students in STEM disciplines and for further academic success by providing enhanced mentoring, a coherent suite of student support services based around a Living Learning Community, and multiple opportunities for interactions with research active faculty and alumni. In addition, it fosters enhanced involvement of scholars in experiential learning programs (such as undergraduate research and internships) that provide them with the skills, experiences, and motivations needed to succeed in college and to enter productive, sustainable and rewarding careers in STEM disciplines. A broader goal of the program is to create and document the effectiveness of a scalable and transferable paradigm for the education of tomorrow's leaders in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
