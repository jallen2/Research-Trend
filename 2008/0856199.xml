    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bulk metallic glasses, which can be formed at cooling rates similar to those used for common silicate glasses, are of significant basic and practical interest. The liquids that form these glasses contain short-range order that generally increases significantly upon cooling below the equilibrium melting temperature (supercooling). This evolving order can couple to the nucleation barrier for the crystal phase, helping to stabilize the supercooled liquid against crystallization, making glass formation easier. Icosahedral short-range order is frequently dominant in transition metal liquids and underlies the glass transition in some Zr-based glasses. However, it is clear that different types of short-range order are dominant in other metallic liquids, raising the question of what underlies glass formation and the glass transition in those cases. Also, there are suggestions of maxima in the specific heat of many metallic-glass-forming liquids, and in some cases sudden changes in density have also been noted on supercooling. The origin of these phenomena is unclear. They may signal the onset of mode coupling, indicate a liquid/liquid phase transition, or correspond to a fragile-to-strong transition. Whether such anomalies in the liquid are a common feature of all bulk-metallic-glass-forming liquids is unknown. To address these and related questions, structural measurements will be made at multiple length scales in select bulk metallic glasses by high-q x-ray diffraction, fluctuation electron microscopy and 3d atom probe studies. Also, high-q diffraction and thermophysical property measurements will be made on liquids that form these glasses, using a new electrostatic levitation facility that has been constructed at Washington University in St. Louis. These data will be correlated with glass formation and crystallization kinetics and the results of TEM-based studies of the time-dependent nucleation rates. The results of these studies will lead to a deeper understanding of the relations between the structures of metallic liquids and glasses and phase transitions, including crystal nucleation and the glass transition. The insight gained will lead to methods for improved control of glass formation and microstructure development during glass crystallization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In crystals the atoms are arranged in regular patterns that repeat over long distances, while only local ordering among neighboring atoms occurs in liquids and glasses. Traditional glasses, such as window glass, contain atoms such as silicon and oxygen. Recently, glasses made entirely of metal atoms, which can be formed and blown into intricate shapes like traditional glasses, have been discovered. These metallic glasses are stronger and more corrosion resistant than the widely used crystalline metals. However, the reasons for metallic glass formation and the atomic structures of the glasses are poorly understood. To address these questions, we will make measurements of the structures and physical properties of select metallic liquids and glasses. These data will be correlated with glass formation. Glass crystallization during heating, which frequently produces composite materials with even superior properties, will also be studied. This investigation will give a deeper understanding of the relations between the liquids and glasses, and will lead to improved methods for glass formation and crystallization control. The research will provide valuable training for graduate and undergraduate students. The principal investigator will incorporate this research into presentations given to local schools, and will offer opportunities for high school students to visit and work in his lab, exposing those students to the exciting possibilities of a career in the science of materials.</AbstractNarration>
