    <AbstractNarration>0827133&lt;br/&gt;Grindlay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is for a U.S.-Egypt Workshop entitled "US-Egypt Workshop on Frontiers in High Energy Astrophysics from Neutron Stars to Gamma-ray Bursts" to be held in Alexandria, Egypt, August 24-30, 2008. The U.S organizer is Dr. Jonathan Grindlay, Department of Astronomy, Harvard University. The Egyptian co-organizer is Dr. Alaa Ibrahim, Cairo University, Egypt. The Workshop will bring together astrophysicists from the US, Middle East, North Africa, and neighboring Mediterranean countries to meet and discuss the new developments in the neutron star and gamma-ray burst fields, to expose and retrain junior researchers and students on new research trends and results, and to initiate collaborative projects of mutual interest between US and regional scientists. The workshop will serve as a platform to conduct a set of invited lectures on frontier topics on Neutron Stars (NSs) and Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) and will also provide an opportunity for young researchers to present and discuss their work with senior scientists in order to foster exchange of ideas. Key topics to be discussed include: neutron star structure, spin and magnetic field evolution as deduced from NSs in a variety of astrophysical settings; NS mergers in short GRBs; the NS-black hole interface and distinctions as revealed by accretion vs. jet dominated systems; and understanding GRBs to enable their use as probes of the high-z Universe. The over-arching goal is to bring together senior and junior members of the NS and GRB communities for joint discussion and interactions to facilitate new understanding and to develop collaborative research and education programs in high energy astrophysics. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Neutron stars are the most exotic astrophysical forms of matter, and Gamma-ray bursts the most energetic single events, that can be directly studied. They are both prime examples of how research in high energy astrophysics is undergoing significant development and expansion, both on the theoretical and observational fronts. The National Academy of Sciences has recognized the frontiers in astrophysics in its reports Astrophysics in the New Millennium (2001) and Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos: Eleven Science Questions for the New Century (2003). The Workshop program will relate to many of these central questions as they are further defined for the coming Decade. The Workshop will be of particular usefulness to junior researchers. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The Workshop will broaden the depth and breadth of the participation and involvement of scientists from the region who are generally under-represented. It will also promote the participation of minorities, women, and graduate students, and junior scientists (from the US &amp; the region) to facilitate ongoing and future collaboration with senior researchers. The talks will be digitally video-taped and made available on a DVD to be distributed separately with the published (by AIP) proceedings to regional and US universities and research institutions. An online version will be made available from the Workshop website for a broader audience. Furthermore, since the advanced IT tools in astrophysics research are becoming increasingly important also in many other fields, e.g., engineering, business, and finance, this international workshop will have spin-off effects by enhancing the scientific profile of the regional countries. Six junior U.S. scientists and 3 U.S. graduate students will be supported for participating in this workshop. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
