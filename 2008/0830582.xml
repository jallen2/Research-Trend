    <AbstractNarration>Solvent interactions play a critical role in determining the structure and&lt;br/&gt;function of biomolecular systems. However, accurate modeling is a challenging&lt;br/&gt;task due to long-range correlations and vast numbers of solvent atoms and ions.&lt;br/&gt;For very large systems, one method for reducing this expense is the application&lt;br/&gt;of an implicit solvent model which replaces the explicit atoms and ions with a&lt;br/&gt;dielectric continuum. One of the more accurate implicit solvent models is&lt;br/&gt;described by a generalized Poisson equation or Poisson-Boltzmann equation with&lt;br/&gt;point charge source terms. Although the generalized Poisson approach is&lt;br/&gt;considered in very many cases to be sufficiently accurate, most current methods&lt;br/&gt;for approximating its solution have been deemed prohibitively expensive for&lt;br/&gt;very large systems and for applications requiring rapid repetitive evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project centers on the creation and analysis of algorithms of unsurpassed&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness for approximating the solution to the generalized Poisson&lt;br/&gt;equation (GPE) and its extensions. The approach involves solving for an&lt;br/&gt;"effective charge distribution" given by the Laplacian of the solution&lt;br/&gt;to the GPE. The corresponding electrostatic potential can be recovered using&lt;br/&gt;a fast N-body solver. Broader impact of this project will be realized through&lt;br/&gt;the incorporation of novel algorithms in simulation software. Better methods&lt;br/&gt;and software in the hands of scientists will enable biomolecular simulation of&lt;br/&gt;much larger systems with improved accuracy which will result in contributions&lt;br/&gt;to society. In addition, this project provides an opportunity for a graduate&lt;br/&gt;student to engage in research that spans computer science, physical science,&lt;br/&gt;and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
