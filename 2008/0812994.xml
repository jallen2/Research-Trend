    <AbstractNarration>0812994&lt;br/&gt;Wojciechowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research conducted by Mr. Farruggia under the direction of Dr. Wojciechowski of Arizona State University, will investigate the contribution of morphology, ecological habitat selection, and biogeography to the evolution of an economically important legume, Sesbania (Leguminosae). Research will be conducted in Argentina and Paraguay in collaboration with the National University of Rosario in Argentina under the auspices of Dr. Darien Prado. This study will provide key information on the distinctive morphology, ecology, and biogeography of Sesbania and a framework for comparison to related legumes. Specific research goals include a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of Sesbania based on morphological data and molecular markers, testing of dispersal history and key morphological innovations, and the production of a monograph. Outcomes produced from this comprehensive analysis of Sesbania will provide novel datasets for testing current hypotheses of the evolutionary history and biogeography of Sesbania and its nearest relatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study provides the opportunity to expand collaborative ties with botanical institutions in northern Argentina and Paraguay, a geographic region with high legume diversity. The research will provide fundamental knowledge for further economic development of Sesbania and will explore how the floristic composition of the legume will respond to climate change. This proposal will support international dissertation research for one graduate student and will also provide a research opportunity for an undergraduate student.</AbstractNarration>
