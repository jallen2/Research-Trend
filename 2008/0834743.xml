    <AbstractNarration>CSR-DMSS, SM: Design and Evaluation of a Scalable Meta-Event&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Event dissemination systems offer a powerful middleware for&lt;br/&gt;distributed applications such as electronic trading platforms, news&lt;br/&gt;aggregators, and network intrusion detection systems. Such systems are&lt;br/&gt;usually based on the publish-subscribe paradigm: published events are&lt;br/&gt;delivered to clients who have a supplied a matching&lt;br/&gt;subscription. While most current publish-subscribe systems support&lt;br/&gt;subscriptions that evaluate to true/false on a per-event basis,&lt;br/&gt;emerging applications need support for subscriptions to higher level&lt;br/&gt;"meta-events", which correspond to combinations of basic events. The&lt;br/&gt;challenge in tracking such subscriptions is that there is no single&lt;br/&gt;event, when processed in isolation, permits the evaluation of a&lt;br/&gt;subscription to true or false.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project designs, implements and evaluates an event dissemination&lt;br/&gt;system that supports tracking of meta-events. The system converts&lt;br/&gt;user-defined subscriptions into "triggers", and efficiently maintains&lt;br/&gt;the state of the triggers using algorithms inspired by the literature&lt;br/&gt;on data stream processing. The system scales with increasing numbers&lt;br/&gt;of subscriptions through merging triggers by identifying commonalities&lt;br/&gt;between them, and through indexing triggers for fast detection of&lt;br/&gt;matching subscriptions for events. The system is evaluated using an&lt;br/&gt;internet-scale testbed, such as Planetlab. Such a meta-event&lt;br/&gt;dissemination system will provide a more expressive interface to the&lt;br/&gt;designer of distributed and web applications, thus transforming the&lt;br/&gt;way in which distributed applications are authored. This is expected&lt;br/&gt;to impact the application of information technology in various fields&lt;br/&gt;such as healthcare, finance, and security. The project enhances&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate education through strengthening the&lt;br/&gt;freshmen engineering course in Electrical and Computer Engineering and&lt;br/&gt;through developing a strong algorithmic foundation for research&lt;br/&gt;students in networking and distributed computing.</AbstractNarration>
