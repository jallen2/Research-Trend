    <AbstractNarration>Next generation wireless networks will focus on the open &lt;br/&gt;wireless architecture platform. In such a network, heterogeneous &lt;br/&gt;wireless systems will be integrated to provide reliable, &lt;br/&gt;high-bandwidth, on-demand services with performance guarantees &lt;br/&gt;to a variety of users with di®erent tra±c characteristics, &lt;br/&gt;security requirement, and hardware capabilities. This SGER &lt;br/&gt;project is exploring three key issues in the resource management &lt;br/&gt;of such systems. First, utility-based model is investigated to&lt;br/&gt;deal with access selection and vertical handover decisions in &lt;br/&gt;which policies governing the network operations are embodied &lt;br/&gt;in the design of marginal utility functions. Second, a &lt;br/&gt;utility-based QoS enabling scheduling model is developed in &lt;br/&gt;which the utility at a given moment can re°ect the received &lt;br/&gt;productivity of the system in the long term run and scheduling &lt;br/&gt;decisions to deal with multiple QoS parameters are made using &lt;br/&gt;reinforcement learning. Third, an integrated model that measures&lt;br/&gt;security overheads experienced by security-critical tasks and is &lt;br/&gt;applicable to the security-aware admission control is developed. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on the development of solutions &lt;br/&gt;that are critical for next generation wireless and mobile &lt;br/&gt;communication networking systems. Written reports of research &lt;br/&gt;findings will be disseminated through academic publications.</AbstractNarration>
