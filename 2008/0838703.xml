    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0838703&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Robion C. Kirby, Peter Teichner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment&lt;br/&gt;Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators (Robion Kirby and Peter Teichner),&lt;br/&gt;with the cooperation of the other senior personnel (Professors&lt;br/&gt;Ian Agol, Robert Bryant, Michael Hutchings, Vaughan Jones, John&lt;br/&gt;Lott, Constantin Teleman, and Alan Weinstein), propose to&lt;br/&gt;establish a research training group of undergraduates, graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, postdoctoral fellows, and senior faculty at the UC&lt;br/&gt;Berkeley mathematics department in the areas of geometry,&lt;br/&gt;topology and operator algebras. The objectives are to improve&lt;br/&gt;the recruitment of undergraduates into graduate studies in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, and the training of graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellows, by establishing a strong, coherent&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary group in the above areas. These areas are&lt;br/&gt;coherent in that they have at their center problems and methods&lt;br/&gt;from mathematical physics, such as the count of pseudoholomorphic&lt;br/&gt;curves to calculate Seiberg-Witten and Heegaard-Floer invariants&lt;br/&gt;of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, or the use of Ricci flow for&lt;br/&gt;understanding smooth manifolds, or the use of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;notions of quantum field theories to describe interesting&lt;br/&gt;algebraic topology, like elliptic cohomology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major difficulty for young people entering research in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics today is the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of&lt;br/&gt;the subject and the range of technical tools required.&lt;br/&gt;Traditional seminar formats are becoming less effective at&lt;br/&gt;training. We will work with the existing strong programs of the&lt;br/&gt;mathematics department to create a series of new and restructured&lt;br/&gt;activities, ranging from the undergraduate level to advanced&lt;br/&gt;research. These will include undergraduate research seminars&lt;br/&gt;during the school year led by graduate students under the&lt;br/&gt;supervision of senior faculty, undergraduate and graduate summer&lt;br/&gt;workshops, elementary level graduate student seminars, a hot&lt;br/&gt;topic seminar, and a weekly joint research seminar in which&lt;br/&gt;each research talk is preceded by a background lecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas of geometry, topology and operator algebras covered in&lt;br/&gt;this proposal are central to mathematics and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physics. UC Berkeley has an exceptional group of faculty in this&lt;br/&gt;area, and a long history of successfully training graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students. However, these subjects have grown more&lt;br/&gt;and more interdisciplinary requiring graduate students to know&lt;br/&gt;much more than in the past, and more guidance is required of&lt;br/&gt;senior mathematicians. To improve the training of graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdocs, they should also improve the quality of&lt;br/&gt;research that they produce. The cross-group interaction will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate a number of interdisciplinary research projects that&lt;br/&gt;we intend to pursue, including: Elliptic cohomology and quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theory, K-theory and topological field theories,&lt;br/&gt;Semi-infinite aspect of elliptic cohomology, and Four-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;field theories.</AbstractNarration>
