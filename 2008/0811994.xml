    <AbstractNarration>Link analysis algorithms leverage hyperlinks created by authors as &lt;br/&gt;semantic endorsements between pages, while social bookmarks provide a &lt;br/&gt;way to leverage annotations by information consumers as a source of &lt;br/&gt;information about pages. This project explores a novel approach that &lt;br/&gt;is a synergy of the two: soliciting annotations from users about the &lt;br/&gt;content of pages, in a way that implicitly forms networks of &lt;br/&gt;relationships between and among resources and tags. These socially &lt;br/&gt;generated relationships are then aggregated to build bottom-up, &lt;br/&gt;global semantic similarity networks. Algorithms are developed to &lt;br/&gt;construct, analyze, and mine these networks in support of search and &lt;br/&gt;recommendation applications, exploratory navigation interfaces, &lt;br/&gt;resource management utilities, tag spam detection, and incentive &lt;br/&gt;games to accelerate the achievement of critical mass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To extrapolate both annotations about content (tags) and semantic &lt;br/&gt;relationships (similarity) from single users to the ``wisdom of the &lt;br/&gt;crowd,'' the project investigates an information-theoretic model that &lt;br/&gt;extracts semantic assessments from information structures that many &lt;br/&gt;users are already maintaining, namely the bookmarks and tags they &lt;br/&gt;manage on their browsers or online. This entails the design and &lt;br/&gt;evaluation of several network-based measures and algorithms, such as &lt;br/&gt;similarity, novelty, centrality, and focus. Among the aims of this &lt;br/&gt;model are the exploration of the duality between resources (URLs) and &lt;br/&gt;concepts (tags or categories) and the integration of social &lt;br/&gt;annotation and collaborative filtering. One way to provide users with &lt;br/&gt;immediate value is to integrate client-based taxonomies and server- &lt;br/&gt;based folksonomies for social bookmark management. Both traditional &lt;br/&gt;users of browser bookmarks and social users of online bookmarks can &lt;br/&gt;take advantage of the same semantic maps while retaining the &lt;br/&gt;convenience of intuitive browser interfaces and centralized storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information about the project can &lt;br/&gt;be found at http://GiveALink.org.</AbstractNarration>
