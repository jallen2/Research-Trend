    <AbstractNarration>Migration and storage of melts in the deep interior of the Earth is largely controlled by the microscopic structure of the rocks. In partially molten rocks, melt is distributed in nanometer to micron-sized pockets and tubules along corners and edges of the mineral grains in the rock. The shape, distribution, and connectivity of these melt-rich pockets and tubules determine the rate and direction of melt transport through the rock. The area fraction of the grain surface wetted by the melt tubules and pockets controls a large number of physical properties, including the seismic signature of the partially molten rock. This project will lead to the development of a theoretical framework for quantifying the shape and distribution of the melt tubules and melt pockets in a partially molten rock. The analytical and numerical tools developed in this project will identify the forces that control the melt geometry, predict the redistribution of melt tubules and melt pockets in partially molten rocks in response to the forces of deformation, and use the observed seismic signature of the so-called ultra low velocity zones to infer the extent of melting and melt storage in the deep interior of the Earth.</AbstractNarration>
