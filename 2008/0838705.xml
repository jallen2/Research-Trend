    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: EMSW21-MCTP Mathematical &amp; Theoretical Biology Institute Undergraduate Research Program &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute (MTBI) for undergraduate research was established in 1996. The objectives of the Mathematical &amp; Theoretical Biology Institute (MTBI) Undergraduate Research Program are to encourage and facilitate the access to and the successful completion of graduate studies by mostly under-represented minority students in mathematics and science. The MTBI Summer Program at Arizona State University exposes undergraduates to scientific research by letting them address relevant questions in theoretical biology. The consecutive summer research experiences take place at Arizona State University and lasts 8 weeks. Students receive four weeks of intensive training in mathematical and computational techniques in order to develop and carry out their own research projects during the remainder of the program. The research experience ends with the completion of a formal research paper and public oral and poster presentations of students? findings.&lt;br/&gt;Supporting an environment in which high quality undergraduate research is recognized and expected (MTBI technical reports provide the best examples. Since 1996 MTBI students have produced 120 papers some of which have been published in peer reviewed journals (abstracts and last five years of papers available through our website - http://mtbi.asu.edu/Research.html). MTBI students typically present their work at national conferences. MTBI provides its alumni continued academic encouragement and support throughout their graduate studies and afterwards. Since the program?s inception 153 US alumni have pursued advanced degrees, and 110 (87 URM) have or are pursuing PhDs; 79 (68 URM) have received advanced degrees and 25 (21 URM) have received PhD?s. MTBI?s summer research activities have been supported with grants from the National Science Foundation and from grants from the National Security Agency. Substantial additional support comes from Arizona State University and from the Sloan Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
