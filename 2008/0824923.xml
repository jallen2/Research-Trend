    <AbstractNarration>U.S-Germany Dissertation Enhancement: Supramolecular Structures Based on Photo-Reactive Cationic Surfactants and Polyelectrolytes&lt;br/&gt;0824923&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transformative impact of ionic liquids has evolved from simple ?green? solvents as replacements for volatile organic solvents to commercially viable technologies ranging from electro-active devices to efficient catalysts. Ionic liquids have emerged as a platform for future technologies, and ionic liquids are now integral components in electromechanical transducers and high-performance membranes for alternate energy. Macromolecules that are derived from ionic liquid precursors enable the introduction of unprecedented charged units and counterions into a myriad of electro-active devices. A multidisciplinary research team is critical to fundamentally understand the structure-property-performance relationships for future technologies containing ionic liquids. The diverse chemical structure of ionic liquids offers an expanded toolbox of building blocks for novel macromolecular architecture. Structural characterization will reside at the boundaries of traditional academic disciplines and requires expertise in diverse strategies ranging from aqueous size-exclusion chromatography and solution rheology to solid state morphology. Collaboration among Professor Timothy E. Long and Mr. Matthew Hunley at Virginia Tech with the research group of Professor Axel H.E. Müller at Universität Bayreuth in Germany will uniquely assemble the synthetic and characterization expertise required to answer these fundamental questions. The proposed Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project will focus on the synthesis and preliminary characterization of photo-reactive cationic polyelectrolytes and polymerizable cationic amphiphiles. Photo-reactive cationic polyelectrolytes and amphiphiles are proposed to form tailored supramolecular assemblies for functional applications, such as cylindrical ?tubular? micelles and ion channels. The influence of macromolecular topology on the ability of polyelectrolytes and amphiphilic ionic liquid polymers to form functional nanometer-scale scaffolds will also be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration between Virginia Tech and the Universität Bayreuth connects internationally-renowned scientists and world-class characterization facilities and expertise not found at a single university. It will fund Matthew Hunley, a U.S. graduate student, to spend one semester in Bayreuth conducting research with the team led by Axel Müller. The collaboration bridges the two international groups to enable cross-cultural interaction and idea exchange, as well as fosters long-term research collaborations between the two groups. The studies will provide fundamental scientific knowledge, and integrated societal impact will focus on smarter, ?greener? electromechanical devices and high-performance membranes for electronic and biomedical applications.</AbstractNarration>
