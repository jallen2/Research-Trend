    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to first design efficient very large-scale integrated (VLSI) system architectures for algebraic soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoders. Then, through studying how the architectures change with design parameters, further optimizations will be carried out to develop a unified framework for the VLSI design of algebraic soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoders. The approach is to optimize the decoding algorithms and VLSI architectures interactively, such that the most efficient decoder architecture can be designed for given application requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the proposed research serves as a bridge connecting advanced theory and practice. The key potential for innovation in this research is the delicate interplay among algorithmic transformations and novel VLSI design techniques. Unlike traditional design approaches in which the VLSI architectures are determined by the algorithms, interactive algorithmic and architectural optimizations will be employed. Particularly, the feedback from the VLSI design level to the algorithmic level are critical to achieving the most efficient designs and developing an optimized framework. Addressing the challenging tasks in this project requires combined expertise in coding theory, digital communications and VLSI design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impacts, the proposed research could potentially revolutionize digital communication and storage systems. The design techniques to be developed can be also extrapolated to the implementation of other advanced algorithms. The proposed research will be integrated into education through developing dynamic course work, involving both undergraduate and graduate students in research, and promoting engineering to middle and high school students. In addition, the participation of students from underrepresented groups in engineering will be increased by recruiting and retaining women.</AbstractNarration>
