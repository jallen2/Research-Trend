    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests funding to provide partial support for the ?GEOSS Workshop XXIII: Science Modeling and Data Policy,? that will be held in Quebec City, Canada in September 2008. The themes of the workshop are large-scale coupled models, data assimilation, and data access for GEOSS. This workshop is organized by the IEEE Committee on Earth Observations (ICEO) as part of an on-going international series of GEOSS workshops focusing on sciences themes pertinent to GEOSS. The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is a complex system of sensors, communication devices, storage systems, computational and other devices used in concert to observe the Earth and eventually come to a better understanding of the Earth?s processes. In addition, GEOSS will include models and processes to create information from the observations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of this GEOSS workshop will be available globally, both in direct publications (issued on the internet for free global access) and in the impact that the workshop will have on GEO tasks. The activity will also serve to connect the engineering community more closely with the Earth science modeling and Earth data user communities, thus enhancing an important three-way partnership necessary to see the maximum benefits from Earth observations.</AbstractNarration>
