    <AbstractNarration>As a means to enhance technological literacy, attract more young people to careers in engineering and contribute to the sustainment of the national capacity for technological innovation, the Center for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering Education (CASEE) of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) seeks to increase public awareness of the role of engineering. Specifically, this project builds upon prior experience with previous workshops that have explored the representations of engineers and engineering in films and television in order to advance the implementation of a "prime-time" commercial television series that highlights the positive roles of engineers in modern society. This project will plan, organize, and convene a forum wherein 12 experienced producers, writers, and directors will devote one and one-half days to discussion of key questions which will determine the viability of attaining an engineering focused narrative television series.</AbstractNarration>
