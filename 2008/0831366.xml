    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: CT-ISG: Collaborative Research: Key Generation from Physical&lt;br/&gt;Layer Characteristics in Wireless Networks&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 08/05/08&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development of a new class of secret key generation and&lt;br/&gt;renewal algorithms for securing wireless networks by taking advantage of physical&lt;br/&gt;layer characteristics. The basis of the approach is the identification of measurable&lt;br/&gt;quantities of the wireless channel between a pair of nodes that are highly correlated&lt;br/&gt;exclusively between them (albeit not identical). Capitalizing on this correlation, the&lt;br/&gt;project develops algorithms for obtaining a shared key under various adversarial&lt;br/&gt;models.&lt;br/&gt;This addresses a critical problem area as the broadcast nature of a wireless link&lt;br/&gt;provides a natural eavesdropping and intervention capability to an adversary and thus it&lt;br/&gt;follows that securing a wireless link is essential to the security of any wireless network.&lt;br/&gt;This project undertakes the design, implementation, analysis and testing of several&lt;br/&gt;protocols and clarifies the relationship between the channel characteristics and the&lt;br/&gt;cryptographic protocols that use them. It also investigates the trade-offs between&lt;br/&gt;computational and communication costs, and quantifies the level of security achieved&lt;br/&gt;by the key generation and renewal protocols assuming various adversarial models.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project is in the potential of making wireless communications&lt;br/&gt;more secure while avoiding costs (both computational and organizational) of&lt;br/&gt;cryptography. Given the increased wireless internetworking and the multitude of&lt;br/&gt;wireless enabled devices presently carried by an average user, the security of the&lt;br/&gt;wireless link becomes one of the most critical aspects of securing computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;The reduction in the computation also will translate to a reduction in energy use,&lt;br/&gt;important to battery or alternative powered systems. Educationally, the project will&lt;br/&gt;present an attractive combination of aspects of signal processing, computer security,&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and cryptography and will offer a wealth of problems for student engagement</AbstractNarration>
