    <AbstractNarration>This project is a three-year partnership between the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC) and two discipline-based organizations, the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC/PTEC, an effort of the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers) and the American Chemical Society. The project vision is the creation of a large and enduring national network of colleges and universities that have successfully negotiated difficult institutional constraints to establish strong, effective, and well-sustained high school teacher preparation programs in science and mathematics - programs that respond successfully to the need for accomplished science and mathematics teachers in their states and throughout the country. Core objectives of the work are to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; a. Create and support a national leadership network from up to 50 institutions of presidents, chancellors, provosts and their designees who are active at their institutions in improving mathematics and science education - and especially teacher education;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; b. Increase the number of disciplinary faculty who are contributing toward teacher preparation and who, through inter-departmental, inter-college and school-university partnerships, assume increased responsibility for the mentoring and induction of beginning teachers and the professional development of career teachers;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; c. Address and make demonstrable progress toward overcoming the challenges that impede the ability of universities to strengthen their science teacher preparation programs; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; d. Widely disseminate the results and lessons learned from this and other related projects, especially the lessons learned about: (1) changes in institutional policies and practices that enhance science teacher preparation programs and increase the participation of disciplinary faculty; (2) the programmatic features of exemplary science teacher preparation programs, (3) the features of successful Noyce Scholarship Programs; (4) securing the ongoing and active commitment of top institutional leadership to making teacher preparation - particularly in science and mathematics - a central university enterprise; (5) the role of the disciplinary societies in strengthening science teacher preparation and in the support of practicing teachers; and (6) state policy efforts that can facilitate improvement of science teacher preparation and that remove the disincentive for pursuing a career in teaching; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; e. Provide support to the national networks of MSP and Noyce Scholarship programs, facilitating communication across these and other networks of science and mathematics education programs.</AbstractNarration>
