    <AbstractNarration>The grant proposal describes several directions of&lt;br/&gt;research to be undertaken by Jay Jorgenson and his co-authors&lt;br/&gt;which, somewhat generally, build on his prior investigation of&lt;br/&gt;number theoretic applications of heat kernel and heat kernel&lt;br/&gt;analysis. Previous work by Jorgenson with J\"urg Kramer focus on&lt;br/&gt;analytic aspects of Arakelov theory. Continuing this work,&lt;br/&gt;Jorgenson and Kramer recently established a relation between&lt;br/&gt;certain L-functions attached to non-holomorphic Maass forms and&lt;br/&gt;L-functions attached to holomorphic forms of weight two. Part of&lt;br/&gt;the proposed research describes work to be carried out by&lt;br/&gt;Jorgenson and Kramer which studies the application of their&lt;br/&gt;L-function relation to questions involving bounds of Fourier&lt;br/&gt;coefficients of Maass forms. Additionally, the Jorgenson and&lt;br/&gt;Kramer collaboration has resulted in projects involving the&lt;br/&gt;inter-relations between hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic&lt;br/&gt;Eisenstein series. The research proposal describes a number of&lt;br/&gt;problems which remain in this direction. In collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;Gautam Chinta and Anders Karlsson, Jorgenson has initiated a&lt;br/&gt;program of study of heat kernels and analytic number theory&lt;br/&gt;associated to totally disconnected spaces, including discrete tori&lt;br/&gt;and Cayley graphs associated to finite groups. The proposal&lt;br/&gt;outlines further questions to be investigated by Jorgenson in his&lt;br/&gt;joint research efforts with Chinta and Karlsson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heat kernel, and heat kernel analysis, is present&lt;br/&gt;in many areas of mathematics and related fields. For example, one&lt;br/&gt;component of the joint research undertaken by Chinta, Jorgenson&lt;br/&gt;and Karlsson is to study determinants of certain matrices&lt;br/&gt;associated to graphs associated to finite groups. Going back as&lt;br/&gt;far as Kirckhoff in 1847, connections have been known which&lt;br/&gt;establish relations between these determinants and other&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, such as electrical engineering and chemistry. More&lt;br/&gt;recently, one can say that a considerable amount of financial&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and financial engineering is built on heat kernel&lt;br/&gt;analysis. In addition to specific research problems posed by&lt;br/&gt;Jorgenson which relate to finance, his teaching duties include&lt;br/&gt;curricular development activities involving financial engineering&lt;br/&gt;and bio-statistics courses, all of which benefit from Jorgenson's&lt;br/&gt;research program. Finally, the proposal describes a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;problems which are assessable to students of many levels, ranging&lt;br/&gt;from advanced undergraduate students to recent Ph.D.'s.</AbstractNarration>
