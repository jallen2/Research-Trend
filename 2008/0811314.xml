    <AbstractNarration>In its broad outlines, the research program of the P.I. aims at the&lt;br/&gt;development, analysis and computer implementation of numerical methods designed&lt;br/&gt;to approximate the solutions of some partial differential equations (pde's)&lt;br/&gt;that have important applications in the fields of engineering and physics. The&lt;br/&gt;Discontinuous Galerkin method constitutes the core methodology of this&lt;br/&gt;effort. The ultimate goal of the research is to make full use of this method&lt;br/&gt;to develop convergent and efficient adaptive methods designed to reduce the&lt;br/&gt;run time of the algorithms by finding optimal or quasi-optimal meshes. Other&lt;br/&gt;efforts will be directed towards the development of domain decomposition and&lt;br/&gt;multigrid algorithm for the fast solution of the resulting systems of equations&lt;br/&gt;on single as well as multiprocessor computers.&lt;br/&gt;The P.I. will develop methods and adaptive algorithms for second and fourth&lt;br/&gt;order elliptic problems, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the&lt;br/&gt;Cahn-Hilliard equations and use them to simulate phenomena&lt;br/&gt;modeled by these equations. Adaptive methods will also be used to simulate&lt;br/&gt;finite-time blowup of nonlinear evolution equations. Some areas of&lt;br/&gt;applications are chemical reactions where the geometry of the domain plays an&lt;br/&gt;important role and the simulation of tumor growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific computing is playing an increasingly important role in the progress&lt;br/&gt;of Science as a cost effective alternative to "real life" experiments which&lt;br/&gt;could be very costly, say wind tunnel experiments in aircraft design, or even&lt;br/&gt;impossible to duplicate, such as supernova explosions and other astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. It is worth mention that numerical simulations are playing a crucial&lt;br/&gt;role in the identification of the potential effects of global warming. The U.S.&lt;br/&gt;government, through its various funding agencies, has made important investments&lt;br/&gt;by the creation of supercomputing centers equipped with the latest&lt;br/&gt;generation of massively parallel computers. To extract the full power of these&lt;br/&gt;machines, with some having tens of thousands of individual processors, efficient&lt;br/&gt;and "scalable" methods and algorithms must be developed to keep pace with the&lt;br/&gt;advances in hardware. Indeed, most current algorithms fall short of harnessing&lt;br/&gt;the full power of these computers especially when the number of processors&lt;br/&gt;exceeds a few thousand. The Discontinuous Galerkin method is a recently&lt;br/&gt;introduced methodology with great potential and wide applicability. Its many&lt;br/&gt;attributes include flexibility, ability to handle complex geometries and&lt;br/&gt;scalability. Further understanding of this approach and the development of&lt;br/&gt;efficient and parallel computer codes will have a positive impact on the&lt;br/&gt;ever increasing areas of Science that make essential use of numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations. Finally, two graduate students are actively participating in this&lt;br/&gt;project as partial fulfillment of their Ph.D. degree requirements. This will&lt;br/&gt;achieve another goal of this project which is to contribute to the training of&lt;br/&gt;the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>
