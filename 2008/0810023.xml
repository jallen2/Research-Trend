    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops new algorithms and data representations to streamline the development and dissemination of computer animation products. High risk for this project lies in extending prototype software for temporal anti-aliasing on crisp mathematical examples to realistically complex cases. The innovation, if successful, will be a comprehensive commercial solution and provide basic improvements to temporal anti-aliasing during the conceptual design stage, portability across display devices (inclusive of emerging 3-D options) and compact representation for more efficient data storage and transmission. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The business focus of the effort is to facilitate the creation, storage and delivery of digital visual effects. If successful, a new market (similar to traditional visual effects) will be developed. Once established, this market will offer significant commercial opportunity. As the technology matures, current partners will be developing instructional animation content for undergraduate biology students. This effort will offer feedback to assist in contributing to ongoing educational projects in other areas as well.</AbstractNarration>
