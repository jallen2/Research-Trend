    <AbstractNarration>This project is a Numerical Computing and Optimization REU site hosted by Florida International University (FIU). This site?s region, Southeast Florida, is a rapidly growing communication industry hub. This REU Site contributes to a well trained technical workforce in response to information from to the US and Florida Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating that the need for computer systems and data communication analysts is projected to grow during the 2006-2016 period. FIU is recruiting a diverse group of students and engaging them in a research experience to ensure that greater numbers will attend graduate school. Each summer 10 students are selected from across the country to participate in a variety of research projects that are supervised by the faculty for a period of 10 weeks. Projects span fundamental multidisciplinary areas in reconfigurable algorithms, software and operating systems for emerging applications. Students also attend a number of technical and professional seminars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Undergraduate students participating in this summer program perform supervised research and obtain rich experiences in a diverse and multicultural environment. Female and under represented minorities are selected from across the country to participate in the program, thus giving a diverse perspective and strength to the research. The student projects allow participants to learn fundamental principles of theoretical and practical telecommunications and networking. The undergraduate students attend structured training sessions to learn how research is conducted and how to be effective team members. The research projects involve a combination of model design, development and testing of algorithms, and software and tools necessary to design and validate secure, context-aware and adaptable next generation computing and communication systems and devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project engages students from underrepresented groups in research and exposes them to the possibilities of graduate study and encourages them to choose a career path involving research. The students develop intellectual confidence as they associate with other students who share their commitment to science and engineering. This REU site advances the research skills of the undergraduate participants and improves the employment options for these students. This provides a stronger technically educated American workforce. The REU research advances are integrated into the curriculum of related classes at FIU and thus benefit other students.</AbstractNarration>
