    <AbstractNarration>Nochetto&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807811&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The adequate numerical treatment of continuum phenomena&lt;br/&gt;exhibiting disparate space-time scales is a formidable&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and computational challenge. Modern algorithms&lt;br/&gt;should be able to resolve fine scales for certain physical&lt;br/&gt;quantities without overresolving others, thereby optimizing the&lt;br/&gt;computational effort and making realistic 3d simulations&lt;br/&gt;feasible. Mathematical models in biophysics (such as&lt;br/&gt;biomembranes in both fluid and gel state), in materials science&lt;br/&gt;(such as crystal surface morphologies and bilayer actuators), and&lt;br/&gt;in shape optimization (including both fluid and solid mechanics)&lt;br/&gt;are typical yet quite distinct examples addressed in this&lt;br/&gt;project. Their multiscale structure manifests in rapid&lt;br/&gt;transients and slow motion regimes in time, as well as point and&lt;br/&gt;line singularities (interfaces) and thin layers in space. Large&lt;br/&gt;domain deformations, perhaps leading to topology changes, is&lt;br/&gt;another intriguing feature. The goal of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;design, test, and analyze reliable and efficient adaptive finite&lt;br/&gt;element methods for these multiscale problems, most governed by&lt;br/&gt;geometric partial differential equations, with space-time error&lt;br/&gt;control based on a posteriori error estimation. This project&lt;br/&gt;builds upon, and in fact extends and enhances, the work of the&lt;br/&gt;prior NSF Grant DMS-0505454. It is organized in a number of&lt;br/&gt;small but interrelated topics permeated by the roles of geometry&lt;br/&gt;and adaptivity throughout, from issues in numerical analysis and&lt;br/&gt;computation to applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project blends quite delicate analytical,&lt;br/&gt;computational, and modeling issues in several areas of research&lt;br/&gt;of strategic importance such as nanotechnology, materials and&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing, biotechnology, and high performance computing. &lt;br/&gt;Designing smart electro-mechanical devices as well as&lt;br/&gt;understanding key functions of lipid membranes in living&lt;br/&gt;organisms, both at the nano and microscales, require powerful and&lt;br/&gt;flexible computational algorithms capable of dealing with large&lt;br/&gt;shape variations. This project develops such tools. It is a&lt;br/&gt;collaborative and interdisciplinary project involving a number of&lt;br/&gt;scientists in the US (four of them engineers and physicists) and&lt;br/&gt;abroad, as well as several students and postdocs. Because a&lt;br/&gt;substantial effort is devoted to education and human resource&lt;br/&gt;development, most resources are used to partially support&lt;br/&gt;students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>
