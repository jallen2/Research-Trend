    <AbstractNarration>Despite the clear success stories of wireless networks in the public, commercial, and governmental realms, recent work has shown that poor routing/scheduling can significantly impair their performance. We note that the unacceptable performance loss observed is not a consequence of a lack or deficiency of scheduling/routing algorithms in the literature; rather the cause is the information structure (channel state, queue state, topology, etc) that these algorithms assume. This proposal steers down a different path, initiating a conceptual shift toward the primary importance of information structure. We consider practical scenarios where only a small fraction of the network state can be explored. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: (a) characterizing the fundamental impact of partial/delayed network state information (NSI) on network throughput and other performance metrics such as delay and reliability, and (b) developing high-performance and distributed algorithms that can operate optimally subject to partial information. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: We believe this work can contribute towards furthering basic network science required to design high-performance scheduling and routing with limited NSI. We also plan to bring some of the questions both as interesting undergraduate projects, as well as develop a new graduate-level course on the mathematics of the design of communication networks.</AbstractNarration>
