    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site Program in Biogeosciences at Iowa State University supports 10 undergraduate engineering and science students each year for three years in a 10-week summer research experience. With a focus on complex environmental systems, the program's principal goals are to (1) involve undergraduates from a wide range of host institutions in a coherent and extendable research experience; (2) enhance the ability of students to undertake high quality, interdisciplinary research in a collaborative, collegial environment; and (3) cultivate a generation of environmental scientists and educators that reflects the diversity of backgrounds and experiences of students in the United States. The specific objectives of this program are to (1) provide students with opportunity to conduct independent research in biogeosciences in a supportive and challenging environment; (2) provide exposure to different scientific approaches and experimental methods; (3) introduce students to the presentation of scientific results through oral presentation and peer-reviewed publication; and (4) motivate students to continue on to graduate school and successful careers in science and engineering. Each participant will undertake an individual research project under the supervision of a faculty member, typically as a member of a group that includes graduate students and post-doctoral research associates. Students will participate in a series of workshops, seminars, and discussions by invited speakers addressing issues such as research methodology, career planning, and ethics in scientific research. Also included in the program are field trips and community-building activities designed to foster cohesiveness among the students as a multicultural group and to enhance their appreciation of scientific research. The experience will conclude with a research symposium at which students will present their work to faculty, peers, scientists, and resource management professionals from local, state and federal agencies.</AbstractNarration>
