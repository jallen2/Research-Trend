    <AbstractNarration>III-CXT: Learning from graph-structured data: new algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;modeling physical interactions in cellular networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complex behavior of the cell derives from an intricate network of &lt;br/&gt;molecular interactions of thousands of genes and their products. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding how this network operates and predicting its behavior &lt;br/&gt;are primary goals of biology and have broad implications for life &lt;br/&gt;science, medicine and biotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genomic information revolution of the last ten years has enabled &lt;br/&gt;new systems-level and data-driven approaches for studying cellular &lt;br/&gt;networks. In particular, using machine learning to model gene &lt;br/&gt;regulatory networks---the switching on and off of genes by regulatory &lt;br/&gt;proteins that bind to non-coding DNA---has emerged as a central &lt;br/&gt;problem in systems biology. Now, an explosion of new high-throughput &lt;br/&gt;technologies for measuring physical interactions between proteins and &lt;br/&gt;between protein and DNA provides a new data integration challenge for &lt;br/&gt;computational modeling of gene regulation. These new data can all be &lt;br/&gt;viewed as graph-structured data, or physical interaction networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central computational goal of this project is to develop new &lt;br/&gt;machine learning learning algorithms for exploiting graph-structured &lt;br/&gt;data, including: (1) boosting with efficient graph mining; (2) graph &lt;br/&gt;kernels based on subgraph histogramming; and (3) information-based &lt;br/&gt;graph partitioning. These new algorithms will be used to integrate &lt;br/&gt;physical interaction network data into models of gene regulation in &lt;br/&gt;order to better represent underlying biological mechanisms. The &lt;br/&gt;focus will be two fundamental modeling problems: inferring signal &lt;br/&gt;transduction pathways and modeling cis regulatory modules at the &lt;br/&gt;level of DNA sequence and interacting regulatory proteins. The &lt;br/&gt;algorithms will be applied both to publicly available data and to &lt;br/&gt;primary gene expression data provided by one of the investigators to &lt;br/&gt;study the hypoxia in yeast and the response to environmental toxins &lt;br/&gt;in mammalian neural cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will learn systems-level models that lead to new insight &lt;br/&gt;into the underlying mechanisms of gene regulation and open the way to &lt;br/&gt;broader biological discoveries. All data, results and source code &lt;br/&gt;will be publicly available via the Web (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/ &lt;br/&gt;compbio/cellular-networks) and disseminated through courses and &lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics software packages. The project will also create &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research opportunities for joint dry and wet lab &lt;br/&gt;projects and outreach activities to introduce New York City public &lt;br/&gt;high school students to new interdisciplinary areas of science.</AbstractNarration>
