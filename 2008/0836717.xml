    <AbstractNarration>The Dimensions Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discipline: Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The Dimensions Program" is creating new learning materials by adding contextual information to application problems to help pre-algebra students understand how mathematics is used to relate to the world around us. The first, second, and third geometrical dimensions are a unifying theme for the six STEM projects being developed, each comprised of a half dozen unique laboratory activities and association question-banks. The application contexts of these six projects have been identified through research on labor market needs, local business and industry, and national developing technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seven community colleges are involved with the development of the learning resources. The materials are being tested for usability and effectiveness in community college pre-algebra courses. The evaluation of these materials includes using pre and post tests to document changes in students' geometric understanding and in their attitudes toward learning mathematics. An electronic Resource Book of projects, laboratories, and supplemental questions is being published on the web for a broad dissemination of these easily implemental projects and corresponding laboratories. The first chapter of this Resource Book is designed to help teachers know the best educational practices for implementing these materials in the classroom.</AbstractNarration>
