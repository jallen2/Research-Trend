    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: ECCS-0846415&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: CAREER: Numerical and Experimental Study of Photon-Electron Interaction in Surface Plasmon-Polariton Nanophotonic Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Kuang, Wan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: Boise State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to study the optical property of surface plasmon-polariton nanophotonic devices due to photon and electron interactions. The approach is to develop a self-consistent model by incorporating electron dynamics in finite-difference time domain Maxwell?s equations using a quantum hydrodynamic transport model. The electron flow is described by a single-particle effective mass Schrödinger?s equation with many-body field described by density functional theory. The electrodynamic and the transport equations are coupled through the polarization-induced current density. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will greatly impact the field of nanophotonics, which is a major driver in the era of nanotechnology. The research seeks to understand how the carrier transport can be utilized to shape the optical properties of nanoplasmonic devices, a subject that has been largely unexplored. The program opens the door to breakthrough in active plasmonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this research also extends to solar cells, bio sensing and imaging. To facilitate research collaboration, numerical program will be hosted as an open source project. The research also has a broad educational impact on many levels. The subject of self-consistent modeling will be integrated into Ph.D. program on quantum optics. The undergraduate curriculum developments aim at offering a high quality education to students, who have become one of the major sources of local technical industry. The outreach program provides an innovative opportunity to expose younger adults to science and engineering. The program includes activities that specifically target the communities of a fast growing Hispanic population.</AbstractNarration>
