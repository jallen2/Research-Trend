    <AbstractNarration>The expectation for ever-present broadband connectivity is growing along with the proliferation of "always-on" mobile devices such as PDAs, laptops and cell phones. The International Telecommunications Union predicts people worldwide will soon live in "ubiquitous network societies," where interconnected appliances and devices provide relevant content and information whatever the location of the user. While some public spaces currently offer wireless internet, broadband subscribers typically lose guaranteed connections each time they leave their access points. One increasingly popular solution, shared broadband signals, relies on a model of peer-to-peer networking. Instead of information passing from "one to many," it may travel from "many to many." This form of viral networking is beginning to take hold at the grassroots level of media activism, as well as within the elite realm of venture capitalism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation project funded by the Science, Technology and Society Program develops a deeper understanding of a complex phenomenon: the potential for peer-to-peer signal sharing to expand digital inclusion in the United States. Semi-structured interviews provide enhanced understanding of the mesh networking movement. The project incorporates the perspectives of multiple stakeholders -- people who opt to share their WiFi signals, federal regulators, incumbent ISPs, and both non-profit and for-profit entities that facilitate peer-to-peer networking. The project also surveys people who participate in this movement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research lies in its efforts to expand and deepen the literature on how ad hoc networks can help close the digital divide. An extensive literature review reveals that few academic studies have focused on the role organized wireless signal sharing initiatives can play in deploying broadband to disenfranchised communities. Among the studies that do exist, the focus is on ISPs -- that is, the supply-side of broadband access. This research extends knowledge by delving into the demand-side of the peer networking movement as a means of better understanding potential pathways to connectivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are underscored by the fact that digital communications are becoming integrated into nearly every aspect of American life. They intersect with our economic, social and cultural lives. In fact, full participation in these realms is impossible without internet access, skills training and relevant online content. The study approaches WiFi signal sharing as more than a promising "last mile" technology. Rather, the research draws attention to its potential to disrupt the telecommunications industry by enabling consumers to take advantage of broadband signals without subscribing to an ISP.</AbstractNarration>
