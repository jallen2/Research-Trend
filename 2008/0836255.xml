    <AbstractNarration>The 17th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks&lt;br/&gt;(ICCCN?08) will be held in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, USA from August 3 to&lt;br/&gt;August 7, 2008. This preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting&lt;br/&gt;new research results in the area of computer communications and is widely attended by&lt;br/&gt;researchers and practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as ICCCN is highly&lt;br/&gt;valuable for graduate students? research and career development. Participants have the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, and interact&lt;br/&gt;with many others performing state-of-the-art research in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to support approximately eight graduate students in the&lt;br/&gt;United States to attend ICCCN?08. The travel awards will target graduate students, in&lt;br/&gt;particular female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited&lt;br/&gt;travel funds to attend conferences, which is an important part of their educational&lt;br/&gt;experience.</AbstractNarration>
