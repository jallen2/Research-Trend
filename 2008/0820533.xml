    <AbstractNarration>PI: Reginald B. Cocroft&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # IOS-0820533&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Novel mechanisms of mate localization in plant-dwelling insects: an integration of behavior, neurobiology and biomechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant-feeding insects are among the most abundant and diverse organisms on earth, with a major impact on both natural ecosystems and agriculture. For many of these insects, survival and reproduction depend on the detection of low-amplitude vibrations of the plant surface, generated by the activity of potential mates, competitors, or natural enemies. However, in spite of the importance of plant-borne vibrations for insect behavior and ecology, two fundamental questions remain unanswered. First, how can a small insect determine the direction of a vibration source elsewhere on the same plant? And second, can an insect use the complex motion of plant stems and leaves during vibration transmission to estimate its distance from the source? To answer these questions, an interdisciplinary team has been assembled with expertise in behavior, neurobiology, mechanical engineering, and computational modeling. The team will develop new research tools and use them to understand how insect behavior is guided by mechanical vibrations, using computational models to integrate the results of behavioral experiments, sensory neurophysiology, and biomechanical measurements. Previous research by this team has revealed surprising sources of information that insects may use in sensing; for example, the motion of an insect body, resting on its six legs, can be highly sensitive to the direction of travel of a plant-borne vibration. Results of the proposed research will transform the current understanding of how mechanical vibrations influence the behavior of one of the most ecologically and economically important groups of organisms. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Because collaborative teamwork is increasingly important for scientific progress, a major goal of the project will be to train graduate students in the skills needed for a career in interdisciplinary research. Finally, insights gained during the study could lead to the design of directional vibration sensors that could have an impact on many industries.</AbstractNarration>
