    <AbstractNarration>This Career development plan includes significant research, educational, and outreach components. The&lt;br/&gt;research component is focused on developing novel and systematic methodologies for the analysis, design,&lt;br/&gt;and implementation of cooperative dynamic networks. A dynamic network consists of spatially distributed&lt;br/&gt;dynamic nodes (e.g., autonomous vehicles, mobile sensors) which are coordinated by common set of goals and&lt;br/&gt;possible dynamic interaction between the nodes. There are many applications where a dynamic network may&lt;br/&gt;be more suitable than a single vehicle, especially where a distributed system of sensors is advantageous. Yet&lt;br/&gt;without coordinating the movement of the nodes or without managing the information the nodes retrieve,&lt;br/&gt;any advantage of dynamic network deployment may be lost and damaging collisions or interference may&lt;br/&gt;occur.&lt;br/&gt;This research will be integrated into curriculum development designed to provide research opportunities&lt;br/&gt;for undergraduate students with emphasis on attracting and retaining underrepresented minorities. The&lt;br/&gt;outreach component will support on-going educational programs designed to target K-12 institutions, and&lt;br/&gt;the Native American populations of Oklahoma.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit New Developments in complex networks of interacting systems like teams of au-&lt;br/&gt;tonomous vehicles/robots for homeland security, search and rescue operations, disaster relief operations,&lt;br/&gt;multi-targeting/multi-platform battlefield groups, unmanned air vehicle systems, intelligent highway/vehicle&lt;br/&gt;systems, wireless surveillance networks, and elsewhere place severe demands on the design of cooperative&lt;br/&gt;control schemes and communication strategies in the presence of changing environment. The large-scale in-&lt;br/&gt;terconnected nature of such systems requires logic-based supervisors with increased capabilities for dynamic&lt;br/&gt;planning, optimality and that guarantees performance subject to constraints, con ict resolution, failure&lt;br/&gt;handling, and other decisions. To facilitate the design of this class of systems the following key research&lt;br/&gt;challenges will be addressed:&lt;br/&gt; Development of computationally efficient algorithms for distributed model predictive control.&lt;br/&gt; Derivation of novel algorithms for cooperative optimization based control.&lt;br/&gt; Development new methodologies that enable goal directed sensing by fusing the information from&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous sensors over the dynamic network, and providing the required information for each node&lt;br/&gt;to plan and control its mobility.&lt;br/&gt; Designing adaptive robust controllers that take into account the uncertainties on the dynamics of the&lt;br/&gt;robotic network.&lt;br/&gt; Experimental verification and validation of the proposed methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact Ensuring that the above Career research thrusts have the broadest impact on society,&lt;br/&gt;they should be integrated with a coherent educational and outreach plan. It is well-known that robotics pro-&lt;br/&gt;vides an excellent platform for getting students interested in science and engineering. This proposal includes&lt;br/&gt;educational components targeted at high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The proposed work&lt;br/&gt;includes:&lt;br/&gt; Mentoring activities that include under-represented students in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and&lt;br/&gt;Technology (SMET) with the objective of retaining them in electrical and computer engineering.&lt;br/&gt; A robotic extension program will be designed to stimulate the interest of Native American children to&lt;br/&gt;increase their appreciation and understanding of science, technology, and engineering, in an informal&lt;br/&gt;learning environment.&lt;br/&gt; Seek industrial/governmental partnerships to transfer technology. Besides publications in refereed&lt;br/&gt;conference and journals, new courses such as Computer Embedded Systems, Robotics and Perception,&lt;br/&gt;and Control Hybrid Systems will be introduced into the curriculum.&lt;br/&gt; Software tools, algorithms, demos and results will be available on the web.&lt;br/&gt;The educational and research components of this Career proposal build upon previous and on-going work&lt;br/&gt;and existing equipment supported by Oklahoma State University.</AbstractNarration>
