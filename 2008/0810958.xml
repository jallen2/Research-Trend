    <AbstractNarration>The generation, propagation, and energetic transport of ocean waves&lt;br/&gt;play a crucial role in many technologies including near-shore&lt;br/&gt;watercraft navigation, the design of deep-sea oil-drilling rigs, and&lt;br/&gt;the generation and propagation of tsunamis. However, the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;technologies for the remote detection and measurement of these&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear waves are based upon the scattering of linear acoustic or&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic radiation from the surface or bulk of the fluid. Not&lt;br/&gt;surprisingly, the state-of-the-art in theory, approximation, and&lt;br/&gt;numerical simulation of these two disparate wave phenomena is quite&lt;br/&gt;different. In this proposal the Principal Investigator (PI) advocates&lt;br/&gt;the development of a unified computational approach to these two&lt;br/&gt;problems with the goal of producing a set of highly accurate, stable,&lt;br/&gt;and error-controllable numerical algorithms for the detection,&lt;br/&gt;simulation, and evaluation of waves on the surface of large bodies of&lt;br/&gt;water. Over the past ten years the PI has developed a set of stable,&lt;br/&gt;high-accuracy Boundary Perturbation (BP) algorithms for the study of&lt;br/&gt;both traveling ocean waves and scattering returns from irregularly&lt;br/&gt;shaped obstacles. These BP algorithms each involve an independent&lt;br/&gt;perturbation parameter and the PI proposes to investigate a strategy&lt;br/&gt;of coupling these two disparate algorithms by linking these&lt;br/&gt;parameters, thus realizing huge computational savings. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;the PI proposes to significantly extend and improve existing BP&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for the simulation of linear waves in the high-frequency&lt;br/&gt;regime. In short, the Geometric Optics solution points the way to a&lt;br/&gt;solution Ansatz which can be represented with a frequency-independent&lt;br/&gt;number of unknowns. The PI, in collaboration with F. Reitich, has&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated how this Ansatz coupled to classical BP methods can be&lt;br/&gt;used to compute high-frequency scattering returns from shallow&lt;br/&gt;surfaces with enormous computational savings. In this proposal the PI&lt;br/&gt;advocates the further development of these algorithms to incorporate&lt;br/&gt;the scenario of multiple reflections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The generation and propagation properties of ocean waves are crucial&lt;br/&gt;in many technologies including watercraft navigation, design of&lt;br/&gt;deep-sea oil-drilling rigs, and the study of tsunamis. However, the&lt;br/&gt;methods for the measurement of these nonlinear ocean waves are based&lt;br/&gt;upon the scattering of linear acoustic or electromagnetic radiation.&lt;br/&gt;The state-of-the-art in both the theory and practice of these two&lt;br/&gt;disparate wave phenomena is quite different. In this proposal the&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator (PI) advocates the development of a unified&lt;br/&gt;approach to the computation of these two problems with the goal of&lt;br/&gt;producing a set of reliable and accurate numerical algorithms for the&lt;br/&gt;detection and simulation of ocean waves. This will involve the PI&lt;br/&gt;bringing together two separate threads of his research program to&lt;br/&gt;implement this unified approach. Additionally, he will need to expand&lt;br/&gt;the capabilities of his algorithms to account for the highly&lt;br/&gt;oscillatory character of the linear waves which arise in these&lt;br/&gt;applications. The latter task will be particularly challenging and is&lt;br/&gt;the current focus of a great deal of research by both civilian and&lt;br/&gt;military agencies.</AbstractNarration>
