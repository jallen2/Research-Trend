    <AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Formulation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832469 Georgia Tech; Andreas Bommarius &lt;br/&gt;0832530 University of Kansas; Eric Munson &lt;br/&gt;0832478 Duquesne University; James Drennen &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Kansas, and Duquesne University propose a planning grant for a collaborative center "Center for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Formulation (CPMF)" to address current challenges in the pharmaceutical industry with the aim of developing solutions towards more selective and robust manufacturing processes, more stable formulations, and better characterized and consistent products. The Center will provide a mechanism for collaborative projects between scientists from government, academia, and industry to develop innovative methods towards more selective and robust processes with less environmental footprint and to improve the safety of the nations drug supply. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research agenda includes manufacturing, formulation, and analytical. The manufacturing focus is on transitioning to microscale and continuous process from the current norm of batch processes. The integration of manufacturing, formulation, and analyses of the approaches to testing and rapid identification of counterfeit and degraded drugs will lead to an advancement in knowledge in the field. Advances in these areas would help mitigate production costs, and would help keep the companies viable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will improve the ability to develop safe drugs and drug formulations. Collaborations with the pharmaceutical industry will add value by promoting the rapid dissemination and application of technologies and information. The proposed center (CPMF) will promote learning by participant students as they conduct their research. CPMF will also place emphasis on recruiting under-represented groups in the graduate education, including presentations and visits to colleges and universities that serve under-represented groups, especially where the faculty are alumni.</AbstractNarration>
