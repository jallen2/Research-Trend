    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: The US National Congress of Computational Mechanics has become a premier conference in the field of Computational Science and Engineering, not only in the USA but also internationally. It encompasses a broad range of disciplines and has evolved into a confluence of multidisciplinary ideas. For students and post-doctoral researchers, this is an ideal platform for exposure to the state of the art developments in a broad range of fields. The conference provides an excellent platform for younger researchers to showcase their ideas and research progress, to experts in various fields and gain instant recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Students and post-doctoral researchers will participate through presentations in technical sessions and poster sessions. Furthermore, panel discussions are planned with experts from industry, academia and government (Air Force, Army, Navy and DOE labs) to provide future directions. The organizing committee will try to encourage underrepresented minority and women students to participate in this congress by awarding travel scholarships.</AbstractNarration>
