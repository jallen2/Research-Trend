    <AbstractNarration>This project involves a strong education-industry-government group whose primary concern is industry's critical information infrastructure. Given that there is a lack of national framework for curricula and training development in digital forensics education, this project cuts across disciplines to generate a new knowledge set including security management and law enforcement perspectives. The project has three main objectives: (1) collaboration between faculty in computing and faculty in the Criminal Justice Department to develop new curricula in digital forensics for a certificate and/or A.S. degree in Computer Security and Investigations; (2) development of laboratory modules, which facilitates community college students' education for technician jobs in digital forensics, including the creation of CDs for training and tutorials; and (3) running of community-wide symposia to disseminate information to the general population about computer security and digital forensics. Unique features include (1) linkage with government agencies, companies, and other academic institutions through the Advisory Council; (2) cutting across disciplines to teach a hybrid mix of skills; (3) courses designed as modular courses to be offered as short courses or workshops for professional development for educators; and (4) website and web-based facilities that support the project, academic program, courses, and distance learning.</AbstractNarration>
