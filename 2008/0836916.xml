    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, a collaboration among University of South Florida, Old Dominion University and Arizona State University, is developing state-of-the-art prototype web-based learning tools for open courseware in undergraduate numerical methods courses. These tools include game based simulations, a virtual tireless internet instructor, endless self-assessment tests, and audio-based Flash/PowerPoint presentations. In this pilot project, these tools are being developed for one topic (simultaneous linear equations). They are enhancing student learning by using simulations to improve the classroom and self-learning experience, personalizing learning via the internet instructor, self-assessing the level of learning via multiple-choice questions tests, and providing multiple contexts for understanding the same material. The evaluation effort includes formative and summative aspects using instruments to measure content knowledge and skills, attitude surveys for students and faculty members, student focus groups, and faculty member interviews. Instructional material and results are being disseminated through website postings, through presentations at the ASEE and FIE conferences, and through journal articles. Broader impacts include the collaboration of the three universities and the dissemination of the instructional material.</AbstractNarration>
