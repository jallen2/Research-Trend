    <AbstractNarration>Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests NSF support for acquisition of a research grade advanced atomic force microscopy (AFM) system and a portable AFM ideally suited for teaching, training, and outreach. This instrumentation will help to establish a state-of-the-art scanned probe microscopy (SPM) research and outreach program for the advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology at Appalachian State University (ASU) in addition to providing the unique opportunity of training for undergraduate and graduate students interested in pursuing careers in science, technology, and engineering. Funding of this grant will encourage and promote a higher level of research in nanoscience at ASU and will be utilized to further projects which nclude nanotribology, plasmonic bio-sensing, beam induced chemistry, noble metal nanoparticle templating, molecular self- assembly, and renewable energy initiatives. ASU is shifting its priorities to increase efforts on research in response to the needs of our state while maintaining and enhancing our traditional strengths in science education. In order to further this goal, it is necessary to provide state-of-the-art research equipment to faculty and students so as to facilitate leading edge research capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;Our intradepartmental collaborations at ASU as well as with NCSU, Duke, Army Research Office and NC regional industries will ensure this investment will have positive impacts on and off campus. ASU has a strong background in involving undergraduates in cutting edge research (www.osr.appstate.edu &lt;http://www.osr.appstate.edu&gt;). We plan to involve ASU graduate and undergraduate students in research projects utilizing the instrumentation. We believe that the proposed instrumentation and the collaboration with other institutions will help strengthen ASU?s development in education by exposing students to current research efforts, training students on the proposed instruments, and preparing students for careers in industry that require this type of instrumentation for quality assurance and root cause failure analysis. In addition to the research grade AFM, we propose to purchase a portable AFM for in- class demonstrations and active learning opportunities for ASU students. We will also use the portable AFM for community outreach education and recruiting efforts via visits to regional public schools (over all grade levels) and interactions with outreach groups, such as the Mathematics and Science Education Center, sponsored by the Department of Mathematics here at ASU. The acquisition of the portable AFM would aid in future outreach activities such as scholar weekends at ASU, the Duke TIP academy at ASU, and, to target education of minority groups, visits to inner city schools in the greater Charlotte area. We will also use the portable AFM to create active learning modules to be posted on our website that will be shared with other educators who wish to integrate AFM in the classroom to excite students in the hope they will continue to pursue nanotechnology related studies in college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layperson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed acquisition of a research grade and educational atomic force microscope (AFM) for ASU?s Dept. of Physics &amp; Astronomy will ensure that ongoing nanoscience, nanotechnology and renewable energy research on campus will continue to further knowledge within the respective scientific communities. Funding of this grant will encourage and promote a higher level of research in nanoscience at ASU and will be utilized to further projects including nanotribology, plasmonic bio-sensing, beam induced chemistry, noble metal nanoparticle templating, molecular self- assembly, and renewable energy initiatives. ASU is shifting its priorities to increase efforts on research in response to the needs of our state while maintaining and enhancing our traditional strengths in science education. In addition, the instrumentation will be used for outreach in western NC middle and high schools, as well as provide active learning for students on ASU?s campus. The AFMs will encourage student interest in nanoscience as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics and ensure that undergraduate and graduate students will have hands-on experience with and knowledge of skills needed to contribute to a high technology workforce critical for growing the economy of NC and the US.</AbstractNarration>
