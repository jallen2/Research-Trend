    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops cell membrane mimetic-microarrays for high-throughput screening and analysis of multivalent drug candidates, particularly nanomedicine. Traditional drugs based on mono-valent and high-affinity interactions can lead to non-specific side effects and toxicity. Advances in synthetic and processing techniques for nanoparticles (inorganic, organic, dendrimer, polymer, liposomes, and etc.) have made available an increasing library of drug candidates that incorporate multivalent surface functionalities for targeting specific cells. The proposed cell membrane mimicking microarrays will be based on an air-stable and fluidic supported lipid bilayer system; the robustness of the proposed membrane microarrays greatly simplifies manufacturing, product distribution, and usage. This product will be of high value to pharmaceutical companies and research institutions that are involved in multivalent and nanomedicine development as well as fundamental research on cell-cell interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are contributions to drug development and human health. Nanomedicine is a $7 billion market today and growing at double digits annually. While pharmaceutical companies, biotech startups, and academic laboratories are actively developing nanoparticle-based therapies, there are no products that provide high-throughput analysis of these potential drug candidates. The proposed research will allow development of a superior product to meet the needs for large-scale screening of multivalent drug candidates and, in return, accelerate the development of nanomedicine.</AbstractNarration>
