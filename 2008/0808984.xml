    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Morse of the University of Utah, together with his postdoctoral and graduate student researchers, will study the structure and boding in a series of transition metal silicides, early-late transition metal dimers (e.g. TiNi), transition dimer metal cations, and complexes of TiO+ cations with Lewis bases. These experiments will be carried out in a molecular beam or a cryogenically-cooled ion-trap. The molecules will be interrogated with a variety of laser spectroscopic methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These molecular species are a challenge for current theoretical methods, thus these results will serve as useful benchmark systems to test new or improved computational chemistry methods. In addition, the species themselves are important models with which to build up useful models of technologically important materials -- from memory metals to titanium oxide photocatalysts. The young scientists working with Prof. Morse will use sophisticated lasers and vacuum apparatus, and will be well-trained for the technological workforce. Prof. Morse has trained a significant number of women scientists, and this track record is expected to continue.</AbstractNarration>
