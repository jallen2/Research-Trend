    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0805878&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Alejandro Uribe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will study aspects of the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between the semiclassical behavior (i.e. as Planck's constant&lt;br/&gt;tends to zero) of quantum-mechanical objects with their geometric&lt;br/&gt;counterpart in phase space. More specifically, problems to be&lt;br/&gt;investigated include: Direct and inverse spectral problems for&lt;br/&gt;Schrodinger operators in various semi-classical settings,&lt;br/&gt;rigorous analyses of semiclassical approximations commonly used&lt;br/&gt;in the physics and quantum chemistry communities (Bohr-Sommerfeld&lt;br/&gt;conditions, approximate propagators and computation of&lt;br/&gt;correlation functions), as well as quantum-mechanical analogies&lt;br/&gt;of constructions in symplectic geometry (like symplectic&lt;br/&gt;cutting). The settings will be both classical (when the phase&lt;br/&gt;space is Euclidean) and more geometric (e.g. when the phase space&lt;br/&gt;is a compact Kahler manifold or the cotangent bundle of a&lt;br/&gt;configuration space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relationship between mathematics and physics is profoundly&lt;br/&gt;important for both the theory and applications of these subjects.&lt;br/&gt;In one direction, mathematics is the language of physics and its&lt;br/&gt;methods can have powerful applications; in the other, physical&lt;br/&gt;problems often give rise to new mathematical problems that can be&lt;br/&gt;extremely fruitful. The proposed research will study problems at&lt;br/&gt;the interface between quantum mechanics and geometry. The&lt;br/&gt;problems are generally of two kinds: spectral, meaning related to&lt;br/&gt;the energy of a quantum system, and dynamical, comparing the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of a quantum system with its classical counterpart.&lt;br/&gt;The spectral problems seek to understand the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;the possible energy levels of a quantum system and the geometry&lt;br/&gt;of the corresponding classical system. The dynamic problems&lt;br/&gt;should result in a better understanding of the underpinnings of&lt;br/&gt;some popular computational methods in quantum chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
