    <AbstractNarration>This conference intends to bring a small group of Minority Serving Institution (MSI) faculty and experts in program evaluation to share lessons learned; to present new and evolving theories embedded within indigenous cultural experiences; and, to actively engage in strategizing avenues for improving capacity building and sustaining the application of responsive culturally appropriate evaluations. It is also a needs assessment focused on participant identification of needed capacity building activities in evaluation from three perspectives: their own, their institution and across Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This grant would be a follow-up to expand previous activities initiated by NSF through the Broadening Participation Initiative in Evaluation Capacity Building. The proposed conference also would set the stage for designing and revising strategies/models and the review of their use for broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
