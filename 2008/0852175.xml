    <AbstractNarration>Research over the past 20 years has shown that trait differences acting after copulation&lt;br/&gt;but before the fusion of sperm and egg nuclei, often termed postmating, prezygotic trait&lt;br/&gt;differences, play a primary role in reducing gene exchange between populations within&lt;br/&gt;a species and between closely related species. The genetic basis of these trait&lt;br/&gt;differences is poorly understood and thus, constitutes the primary goal of Marshall and&lt;br/&gt;Howard's research plan. Specifically, the proposed research focuses on identifying the&lt;br/&gt;seminal fluid and sperm proteins that differ, whether in abundance or structure, between&lt;br/&gt;closely related ground cricket species that are isolated by postmating, prezygotic trait&lt;br/&gt;differences. Once identified, gene silencing technology will be used to evaluate the&lt;br/&gt;function of each protein and its influence on preventing or reducing fertilization between&lt;br/&gt;species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Barriers to fertilization have been intensively studied in the Allonemobius socius&lt;br/&gt;complex of crickets, providing an excellent model for evaluating the genes and proteins&lt;br/&gt;that underlie successful fertilization. Understanding the genetic basis of fertilization&lt;br/&gt;incompatibilities between populations and species can provide insight into a wide-range&lt;br/&gt;of topics, including the development of infertility within species (including humans) and&lt;br/&gt;the role of sexual selection and sexual conflict in driving the divergence of fertilization&lt;br/&gt;proteins. The project provides training for undergraduate and graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;outreach to K-12 schools.</AbstractNarration>
