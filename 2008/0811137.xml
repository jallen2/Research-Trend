    <AbstractNarration>Abstract-Veena Misra-SGER&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to investigate a highly innovative route in&lt;br/&gt;the real-time formation and characterization of nanoparticle based electronic devices via&lt;br/&gt;a revolutionary ultra thin SiC membrane platform that provides ultra-fast temperature&lt;br/&gt;rates (1200degree centigrade/msec). This approach can revolutionize nanostructure&lt;br/&gt;formation which can substantially increase the commercialization potential of&lt;br/&gt;nanodevices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, nanoparticles have gained tremendous interest for their potential use in memory devices, chem-bio sensors and spintronics. However, one of the biggest challenges facing nanoparticle commercialization is the formation of dense, uniform and mono-disperse films. The inability to control kinetics of the anneal conditions, such as temperatures, ramp rates and cool down rates, typically used to form nanoparticles can lead to uncontrolled process leading to undesired sizes and variations. The study of kinetics at the millisecond range affords novel insight into nanostructure formation which will directly influence the device characteristics. Fully fabricated nanoscale devices will be integrated directly on the semiconductor membrane heating while undergoing simultaneous electrical characterization. Nanoscale MOSFETs and two-terminal coulomb blockade devices will be fabricated. The features of C-V and I-V curves, such as periodicity of steps, sharpness of steps, degree of charge storage and coulomb blockade window will be measured. With this system, over a hundred anneal/measurement steps can ultimately be achieved in a matter of seconds. Multiple discrete heaters, fabricated on a single wafer, can further expedite cycles of learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This knowledge will impact the fields of memories, sensors, photonics and bioelectronics. The system being proposed here is highly amenable to enhance education modules due to its small footprint and ease of access. We will use this system as a visualization tool for undergraduates to correlate dynamic changes in size and shape of nanostructures to device characteristics in real-time. Broader use of controlled and organized nanostructures will result in commercialization opportunities and give high return on investment in nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
