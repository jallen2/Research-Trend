    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: &lt;br/&gt;Zinc oxide is an important material because of its electronic properties, ease of synthesis, low cost of synthesis and for being more environmentally friendly than some alternatives. These properties make it the material of choice for such applications as photovoltaics, gas sensors, ultraviolet transceivers for the military, and when transition metals are added to the zinc oxide, it is a potentially useful material for developing spin-based electronics (spintronics). Spintronics employs the magnetic property or spin of electrons to carry signals and process information where conventional electronics uses only the charge of the electrons. Spintronics has been proposed as the future replacement for conventional electronics, which is approaching its limit of miniaturization, because it would allow more information to be processed with less material. For the development of spintronics to be realized, a better understanding of how the synthetic, compositional and structural details determine the materials electronic and magnetic properties is essential. This joint proposal with Northwest Nazarene University, Boise State University, and Rochester Institute of Technology seeks a solution-based route to zinc oxide containing magnetic elements. A particular emphasis of the project will be to systematically relate synthetic and process conditions to structural and compositional details and to electronic and magnetic properties of the materials. Synthesis and thermal characterization of the materials will be done at NNU, structural and magnetic characterization will be done at BSU, and electronic characterization will be done at RIT. The project will involve high school, undergraduate and graduate students. A particular emphasis will be placed on selecting students who are early in their academic careers, with the expectation that involving them in mentored research projects will motivate them to graduate and pursue careers in areas of science and technology. Aspects of this project are being incorporated into three classes and three laboratories at NNU. Instrumentation purchased for this project is being made available to local high school classes to come and use. The project is expected to directly impact at least 114 undergraduate, graduate and high school students each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: &lt;br/&gt;This joint proposal with Northwest Nazarene University, Boise State University, and Rochester Institute of Technology seeks a solution-based route to thin films and bulk powders of high quality ferromagnetic semiconductors, based on zinc oxide. Ferromagnetic semiconductors have been proposed as a future replacement for conventional semiconductors as the electronics industry rapidly approaches the limits of miniaturization, since these materials would have a greater processing and storage capacity while using less material. Each year, seven high school, undergraduate and graduate students will be directly involved with this research. These students will learn and use a variety of characterization techniques, including thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry with mass spectroscopy (TGA/DSC/MS), X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Hall effect and magnetic measurements. Synthesis and thermal characterization will be done at NNU, structural and magnetic characterization will be done at BSU, and electronic characterization will be done at RIT. Since aspects of this research are being incorporated into three classes and three laboratories at NNU and local high school chemistry classes will be encouraged to come to NNU to characterize materials using the TGA/DSC/MS, it is anticipated that this proposal will directly impact at least 114 high school, undergraduate, and graduate students each year.</AbstractNarration>
