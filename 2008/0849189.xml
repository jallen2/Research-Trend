    <AbstractNarration>The San Jose State University (SJSU) Scholars in Science project provides fifty-six scholarships for academically talented, financially needy students who are motivated to pursue careers or advanced degrees in STEM fields. These Scholars in Science are supported in obtaining degrees in at least one of five areas: Meteorology, Geology, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Scholars are recruited from freshman and sophomore courses and have completed the first semester of chemistry and a college level mathematics course, pre-calculus or higher. The Scholars are supported by a faculty mentor, the College of Science Advising Center and the PIs. The Scholars are encouraged as part of a community of learners through priority registration allowing the Scholars to enroll in common classes and allowing them the flexibility to participate in Academic Excellence Workshops, the Graduate School Preparation Seminar, the SJSU STEM Scholars in Science monthly meetings, and membership in a scientific society. Students interested in research are assisted in securing positions on and off campus and students interested in high school teaching are provided opportunities to develop their teaching skills while earning their STEM disciplinary degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the students who qualify for this program are women, come from groups underrepresented in the sciences, and/or are the first in their families to go to college. The project focuses on the retention, education and career choices of the Scholars by providing them with structured guidance and career discovery support. In addition, skills development is provided for working collaboratively in project development and for management by allowing Scholars to select and plan some of the support activities. The Scholars in Science project is intended to serve as a model for other endeavors at San Jose State University.</AbstractNarration>
