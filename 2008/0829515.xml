    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Workshop on Multiscale and Stochastic Modeling, Analysis, and Computation, held at Michigan State University on 10-11 October 2008. The meeting focuses on two related topics: the application of multi-scale modeling and analysis to the development of nano-structured materials for energy conversion applications, and the integration of stochastic methods into the modeling and analysis of multi-scale and cellular processes. The workshop aims to provide a forum to exchange viewpoints, identify core issues, and promote collaborative research among applied mathematicians, physicists, and biologists who are interested in nano-scale materials and cellular reacting networks. By combining the two areas into a single workshop and by interspersing theoretical and applied talks, the program is designed to catalyze cross-fertilization between scientists with the various disciplinary backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative research initiated in connection with this workshop may spur important advances in the areas of energy technology, cellular networks, and nano-structured materials. The workshop encourages and supports broad participation by students, postdocs, and junior faculty, especially women, under-represented minorities, and people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop web page: http://www.math.msu.edu/%7Erichardl/workshop/index.html</AbstractNarration>
