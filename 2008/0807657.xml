    <AbstractNarration>Organisms have a finite amount of energy to devote to basic life processes such as reproduction and dispersal. They must allocate this energy to competing structures and functions, leading to ?trade-offs? between these processes. Understanding how these trade-offs shape allocation strategies is central to understanding biological diversity. In this proposal, the investigators use a theoretical model to predict patterns of variation in trade-offs and propose an experiment to test these predictions using the well-studied trade-off between flight capability and reproductive output in the sand cricket, Gryllus firmus. By raising families on different food levels, they will quantify the influence of genetics (family) and resource availability (food level) on both the acquisition of energy and its subsequent allocation to competing processes. These results will be integrated into a novel genetic model for predicting variation in trade-offs within and among species.&lt;br/&gt;A key objective of this project is to train new scientists by providing hands-on experience for an ethnically diverse cadre of undergraduate students. The project offers students the unusual challenge of integrating biological knowledge across many levels, including physiology, ecology, genetics and evolution. Talented students will be encouraged to develop independent research projects and PI Fairbairn has a strong record of success in mentoring such students.</AbstractNarration>
