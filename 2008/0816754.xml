    <AbstractNarration>Inquiry-based laboratory experiences are being developed for several STEM courses. During the first year fifteen graduate students, postdoctoral personnel and faculty members attend the Center for Adaptive Optics Professional Development Program workshops focusing on the development of inquiry-based laboratories. The workshops consist of a number of sessions held over several months. In the second year there will be 30 workshop participants, of which one-third to one-half are expected to be returning participants. The participants are divided into three person design teams to develop new inquiry-based laboratory experiences that mirror the way science is practiced by scientists. Over the three year project, ten laboratory units will be designed or redesigned and be taught for three STEM courses at UCSC and five units in astronomy for the Hartnell College (a nearby community college). Assessment and evaluation is an ongoing process throughout the project.</AbstractNarration>
