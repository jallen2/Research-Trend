    <AbstractNarration>This project is for partial support for an international meeting on Glial Biology, as part of the Gordon Research Conference series, to be held in Ventura, California, March 15-20, 2009. The broad and long-term goal of the conference is to increase our understanding of the manner in which glial cells in the brain interact with one another and with neurons during normal brain function and in neurological diseases. The biology of two specific glial cell types, astrocytes and microglial cells, is emphasized in this meeting. The specific aim of this meeting will be to convene 44 speakers to discuss critical areas of glial research with a total of 140 participants, during a five-day conference. The program will address glia cell involvement in synaptic structure and function, neurogenesis, brain energy metabolism, cerebral blood flow, and some neurological diseases including tumors and stroke. The Glial Biology GCR is designed to: 1. Initiate and help sustain an interactive dialogue between scientists in different fields of glial biology and glial-neuron interactions by providing a long-term forum for presentation of cutting-edge work to a diverse group of leading researchers. 2. Suggest new approaches to solve timely glial biology problems and help identify controversial issues in this field that require resolution. 3. Raise awareness in the neuroscience community of the importance of glial-neuronal interactions. Specific presentations at this conference will focus on the involvement of glial cells in brain development, tumor formation and spread, normal and deranged energy metabolism (e.g., stroke and hypoglycemia) and pain perception. Students and post-doctoral fellows will be invited and will have a unique opportunity to learn from some of the most distinguished glial scientists in the world.</AbstractNarration>
