    <AbstractNarration>This award is for travel funds to support technical coordination by various collaborators with the Blue Waters project team and vendor technical team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will make available on Blue Waters computational tools and environments for social and biological research involving interacting automata at nodes of very large social contact network or interaction graphs. Such research includes the evaluation of mitigation strategies for contagion on realistic national- and global-scale social contact networks, worm propagation on the Internet, percolation processes, viral marketing, database replication (in particular for sensor networks), and social phenomenon such as the propagation of fads and norms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of research with the tools to be deployed may help provide better understanding of how different strategies for dealing with emerging infectious diseases can influence the course and impact of pandemics. The principal investigators are new NSF investigators.</AbstractNarration>
