    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0823685&lt;br/&gt;Shipley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BRIGE awards maintain global competitiveness by increasing the diversity of ENG researchers, who are initiating research programs early in their careers. BRIGE awards further the broaden participation of engineering researchers by increasing the number of engineering graduates, by improving the representation of women and minorities in engineering, and by understanding how to improve recruitment and retention of engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BRIGE award will investigate the mechanisms and the ability of nanomaterials to adsorb specific contaminants. The research seeks to further the development of efficient and cost effective water treatment and remediation technologies. A significant amount of work has been done in batch processes on bulk crystals (activated carbon, iron oxides, aluminum oxides, etc) ability to adsorb a specific contaminant. But little corresponding work has been conducted on nanomaterials; the high surface area of many nanomaterials makes them ideal sorbents for contaminants. The PI seeks to study the desorption of contaminants under environmental and engineered conditions to better understand and model unique adsorbents. Preliminary research by the PI using groundwater from Brownsville, TX has suggested that nanomaterials can be used to remove arsenic, several naturally occurring radionuclides, and heavy metals. But others were not removed from solution and the difference is not yet understood. Understanding the difference, leads to better prediction of sorption behavior and application to environmental engineering technology. The PI will determine the interaction of nanoparticles and adsorbates with batch and column experiments for both adsorption and desorption. The PI will use equilibrium isotherms, sorption and desorption kinetics, and specific surface analysis tools to characterize the mechanisms of sorption and desorption. Adsorbates will include heavy metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UTSA is a minority institution with a population of 28,500 students of which roughly half are of Hispanic background. The work promotes engineering research projects using innovative methods to address engineering problems while training the next generation of engineers. It also creates new research opportunities while encouraging the involvement of both undergraduate and graduate students that are from a traditionally underrepresented student population. The research will provide fundamental understanding on the sorption behavior of contaminants to nanomaterials. These outcomes will yield understanding that can be applied to the future development of water treatment and remediation technologies that could be functional for small individual treatment systems and/or for central publicly owned treatment facilities using the unique properties of nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This BRIGE grant will broaden the participation of and increase opportunities for all engineers including those from groups underrepresented in the engineering disciplines. This BRIGE grant will also encourage the PI to become actively and competitively engaged in research as an independent investigator.</AbstractNarration>
