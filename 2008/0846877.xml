    <AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: ECCS-0846877&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Unified Optimal Control and Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems with Closed-Form Solutions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Xin, Ming&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: Mississippi State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to create a unified theoretic framework for optimal control and estimation of nonlinear dynamic systems. The approach is to (1) establish a rigorous theory and efficient algorithms for solving nonlinear optimal control problems with closed-form solutions for a variety of terminal conditions; (2) develop a dual nonlinear estimation technique using a unified methodology derived from the control algorithm; (3) systematically integrate the control and estimation algorithms and validate them through simulation studies and experiments. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The novel theory will provide new perspectives and tools to solve the traditionally difficult nonlinear optimal control and estimation problems. The unified approach will give simpler closed-form solutions and overcome the computational barriers. More importantly, the new results will expand the optimal control application horizon significantly since most real systems have nonlinear dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The success of this research represents a breakthrough in optimization of a wide variety of complex dynamic systems, which will have a profound impact on many aspects of the economy and society. The novel research results will provide the state-of-the-art content for new courses, research topics, as well as hands-on learning opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. The educational impact can be maximized by involving students in integrating the new techniques into the flight control research of unmanned air vehicles and micro-satellite project at the Mississippi State University. The dissemination of this new technique through the university?s unique outreach program will have a great impact on attracting local high school and minority students' enthusiasm in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
