    <AbstractNarration>As the Internet evolves into a global communication infrastructure, &lt;br/&gt;it is becoming complex and ubiquitous. It is bringing together &lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous collections of hosts and network devices such as &lt;br/&gt;wireless mesh networks. A consequence of this ever-increasing &lt;br/&gt;scale, complexity and agility is that problems of managing this &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure keep getting worse. Research concentrating on &lt;br/&gt;streamlining fundamental issues has shown that absence of a single &lt;br/&gt;end-to-end lightweight hybrid network management solution with the &lt;br/&gt;necessary levels of context awareness and adaptability, while much &lt;br/&gt;desirable, has not yet been realized. Consequently, the community &lt;br/&gt;is still detained from fully gaining from many of the emerging &lt;br/&gt;applications of the cyber-infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves an exploratory investigation towards a &lt;br/&gt;?drive through? network management platform for ?on-the-fly? &lt;br/&gt;Internet-enabled mobile networks. Objectives include new conceptual &lt;br/&gt;approaches that couple application, and middleware designs with design &lt;br/&gt;of network management services; novel theoretical models that tap into &lt;br/&gt;in-network management characteristics of pervasive computing so that &lt;br/&gt;missing or conflicting information gathered from multiple participating &lt;br/&gt;nodes can be tolerated; augmentation of security management algorithms &lt;br/&gt;with trustworthiness functionalities; theoretical schemes that examine &lt;br/&gt;epistemic uncertainty by fusing imprecision, uncertainty and event &lt;br/&gt;synchronization with belief theory; and extensions to archetype &lt;br/&gt;platforms for supporting autonomic network management and configuration. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research lies in presenting a first step &lt;br/&gt;towards synthesis of integrated network management theoretical and design &lt;br/&gt;solutions that support traditional network management protocols and &lt;br/&gt;functionalities in addition to the dynamic aspects of infrastructures-less &lt;br/&gt;networks. Although some risk exists, focused research can overcome the &lt;br/&gt;current barriers. The broader impact of the research is that this work &lt;br/&gt;will pave the way to transformative next generation network management &lt;br/&gt;paradigms and tools.</AbstractNarration>
