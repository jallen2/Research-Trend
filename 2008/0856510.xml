    <AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Tribologically Durable UHMWPE Nanocomposites for Total Joint Replacements: Nano-mechanics and Bio-tribological Modeling &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this project is to study the nano-mechanics and bio-tribology aspects of graphitic UHMWPE nanocomposites for total joint replacements, and to establish models for the design of tribologically durable materials that can provide longer life expectancy for prosthetic implants. The conventional method for increasing wear resistance of UHMWPE components of total joint replacements is crosslinking UHMWPE material by irradiation followed by re-melting. These methods have resulted in severe problems such as reduced fatigue strength and toughness, as well as the generation of wear debris in the most biologically active size range, raising concerns of osteolysis, bone resorption, and implant loosening. This project aims at solving those problems through studies of nano-mechanics and bio-tribological modeling for durable UHMWPE nanocomposites reinforced by newly developed graphitic nanomaterials. This research will result in a new design methodology for polymer materials used in artificial joints, and thus lead to optimal UHWMPE nanocomposites and dramatically extended life expectancy for total joint replacements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this project will provide a base for design and development of tribologically durable UHMWPE materials that can lead to longer life spans for a variety of artificial joints to meet a wide range of patient needs. This research will benefit and contribute to bio-engineering, nanotechnology, materials science, heath care system capability, and our society at large. It will also contribute to multi-level education in both ND and WA states. This project will directly involve both undergraduate and graduate students, and will also lead to new lectures for course development in both universities. Native American tribal college students, woman and minority students will benefit from this research through summer workshops</AbstractNarration>
