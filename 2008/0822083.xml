    <AbstractNarration>International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS) is an emerging conference in the area of mobile and sensor networks. MASS is fully sponsored by IEEE Computer Society. This conference traditionally brings together researchers in the broad field of wireless and sensor networks. Earlier research on wireless networks and mobile computing has concentrated on single-hop networks, where network nodes communicate directly with a fixed infrastructure, such as cellular or satellite systems. However, multi-hop communication needs to be supported in conferences, hospitals, battlefields, rescue operations, and monitoring scenarios, where network nodes communicate via other network nodes. More recently, wireless community networks (a. k. a. wireless mesh networks) have been proposed as alternatives for providing Internet access in new (business and residential) areas. This conference aims to address multi-hop ad-hoc and sensor networks systems, covering topics ranging from physical issues to the applications aspects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in conferences such as IEEE MASS is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with peers and more senior researchers, thus having the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge work in the field of wireless and sensor networks. The travel support will enable US-based graduate students to attend and present their research results in this important IEEE conference. Since the travel support in most of the NSF awards is quite limited to students (who are authors), this fund will enable the awardees not to divert research funding for travel.</AbstractNarration>
