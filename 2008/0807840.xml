    <AbstractNarration>Mosco&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807840&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleagues study mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems with large surfaces and small volumes that arise in&lt;br/&gt;physics (e.g., highly fragmented electrical conductors, high&lt;br/&gt;voltage electric discharges, electrolytic deposition,&lt;br/&gt;diffusion-limited aggregation), chemistry (catalytic converters,&lt;br/&gt;surface chemistry), biology (cell membranes, vascular systems),&lt;br/&gt;engineering (hydraulic fracturing in oil wells, thin ramified&lt;br/&gt;fibers, elastic thin bodies, towers and bridges in open space). &lt;br/&gt;In all these problems a lower-dimensional physical body -- the&lt;br/&gt;"surface" -- intrudes and interacts with a full dimensional&lt;br/&gt;surrounding body -- the "volume." The volume is small, the&lt;br/&gt;surface is large, possibly fractal and with infinite area. In&lt;br/&gt;this project, the mathematics of fractal structures in space is&lt;br/&gt;focused on two fundamental issues: 1) second order transmission&lt;br/&gt;conditions for second order operators; 2) singular homogenization&lt;br/&gt;with fractal terms. New tools of analysis are developed, like&lt;br/&gt;Hoelder metrics and measure-valued Lagrangeans. Finite element&lt;br/&gt;numerical approximations provide the quantitative and flexible&lt;br/&gt;setting required by prospective applications such as those&lt;br/&gt;mentioned above. The principal investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;develop new mathematics aimed at meeting the challenges and&lt;br/&gt;taking advantage of the new technologies of the time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The mathematics developed in this project is motivated by,&lt;br/&gt;and oriented to, the study of applied problems of unusual type,&lt;br/&gt;occurring in the materials sciences and manufacturing,&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology, biotechnology, and the environmental sciences. &lt;br/&gt;The unusual feature of these problems consists in the presence&lt;br/&gt;and interaction, within the same system, of two physical&lt;br/&gt;phenomena, one confined in a "small volume," the second unfolding&lt;br/&gt;itself on a "large surface." Nanotechnology can produce very&lt;br/&gt;fine fractal surfaces that can be assembled to form composite&lt;br/&gt;materials with enhanced internal surface effects (catalytic&lt;br/&gt;devices, absorbers, surface chemistry, radiators and similar). &lt;br/&gt;Environment-driven fractal networks can support irrigation of&lt;br/&gt;large surfaces with scarce fluid volume (as in vascular and&lt;br/&gt;biological systems). Interlaced thin fibers and fractal thin&lt;br/&gt;structures can tune wave propagation in space. Despite their&lt;br/&gt;complexity, these applications hinge on an unusual volume vs.&lt;br/&gt;surface relation of the kind mentioned before. The project&lt;br/&gt;involves young researchers and students -- with attention to&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities -- who receive a broad, flexible&lt;br/&gt;training that provides access to science and technology as well&lt;br/&gt;to professional activities outside academic institutions.</AbstractNarration>
