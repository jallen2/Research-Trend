    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0827467&lt;br/&gt;Young&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference (www.GCandE.org) is organized each year by the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute (ACS GCI) with the active involvement of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, U.S. government agencies, and academic and industry organizations. The purpose of the annual conference is to create interdisciplinary bridges among scientists and engineers who use chemistry as a tool to develop breakthrough advances for sustainability. Now in its 12th year, the annual conference focuses on topics that are relevant to fundamental research in all aspects of chemistry and chemical engineering. The next conference is scheduled for 24-26 June 2008 and will be held in Washington, DC, in connection with a ceremony recognizing the winners of the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards. Through this award, ACS GCI will support student education and participation in green chemistry and engineering (GC&amp;E) through educational activities at the conference, providing students with &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- travel scholarships to participate in the GC&amp;E Conference; &lt;br/&gt;- a judged, student poster session at the GC&amp;E Conference; and &lt;br/&gt;- instructors for a one-day, free, GC&amp;E Student Workshop preceding the conference, on June 23, 2008. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Green chemistry and engineering are important for the future of our society. The science community must actively recruit the best new minds to this science through education. The theme of the 12th annual GC&amp;E conference is 'Using Green Chemistry &amp; Engineering to Advance Sustainable Solutions'. The program will include cutting-edge research and cross-cutting themes in education, making the business case, and industrial applications. Students participating in the GC&amp;E workshop and/or conference will have a unique opportunity to engage in topics not commonly encountered in traditional university courses and conferences. Educational workshop discussions and technical conference talks will be given in diverse areas such as: analytical methods and technologies, bio-based materials and processes, catalysis, education and outreach, environmental decision making and metrics, new materials, process design, renewable fuels, solvents and solvent systems, and synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Through the design of chemical reactions and processes that reduce or even eliminate negative impacts on human health and the environment, green chemistry and green engineering approaches seek to achieve the twin goals of economic prosperity and environmental sustainability. Green chemistry and engineering are important tools in preventing pollution at the source and providing solutions to global sustainability challenges. This highly interdisciplinary workshop and meeting will be an excellent opportunity for students to learn to present their research, learn the latest developments in green chemistry and green chemical engineering, and expose themselves to the broader economic, social and political context in which these developments occur. Educating the innovators of tomorrow is a crucial part in securing the well-being of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will have an excellent opportunity to learn about the newest research developments in their areas, dialog with other academic, industrial, and governmental researchers, advance their participation in professional societies, and expand their network of professional contacts. Interaction and collaboration will generate new knowledge that will help to define our sustainable future.</AbstractNarration>
