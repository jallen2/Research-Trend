    <AbstractNarration>Over five years, CSUDH is offering $10,000 scholarships to 35 unduplicated juniors and seniors majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics or physics who are becoming math-science teachers in high-need secondary schools in the Los Angeles or Lynwood school districts. A large percentage of the scholarship recipients are underrepresented minorities, based on CSUDH's STEM undergraduate pool: 39% Latino, 32% African American, 12% Asian/Pacific Islander, 6% white, 11% unknown. The Noyce program operates in cohorts, led by advisors from the two participating CSUDH colleges. Scholars attend monthly cohort meetings for peer and faculty support, advising, mentoring, information, exposure to math-science secondary teaching and education experts. Through the cohorts, scholars are linked to academic resources, financial aid or other programs that meet individual needs. The Noyce program leverages 1) a state-funded undergraduate recruiting program for mathscience majors, which offers academic support but not financial support; and 2) a federally funded accelerated credential program, Transition to Teaching (TTT). In combination, Noyce and TTT provide 3 years of financial support during the last 2 years of undergraduate study and 1 year of postbaccalaureate teacher training. Noyce scholars transition into TTT, which enables them to earn their credential in one year while holding a full-time teaching position as a university intern in the high-needs Los Angeles Unified or Lynwood school districts and which provides financial assistance and substantial support in a cohort structure, leading to high retention. Of the 113 total TTT participants in the past three years; 108 (95.5%) are teaching in the challenging TTT service-area schools and another four are teaching elsewhere (99% total teaching). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The evaluation phase of this project is measuring the extent to which combining undergraduate math-science training with scholarships, advising, academic support and monitoring in a cohort structure enables students to focus on their studies, maintain their grades, stay in school, complete their degree in a timely fashion and become successful math-science teachers. The project also is providing an opportunity to use scholarships to leverage an undergraduate recruiting program for math-science majors and an accelerated credential program that includes employment as an intern teacher. Results can help shape future strategies to alleviate the math-science teacher shortage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The success of this project in increasing the supply of well-qualified math-science teachers in Los Angeles will have a positive impact on the lives and aspirations of the scholars' students, as well as their schools. It will positively affect the community and local economy when students trained by these teachers bring their math-science skills into the workplace.</AbstractNarration>
