    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Jason Barnes is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Durham University. Dr. Barnes will examine changes in the landscape in the southern Himalayas in response to the collision of the Indian subcontinent against Eurasia. Dr. Barnes will study in detail topographic features, measure fault lengths and displacements, determine the rates of erosion and deposition, and explore the possibility of using topography to infer seismic hazards. To reach the scientific goals, Dr. Barnes will construct detailed geologic maps, examine satellite images, digital topography maps, and measure isotopes in sand grains (10Be) from the Siwaliks Hills, northwest India. The results from this investigation will provide information that is needed to understand the relationship between changes in landscape and earthquakes in regions where geologic faults may not be visible at the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Dr. Barnes will interact with scientists from Britain and India and participate in the development of programs that will disseminate the findings of the research not only to other scientists from these countries, but also to others working in hazards and risk management.</AbstractNarration>
