    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this proposal is to evaluate the use of instantaneous, chip-wide global information for increasing performance and reducing power and cost in large-scale, chip multi-processors (CMPs). Using global information contradicts conventional thinking because it has been assumed that traversing the entire chip requires many clock periods. Recently developed circuits, however, enable single-cycle, chip-wide signaling, suggesting new possibilities of combining global and local information simultaneously. Further, similar ideas have not been previously implemented in large, traditional multi-chip systems because design flexibility, interconnect configurability, and transistor performance improvements exist only on chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary exploration has identified both the required interconnect circuits and opportunities for hardware and software to take advantage of up-to-date global information. The research plans to exploit new circuit techniques that will enable the proposed network-on-chip (NOC)with hybrid interconnect (NOCHI) architecture, which has both a data plane using conventional interconnect techniques and an ultra low-latency control plane with a global interconnect. Because NOCHI ignores established design patterns, understanding the circuit properties is essential for the architectural studies, which include: new algorithms that can better control and regulate power consumption within the network and across cores; improved interaction of the cores with the off-chip memory system to reduce demands on on-chip network resources; the ramifications of global information on cache coherence and management; and software controlled, ultra low-latency efficient synchronization for multicores.</AbstractNarration>
