    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for Collaboration &lt;br/&gt;0427985, 0427464, 0427094,0427912,0427695 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multidisciplinary team of researchers from Argonne National &lt;br/&gt;Laboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, &lt;br/&gt;University of Chicago, Emory University, and University of &lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania, with collaborators from the Universities of Graz and &lt;br/&gt;Lubek, will initiate a long term research project on image-driven, &lt;br/&gt;inversion-based biophysical modeling. The team includes expertise in &lt;br/&gt;numerical algorithms and scientific computing, fluid and solid &lt;br/&gt;biomechanics, PDE optimization, inverse problems, medical image &lt;br/&gt;analysis and processing, and distributed and grid computing necessary &lt;br/&gt;to tackle this class of problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to create a framework for assimilating multimodal &lt;br/&gt;dynamic medical image data to produce highly-resolved, &lt;br/&gt;physically-realistic, patient-specific biomechanics models. While the &lt;br/&gt;computational and algorithmic aspects of the project are widely &lt;br/&gt;applicable, the target application will be the construction of &lt;br/&gt;patient-specific cardiac biomechanics models from 4D image datasets of &lt;br/&gt;heart motion. Such models are useful for medical diagnosis and &lt;br/&gt;surgical planning. This places a premium on quick turnaround of the &lt;br/&gt;computations, which mean they must be fast, scalable, and capable of &lt;br/&gt;exploiting grid-based computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will focus on three key areas that undergird the project's &lt;br/&gt;overall goals: registration, inversion, and distributed computing. The &lt;br/&gt;registration research component will create multilevel algorithms to &lt;br/&gt;extract cardiac deformation histories from time-varying medical image &lt;br/&gt;datasets via the solution of sequences of 3D image registration &lt;br/&gt;problems. The inversion research component will develop multilevel &lt;br/&gt;algorithms that use these deformation field histories as virtual &lt;br/&gt;observations to solve inverse problems for cardiac biomechanical &lt;br/&gt;parameters. The distributed computing research component will create &lt;br/&gt;tools for performance prediction and resource scheduling that support &lt;br/&gt;simulations across distributed computational resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dovetailing with the research components, the project will undertake &lt;br/&gt;an educational program designed to communicate the fruits of its work &lt;br/&gt;and of the wider benefits of the integration of the biomedical &lt;br/&gt;sciences, computing sciences, and computational sciences, to a more &lt;br/&gt;general audience of students, disciplinary researchers, and the lay &lt;br/&gt;public. The professional activities of the team members in the &lt;br/&gt;inversion, image registration, grid computing, and computational &lt;br/&gt;science communities will be parlayed to organize workshops and &lt;br/&gt;international meetings, edit volumes, teach summer schools, develop &lt;br/&gt;university and short courses, and engage in outreach activities---as &lt;br/&gt;they have done in the past---but with greater emphasis on the field of &lt;br/&gt;computational biomedicine. The proposed image-based cardiac &lt;br/&gt;biomechanics modeling application will provide an excellent &lt;br/&gt;opportunity to demonstrate the benefits to health and welfare that &lt;br/&gt;advances in optimization-based registration and inversion algorithms &lt;br/&gt;and Grid computing can provide.</AbstractNarration>
