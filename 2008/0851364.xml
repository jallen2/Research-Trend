    <AbstractNarration>Using the excitement of scientific discovery, the experience of hands-on research in a foreign setting, and the power of the Internet, the proposed project aims to enhance understanding of global culture, biological diversity, and effective strategies in science education. Over 2 summers undergraduate students will engage in interdisciplinary problem based research that is expected to generate a model of long-term dynamics in human exploitation of marine biological communities, emphasizing interactions between humans and the environment. A diverse group of undergraduates from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB; a Minority Serving Institution and the lead institution for NSF?s Alabama AMP or Alliance for Minority Participation Program) and elsewhere in the US, will spend 6 weeks in the field and 3 weeks in the classroom and lab at UAB each summer. The team will recruit minorities to fill a significant proportion of the available positions by tapping into the diversity in student participation already present in UAB?s AMP and the McNair Scholars Program. Students? activities and projects will include: archaeological surveys, mapping, and excavations; collecting and analyzing ethnographic data on resource exploitation and foodways; conducting lab analysis of archaeological materials; working with database systems and computer software; and interpreting data in written, digital, and oral presentations for the academic and general public. An External Advisory Committee of senior scholars will guide and monitor the progress of this REU site.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. This innovative project will produce a model describing millennia of human-environmental interactions. An evolutionary perspective is afforded by our team?s expertise in ethnography, archaeology, and historical ecology, providing for the evaluation of changes in marine diversity and exploitation through time. A fundamental part of the proposed research is the collaboration of students and faculty from North America, Fiji-based collaborators, and Fijian villagers. These interactions will serve to stimulate interest in the understanding and preservation of cultural and natural resources. This site will provide a model of innovative strategies for teaching field-based sciences, for disseminating research to educators, and for evaluating the educational effectiveness of our approach. The team will develop visual digital media and contribute to technologically savvy curriculum for use in K-16 classrooms throughout the state of Alabama. This research is expected to have a positive impact on the practices of anthropology, historical ecology, and science education in terms of theory and method.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The broader impacts of this project include the teaching and training of students and indigenous collaborators in anthropological field methods. The research findings will be disseminated via a partnership between this REU site and Alabama Public Television (APT) through APTPLUS, APT?s 21st century destination for online learning. State-of-the-art technology combined with a wealth of content-rich resources makes learning a dynamic, interactive experience for all ages. Free for educators, adult learners, parents and youth, APTPLUS provides exciting multimedia education. This video-on-demand service offers pre-K through adult learning curriculum content, professional development, national and local video libraries, and links to state and national educational web sites and support materials. Currently, 100% of the public school districts and 71% of the public K-12 teachers are using APTPLUS as a teaching and learning tool. REU video footage, photos, and research data hosted on the APT website will be incorporated into online educational professional development programs.&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to reach as many audiences as possible, the project team will also disseminate information through traditional procedures such as scholarly presentations and publications. Data gathered by REU students will be used in displays and presentations to the general public in collaboration with UAB, the McWane Science Center, University of the South Pacific, the Fiji Museum, and Alabama Public Television.&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and also EPSCoR.</AbstractNarration>
