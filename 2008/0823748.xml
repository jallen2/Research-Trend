    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0823748&lt;br/&gt;Narayanan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding is to support the travel of approximately 10 US scientists and researchers to present papers at the fourth international workshop and conference on thermal, fluid and interfacial phenomena in physico-chemical, materials and bio- processes. Problems of materials processing, nanotechnologies and drug delivery as well as space technologies will be addressed. The conference will be held at the Tokyo University of Science campus on October 21-23, 2008. These scientists will represent a broad base of research funded by NSF, through its chemical thermal and fluids division. Scientists from various countries will be able to discuss their research and foster collaboration for future work. The scientists will represent academia, industry and government research and this collaboration will therefore benefit the cooperative science programs between the US and other countries as well as university industry collaboration. The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer Verlag, which has an electronic publishing format aside from a book format. Thus, the research ideas will be widely disseminated via libraries and the electronic media making a broad impact on the community of scientists and engineers. The published research ideas and discussions will encourage future novel research and fresh perspectives on problems of technological content.</AbstractNarration>
