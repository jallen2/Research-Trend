    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to transform second-semester introductory physics (Physics II) into a Studio-based format, focusing primarily on the creation of new learning materials and teaching strategies. Several years ago, the first semester of this course (Physics I) at the school underwent a similar transition, resulting in substantial gains in student performance and satisfaction. Now, space is available for the second semester. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pilot results from the Physics II courses held in Studio have identified a number of specific avenues for reform, including increased problem difficulty to better provoke group interactions, careful use of problem scaffolding, and an emphasis on written explanation of work. This project involves careful assessment of the current state of the class, followed by significant curriculum development and implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary outcome of this project is a substantially improved Studio curriculum. With systems in place to track curriculum improvements over time, these changes are intended to be permanent. The changes are designed to improve student learning of conceptual material, problem-solving strategies, student attitudes, and student understanding of the nature of science. There are also three secondary outcomes that make use of new Studio course:&lt;br/&gt;1. Faculty and student training in research-based teaching techniques. &lt;br/&gt;2. Disseminated knowledge regarding how to effectively transform from a traditional model to a Studio or hybrid Studio model, aiding other institutions in making similar changes.&lt;br/&gt;3. Opportunities for physics education research of significant interest, including longitudinal studies comparing students who have had Studio-based classes to those who have not, and studies comparing Studio to other large-lecture reforms implemented in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work includes a model for implementing the transition to a Studio Physics or hybrid course at other universities. Careful assessment of the transition enables identification of more and less effective course features. In addition, the transformed Studio allows future research of considerable interest, including comparisons between the School's studio and other institutions' approaches to reform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work include the 800-1000 students served by the course each year, as well as the involvement of 15-20 student teaching and research assistants in implementing and assessing these improvements each semester. Student benefits should include higher performance on conceptual and problem-solving tasks, and improved attitudes towards physics. Faculty at the school who teach Physics II are able to experience research-based educational practices and their positive effects. The experience also allows faculty at other institutions to benefit from the results.</AbstractNarration>
