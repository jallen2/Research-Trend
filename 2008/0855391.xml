    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is devoted to theoretical studies of optical frequency comb interaction with molecules. The excitation of two-photon Raman transitions will be investigated, induced by two pulse trains with locked phase, and also by crafted femtosecond pulse trains. Possibilities of selective excitation of predetermined Raman transitions will be investigated, taking into account effects of decoherence. The objectives are to gain insight into the mechanisms of pulse train interactions with matter, to learn about factors that govern molecular state time evolution, and to develop new control methods of molecular dynamics in the presence of fast decoherence. The investigations will advance modern ultrafast control methods through discovery of new quantum control mechanisms based on frequency comb interaction with molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These results will broaden areas of quantum control applications, from detection of molecular species to imaging techniques to quantum gates. Graduate students will get involved in the development of theoretical models, programming, collecting and interpreting data of numerical calculations. The research results will be incorporated into graduate course material of a course "Methods of Quantum Control". Students enrolled in this course will learn about advanced quantum control methods, based on latest developments of laser technologies. The research experience and the course study will broaden the opportunities for their career development. Collaboration with experimental groups within the Department of Physics at Stevens Institute of Technology will be initiated, aiming at exploring possibilities of new methods of experimental realization.</AbstractNarration>
