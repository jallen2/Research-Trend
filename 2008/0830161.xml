    <AbstractNarration>The Investigators propose to develop and implement novel and&lt;br/&gt;efficient Gaussian-beam-based computational methods for large-scale computational&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetics motivated by industrial and military applications. The project addresses&lt;br/&gt;several fundamental issues in scientific computing and applied mathematics, such as&lt;br/&gt;multi-scale modeling, simulation, and inverse problems, which are essential in material&lt;br/&gt;sciences and nanotechnology. Computational electromagnetics has become a fundamental,&lt;br/&gt;vigorously growing technology in diverse science and engineering disciplines, ranging&lt;br/&gt;from radar, sonar, seismic imaging, medical imaging, lithography processing, detection of&lt;br/&gt;land mines, submarine detection, stealth technology, remote sensing, electronics to&lt;br/&gt;microscopy and nanotechnology. The new methodology resulting from Eulerian Gaussian beam&lt;br/&gt;methods has substantial impact on computational electromagnetics and applications,&lt;br/&gt;particularly at high frequencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves large-scale direct and inverse scattering problems for electromagnetic&lt;br/&gt;wave propagation with high wave numbers. The Investigators will develop efficient and accurate&lt;br/&gt;Eulerian Gaussian beam methods for Maxwell's equations in inhomogeneous media in the high&lt;br/&gt;wave number regime. Furthermore, the Investigators will apply the new Gaussian methods to three&lt;br/&gt;challenging and practically important problems for Maxwell's equations: inverse medium&lt;br/&gt;problems, large cavity problems, and diffraction grating problems. New Eulerian&lt;br/&gt;Gaussian-beam-based algorithms will be developed for the first time for these applications.&lt;br/&gt;The Gaussian beam method will be capable of producing uniform asymptotic solutions beyond&lt;br/&gt;caustics for wave propagation with high wave numbers. These new Eulerian Gaussian beam&lt;br/&gt;methods should also provide an efficient tool for many other applications related to&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic waves in inhomogeneous media.&lt;br/&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------</AbstractNarration>
