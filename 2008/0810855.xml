    <AbstractNarration>The main purpose of this project is to develop, analyze, and test novel,&lt;br/&gt;accurate a posteriori error estimators of the recovery type for various&lt;br/&gt;finite element discretizations of a variety of elliptic equations and&lt;br/&gt;systems arising from solid and fluid mechanics, including nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;problems. The investigator and his colleagues plan to study two types of&lt;br/&gt;recovery procedures: one is accurate only for the constitutive equation&lt;br/&gt;and the other is accurate for both the constitutive and equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;equations. Based on these recovered fluxes (or the stresses for solid&lt;br/&gt;and fluid mechanics), they will study three kinds of estimators. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, they will study an exact estimator on any given mesh,&lt;br/&gt;including an arbitrary initial mesh, with no regularity assumptions.&lt;br/&gt;Exactness on any given mesh implies that the estimator is ideally&lt;br/&gt;perfect for error control (or the so-called solution verification) on&lt;br/&gt;coarse (pre-asymptotic) meshes. No regularity assumptions in this&lt;br/&gt;project mean that the only assumptions on the existence of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying problem are required.&lt;br/&gt;This is weaker than those required for approximation theory and much&lt;br/&gt;weaker than those required by the current theory of the recovery-based&lt;br/&gt;estimators. Therefore, the estimators can be applied to problems of&lt;br/&gt;practical interests such as interface singularities, discontinuities in&lt;br/&gt;the form of shock-like fronts and of interior or boundary layers. The&lt;br/&gt;second part of the project is to establish convergence of adaptive&lt;br/&gt;finite element methods based on the recovery-based estimators and the&lt;br/&gt;newly developed estimators of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major problem with computer simulations of physical phenomena is that&lt;br/&gt;all computational results obtained involve numerical error.&lt;br/&gt;Discretization error can be large, pervasive, unpredictable by classical&lt;br/&gt;heuristic means, and can invalidate numerical predictions.&lt;br/&gt;A posteriori error estimation is a rigorous mathematical theory for&lt;br/&gt;estimating and quantifying discretization error in terms of the error's&lt;br/&gt;magnitude and distribution based on the current simulation and given&lt;br/&gt;data of the underlying problem. This information provides bases for&lt;br/&gt;solution verification and for adaptive control of simulation process:&lt;br/&gt;adaptive mesh refinement, adaptive control of mathematical models and&lt;br/&gt;numerical algorithms. Success in this project will provide accurate and&lt;br/&gt;reliable a posteriori error estimators for a large class of elliptic&lt;br/&gt;equations/systems arising from engineering, physics, aerodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric sciences, geology, biomechanics, material sciences,&lt;br/&gt;nano-technology, and industrial applications. The development of the&lt;br/&gt;exact estimator will enable error control on pre-asymptotic meshes and&lt;br/&gt;predictable computation analysis. Error control on pre-asymptotic meshes&lt;br/&gt;is of paramount importance for simulating physical phenomena in&lt;br/&gt;engineering applications and scientific predictions with limited&lt;br/&gt;computer resources.</AbstractNarration>
