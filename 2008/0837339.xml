    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary - (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates the courses necessary to add a forensic engineering track to the undergraduate Interdisciplinary Engineering curriculum at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. The investigators are developing three new interdisciplinary courses, Applied Design of Experiments, Reverse Failure Analysis, and Forensic Investigation Procedures, that form the core curriculum of programs in engineering accident and crime scene investigation. The courses utilize modern pedagogical techniques including case based learning and problem based learning in an effort to increase student learning outcomes. The courses incorporate real-world engineering forensic examples and hands-on laboratory experiences. The project includes an extensive and rigorous evaluation plan with both formative and summative components. The evaluation plan uses both quantitative and qualitative data to measure student achievement and course material effectiveness. The new course materials and evaluation results are disseminated to other educators and institutions through established online STEM knowledgebases, including the National Science Digital Library, and national workshops. The project includes a focused outreach effort to interest eighth grade girls in careers in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
