    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of low-cost, highly-autonomous vehicles equipped with control, communication, sensing&lt;br/&gt;and computing capabilities is paving the way for the deployment of mobile sensor networks in a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of applications. Examples include environmental monitoring, oceanographic research, high-stress, rapid de-&lt;br/&gt;ployment operations, and health monitoring of civil infrastructure. In these envisioned applications, many&lt;br/&gt;critical processes occur at temporal and spatial scales that cannot be effectively sampled with current ap-&lt;br/&gt;proaches. Mobile sensor networks hold the promise to provide the rich, in-situ spatio-temporal data needed to&lt;br/&gt;revolutionize the detection, estimation, and monitoring of dynamic natural phenomena. Controlled mobility&lt;br/&gt;integrated with distributed data fusion capabilities will enable sensor networks to provide broad spatial cov-&lt;br/&gt;erage, react to short-lived events in real time, and track key processes that occur away from fixed sites.&lt;br/&gt;The state of the art in distributed data fusion only considers static networks, and therefore is not directly&lt;br/&gt;applicable to ad-hoc, dynamically changing mobile networks. The state of the art in motion coordination&lt;br/&gt;of networked systems has only developed centralized approaches to estimation and signal processing. As a&lt;br/&gt;result of these limitations, current mobile networks are too rigid to cope with the small-scale features and&lt;br/&gt;the rapid evolution characteristic of many key physical processes.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The major objective of this project is the synthesis of scalable coordination algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for mobile networks performing spatially-distributed sensing tasks. Distributed strategies that maximize the&lt;br/&gt;information content of collected data will allow future sensor networks to adapt to changing conditions in a&lt;br/&gt;rapid, autonomous and optimal fashion. To make this vision a reality, this project will address the distributed,&lt;br/&gt;in-situ aggregation of data collected by mobile networks in dynamic scenarios, and the information-driven,&lt;br/&gt;scalable coordination of the network mobility to optimally perform the required sensing tasks.&lt;br/&gt;The research plan will adopt an ambitious integrative approach composed of three thrusts: (i) a sound,&lt;br/&gt;unifying framework where different cooperative strategies can be rigorously formalized and compared. This&lt;br/&gt;effort will facilitate the modular design of cooperative strategies for complex sensing tasks via the combination&lt;br/&gt;of simpler algorithms performing more basic objectives; (ii) system-theoretic tools to evaluate the correctness,&lt;br/&gt;robustness and scalability properties of coordination algorithms. To assess the optimal trade-offs between&lt;br/&gt;performance and energy allocation in combined communication, motion, and sensing scenarios, this research&lt;br/&gt;will evaluate complexity measures for cooperative strategies and spatially-distributed tasks; and (iii) novel,&lt;br/&gt;systematic design methodologies that allow to break down global sensing tasks into local objectives for&lt;br/&gt;individual agents. This effort seeks to synthesize fault tolerant, scalable algorithms that sit at the limits on&lt;br/&gt;the achievable performance, operational time and energy consumption of mobile networks conducting data&lt;br/&gt;fusion and estimation tasks. The innovative technical approach builds on a set of very promising results by&lt;br/&gt;the PI and collaborators, hinging upon disciplines such as cooperative and topology control, automata and&lt;br/&gt;hybrid systems theory, robotics, wireless communications, and operations research.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The techniques developed in this work will help design autonomous and efficient mobile&lt;br/&gt;networks performing critical tasks in homeland security, industrial processes, health care and the environment.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will lead to crosscutting and synergistic technologies applicable to a wide range&lt;br/&gt;of scenarios where real-time information gathering and data exploitation are important. The results will&lt;br/&gt;be transferred to oceanographic and disaster management applications in collaboration with the Monterey&lt;br/&gt;Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and NASA Ames, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed educational activities are integrated into the research plan and consist of the following&lt;br/&gt;initiatives: (i) involvement of undergraduate students in research via design projects, summer internships&lt;br/&gt;and engineering research demonstrations in a newly-created laboratory environment; (ii) development of an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate course on \Motion Coordination" and a graduate course on \Cooperative Mobile Networks";&lt;br/&gt;(iii) offering of a course on control and robotics in the California State Summer School for Mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;Science for high-school students, and expository and research talks at community colleges near UCSC. Re-&lt;br/&gt;search and educational materials will be made available to high-school teachers, the scientific community and&lt;br/&gt;the general public via an interactive website. Regular activities for broad dissemination (journal publications,&lt;br/&gt;conference presentations, lecture notes) will also be pursued. The evaluation of the educational activities,&lt;br/&gt;based on the educational process and the students' outcomes, will be done in collaboration with the UCSC&lt;br/&gt;Center for Teaching Excellence. Special attention will be paid to integrate inclusive teaching practices into&lt;br/&gt;the daily educational activity to address retention issues concerning underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>
