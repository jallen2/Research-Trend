    <AbstractNarration>The marine troposphere plays important roles in the global geochemical cycles of many elements, in the global radiation budget, and in the global distribution of organic compounds, nutrients, microbes and pollutants. At present, many aspects of atmospheric composition, atmospheric transport, and atmosphere-ocean exchange remain poorly understood, thus limiting our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of anticipated future climate change. Central to improving our understanding of these topics is the ability to observe and sample the marine boundary layer. In this regard, oceanic island observatories have played a crucial role. By virtue of its location in the western North Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda has been a key location for numerous field studies of the marine troposphere. Bermuda is also well equipped for such field research, with the 23-m high atmospheric sampling tower and site laboratories that were established at Tudor Hill during the NSF-funded AEROCE program (1988-1998). With support from the NSF Chemical Oceanography and Atmospheric Chemistry Programs, the Tudor Hill tower and site laboratories were repaired and refitted in 2002-2003, and have since been operated and maintained as a community field research facility. Facility operations have included the collection of continuous meteorological data and weekly bulk-aerosol samples and rainwater samples, which are archived at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) and made freely available to the scientific community, as well as the collection of samples and data for a variety of external research projects funded by NSF, NOAA, NASA and other agencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funds from this renewal award, researchers at BIOS will continue to maintain, operate and upgrade this valuable community research facility over the period September 2008-August 2011. Specifically, they will: (1). operate and maintain a state-of-the-art marine atmospheric sampling and observing facility at Tudor Hill, Bermuda; (2). continue collection of continuous meteorological data and weekly bulk-aerosol and rain samples, which will be archived at BIOS and made freely available to other researchers; (3). collect additional atmospheric samples and data for external investigators, and provide for the use of the facility by external investigators; and (4). expand the capacity of the facility in terms of electrical power and tower sampling space. Modest facility-user fees will be requested for the collection of samples or data in addition to those specified in (2), above, or for other research use of the facility. Anticipated net revenue from these user fees (on the order of $10,000 per year) will be used to defray costs of site maintenance, equipment replacement, and additional technician support in the project period. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In general terms, the continued operation and maintenance of the Tudor Hill site will facilitate research concerning the chemistry and physics of the marine troposphere and oceanatmosphere exchange processes -- topics that are central to international research initiatives such as IGAC, SOLAS and GEOTRACES. Such research is expected to improve our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of anticipated future climatic and environmental change. In a regional context, the Tudor Hill facility will complement ongoing time-series research in the Sargasso Sea, including Hydrostation S, BATS and the Oceanic Flux Program. Together, these programs promise significant advances in our understanding of oceanic and atmospheric processes. This project is expected to make significant educational contributions at a number of levels. Data and samples will be made available for use in graduate research projects, as they have been in the past. The Tudor Hill facility will also provide undergraduate education opportunities through the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, and through undergraduate courses taught at BIOS. The Tudor Hill facility will continue to feature in BIOS public outreach activities, including public lectures, weekly tours, and the annual open-house day. In addition, there will be a new web page that will include general information on the Tudor Hill facility, as well as information and data for external research and education users.</AbstractNarration>
