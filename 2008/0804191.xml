    <AbstractNarration>Technical. A Gordon Research Conference on Defects in Semiconductors will be held at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, NH, August 3-8, 2008. The goal of the conference is to promote fundamental understanding of defects and defect-related phenomena in homogeneous and structured semiconductors. These defects occur, or are introduced, during growth and/or processing of electronic materials. The conference will provide a forum for interaction between university, government and industrial scientists. Topics include control of defects in ZnO, GaN, diamond, and organic semiconductors during growth and processing; interface defects that occur during heteroepitaxial growth of Si, SiC, and GaN; and discussions of atomic-scale imaging techniques, combined with state-of-the-art theoretical methods addressing fundamental atomic-level mechanisms of defects. Topics that are controversial and/or forward-looking will be emphasized. The conference deals with defects in a broad range of bulk and nanoscale electronic materials to assist advancing fundamental understanding in emerging materials such as wide-band-gap semiconductors and doped nanoparticles. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical. An important impact of this conference will be to increase the attendance of young scientists from underrepresented groups. Gordon conference setting and format encourage interactions on multiple levels, and among senior staff and those early in their careers. Efforts will be made to improve the inclusion of women and minorities in fields related to electronic materials. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established among universities, research institutions, and industry. The requested NSF funds will be used to facilitate participation in the meeting by young faculty, postdoctoral research associates and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
