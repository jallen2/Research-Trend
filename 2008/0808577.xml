    <AbstractNarration>Emerging infectious diseases threaten numerous wildlife populations, many of which are already experiencing declines. Precipitous declines of amphibians are of broad concern, and several diseases have been implicated in wholesale extinction events. However, diseases rarely act alone. Rather, multiple diseases and other factors such as habitat loss or invasive predators can impact a population in concert, magnifying effects on host populations. This research will investigate the effects of multiple emerging pathogens on the California red-legged frog, in Central Coastal California. The impacts of three pathogens will be measured separately and in combination to understand if the pathogens have synergistic impacts on the host population. This work will also examine how two other amphibian species that co-occur with California red-legged frogs may act to maintain the diseases in the region. This project will help to develop models and techniques that can be used generally to approach these complex ecological questions, with the goal of establishing more effective and timely interventions for at-risk species threatened by emerging diseases. Further, this project offers many opportunities for educational outreach; investigators will partner with several local science outreach programs to reach a diversity of audiences. Undergraduate and high school students also will be involved in the field and lab activities. This project will support the thesis research of a doctoral student.</AbstractNarration>
