    <AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Computational Models for Evaluating Long Term&lt;br/&gt;CO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key goal of this project is to produce a prototypical&lt;br/&gt;computational system to accurately predict the fate of injected CO2&lt;br/&gt;in conditions governed by multiphase flow, rock mechanics,&lt;br/&gt;multicomponent transport, thermodynamic phase behavior, chemical&lt;br/&gt;reactions within both the fluid and the rock, and the coupling of all&lt;br/&gt;these phenomena over multiple time and spatial scales.&lt;br/&gt;To tackle this grand challenge effort, a multidisciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;team has been assembled of senior researchers M. F. Wheeler,&lt;br/&gt;T. Arbogast, and M. Delshad of the Center for Subsurface Modeling&lt;br/&gt;and I. Duncan from the Bureau of Economic Geology at The&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at Austin, as well as M. Parashar of&lt;br/&gt;the Applied Software Systems Laboratory at Rutgers University. This&lt;br/&gt;group has expertise in (1) applied mathematics and computational&lt;br/&gt;science that includes multiscale and multiphysics algorithms, solvers,&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty, and optimization (2) computer science&lt;br/&gt;that includes dynamic adaptivity, model/code couplings, and data&lt;br/&gt;management and transport (3) compositional modeling and&lt;br/&gt;CO2 injection processes and (4) CO2 demonstration sites.&lt;br/&gt;In each of the third and fourth years of the project, we will&lt;br/&gt;host a two-day workshop for high school teachers, advanced high school&lt;br/&gt;students, and undergraduate students with an interest in high school&lt;br/&gt;teaching. We will provide training in the use of a sophisticated groundwater&lt;br/&gt;simulator, to be used as a tool to engage and pique the interest of&lt;br/&gt;high schoolers, perhaps leading some to careers in mathematics, the&lt;br/&gt;sciences, and interdisciplinary work. In addition, two postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;students and roughly two graduate students will be supported&lt;br/&gt;throughout the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geologic sequestration is a proven means of permanent CO2 greenhouse gas&lt;br/&gt;storage, but it is difficult to design and manage such efforts. Predictive&lt;br/&gt;computational simulation may be the only means to account for the lack of&lt;br/&gt;complete characterization of the subsurface environment, the multiple scales of&lt;br/&gt;the various interacting processes, the large areal extent of saline aquifers,&lt;br/&gt;and the need for long time predictions. This proposal will investigate high&lt;br/&gt;fidelity multiscale and multiphysics algorithms necessary for simulation of&lt;br/&gt;multiphase flow and transport coupled with geochemical reactions and related&lt;br/&gt;mineralogy, and geomechanical deformation in porous media to predict changes in&lt;br/&gt;rock properties during sequestration. The work will result in a prototypical&lt;br/&gt;computational framework with advanced numerical algorithms and underlying&lt;br/&gt;technology for research in CO2 applications, which has been validated and&lt;br/&gt;verified against field-scale experimental tests. The multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research team has expertise in (1) applied mathematics and computational&lt;br/&gt;science, (2) computer science and engineering, (3) compositional modeling and&lt;br/&gt;CO2 injection processes, and (4) CO2 demonstration sites.&lt;br/&gt;In each of the third and fourth years of the project, we will&lt;br/&gt;host a two-day workshop for high school teachers, advanced high school&lt;br/&gt;students, and undergraduate students with an interest in high school&lt;br/&gt;teaching.
