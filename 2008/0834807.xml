    <AbstractNarration>Ordinary PCs are widely employed for large scale scientific computing today. Released&lt;br/&gt;in 2004, BOINC middleware is managing over 500,000 volunteered PC nodes and&lt;br/&gt;providing computation power to around 30 scientific research projects including&lt;br/&gt;Rosetta@home, Climateprediction.net, and IBM World Community Grid. The main&lt;br/&gt;attraction of such "virtual clusters" is that computing is "free" as minimal additional&lt;br/&gt;hardware and personnel resources are needed. The potential for exploiting such idle&lt;br/&gt;cycles is immense since well under 1% of the world's 1 billion PCs are currently&lt;br/&gt;participating.&lt;br/&gt;Currently idle PCs are exploited for sequential and independent parallel tasks, but not&lt;br/&gt;communicating parallel tasks, a common HPC paradigm. The central goal of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to achieve robust execution of communicating parallel applications on networked&lt;br/&gt;ordinary PCs. The challenge is that ordinary desktops are "volatile", i.e., their&lt;br/&gt;availability changes suddenly and frequently based on desktop owner's actions.&lt;br/&gt;Checkpointing of parallel applications, the state of the art in fault tolerant scientific&lt;br/&gt;computing, is not sufficient for high failure rate environments.&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing the VolPEx framework (Parallel Execution on Volatile nodes)&lt;br/&gt;that employs managed redundancy as the core mechanism to achieve seamless&lt;br/&gt;forward application progress in the presence of routine failures. The canonical execution&lt;br/&gt;model consists of two or more concurrent replicas of each process with failed process&lt;br/&gt;replicas regenerated on-demand from healthy ones. The following communication APIs&lt;br/&gt;are provided for application development.&lt;br/&gt;1. Virtual Dataspace: An abstract API for asynchronous anonymous Put/Get&lt;br/&gt;communication among tasks. The BOINC programming model of independent tasks is&lt;br/&gt;being extended with the dataspace API to allow inter-task communication&lt;br/&gt;2. Volpex MPI: A subset implementation of MPI with a communication layer customized&lt;br/&gt;for execution on volatile nodes.&lt;br/&gt;The validation of this research will include execution of selected parallel applications on&lt;br/&gt;100s of nodes across campus LANs and 1000s of nodes across the globe under&lt;br/&gt;Volpex/BOINC.&lt;br/&gt;The ability to transform ordinary PCs into a virtual cluster to run parallel codes will have&lt;br/&gt;wide ranging impact. Virtually all scientists will get access to HPC while the need for&lt;br/&gt;clusters and the cost of purchasing, operating, and maintaining clusters will diminish.</AbstractNarration>
