    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kleshchev, Alexander &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0757852 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Oregon Eugene &lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference `Lie Algebraic Systems with Origins in Physics'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In January-June 2009, a half-year program "Algebraic Lie Theory" will take place at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge, England. One of the major events during the program will be the workshop "Lie Algebraic Systems with Origins in Physics" planned for 23-27 March, 2009. The workshop will bring together mathematicians and mathematical physicists working in such (overlapping) areas as W-algebras, Yangians, vertex algebras, positive characteristic Lie theory, conformal algebras, chiral algebras, quantum groups, Hecke algebras, Cherednik algebras, infinite dimensional Lie algebras, as well as related representation theory, geometry, combinatorics, and applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will provide rare and very important opportunities, especially for young researchers (including graduate students). It will bring together people working in different areas of Lie theory, mathematical physics, and representation theory. Instructional workshops are planned as part of the larger program at the Isaac Newton Institute. A volume of proceedings of the workshop is planned. This grant provides support for participation of U.S. mathematicians in this workshop. This support might be used by many participants in an especially effective way: once there, people might be able to stay at the Isaac Newton Institute for a longer period of time using additional funds of their own or apply for per diem from the Institute. At least half of the funds will be used to support women, minority, and young scientists (including graduate students).</AbstractNarration>
