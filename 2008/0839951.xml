    <AbstractNarration>DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF HIGH FREQUENCY SILICON CAPACITIVE&lt;br/&gt;RESONATORS FOR HIGH-Q OPERATION IN LIQUID MEDIA&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;1. Objectives&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is aimed at the design, fabrication, and characterization of bulk-mode capacitive&lt;br/&gt;silicon resonators capable of high-Q operation in liquid for high-resolution label-free biochemical&lt;br/&gt;detection and analysis. The goal is to demonstrate quality factors as high as 1000 in DI water for&lt;br/&gt;resonators in the 10-200MHz frequency range.&lt;br/&gt;2. Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Despite recent developments in the silicon resonator technologies and speculations on the&lt;br/&gt;suitability of such devices as high-precision mass sensors, no viable design or architecture for&lt;br/&gt;practical sensory applications has been demonstrated for such devices. In particular, operation of&lt;br/&gt;capacitive micro-resonators in liquid with an acceptably high quality factor remains an open&lt;br/&gt;problem. This effort will develop and demonstrate new design concepts and fabrication&lt;br/&gt;approaches for minimization of viscous damping caused by the surrounding liquid. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;partially encapsulated resonators will be designed, fabricated and characterized in aqueous liquid&lt;br/&gt;media.&lt;br/&gt;3. Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Successful development of the proposed resonators will pave the way towards implementation of&lt;br/&gt;highly sensitive label-free biochemical sensor arrays with numerous applications in biology,&lt;br/&gt;medicine and health sciences.&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcomes of the proposed activities will fuel the PI?s ongoing lecture and lab course&lt;br/&gt;development activities under the NSF NUE grant. The PI will have research assistantship&lt;br/&gt;openings for undergraduate students under this project. The financial support for the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students will be provided by the University of Denver through the Partners in&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship (PINS) program. In selection of the undergraduate research assistants priority will be&lt;br/&gt;given to students from the minority and under-represented groups</AbstractNarration>
