    <AbstractNarration>so This award provides NSF support for a multidisciplinary planning workshop, held April 25, 2008, in St. Louis, Missouri, in conjunction with CPSWEEK 2008. The purpose of the workshop is to examine research needs and advance a multidisciplinary research agenda in Cyber-Physical Systems. Contributing subfields include distributed, real-time and embedded systems, dynamics and control theory and engineering, networking and communication, formal methods, learning and state estimation, robotics, human-in-the loop design, sensor and actuator nets, hardware and system software platforms for embedded systems, and physical device and system engineering. Cyber-physical systems are seen as the next generation of engineered systems, in which cyber capability (computation, networked control, and communication) is pervasive and deeply integrated into the design and interactions of physical and engineered systems.</AbstractNarration>
