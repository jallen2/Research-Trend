    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the subject of algebraic dynamics. Orbits of&lt;br/&gt;points under iterates of maps are among the most important objects in&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. In the study of algebraic dynamics, the map is typically a&lt;br/&gt;polynomial or rational map in one or more variables. It is natural to&lt;br/&gt;ask what kinds of algebraic relations infinite families of elements&lt;br/&gt;within an orbit can satisfy. The PI conjectures that if infinitely&lt;br/&gt;many elements within an orbit satisfy an algebraic relation, then that&lt;br/&gt;relation must in some sense be stable under some iterate of the map.&lt;br/&gt;This conjecture may be thought of as a general dynamical analog of the&lt;br/&gt;well-known Mordell-Lang conjecture for group varieties. Thus far,&lt;br/&gt;this conjecture has been proved in a few special cases using a&lt;br/&gt;combination of diophantine and p-adic analytic methods. The main goal&lt;br/&gt;of this project is to prove the conjecture in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the interaction between algebraic maps and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic equations. An algebraic map is a function such as f(x) =&lt;br/&gt;2x+3. Applying the map repeatedly to a single number gives what is&lt;br/&gt;called the orbit of that number under f. For example, if f(x) = 2x+3&lt;br/&gt;and we start with the number 1, then the orbit is 1, 5, 13, 29, 61,&lt;br/&gt;and so on. One can also form orbits out of pairs, triplets, and&lt;br/&gt;n-tuples of numbers by allowing f to be an algebraic map in more than&lt;br/&gt;one variable. An algebraic equation is simply a more general version&lt;br/&gt;of the familiar quadratic polynomials one encounters in beginning&lt;br/&gt;algebra, except that it may have more variables and have higher degree&lt;br/&gt;terms. One expects that if infinitely many numbers in an orbit&lt;br/&gt;satisfy some algebraic relation, then that relation has an innate&lt;br/&gt;connection with the algebraic map. The PI states a precise conjecture&lt;br/&gt;along these lines, which he hopes to prove. The strategy for the&lt;br/&gt;proof involves a wide range of techniques, some number theoretic, some&lt;br/&gt;geometric, and some analytic.</AbstractNarration>
