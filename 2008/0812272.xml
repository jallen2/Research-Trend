    <AbstractNarration>Probabilistic databases have many important applications in areas such as &lt;br/&gt;crime fighting, data cleaning and integration, moving object tracking, and &lt;br/&gt;science, and have recently moved into the limelight of data management &lt;br/&gt;research. Probabilistic databases are expected to allow for new data &lt;br/&gt;management applications to arise that currently require substantial &lt;br/&gt;bootstrapping and development effort, if they are feasible at all. &lt;br/&gt;Probabilistic databases allow for very flexible ways of representing and &lt;br/&gt;managing incompleteness and are a possible foundation for a new breed of &lt;br/&gt;more encompassing and powerful data integration systems. Probabilistic &lt;br/&gt;databases could give rise to more effective, lazy integration systems, in &lt;br/&gt;which the input is initially inserted into the database with a high degree &lt;br/&gt;of uncertainty, which is subsequently reduced using various forms of &lt;br/&gt;corpus data, evidence, and probabilistic mappings and rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to perform foundational research and &lt;br/&gt;develop a probabilistic database management system that can support such &lt;br/&gt;applications. The first aim of this project is to work on efficient query &lt;br/&gt;processing techniques, with a particular focus on the essential problems &lt;br/&gt;of computing tuple confidence values and the closely related problem of &lt;br/&gt;conditioning a probabilistic database. Both are known to be &lt;br/&gt;computationally hard, and efficient techniques are expected to have to &lt;br/&gt;make use of the state of the art in algorithms for constraint &lt;br/&gt;satisfaction. In some applications, such as ad-hoc query processing for &lt;br/&gt;decision support, exact query results are not necessary. Previous work has &lt;br/&gt;pointed out efficient approximation techniques for simple queries, namely &lt;br/&gt;for the ranked retrieval of results of conjunctive queries together with &lt;br/&gt;their confidences; however, there is currently no work on approximating &lt;br/&gt;queries that themselves make use of confidence values, for example in &lt;br/&gt;selection operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximating expressive, compositional queries on &lt;br/&gt;probabilistic databases is a second main focus of the planned project. &lt;br/&gt;Thirdly, nearly all previous work on probabilistic databases has focussed &lt;br/&gt;on designing representation systems and query languages and laying the &lt;br/&gt;foundations for efficient query processing. For real data management &lt;br/&gt;applications to use probabilistic database systems in the future, it must &lt;br/&gt;also be possible to update such databases, and to run transactional &lt;br/&gt;programs on them. While no work on this exists in the literature, &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty in the data poses a number of fundamental challenges to be &lt;br/&gt;addressed as the third main aim of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The homepage of the MayBMS project which is the subject of this proposal &lt;br/&gt;can be found at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/maybms/ .</AbstractNarration>
