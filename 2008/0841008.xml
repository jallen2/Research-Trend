    <AbstractNarration>While distinctive sex chromosomes are a conspicuous feature of the nuclei of diverse&lt;br/&gt;organisms, the evolutionary processes responsible for the origins of separate genders&lt;br/&gt;and sex chromosomes in animals, plants and fungi remain largely unknown. The&lt;br/&gt;independent origin of separate sexes (that is, male individuals and female individuals) in&lt;br/&gt;many flowering plant lineages provides biologists with an opportunity to investigate&lt;br/&gt;various stages in the evolution of gender determination and sex chromosomes. For&lt;br/&gt;example, separate sexes have evolved within the last two million years in the genus&lt;br/&gt;Asparagus and the genes responsible for gender determination have been mapped to a&lt;br/&gt;relatively small region on otherwise recombining chromosomes. PIs, Leebens-Mack&lt;br/&gt;and Pires will sequence across the newly evolving female (proto-X) and male (proto-Y)&lt;br/&gt;forms of this region in garden asparagus in order to test hypotheses concerning the&lt;br/&gt;early evolution of incipient sex chromosomes and to identify candidate genes that may&lt;br/&gt;be responsible for gender determination.&lt;br/&gt;By investigating the mechanisms that promote repression of recombination between&lt;br/&gt;genes influencing male and female function in flowering plants, the results from this&lt;br/&gt;project will have implications for crop improvement and the fundamental processes that&lt;br/&gt;shape genome structure. Undergraduate students will also be trained in genome&lt;br/&gt;annotation and comparative genomics.</AbstractNarration>
