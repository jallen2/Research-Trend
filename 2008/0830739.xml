    <AbstractNarration>This research involves the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for survivable routing &lt;br/&gt;in next generation networks. Current research in this area are either heuristic based that &lt;br/&gt;lacks performance guarantee, or computationally intensive that lacks scalability. The PI &lt;br/&gt;concentrates on efficient survivable routing in a very important class of network topologies &lt;br/&gt;known as minimum isolated failure immune networks. Efficient algorithms will be designed for &lt;br/&gt;survivable routing in such networks. This transformative research will provide a solid &lt;br/&gt;theoretical foundation for survivable routing in next generation networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The INTELLECTUAL MERIT of this research lies in exploring a new dimension of research in &lt;br/&gt;survivable routing in next generation networks, using combinatorial optimization and &lt;br/&gt;algorithms as tools of investigation.&lt;br/&gt;The research will extend the frontiers of knowledge in survivable networks in the following &lt;br/&gt;directions: (1) improving heuristic based or integer linear programming based algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for survivable lightpath routing in mesh network to polynomial time optimal algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;survivable lightpath routing in minimum isolated failure immune networks; (2) extending &lt;br/&gt;heuristic based QoS-aware redundant tree schemes to QoS-aware redundant tree schemes with &lt;br/&gt;provably good performance; (3) extending heuristic based double-failure protection to &lt;br/&gt;guaranteed double-failure protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of BROADER IMPACTS, this research will lead to (i) integration of research into &lt;br/&gt;educational experiences of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, especially &lt;br/&gt;students from underrepresented groups;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) unification of seemingly diverse disciplines which have common underlying mathematical &lt;br/&gt;foundation; (iii) dissemination of research results through presentation and publication &lt;br/&gt;in high-quality conferences and journals.</AbstractNarration>
