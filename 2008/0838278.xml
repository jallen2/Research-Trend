    <AbstractNarration>Semiparametric methods continue to be an active research area,&lt;br/&gt;especially as computing resources and power grow. These methods are used&lt;br/&gt;for inference in models with both parametric and nonparametric&lt;br/&gt;components. Work in this setting ranges from semiparametric modeling and&lt;br/&gt;efficiency to semiparametric regression. The former involves making&lt;br/&gt;efficient inferences in the presence of infinite dimensional nuisance&lt;br/&gt;parameters. The latter corresponds to regression models with parametric&lt;br/&gt;errors and unspecified (nonparametric) regression functions. Fundamental&lt;br/&gt;work remains to be done in high dimensional missing data problems, both&lt;br/&gt;in the setting of frequentist and Bayesian inference and in estimating&lt;br/&gt;regression functions with the complications posed in many different&lt;br/&gt;areas of application. The workshop brings together leaders in the field&lt;br/&gt;of semiparametric methodology and young researchers. The invited&lt;br/&gt;speakers all are very distinguished individuals who have done&lt;br/&gt;outstanding work in semiparametrics and have co-authored three of the&lt;br/&gt;seminal texts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flexible modeling with few assumptions is an integral component of&lt;br/&gt;solving many scientific problems. Semiparametric methods are a way to&lt;br/&gt;accomplish this. Major advances have been made in the past thirty years.&lt;br/&gt;However, fundamental work remains to be done in high dimensional&lt;br/&gt;problems with incomplete data, in estimating regression functions with&lt;br/&gt;the complications posed in many different areas of application, among&lt;br/&gt;other areas. Applications for such work are wide ranging and include&lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal models, capture-recapture models, and measurement error&lt;br/&gt;models in environmental applications, classification and testing in in&lt;br/&gt;genetics and genomics, and missing data models in longitudinal&lt;br/&gt;observational studies and clinical trials. The workshop provides an&lt;br/&gt;excellent opportunity to discuss the many recent significant&lt;br/&gt;developments in semiparametric methodology and to identify important&lt;br/&gt;problems and new research directions.</AbstractNarration>
