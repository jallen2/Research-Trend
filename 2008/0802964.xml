    <AbstractNarration>Ringland&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0802994&lt;br/&gt;Carbonara&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0802964&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; URGE to Compute provides a year-long computationally&lt;br/&gt;intensive Undergraduate Research Group Experience in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences to an annual cohort of 12 undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;mathematics majors. A collaboration of the University at Buffalo&lt;br/&gt;(UB), Buffalo State College (BSC), and the Hauptman-Woodward&lt;br/&gt;Medical Research Institute, the project brings together an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary group of 16 faculty researchers who have a&lt;br/&gt;shared sense of the importance of computation in the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;sciences, a record of successful supervision of undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;research, and a commitment to increasing the effectiveness of the&lt;br/&gt;preparation of students at UB and BSC for post-graduate education&lt;br/&gt;and careers in the many fields that now demand a combination of&lt;br/&gt;computational and mathematical skills. Prior to commencing the&lt;br/&gt;full-year research experience, students take calculus,&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, linear algebra, and a new sophomore&lt;br/&gt;course in scientific and mathematical computing which was&lt;br/&gt;developed with this project in mind and is offered to all math&lt;br/&gt;majors. Special efforts are made to recruit minorities and&lt;br/&gt;women, who are underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;The year of research begins in the Spring semester of the&lt;br/&gt;students' junior year with: a support course that provides&lt;br/&gt;background on the theme that unifies all the research projects&lt;br/&gt;for that year (e.g. stochastic processes in 2009); a team-taught&lt;br/&gt;course on the tools and methods of computational research;&lt;br/&gt;regular meetings with the research project mentor; and the first&lt;br/&gt;part of a seminar that runs throughout the year. Research&lt;br/&gt;continues through the summer, and students write an honors thesis&lt;br/&gt;or a paper for publication in the Fall. Computational resources&lt;br/&gt;available to the students include a 2000-node cluster and a&lt;br/&gt;visualization laboratory at UB's Center for Computational&lt;br/&gt;Research. Talks by eminent outside researchers are a feature of&lt;br/&gt;the seminar, and students attend a national conference in an area&lt;br/&gt;related to their research, disseminate their results at regional&lt;br/&gt;meetings and local exhibitions of undergraduate scholarship, and&lt;br/&gt;participate in outreach activities at local high schools. After&lt;br/&gt;the year is over, in their final undergraduate semester, the now&lt;br/&gt;highly trained students serve as teaching assistants in the&lt;br/&gt;introductory differential equations course that is taken by all&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, engineering, and science students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Over the multi-year course of the project, the research&lt;br/&gt;focuses on a wide variety of topics of societal importance. &lt;br/&gt;These include optical fiber communications, agricultural pest&lt;br/&gt;control, cryptography, medical imaging, and the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;materials (from semiconductor devices to mudflows). The project&lt;br/&gt;not only trains a select annual cohort in these vital areas, but&lt;br/&gt;also reaches a substantial fraction of all math majors at UB and&lt;br/&gt;BSC with a curriculum that is computationally enriched by the&lt;br/&gt;preparation and support courses for the project, and a&lt;br/&gt;departmental life that is enhanced by the seminars and the&lt;br/&gt;exposure to peers engaged in research. The project is supported&lt;br/&gt;by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of&lt;br/&gt;Multidisciplinary Activities, and the EHR Division of&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
