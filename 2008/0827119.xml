    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: ECS-0827119 &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Wei You &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to request funds for the support of travel awards for graduate students, post-docs, and young faculty to attend the Symposium AA " Conjugated Organic Materials ?? Synthesis, Structure, Device, and Applications " to be held at the 2008 Spring Materials Research Society Meeting (Mar 24-28, 2008, San Francisco, CA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Given the current status of the field of organic electronics and photonics, this symposium is timely, and will be of great interest to the general materials community. Specifically, we envision a high-impact, cross-disciplinary, and comprehensive symposium on organic conjugated materials -- the electrically-active component of organic electronics and photonics -- with emphasis on the chemistry, physics, the processing-structure-property relationships, as well as device fabrication and characterization of organic molecular materials and polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;There will be ten half-day oral sessions and three evening poster sessions and we expect many invited and contributed speakers with a large number were planned This symposium will provide an excellent opportunity for the attendees (especially graduate students) to stay current with the state-of-the-art researches and to promote fruitful discussions among researchers.</AbstractNarration>
