    <AbstractNarration>Lewis&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0806057&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his students study the interplay&lt;br/&gt;between variational analysis, intuitive, possibly randomized,&lt;br/&gt;general-purpose nonsmooth optimization algorithms, and&lt;br/&gt;applications to concrete models, particularly in robust control. &lt;br/&gt;A paradigm, originating with Demmel in the 1980's, relating&lt;br/&gt;conditioning, ill-posedness, and computational speed, inspires&lt;br/&gt;the investigator's thinking. The study of matrix pseudospectra&lt;br/&gt;powerfully illustrates the general technique: fundamental&lt;br/&gt;indicators of transient dynamical behavior, pseudospectra have a&lt;br/&gt;rich structure, blending complex and matrix analysis,&lt;br/&gt;semi-algebraic geometry, and numerical linear algebra, all&lt;br/&gt;ingredients in pseudospectral optimization. Semi-algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry in particular is developing into a fundamental tool not&lt;br/&gt;just in applications such as pseudospectra, but throughout&lt;br/&gt;variational analysis. The investigator uses this approach, for&lt;br/&gt;example, to study novel structural tools such as "partial&lt;br/&gt;smoothness", thereby analyzing convergence rates observed in&lt;br/&gt;computational practice. Fundamental to the investigator's&lt;br/&gt;approach is a complex blend of variational analysis, classical&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, numerical computation, and applied modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Often the designer of a complex engineering system varies&lt;br/&gt;certain features in order to optimize some aspect of system&lt;br/&gt;performance. A simple example is a shock-absorber: by varying&lt;br/&gt;the grade of lubricant it contains, the manufacturer can modify&lt;br/&gt;how stiff a suspension system feels. Finding optimal choices for&lt;br/&gt;damping vibrations in such a physical, electronic, communications&lt;br/&gt;or information system is "nonsmooth": choices are very sensitive&lt;br/&gt;to slight changes in the system, one reason they seem hard to&lt;br/&gt;compute. The investigator facilitates this important but&lt;br/&gt;challenging optimization process by blending mathematical&lt;br/&gt;modeling and analysis with scientific computation. He&lt;br/&gt;disseminates his research energetically through expository and&lt;br/&gt;technical publications, high-profile lectures, and online, to&lt;br/&gt;diverse international scientific and engineering audiences. As&lt;br/&gt;an integral part of the project, the investigator's PhD students&lt;br/&gt;develop crucial skills bridging divisions between sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory and the many practical applications of&lt;br/&gt;nonsmooth optimization.</AbstractNarration>
