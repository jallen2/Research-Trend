    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: Optical Forces in Integrated Microphotonic Devices&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michelle L. Povinelli, University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microphotonic devices, such as photonic crystals and microresonators, control light on the sub-wavelength scale. Large-scale integration on semiconductor chips will enable all-optical circuits capable of complex information processing. To achieve this goal, mechanisms for tuning, adapting, and reconfiguring individual devices are needed. The proposed work will use optical forces for this purpose. Preliminary results have shown that light can be used to pull two parallel cantilevers together or push them apart. This effect will be used to envision new optical devices whose properties can be controlled all-optically. Electromagnetic simulations will be used to calculate optical forces in lithographically-fabricated structures such as coupled waveguide cantilevers and photonic crystal slabs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will establish a new mechanism for positioning and control on the nanoscale. The results are expected to have broad impact in microphotonics, integrated optics, quantum optomechanics, and optical trapping. The work will benefit from cross-fertilization of ideas with the MEMS community: optical forces provide an alternative actuation mechanism to traditional electrostatic approaches and will result in unique application niches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed work includes integrated research and educational activities that will impact the scientific research, USC, and Los Angeles communities. The PI will give lectures on engineering careers to groups of female and minority students. The PI and her research group will also work with the USC Center for Engineering Diversity to develop two programs for educationally-disadvantaged K-12 students: interactive optics demos and classroom talks by USC undergraduates that relate electrical engineering to everyday life.</AbstractNarration>
