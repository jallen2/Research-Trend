    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Univeristy of North Carolina Greensboro Regional Mathematics and Statistics Conference which will be held at UNCG on November 3, 2012. The main goal of the UNCG Regional Mathematics and Statistics Conference is to provide a venue for students at all levels to share and experience research in the field of mathematics and statistics. This conference started as an annual undergraduate student conference in 2005 and has now expanded to include graduate researchers since 2009. The conference is completely focused on student research. We showcase this aspect of the conference by having only one plenary speech by an expert faculty and rest by students. The conference has established a tradition of attracting active student researchers and their faculty mentors from North Carolina and Virginia. The NSF support will allow us to attract participants from the entire Southeastern Atlantic region. The conference website is:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.uncg.edu/mat/rmsc/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The opportunity for personal interaction among students and between students and faculty is a hallmark of our conference. These interactions enhance the research infrastructure and are essential for the success of student research and for training a new generation of mathematicians and statisticians. Moreover, due to the funding of NSF we have been able to support women and minorities, currently underrepresented in mathematical research. Students from these underrepresented groups accounted for about half of the supported participants.</AbstractNarration>
