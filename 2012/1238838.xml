    <AbstractNarration>The project entitled - Nanoscience Transforming STEM Education at Hampton University - has the goal to develop and implement an integrated, multidisciplinary STEM research and education program in nanoscience that prepares students for graduate studies and professional careers in the field of nanoscience. The project seeks to answer the question: Will the implementation of an interdisciplinary, nanoscience project at the institution accomplish a desired transformation within the university that will result in improved recruitment, retention and graduation of more, highly-qualified STEM graduates for entry into graduate schools or the STEM workforce? The objectives are to develop an undergraduate nanoscience curriculum concentration; engage students in nanoscience-related research throughout the academic year and summer session at national laboratories, industries and international universities; offer professional workshops and seminars; provide "next steps" educational and career support; provide professional faculty development to increase their publications records; promote the nanoscience project to incoming and current STEM students to interest them in pursuing the nanoscience concentration; and increase awareness of local high school students in nanoscience and career opportunities in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implementation activities require participation across targeted disciplines including Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Engineering, Mathematics and Physics where minorities and women are underrepresented. The institution's student body is approximately 88% African American. This project will greatly assist in the institution's ongoing efforts to strengthen the undergraduate research environment in nanoscience and STEM research and to increase the number of women and minorities who pursue Ph.D.degrees and careers in nanoscience and STEM fields. A significant component of the project is to give students international research partnership experiences by having internship opportunities at international universities and thereby better prepare them to participate in the global workforce.</AbstractNarration>
