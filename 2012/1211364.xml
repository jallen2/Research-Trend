    <AbstractNarration>Most of the equations derived to model physical phenomena support some form&lt;br/&gt;of special solutions such as standing or traveling waves, or other coherent&lt;br/&gt;structures. These special solutions often correspond to real, observable&lt;br/&gt;physical phenomena in the systems that these model equations are meant to&lt;br/&gt;represent. One important aspect of this modeling is the stability of these&lt;br/&gt;special solutions, as the stability of solutions determines if these&lt;br/&gt;solutions are likely to be physically observed. This project is aimed at&lt;br/&gt;understanding the stability and instability these coherent structures.&lt;br/&gt;This usually amounts to computing the index of the operator found by&lt;br/&gt;linearizing about one of these coherent structures - that is the number of&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues of positive real part. This counts the dimension of the&lt;br/&gt;unstable manifold to the solution, giving valuable information on the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of nearby solutions. While the emphasis of this project is on&lt;br/&gt;conservative systems we consider both conservative and dissipative systems.&lt;br/&gt;We use analytical, asymptotic and geometric techniques to identify unstable&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues and to count the number of such eigenvalues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many mathematical models that are important for science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering that support solutions in the form of traveling waves. One&lt;br/&gt;example is an equation known as the Korteweg-DeVries equation, an equation&lt;br/&gt;which governs the behavior of water in a narrow shallow body such as a&lt;br/&gt;canal. The Korteweg-DeVries equation has solutions called solitary waves&lt;br/&gt;which behave just as experience would suggest - they correspond to a&lt;br/&gt;quantity of water which propagates along without changing shape. Similar&lt;br/&gt;equations govern the propagation of light waves, propagation of a&lt;br/&gt;disturbance through a network such as the power grid, etc. It is&lt;br/&gt;important to understand the extent to which these solutions accurately&lt;br/&gt;model the behavior of the underlying system. This is the question of&lt;br/&gt;stability, which measures how robust these special solutions are. If a&lt;br/&gt;special solution like a traveling wave is stable it means that nearby&lt;br/&gt;solutions behave in a similar way. This means such solutions are robust,&lt;br/&gt;and are likely to be observed: if the conditions are not exactly those&lt;br/&gt;necessary to produce a traveling wave but are close we expect to see a&lt;br/&gt;solution which is close to the special one. An unstable solution, on the&lt;br/&gt; other hand, is not robust. In order to observe these unstable solution&lt;br/&gt;one must produce exactly the right conditions, which is very difficult&lt;br/&gt;to achieve in practice. This means that such solutions are more of&lt;br/&gt; mathematical interest than of physical importance. This project is&lt;br/&gt;primarily concerned with developing mathematical techniques to understand&lt;br/&gt; the stability of traveling waves in a number of models including the&lt;br/&gt; Kuramoto model (a model for the behavior of power networks) and several&lt;br/&gt; nonlinear dispersive equations (which govern light waves in nonlinear&lt;br/&gt; media, water waves, waves in plasmas and many other phenomena).</AbstractNarration>
