    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to achieve key technology, infrastructure, and&lt;br/&gt;regulatory science advances for next generation medical systems based&lt;br/&gt;on the concept of medical application platforms (MAPs). A MAP is a&lt;br/&gt;safety/security-critical real-time computing platform for: (a)&lt;br/&gt;integrating heterogeneous devices and medical IT systems, (b) hosting&lt;br/&gt;application programs ("apps") that provide medical utility through the&lt;br/&gt;ability to both acquire information and update/control integrated&lt;br/&gt;devices, IT systems, and displays. The project will develop formal&lt;br/&gt;architectural and behavioral specification languages for defining&lt;br/&gt;MAPs, with a focus on techniques that enable compositional reasoning&lt;br/&gt;about MAP component interoperability and safety. These formal&lt;br/&gt;languages will include an extensible property language to enable the&lt;br/&gt;specification of real-time, quality-of-service, and attributes&lt;br/&gt;specific to medical contexts that can be leveraged by code generation,&lt;br/&gt;testing, and verification tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will work closely with a synergistic team of clinicians,&lt;br/&gt;device industry partners, regulators, and medical device&lt;br/&gt;interoperability and safety standard organizations to develop an open&lt;br/&gt;source MAP innovation platform to enable key stakeholders within the&lt;br/&gt;nation's health care ecosphere to identify, prototype, and evaluate&lt;br/&gt;solutions to key technology and regulatory challenges that must be&lt;br/&gt;overcome to develop a commodity market of regulated MAP components.&lt;br/&gt;Because MAPs provide pre-built certified infrastructure and building&lt;br/&gt;blocks for rapidly developing multi-device medical applications, this&lt;br/&gt;research has the potential to usher in a new paradigm of medical&lt;br/&gt;system that significantly increases the pace of innovation, lowers&lt;br/&gt;development costs, enables new functionality by aggregating multiple&lt;br/&gt;devices into a system of systems, and achieves greater system safety.</AbstractNarration>
