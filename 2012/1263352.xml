    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The Academy for the Environment REU program enables students to explore the intersection of socioeconomic and natural sciences in ways that inform adaptive watershed management in the eastern Sierra Nevada region of Nevada, specifically within the Lake Tahoe Basin and the surrounding northwestern Great Basin high desert. This program is a continuation of a previous NSF REU Site award that supported research in the Lake Tahoe-Truckee River-Pyramid Lake watershed; information on that REU program can be found on the undergraduate research website (http://environment.unr.edu/undergraduateresearch/opportunities/reu.html). The current REU program encompasses a wide range of interdisciplinary research which examines various approaches to assessing, modeling, and managing water resources in the context of climate change and diminishing snowpack in the region. The research group has framed its overall research theme in the context of the "value of snow", in order to promote the integration of a wide range of socioeconomic and environmental research activities, ranging from shore zone studies of water quality and invasive species at Lake Tahoe, to the effects of habitat disturbance (e.g., mining, energy development, fire, vegetation change) on critical habitat for sensitive species in the Great Basin. Students are involved in on-going research that identifies communities and groups that are affected by changes in snowpack, consider alternative outcomes where mitigation strategies and policies assist in adaptation, and quantify impacts in biophysical as well as dollar terms. The research projects are situated within a biologically diverse region, a unique area that joins the high desert with subalpine ecological systems. This confluence of systems provides varied and compelling research opportunities in mountain, desert, and riparian biotic communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Through this team-oriented research experience, students are gaining exposure to diverse scientific inquiries and technologies, and learning how the socioeconomic and natural sciences inform land use policy and adaptive management when faced with changing economic and natural resources. More broadly, the program exposes students to integrated research questions that connect these ecosystems to larger questions of how snow levels influence water availability, usage and conservation in the West. Advanced technologies used in data collection and analysis allow students to gain experience in state-of-the-art research software. Nationally-recruited students examine how these technologies influence the production of knowledge as they refine their scope of research. This program emphasizes team building, creating a positive work environment, and the role students play in these processes. As a result, the REU program is expanding student understanding of, and participation in, effective research programs while also producing research that makes meaningful contributions to the field. This REU Site project is successfully linking students, faculty, and natural resource managers through a collective effort aimed at enhancing our scientific understanding of regional watersheds in an applied research context.</AbstractNarration>
