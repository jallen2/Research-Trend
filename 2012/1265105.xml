    <AbstractNarration>High Frequency Irreversible Electroporation (H-FIRE) is a new, minimally invasive, non-thermal tissue ablation technique in which a tumor is exposed to bursts of very short electric fields for approximately 2 minutes. These pulses structurally rearrange the lipid bilayer of cells a target region inducing cell death. As opposed to other focal ablation techniques, H-FIRE does not affect major blood vessels, nerves or the extracellular matrix making unresectable tumors treatable. The goal of this project is to transfer fundamental technology for solid tumor treatment from the laboratory to clinical application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of this minimally invasive technology facilitates the treatment of tumors currently inoperable with surgical resection or other focal ablation technologies due to their proximity to critical structures such as nerves and major blood vessels. Some tumor types are known to become chemo-resistant and radiation exposure must be closely regulated, especially in younger patients. Thermal-ablation techniques suffer from heat sinking effects by local vessels and tight control of treated regions is challenging. H-FIRE has the potential to complement these other technologies as a standard of care. If successful, a direct result of this project will be the development of an instrument which will be made available for clinicians and researchers to evaluate H-FIRE based therapies.</AbstractNarration>
