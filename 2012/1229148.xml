    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-29148&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Rullkoetter, Paul; Davidson, Bradley; Fitzpatrick, Clare; Laz, Peter J; Shelburne, Kevin&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Denver&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI/Acq.: A Biplane Fluoroscopy System for Dynamic Imaging of In-Vivo Human Motion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring an instrument referred to as Biplanar (2D) Fluoroscopy System, aims to accurately measure kinematics. The instrument, currently the most advanced commercially available technology to record human skeletal motion, utilizes specialized software that can translate the measured data into images of high accuracy and resolution. In collaboration with existing computational research capabilities at the institution, the Biplanar (2D) Fuoroscopy System will be mainly used in the Human Dynamics Laboratory, thus stimulating an important expansion in biomechanics research at the home institution, along with the five other collaborating institutions and three clinical centers. The system is expected to be transformative to biomechanics research, both as a direct measurement instrument of previously unreported joint kinematics and as input to state-of-the-art computational models. Moreover, the resulting research is also expected to be comprehensive in the combination of experimental and modeling capabilities (whole-body motion, electromyography and force measurements and musculoskeletal, finite element, and probabilistic modeling). Accurate measurement of kinematics using the instrument should contribute to create scientific advancements in orthopedics and implant design, assistive technologies, understanding injury mechanisms, rehabilitation, and motor control of human movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The instrument can greatly impact the capability to improve patient outcomes. Given the clinical nature of the proposed work, new biomechanical designs and discoveries could translate into improving the quality of life for those suffering from health injuries. It also contribute to build an exceptional research and education environment for the institution, partner universities and the Rocky Mountain West. The acquired system will provide active learning and research experiences for students in STEM outreach programs, both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as medical students and clinical residents.</AbstractNarration>
