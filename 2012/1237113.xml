    <AbstractNarration>This Innovation Corps project proposes a technology that will focus on reducing the time, cost and effort, and on extending the capability, associated with machining of primarily but not limited to semiconductors and ceramics such as silicon, silicon carbide, sapphire, and others. The proposed technology (Micro Laser Assisted Machining) benefits the manufacture of challenging materials that are hard and brittle. The 50% decrease in material hardness during the Micro Laser Assisted Machining process can be directly correlated to the improved tool life and doubling of machining productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this innovation will eventually result in entirely new capabilities relative to production of materials and products currently not viable or achievable due to processing or use-limitations. Potential applications to emerging technologies, such as turbines and plug-in electric vehicles, where advanced high power and high temperature operation of devices is required, such as IGBTs, may prove to be compatible with the micro laser assisted machining processing technology, possibly resulting in reduced overall manufacturing costs and improved quality.</AbstractNarration>
