    <AbstractNarration>The NSF Divisions of Chemistry (CHE) and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) fund this award to the National Academy of Sciences to support the core activities of the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST). The BCST has broad representation from academe and industry and uses its collective expertise to identify the needs of the community and to provide peer-reviewed consensus reports, workshops, and symposia, as broad outreach into the chemical community and beyond. The BCST enhances the impacts of the chemistry and chemical engineering communities by engaging in questions of importance to federal decision-makers. It addresses timely research problems such as sustainability and energy, and safety and security. The Board also proactively examines topics of importance to the larger chemical enterprise, such as education and training issues, employment concerns, and changes in the research and funding models. By identifying and recruiting top experts to its ad hoc studies, BCST ensures that the present state of technical knowledge is applied to the policy issues facing decision-makers. By raising issues impacting the conduct of chemistry and chemical engineering research with federal officials, it helps assure that the community of practitioners can remain at the forefront of knowledge.</AbstractNarration>
