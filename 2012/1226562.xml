    <AbstractNarration>The lack of positive contact between members of different racial groups has constituted a major social problem throughout American history. Even though racial and ethic diversity in the United States is growing, interracial contact remains relatively rare. Positive interracial contact is important because it has been linked to reductions in prejudice and discrimination and to greater access to intellectual, social and economic capital. When interracial contact occurs, however, research has demonstrated that it is rife with anxiety and discomfort for both racial majority and minority group members. Furthermore, people's anxiety and discomfort during interracial contact has been associated with decreased interest in pursuing future interracial contact. The present research examines how two factors - the racial diversity of an interaction partner's friendship network and the goals that he or she adopts for the interaction - influence people's experiences during interracial interactions. This research proposes a novel, theoretically based model for how these factors independently and collectively influence people's comfort and anxiety when engaged in interracial interactions and their desire to engage in future interracial interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While previous research has examined how racially diverse (vs. homogenous) friendship networks affects interracial interaction expectations, this work examines the role of friendship networks in the context of another situational factor - people's goals for the interaction. Five experimental studies will test whether an interaction partner's racial friendship network (racially diverse or racial homogeneous) and the partner's goals for the interaction (learning or performance goals) influence ethnic minority and White individuals' interaction experiences. In particular, we will measure Black, Hispanic and White college students' experiences of social identity threat, anxiety, and avoidant behavior prior to and during the interaction, as well as their interest in engaging in future interracial interactions. It is hypothesized that an interaction partner who has a racially diverse friend network and who also adopts a learning goal prior to the interaction will reduce participants' social identity threat, anxiety and avoidance behavior, and will foster a more positive interaction. Thus the research will test whether shifts in people's goals within the interaction context can reduce identity threat, opening the door for positive interracial contact?even in the absence of a diverse friendship network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By exploring the perspectives of majority and minority group members, this research will provide novel theoretical and empirical contributions to the existing literatures on interracial contact and social identity threat by broadening our understanding of the challenges faced by people engaged in interracial contact. Moreover, this research will provide practical guidance on how to better structure interracial interactions to facilitate smoother exchanges and greater enjoyment for both minority and majority group members. This understanding is essential as we enter an age of increased globalization and intergroup contact and as we strive to maintain our competitiveness both at home and internationally. As faculty of color, both PIs are committed to broadening diversity with the sciences and thus serve as role models and mentors for graduate and undergraduate students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds that will be involved in the planning, execution, dissemination, and publication of the research findings.</AbstractNarration>
