    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a web-based, validated instrument to monitor, as the academic term progresses, student understanding of a wide range of introductory physics concepts. The distinguishing feature of the approach is a between-student testing mode of inquiry that allows assessment on a weekly timescale. The system rests upon a well-established body of research on student learning, forgetting, re-learning, and interference. The system coordinates selecting students for testing, test administration, and real-time analysis for instructors. Detailed developmental information is provided in a timely manner with low burden to instructors and minimal intrusion on class time. Because large student numbers are necessary for statistical analysis, the system is particularly appropriate for the canonical "large lecture class" of 200-400 students (or larger). Rochester Institute of Technology is responsible for software development, Wabash College is overseeing question validation, and Emory University, Bucknell University, Rutgers University, and Johnson C. Smith University are beta testing the project. Workshops at national meetings of the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers will solicit additional beta-testers.</AbstractNarration>
