    <AbstractNarration>For point-to-point communications, channel capacity is very well&lt;br/&gt;understood, and there are schemes that approach the capacity for&lt;br/&gt;most useful channel models. In contrast, the multi-user communication channels&lt;br/&gt;are not as well understood. The channel models are more complicated, there are&lt;br/&gt;more varieties, and many important problems remain open. As one well-known&lt;br/&gt;example, the capacity problem for discrete memoryless broadcast channel is&lt;br/&gt;still unsettled. As another example, the interference channel capacity region&lt;br/&gt;is known only in certain special cases (such as strong interference). What is&lt;br/&gt;clear from the recent studies of such channels is that in a multi-user&lt;br/&gt;wireless network, the key performance limiting factor is often the interference rather &lt;br/&gt;than the noise, especially at high signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To alleviate this difficulty, the notion of degrees of freedom has been used as&lt;br/&gt;a first order characterization of the system throughput as normalized by the&lt;br/&gt;logarithm of the signal to noise ratio. The total degrees of freedom of&lt;br/&gt;several interference networks have been quantified. On the other hand, the&lt;br/&gt;degrees of freedom region, which is more revealing than the total degrees of&lt;br/&gt;freedom, is much less well understood. For most of the interference networks,&lt;br/&gt;the regions remain unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to quantify the degree of freedom regions of a&lt;br/&gt;class of general interference networks with multiple transmit nodes and&lt;br/&gt;multiple receive nodes, possibly equipped with multiple antennas, and with&lt;br/&gt;general message demands. In particular, we will study the X interference&lt;br/&gt;network, which include interference channels, broadcast channels, multiple&lt;br/&gt;access channels, as special cases. Through interference alignment design based&lt;br/&gt;on vector and rational independence, we will bound tightly the degrees of&lt;br/&gt;freedom region and devise schemes that are optimal (or near-optimal) in the&lt;br/&gt;degree-of-freedom sense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project will advance significantly our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;interference networks, and positively impact the design, architecture, and&lt;br/&gt;signal design and processing for next generation wireless networks. The&lt;br/&gt;project will also help train the next generation of researchers and engineers&lt;br/&gt;in the field of signal processing and communication networks.</AbstractNarration>
