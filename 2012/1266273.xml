    <AbstractNarration>This is a travel grant for students and junior researchers to participate in America's Conference on Wind Engineering. American Association for Wind Engineering holds this conference every four years. The next conference will be held in Seattle, Washington in June 2013. Not only is it important that the United States research community be represented at this prestigious conference for wind engineering in North and South America, it is critical that the students are encouraged to enter the field of wind engineering. The number of investigators pursuing research in wind hazards and their impact are relatively few in the country as compared to investigators in earthquake engineering. Windstorms such as hurricanes and tornadoes continue to cause an increasing amount of damage each year. It is important to deveoop individuals who are well versed in wind engineering and wind hazard mitigation research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In meeting with their international colleagues, the experienced researchers will present recent findings and discuss mitigation strategies for extreme wind events at the conference. Participation of students and junior faculty in this conference will broaden and expand their vision in wind engineering. Lessons learned about how to prevent, respond and recover during and after an extreme wind event are essential to pursue research in life safety and mitigation of damages to civil infrastructure and to property. In addition, climate change, urban population shifts to coastal regions, and the federal mandate for increased renewable energy generation in the future, are important matters for scientific and engineering scrutiny and consideration that require a workforce familiar with wind engineering principles. It is important to engage and sustain students and young researchers in the wind engineering field. A concerted effort is planned to attract women and students from underrepresented groups to participate in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
