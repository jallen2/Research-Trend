    <AbstractNarration>1214122 (Mosher). Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) is the planned introduction of recycled water directly into a public water system or into a raw water supply upstream of a water treatment plant. DPR has the potential to provide a reliable, sustainable local water supply; however, it is not easily implementable in the U.S. due to scientific/technical knowledge gaps and public perception. This multi-disciplinary workshop will bring together academics and water professionals to focus on the technical and social challenges and either directly address them or prepare guidance on means to address them. The workshop will include review of background papers, working group sessions, group report development, and presentations of group reports. A final report will be accessible online. The workshop will advance knowledge in public perception (social science) and technical issues (engineering). The public perception outcomes will directly enhance outreach and educational activities in the water industry. The technology outcomes will enhance scientific research and engineering applications by identifying key issues that will allow for the implementation of DPR and improve current water treatment technologies. DPR has the potential to significantly improve and diversify sustainable water resources management throughout the US, especially in arid regions like CA, AZ, and TX. It can reduce the need for long-distance water conveyance (and associated energy consumption). DPR implementation can also encourage the transformative view that wastewater is a renewable recoverable source of energy, nutrients, and potable water. The final product, a workshop report, will provide guidance on developing protocols for addressing technical challenges to DPR (e.g., modifications needed to upgrade existing advanced treatment facilities to DPR). It will also provide outreach/education tools to better communicate and increase the public?s understanding of DPR. The workshop report will be disseminated broadly to the water community as a free internet download for the purpose of enhancing the scientific and technical understanding of methods/facilities needed to undertake DPR projects, as well as enhance the understanding of social aspects/activities needed to gain public acceptance of DPR. The workshop has the potential to help make DPR a viable option for communities seeking to augment/diversify potable water supplies. Some benefits of DPR to society at-large include: providing a water supply alternative for communities that lack groundwater aquifers or surface water; reducing wastewater discharge to the ocean or inland surface waters, reducing the extraction/depletion of water from aquifers and surface waters, and reducing energy use.</AbstractNarration>
