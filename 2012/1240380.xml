    <AbstractNarration>The investigators propose to design, develop and characterize novel flexible, resorbable nanomaterials and devices for wound healing applications. The work is divided into three tasks to support the engineering of a resorbable system for wounding healing: a) the development of flexible, resorbable materials themselves containing resorbable, high-quality conductors (for use as interconnects and electrodes); b) the development of resorbable, biocompatible batteries; c) the use of implanted flexible -- ultimately resorbable? devices to map and control the electric field wound gradient in internal wounds. Additionally, the work leverages efforts at UCSF on internal wound healing in the context of anastomoses and the extensive experience of the Pediatric Device Consortium (www.pediatricdeviceconsortium.org/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;When implanting therapeutic electronic constructs within the body, a key concern is their removal after the therapeutic effect is complete. This need to remove such constructs has largely limited the deployment of electronic therapeutic systems to applications where they may be easily removed. Specifically, it is typically unacceptable to leave such a device within the body, since gradual degradation of the device could introduce toxic materials in large quantities and sizes into the body. The proposed effort lies at the intersection of nanomaterials, flexible electronics, and medical electronics. The effort brings together leading researchers in these fields. By leveraging the world-leading expertise of the individual researchers in each of these fields, the effort aims to achieve several dramatic innovations in medical electronics, including novel approaches to resorbable conductors and implantable, resorbable power sources. If successful, these efforts will create a body of knowledge and technology to enable the realization of sophisticated in-body therapeutic systems that leverage electrical stimulation to improve healing. This systems approach at translating cutting edge flexible and resorbable electronics directly to the clinic has the potential to transform soft-tissue wound healing therapies. While there are efforts aimed at electronic systems on skin, these efforts are limited by the absence of materials and process development specifically for medical applications, and generally do not aim to develop therapeutic applications; at best therefore, they are diagnostically focused. Similarly, there are numerous efforts focused on flexible electronics, but only relatively simple in-body systems have been demonstrated. This research will provide high resolution, in-body mapping of the wound gradient field in a minimally invasive way and will impact the knowledge and success of cell recovery in many medical procedures. Likewise, the impact of a demonstration of successful stimulation to affect internal wound healing in a controlled or predictable manner would be very high. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The effort will introduce a multi-facetted education and outreach program, targeted at increasing recruitment and retention of high-school students into science and engineering, and extending opportunities to underrepresented minorities at all levels of education from school to university. Opportunities for high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students, as well as underrepresented minorities at all levels will be provided, and will be matched to research within the effort. In addition to research opportunities, seminars and tutorials will be organized to develop interest in flexible electronics for medical applications. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in performing this work. Undergraduates will be engaged in experimental design and metrology tutorials to prepare them for future careers in research. The results of this proposal will also be used in a University-sponsored high-school outreach program. High-school students will be invited to visit the laboratory and to gain hands-on experience. Finally, specific programs targeting recruitment of minority students will be developed as part of this project, with the goal of providing opportunities, training, and mentorship at all levels for minority students to drive their retention and success in STEM field.</AbstractNarration>
