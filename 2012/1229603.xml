    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports acquisition of a Raman spectroscopy system that is integrated with an atomic force microscope, capable of three-dimensional structural and Raman mapping, capable of cryogenic to high temperature operation (77 ? 1,800 K), outfitted with five different wavelengths for Raman probing, and aligned with an additional integrated path for a pump laser. The Raman spectroscopy system will significantly impact and enable a wide range of research projects, including nanomaterial synthesis and assembly, carbon detection and identification, and chemical and biological sensing. It will also play an important role in the validation of computational nanoscience initiatives. The instrument will also advance the understanding of Raman processes at ultra-high temperatures and extreme chemical environments, along with furthering the field of integrated Raman-atomic force microscopy processes and tip-enhanced Raman scattering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raman spectroscopy is a a powerful technique for characterizing frequencies, energies, and fingerprints of matter. This instrument will be housed in Wilsdorf Hall, a recently completed facility dedicated to cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research and actively managed, operated, and supported under the existing infrastructure of the Nanoscale Materials Characterization Facility (NMCF) at the University of Virginia. Existing research thrusts that will utilize the instrument are interdisciplinary, connecting various departments in the Engineering School and the College of Arts and Sciences, and range from basic science and materials discovery to contaminant detection in water supplies. The instrument will be integrated into a combination of classroom and laboratory discussions and activities in multiple classes at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, spanning six disciplines, thus impacting a diverse audience. The use of this instrument will also be encouraged in existing REU and RET programs, which target underrepresented groups and expose them to cutting edge research.</AbstractNarration>
