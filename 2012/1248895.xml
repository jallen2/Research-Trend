    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a series of primary and rechargeable Zinc-Air batteries of new generation. Individual cells will use a new and improved interior design, as well as will incorporate in their composition a host of novel materials and innovative technological solutions. A complete revision of the bill of materials for the battery is planned. The latter will seek to enhance practical Specific Energy of cells, dramatically boosting operational service life, increasing rate capability, preventing in-cell gassing due to corrosion of the anode, and making cells that can better resist the effects of humidity. New product concepts shall be assembled into three standard cell sizes (e.g. LR2450, AA and D) of uniquely modified interior design, and tested against their reference counterparts, so as to conclude on their performance advantages, and to establish grounds for prototyping and commercialization. The ultimate goal is to build cells that will demonstrate Specific Energy of 550+Wh/kg (achieving this value would put this technology at 25% improvement over industry leading brands).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to commercialize new and improved Zinc-Air Batteries and cells. They hold a tremendous potential for successful adoption by the market. The projected demand is driven by a number of factors, with the major one being a substantial installed base currently populated by the conventional Zinc-Air batteries. The latter is the technology of choice in the hearing aid medical devices. Driven by the aging population in the developed countries, the adoption of hearing aid devices is due to increase at a rate, which is forecasted to drive the market for Zinc-Air systems to $400M worldwide by 2017. Also, Zinc-Airs will continue to be used in some niches with the military. Three other lucrative opportunities identified for the specific battery is in the energy storage for utilities, unattended RFIDs, autonomous health monitoring systems and stationary power supplies.</AbstractNarration>
