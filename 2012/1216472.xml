    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 2nd Penn State Bioinorganic Workshop will be held on the University Park campus of The Pennsylvania State University from May 31-June 9, 2012. The proposed workshop aims to provide a complete immersion training experience to students and postdocs. The field of bioinorganic chemistry is diverse, and includes a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and physical chemistry. The workshop will include lecture topics, such as, (1) principles of molecular biology; (2) principles of coordination chemistry; (3) principles of quantum chemistry; (4) transient state kinetic methods; (5) EPR spectroscopy; (6) ENDOR/ESEEM spectroscopy; (7) computation of spectroscopic parameters; (8) resonance Raman spectroscopy; (9) X-ray absorption spectroscopy; (10) Mössbauer spectroscopy; (11) magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy); (12) mass spectrometry; (13) isotope effects as mechanistic probes; (14) protein electrochemistry; (15) X-ray crystallography; and (16) biological electron transfer. In addition, a "hands-on" laboratory training aspect is also included. The following hands-on sessions will be offered: (1) SF-absorption spectroscopy; (2) the FQ method; (3) EPR spectroscopy; (4) Mössbauer spectroscopy; (5) ENDOR/ESEEM spectroscopy; (6) resonance Raman spectroscopy; (7) mass spectrometry ; (8) purification of air-sensitive enzymes; (9) site-directed mutagenesis; (10) protein electrochemistry; and (11) cryoreduction experiments at the Breazeale Nuclear Reactor on the Penn State campus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Many areas of this meeting will directly relate to central challenges facing society today. Fundamental collaborative research in bioinorganic chemistry may provide important insight for rational design of chemical/industrial processes. An example includes the improvement of the Haber Bosch process, a crucial process for modern agriculture, by a better understanding of the enzyme nitrogenase.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will make important contributions to training of students and postdocs in bioinorgranics. Approximately 80 young researchers will immerse themselves in a wide variety of methods and concepts central to this research area, thus receiving training that will undoubtedly be broader than they could possibly receive in any one research group.</AbstractNarration>
