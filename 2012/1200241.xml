    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports research on a manufacturing methodology for the fabrication of large numbers of three-dimensional nanostructures and nanoparticles with precisely patterned surface compositions. The methodology leverages top-down planar patterning methods such as nanoimprint lithography and combines them with bottom-up biologically inspired self-assembly methods based on strain engineering. Experiments and theoretical models will be designed and utilized to study mechanisms to improve assembly, throughput, precision and yield of patterned polyhedral nanoparticles and curved nanostructures. Individual process steps will be optimized using statistical design of experiments to identify important factor-response relationships and the nanoparticles and nanostructures will be characterized using optical and electron microscopies and spectroscopies to probe their physical and chemical structure and properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the creation of a cost-effective method to fabricate large numbers of patterned nanoparticles and 3D nanostructures will open up new capabilities for optics, electronics and medicine. Studies directed at the manipulation of thin film stress and surface forces at the nanoscale will lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior of materials at very small size scales. Three dimensional nanostructures composed of metals, semiconductors and polymers are important for the development of computational, metamaterial, drug delivery and sensor systems. Assessment of the reliability, efficiency and reproducibility of self-assembly methods is also necessary to enable them to be translated from the laboratory to a real-world manufacturing setting, thereby providing significantly new capabilities for nanomanufacturing. The proposed work will also contribute to training and education by the development of instructional laboratory modules, the inclusion of undergraduate students in research experiences and expose K-12 students, teachers and the public to the frontiers of science and engineering, specifically in the area of nanomanufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
