    <AbstractNarration>This award is to support student participation in workshops that are affiliated with the annual ACM symposium on Computer and Communication Security conference (CCS), which are to be during October 15-19th 2012, in Raleigh NC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference is a leading international forum for information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools and experiences. Since 2001, CCS started accommodating affiliated workshops to explore security issues in a variety of emerging areas. The CCS workshops have become active forums for researchers to form focus groups, discuss and collaborate on emerging and critical security problems, and disseminate fresh, revolutionary (and sometimes even controversial) ideas. These workshops also serve as natural venues to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines to address security issues in specific domains, such as health care, cloud computing and national critical infrastructures. The workshop selection process is rigorous and well coordinated. All workshop proposals are carefully reviewed by the CCS steering committee and evaluated based on their topic, intellectual merits, and relevance to academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>
