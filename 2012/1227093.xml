    <AbstractNarration>The Central Caribbean Marine Institute (CCMI) is awarded a grant to build and equip a new Coral Reef Stress Wet Lab at its field station, the Little Cayman Research Centre (LCRC). The lab will be equipped with three primary wet lab work areas including a covered screened area, a climate controlled area, and a shaded screened area for experiments with a specific emphasis on climate change, ocean acidification, and fisheries management (lionfish and grouper). The new wet lab will enable LCRC to (1) enhance their capabilities and capacity for simultaneous research and education activities; (2) improve the quality, quantity, and accessibility of information produced and available at LCRC; and (3) enable them to better serve U.S. scientists and further develop collaborative partnerships with U.S. institutions and government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 2006, LCRC has been providing oceanographic facilities that have enabled students and scientists to conduct field studies at a remote site where marine protection has been effective and where local human and development impacts are minimal. They have hosted over 90 visiting researchers and five major U.S. universities include a LCRC visit as a permanent part of their curriculum. CCMI also offers rich educational and conservation outreach activities for local K-12 Cayman Island schools which include underrepresented groups. Research at LCRC has led to major breakthroughs, including the discovery of new marine meiofauna species, an improved understanding of deep reefs, and new models for predicting coral bleaching and diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this infrastructure enhancement include producing new, high quality results on topics that are of the highest concern for society; providing a training ground for young scientists, who are the future of scientific discovery; attracting the best scientific minds and increasing the capacity of the station by establishing new partnerships and collaborations. Alongside existing long-term ecological and environmental data monitoring capabilities in partnership with NOAA- Coral Reef Early Warning System, the new facility will enhance the frontiers of science by collecting, publishing, and communicating results to the greater scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information about the Central Caribbean Marine Institute please visit: http://www.reefresearch.org/ccmi_website/home.htm</AbstractNarration>
