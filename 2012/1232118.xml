    <AbstractNarration>Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop efficient and distributed cyber-physical systems so as to maximize the potential of improving the reliability and stability of the power grid. Research will be focused on three inter-dependent thrusts: 1) developing efficient fast-converging first-order and second-order distributed algorithms for reactive power control and flow optimization; 2) developing deadline-constrained distributed data aggregation schemes with efficient routing and scheduling decisions; and 3) enabling the optimal deployment of the grid monitoring network as an integrated sensing, communication and computing infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in the theme of enabling new reactive power control schemes with the additional intelligence afforded by the cyber-physical infrastructure, which can be potentially transformative to the development of stable and reliable smart power grid. Efficient distributed control algorithms will be developed with either guaranteed fast convergence speed or desired delay characteristics. The research will provide a novel algorithmic foundation and networking architectures/protocols that enable low-latency and fully distributed reactive power control in smart grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The research will infuse traditional power control problems with a brand-new cyber-physical perspective. It will advance the distributed control theory in power systems and provide timely solutions to significantly improve the reliability and stability of the power grids. The PIs will introduce related research results to classrooms and actively share their findings by giving seminars to both the cyber and power engineering communities. The project will further facilitate training of minority students and help prepare the future cyber and power workforce.</AbstractNarration>
