    <AbstractNarration>Funds are requested to support students at U.S. institutions to attend the 18th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom 2012), which will be held August 22-26, 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey. Since its inauguration, MobiCom has been one of the premier international conferences in wireless and mobile networking, covering a wide spectrum of theoretical and applied research in wireless area. The conference has been held annually since 1994, and has provided a valuable forum for fundamental advances on a wide range of wireless networking topics. Mobicom 2012 technical program consists of technical sessions, workshops, panels, and tutorials. This proposal requests students travel support to boost the participation of US-based students to the conference. Attending such high-caliber technical venues is extremely valuable for future researchers. Not only will they be exposed to the state-of-the-art in the field, but they will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers, and take part in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field (e.g., in terms of technology, standards, etc). In particular, higher priority will be given to female students as well as those from under-represented minority groups institutions that are not traditionally represented in MobiCom.</AbstractNarration>
