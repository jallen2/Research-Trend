    <AbstractNarration>PI David Woodland, Keystone Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology&lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference: Keystone Symposium on "Precision Genome Engineering and Synthetic Biology" to be held in Breckenridge, CO from March 17-22, 2013&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Keystone Symposia conference on Precision Genome Engineering and Synthetic Biology: Designing Genomes and Pathways will bring together scientists who: 1) develop tools for precision genome engineering; 2) use those tools for specific purposes in a wide range of organisms, including humans; 3) create whole synthetic genomes with prospects for wholesale reengineering; and 4) engineering cells with novel pathways and properties. Exchange of cutting-edge information regarding approaches, accomplishments and ambitions will augment the capabilities of each group. The meeting will provide an outstanding forum for students, postdoctoral fellows, and senior investigators who envision careers in genome and pathway design.&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this meeting are as follows: 1. To collect leaders in genome engineering and synthetic biology and make them aware of current technologies and opportunities. 2. To stimulate ongoing interactions and collaborations between these disciplines. 3. To encourage the development of new approaches that will accelerate progress in the target areas. 4. To enlist trainees into these emerging fields, so they will drive future uses and developments. Intellectual merit: Both precision genome engineering and synthetic biology are relatively new fields of research that are developing rapidly, but largely independently of each other. This meeting is designed to bring together the goals, approaches, technologies and leaders in these areas to encourage cross-fertilization and collaboration. Keystone Symposia provides an internationally recognized platform as well as resources to ensure the success of this meeting, and the organizers are well-recognized leaders in the fields of genome engineering and synthetic biology. Broader Impacts: This meeting aims to encourage extension of pathway engineering into a broader range of organisms through genome editing and to stimulate the development of expanded tools of genome manipulation for multi-gene modifications. Moreover, this meeting will enhance infrastructure by fostering networking and initiation of collaborations. The following educational benefits are anticipated: acquaint trainees and investigators new to the field with the state-of-the-art; critical scientific feedback; and career development for trainees and new investigators, including opportunities both to see successful scientists presenting cutting-edge science and to network with prospective mentors and others who might contribute to their scientific and professional development.</AbstractNarration>
