    <AbstractNarration>This project is supporting two cohorts of financially disadvantaged students to address the shortage of labor, women, and underrepresented groups in computer science and related disciplines. Each scholarship is being awarded for four years to remove the financial barrier to degree completion. Sixteen S-STEM scholars in 2013 and 15 in 2014 are being selected based on (1) NSF citizenship/residence requirements, (2) financial need as determined by the FAFSA, (3) academic qualification, (4) personal qualities (e.g., leadership), and (5) contribution to the diversity of the computer science student body. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objectives include (1) identifying and recruiting students with interest and high potential in computer science, with priority given to women and underrepresented groups, (2) improving retention through cohort class enrollments, S-STEM tutor networks, and enriched interactions between S-STEM scholars and existing academic support units and student groups, (3) providing internship and research opportunities to S-STEM scholars for timely professional development, and (4) gathering feedback to refine the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is creating interactions with different campus units and examining financial, social, support structure, curriculum, and environmental factors that contribute to the lack of women and underrepresented groups in computer science. S-STEM cohorts are serving as focus groups to examine the computer science education at the university, including curriculum, counseling, mentoring, professional development, and extracurricular activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The scholarships are allowing financially disadvantaged and debt-averse students to focus more on their degrees. Recruitment activities focus on women and underrepresented students to reestablish their critical mass in the program. Project results and findings are being disseminated through a web portal and education publications.</AbstractNarration>
