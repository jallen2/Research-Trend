    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1207583 PI: Cai, Chengzhi ORG: University of Houston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Benign E. coli adhesion and biofilm formation on mannoside surfaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The proposed research is relevant to a new strategy to prevent pathogen colonization and biofilm formation. This new strategy uses benign bacteria to form a live, protective biofilm on materials surfaces to fence off pathogens. The overall objective of the proposed research is to investigate systematically the role of surface presentation of mannoside ligands on the formation of biofilms of a benign E. coli strain expressing mannoside-binding type 1 fimbriae. The specific objectives are: (1) To optimize the surface presentation of mannoside ligands. A series of mannoside ligands will be synthesized, varying the substituents on the glycosidic linkages. They will be covalently attached to silicone surfaces via an intermittent layer of poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. This approach will allow for control of the local ligand density at nanoscale. (2) To address the role of the affinity and nanoscale presentation of the mannoside ligands on the adhesion, orientation, mobility, proliferation, extracellular matrix production, and aggregation of the benign E. coli, as well as the rate of formation, morphology, coverage, and stability of the benign biofilms. Great progress has been made in molecular biological study of the regulatory mechanism in the late stage of biofilm formation. In addition, the knowledge base has been growing rapidly on how the early stage of biofilm formation is affected by material surface physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. However, the understanding of the effect of specific ligand-receptor interactions on biofilm formation on materials surfaces is limited. The proposed research aims to fill this critical gap in knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation has a tremendous impact on human health and the environment. The proposed research will provide new insights to the process of biofilm formation, which will be invaluable for the development of strategies to prevent pathogen colonization and to promote the formation of benign or functional biofilms. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project will be trained in many fields. The PI will organize a workshop for the Science Extravaganza at the University of Houston to motivate high school students from underrepresented groups to choose a STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) field major in college. An undergraduate student in this project will be recruited from the teach Houston program at the University of Houston. Students in the program teach classroom lessons in local high schools from their first year. The PI will work with the student to develop exciting modules, such as observation of benign biofilm formation, for use in the science course.</AbstractNarration>
