    <AbstractNarration>The causes of geographical gradients in biodiversity are not well understood, and remain a major scientific challenge. Many physical and biotic factors may influence the evolutionary diversification and species distribution dynamics that result in these gradients. This study examines an elevational gradient of tropical birds in Asia, where functional, genetic, and phylogenetic diversity of organisms are woefully understudied and underlying patterns provide a strong system for testing hypotheses about biodiversity along elevational gradients. The proposed research evaluates both traditional (physiological tolerance, competition, opposing boundaries) and novel (taxon age, adult survival, life history trade-offs) factors that vary along elevational gradients and integrates them with dispersal, genetic structure, and phylogenetic history. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research partners will share samples and data, and collaborate in cross-disciplinary training of students, in pursuing tests of the proposed hypotheses. This integration will lead to a new mechanistic understanding and conceptual framework for the influence of physical climate gradients and biotic interactions on species distributions and the evolution of diversity. The project will provide extensive opportunities for the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including a unique cross-cultural life experience as well as hands-on educational and field experience. Public outreach includes work with high school students and teachers, museum exhibits, and development of an educational video on tropical bird nesting behaviors. Finally, this project has critical conservation ramifications, as tropical Asian forests are being lost at the fastest rate of any tropical forests in the world, and this research will provide critical information on possible climate change impacts that are of grave concern to extinction risks.</AbstractNarration>
