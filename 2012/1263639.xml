    <AbstractNarration>Monoterpenoid alcohols are synthesized and used in forest insect pest management strategies as pheromone components in traps and lures. In addition, they are important components of consumer products as scents, flavorants, or therapeutic agents. Current production methods rely on organic syntheses or isolation from plant essential oils, with associated costs and limitations. For example, many syntheses require multiple steps, hazardous solvents and/or protocols, and reduced yields. In contrast, enzyme-catalyzed hydroxylations and other modifications occur in single steps, safely in aqueous buffer and often with comparatively high fidelity. Researchers have cloned and characterized pine bark beetle enzymes that modify monoterpenes, including cytochromes P450 and oxidoreductases. In many cases they catalyze specific reactions for different substrates, resulting in single products, sometimes with extreme enantiomeric excess. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to expand the results of prior research on enzymatic monoterpene modification into useful applications and produce monoterpenoid alcohols in a faster, safer and less costly method than current methods. If successfully completed, researchers will be able to show enzymatic conversion of monoterpenes to monoterpenoid alcohols including a specific type suitable for use in bark beetle lures or traps, in amounts approaching 1 gram per run. Additionally, researchers plan to incorporate methods used during this project into undergraduate studies.</AbstractNarration>
