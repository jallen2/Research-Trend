    <AbstractNarration>This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;(REU) site at Utah State University. The project, called&lt;br/&gt;Bug Wars, exposes students to research on software testing and AI&lt;br/&gt;planning through both competition and collaboration. This project will&lt;br/&gt;create new knowledge about user-session-based testing, model-based&lt;br/&gt;testing with AI planning, and the combination of these two techniques&lt;br/&gt;as applied to web applications. A novel feature of this REU is that&lt;br/&gt;it encourages both competition and collaboration. The students initially&lt;br/&gt;split into two teams that strive to find the most faults in web application&lt;br/&gt;systems under test. One team collects, reduces, and prioritizes&lt;br/&gt;user-session-based test suites. A second team uses machine learning to&lt;br/&gt;build models of the software and AI planning to generate test suites.&lt;br/&gt;Students compete to show the merits of their approach on the same systems&lt;br/&gt;by considering the sizes and fault detection effectiveness of their&lt;br/&gt;test suites. The students then critically discuss their work and propose&lt;br/&gt;combining the different approaches to further improve effectiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that twenty-four students over a&lt;br/&gt;three-year period have the opportunity to participate in a supportive&lt;br/&gt;environment that encourages them to pursue graduate studies in Computer&lt;br/&gt;Science. The students are better prepared for graduate school as they gain&lt;br/&gt;basic research skills, including the formulation of research questions,&lt;br/&gt;design of experiments, critical evaluation, and written and oral&lt;br/&gt;communication.</AbstractNarration>
