    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;1206695, He&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to organize the IEEE Life Sciences Grant Challenges Conference, which is aimed at providing a public platform for debate and exchange of ideas on how to engineer the life sciences in a broad sense. The Conference will review significant progress that have been made in the past decade and identify grand challenges facing the scientific community in engineering life sciences and healthcare in the next 10 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful organization of the conference will bring together leading scholars, government officials, representatives from industry, and outstanding young investigators to discuss and identify critical issues and challenges facing the biomedical engineering community and larger society. The outcome of the conference will provide guidance to the scientific community, government and industry with regard to how to engineer the future of life sciences and healthcare. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference will include a two-day workshop consisting of invited presentations and panel discussions by leading scholars, government officials and representative from industry both from the United States and other countries. General participants are welcome but will be limited to up to a total of 200 participants. The two days meeting will consist of a single session platform presentations and debates on the six topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A white paper summarizing the grand challenges identified to the scientific community through the vast networks if IEEE, to be published in one of the well circulated magazines such as IEEE Spectrum, IEEE PLUSE, ort Science/Nature, and to the public via media coverage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IEEE has strong international representations in the global biomedical engineering community. It is anticipated that a substantial portion of the participants will come from international community. Every effort will be made to encourage the participation of women, racial/ethnic minorities, and person with disabilities in the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the conference will be to identify grant challenges facing the biomedical engineering community in the next 10 years, provide guidance to the scientific community, government and industry with regard t how to engineer the future of life sciences and healthcare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the meeting will include identification of important challenges for the large society, broad dissemination of the conference outcome via IEEE network and media coverage, publication of special issue in international well-circulated magazine, and strong international participants.</AbstractNarration>
