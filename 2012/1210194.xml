    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Vanessa Heckman of the California Institute of Technology to conduct a research project, entitled "Detecting damage in tall buildings using seismic methods," during the summer of 2012 at Earthquake Hazards Division, Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University in Gokasho, Uji, Kyoto, Japan. The host scientists are Professor James Mori and Assistant Professor Masumi Yamada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in applying seismic techniques to detect structural damage in tall buildings after an earthquake. Specifically, seismic interferometry is being explored as a means for localized damage detection using a dataset obtained from a super high-rise steel building located in the Osaka prefecture. Such methods increase national earthquake resiliency by providing a way to quickly assess the structural integrity of buildings after an earthquake. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Being able to conduct this research in Japan, a seismically active country with the densest seismic network in the world, benefits the U.S., where earthquakes are also identified as a national hazard.</AbstractNarration>
