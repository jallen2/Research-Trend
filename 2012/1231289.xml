    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The aim is to create a revolutionary monolithic, narrow linewidth, THz technology which is compact, mass-producible, and has mW-scale power output at room temperature. This will be achieved by optimizing intrinsic nonlinearities in quantum cascade lasers, reducing absorption and phase-matching losses, improving pump power and spectral purity, and improving the device geometry for better THz outcoupling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort combines basic science with advanced technology in order to produce a multi-component, yet highly integrated and functional, device. The building blocks of the high power THz source represent many active areas of investigation including: high power, dual frequency quantum cascade lasers based on two-dimensional diffractive feedback, band structure engineering of nonlinearity in a quantum system, and investigation of plasmon waveguides and surface gratings. The proposed research also makes an excellent case study for how theory, technology, and experiment all play a role in developing a single integrated device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses critical needs in the field of THz light generation at room temperature. There is also significant potential for follow-on work to explore electrical tunability of the source. Besides improving spectroscopy and imaging efforts, the biggest impact of a compact, mass-producible THz source will be ease of access, which will enable new research and applications to be developed in diverse fields.&lt;br/&gt;To increase the lasting impact of this work, educational and outreach activities are stressed which include hands-on training of undergraduates and high-school students.</AbstractNarration>
