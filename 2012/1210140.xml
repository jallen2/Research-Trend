    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Tae K. Kim of the University of Alabama in Huntsville to conduct a research project, entitled "Modeling the solar wind outflow using interplanetary scintillation data," during the summer of 2012 at the Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory (STEL), Nagoya University in Nagoya. The host scientist is Dr. Munetoshi Tokumaru.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in its multidisciplinary nature and potential impact on improving understanding of the solar wind flow throughout the heliosphere. Encompassing a number of scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, solar and space plasma physics, and computational sciences, this research primarily focuses on numerical modeling of the solar wind flow from near the Sun out to the heliospheric boundary with the local interstellar medium using solar wind speed and density estimated from interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations at STEL as boundary conditions. Use of realistic, time-varying boundary conditions such as those provided by IPS observations is necessary for accurate modeling of the heliosphere since the plasma properties in the interplanetary space fluctuate with time, often in a very dramatic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
