    <AbstractNarration>For decades, scientists have been intrigued by how animals recognize the species-specific vocalizations used in social communication. Auditory signals are processed and recognized along the auditory system in the brain. However, vocal recognition must also involve the activation of other brain regions that affect the internal state of the receiver, and subsequently, modulate the behavioral responses to vocal signals. To address this question, the researchers are studying ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) produced by the golden hamster in a sexual context, and behavioral and neural responses to these vocalizations. Both male and female hamsters exhibit a diverse vocal repertoire during sexual encounters. The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that USVs function in sex recognition, and by activating brain regions involved with reward and motivation, USVs increase sexual arousal and stimulate approach behavior to the sound source. The research tests the hypothesis that behavioral responses are regulated by dopamine, a critical compound in mediating reward. Preliminary data suggest that females vocalize more than males and that female USVs are longer in duration and have broader bandwidth than male USVs. In addition, the vocalizations of both sexes exhibit specific sound features that could indicate levels of sexual arousal and motivation of the caller. This study represents a key innovation in the study of USVs by integrating: 1) acoustic and statistical analyses of USV to demonstrate sex discrimination, 2) playback experiments to validate sex recognition and 3) neural responses to the USVs to reveal the brain regions and mechanisms involved in recognizing the behavioral significance of these USV. Moreover, this study will shed light onto other functions of USVs, which in recent years have become important in understanding social behavior and communication in rodent model species used in biomedical research. The research will also provide research opportunities for STEM undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
