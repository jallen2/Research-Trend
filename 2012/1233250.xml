    <AbstractNarration>PI: Suppes, Galen&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1233250&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;br/&gt;Title: Radically New Convection Battery for a Sustainable Transportation Future&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An increase in the battery capacity is needed for transportation applications. The PI has come with an innovative convection battery with a new design that can achieve significantly high ion fluxes through the separators between the electrodes. A convection battery uses a pump to circulate a liquid electrolyte directly through permeable electrodes and the permeable membrane that separates the electrodes. It is a new approach to battery design; more specifically, no evidence of previous batteries utilizing membranes permeable to fluid flow has been located. The proposed work aims to simultaneously improve performance and decrease costs for batteries sized at &gt;2kWh for transportation and stationary applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research include (a) synthesis and characterization of materials; (b) assembly and testing of convection batteries; (c) extending convection battery testing to measure voltage profiles using a custom-fabricated reference cell; (d) evaluating/modeling and evolving theories describing the battery performance; and (e) adopting alternative separators, supports, electrolytes, and chemistries based on opportunity and need. A particularly intriguing development in this research is the identification of how separator materials have a major impact on counter-ion counter-diffusion. Theories related to dimensionless diffusivity, nearest molecular neighbor separation, and ion hopping rate constants appear to be applicable. The modeling studies are designed to improve the understanding of parameters (such as these) that impact the performance of the convection battery and to improve the understanding of how material properties impact dimensionless diffusivity for counter-ions undergoing counter-diffusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The convection battery can substantially eliminate the reliance of the US on imported oil and will advance sustainable electrical power production. Extensions of both proposed modeling and experimental research on batteries will be used in undergraduate and graduate courses. The laboratories of the PI will actively recruit and foster undergraduate researchers including minorities and females who are encouraged to pursue graduate degrees. The undergraduate research program is a key part of the program and the equipment and resources of this effort will enhance that infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
