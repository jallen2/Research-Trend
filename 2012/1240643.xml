    <AbstractNarration>The extratropical cyclones cyclones associated with midlatitude weather systems are typically accompanied by extensive cloud cover, but the extent to which the clouds have an effect on cyclone development is not well known. This project investigates the impact of cloud radiative and latent heating on the development of extratropical cyclones, as well as the amount of energy and moisture they transport poleward. The work uses newly developed datasets in which cloud radiative and latent heating are derived from satellite observations, in combination with meteorological reanalysis products which capture cyclone characteristics including winds, temperature, and humidity. Feature tracking algorithms are used to follow individual cyclones and determine the impact of cloud heating on all stages of the cyclone lifecycle. Previous studies have addressed cloud heating impacts on extratropical cyclones, but with somewhat mixed results, in part due to the lack of available cases on which to base conclusions. The new datasets thus offer the promise of more definitive conclusions, due to the larger number of cases that can be examined, along with improvements in the quality of the cloud heating fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work broader impacts in two ways: first, it will support a graduate student, thereby providing for the next generation of scientists in this research area. Second, the work will be beneficial for evaluating and improving weather and climate models.</AbstractNarration>
