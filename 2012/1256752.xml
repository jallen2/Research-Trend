    <AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation improvement grant supports research in the history of evolutionary ecology. Specifically, it will investigate attempts to integrate models of adaptive phenotypic plasticity into ecological models of species distribution. The project will focus on how specific social, intellectual, and material contexts in which models of plasticity emerged during the 1960s through 1980s shaped their underlying assumptions and commitments. The grant will support travel to multiple sites to retrieve oral histories and to consult specific archival materials that are essential for reconstructing the influential conceptual and theoretical approaches to investigating adaptive phenotypic plasticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will illuminate an important interface between science and society by placing developments in evolutionary ecology in the context of shifting societal visions of environmental connectivity, vulnerability, and anthropogenic change. It will create new bridges between the history of ecology, environmental history, and the history of genetics and molecular biology, by showing how different visions of environmental change are linked to ideas about genetic mechanisms in ecological and evolutionary processes. It will also contribute to our understanding of trans-disciplinary knowledge transfer by describing the consequences of efforts to integrate theoretical and methodological approaches from ecology and evolutionary biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By analyzing the complex relationships between theoretical models and empirical research in contextualized investigative settings, this project can generate insights that are highly transferrable to studies of the role and status of models in other scientific fields. In addition, this project has potential to transform the way that scientists think about the broader social and intellectual contexts of their research; the researcher plans to engage ecologists and policy-makers via presentations at scientific meetings, publications in scientific journals, and transdisciplinary workshops. Finally, the results of this project will be used to create educational materials that illustrate science as a practice.</AbstractNarration>
