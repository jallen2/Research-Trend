    <AbstractNarration>The Eight William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day, directed workshop on Measure and Asymptotics in Group Theory and Low-Dimensional Geometry, to be held at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 28-September 1, 2012. The workshop will consist of a two-day mini-course for graduate students and junior researchers, followed by a three day lecture series. Among the main topics of the workshop will be the recent work of Agol, Hagland-Wise, Kahn-Markovic, Wise, which has culmunated in the recently announced proof by Agol, of the virtual Haken conjecture. Another main topic will be the measure-theoretic properties of groups such as amenability, boundary amenability, and measure equivalence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these areas. The workshop will bring together leading researchers in geometry and topology with graduates students and junior researchers who have a special interest in problems related to group theory and low-dimensional geometry will investigate a number of important questions at the forefront of research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from dfferent areas will result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;http://www.hamilton.tcd.ie/events/gt/gt2012.htm</AbstractNarration>
