    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical and computational studies of plasmonic nanomaterials and of optics and transport in semiconductor nanostructures. During past decade, plasmonics has become a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research area that cuts across physics, chemistry, biology, engineering and medical science. The research objectives of this project include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Microscopic calculations of energy exchange processes between plasmons and molecules, quantum dots or electron-hole pairs which underpin the physics of surface-enhanced Raman scattering, metal luminescence, fluorescence or luminescence of molecules or quantum dots, and resonance energy transfer between donors and acceptors near a metal nanostructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Studies of cooperative phenomena due to plasmonic coupling between system constituent parts, such as spontaneous and stimulated emission of ensemble of fluorophores or resonance energy transfer from an ensemble of donors to an acceptor near a metal nanostructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Investigations of extraordinary electron transmission through a periodic system of quantum dots and quantum wires sandwiched between doped semiconductor leads, and of the role of spin-orbit coupling in coherent transport through a double-quantum-dot system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide research and educational opportunities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. Being a historically black predominantly undergraduate institution, Jackson State University primarily serves the educational needs of the local community. During past several years, the Physics Department at Jackson State University has developed a comprehensive Nanoscale Science undergraduate student research and education program with the aim of (a) exposing students to advanced topics of science and technology, and (b) providing additional resources and opportunities to physics majors who are willing to pursue graduate education in out-of-state universities. This project will help in strengthening the vital research component of this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical and computational studies of optical and transport properties of two classes of materials that have sizes of the order of one millionth the size of the human hair. The first part of this project involves spectroscopic studies of molecules or very small confined systems called quantum dots when they are placed near metallic materials. In such close proximity of the two systems, quantum mechanical effects become important. The PI and his group will examine the emission, absorption, and scattering of light from such hybrid systems through numerical simulations and analytical methods. The second part of the project involves studies of coherent electron transport through a periodic system of semiconductors or confined wires sandwiched between semiconductor leads and the role of the interaction between the spatial and spin degrees of freedom of the electron in such structural arrangements. Both systems of study have potential technological applications in such areas as sensing, medicine, and green energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide research and educational opportunities to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.
