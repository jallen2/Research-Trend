    <AbstractNarration>Research Objective and Approach &lt;br/&gt;This research is a fundamental study on surface switching and self-cleaning/release mechanisms and the development of new design concepts for manufacturing nanocomposite-based switchable surfaces. In this project, new multifunctional nanomaterials with surface switching, self-cleaning and controlled release on demand will be created. The nanocomposite materials and the associated surface dynamic behavior will be characterized quantitatively at the nanoscale. In addition, a multiscale modeling at atomistic and micromechanics scales is proposed to interpret experimental results and to address how the physical, chemical and structural properties of nanomaterials can be translated into enhanced switching performance. The modeling and experiment will be integrated to link the nanoscale phenomena to macroscopic performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits to society &lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include a fundamental understanding of switching mechanisms for the design and development of optimized materials with better performance of practical significance. The success of the project will also advance a large variety of other applications, ranging from simple consumer products to complex technological systems with surface switching and self-cleaning/release properties. This collaborative research effort will impact the scientific and industrial communities to understand an array of materials and surface technologies. The major research outcome of this project is a technical platform for the development of next generation switchable surfaces. Furthermore, both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in emerging and interdisciplinary research. Research and education efforts will be disseminated through conference presentations and scholarly publications that will be beneficial to the scientific community and our society.</AbstractNarration>
