    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to understand the relatively low participation of Appalachian youth in the engineering workforce and engineering careers. By interviewing practicing engineers and college students majoring in engineering, the investigators will develop an understanding of how motivational and self-efficacy factors as well as the regional culture influence career choices. An array of appropriate theoretical frameworks will be used to understand the needs and culture of this underserved and understudied demographic group that stretches over many states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to contribute to an understanding of why Appalachian youth are under-represented in the STEM workforce. The project will work with an array of partners in K-12 and university education as well as industry to ultimately create interventions that can impact workforce development and thus regional economies. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for addressing societal challenges through engineering.</AbstractNarration>
