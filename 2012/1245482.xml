    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing, implementing, and evaluating Interactive Virtual Laboratories in thermodynamics. For each of six threshold concepts that have been identified, a corresponding Interactive Virtual Laboratory is being constructed. Each laboratory is providing students a scaffolded set of activities based on the "predict-observe-explain" technique. The activities are providing multiple representations that allow students to relate the macroscopic thermodynamic properties and processes to molecular behavior. These materials are being piloted in the studio classes of three different courses delivered to chemical, biological, and environmental engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Threshold concept theory serves as a basis for targeted content development, and the assessment and evaluation is informing further development of this learning theory. Identification and validation of threshold concepts is informing thermodynamics instructors and curricular designers and is helping them better craft learning materials and instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Interactive Virtual Laboratories are being made available to engineering faculty through the American Institute of Chemical Engineers Concept Warehouse (another NSF-supported project) and as an instructor resource on the publisher's website of the widely used textbook, Engineering and Chemical Thermodynamics. Additionally, Interactive Virtual Laboratories are providing a central component to a variety of web-enabled instruction systems. This learning environment fits into the broad category of inquiry-based activities that have been shown to reduce gender-based differences in performance in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
