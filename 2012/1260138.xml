    <AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to support academically talented students with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in the College of Engineering, Forestry and Natural Sciences at Northern Arizona University after transfer from community and tribal colleges. In addition to scholarship aid, students are being supported though a residential learning community specifically for STEM transfer students, as well as a seminar class promoting academic and career success in STEM. Scholars also have access to an extensive suite of student-support services, including supplemental instruction, mentoring and undergraduate research opportunities. Financial aid and other project activities are providing support toward increasing graduation rates for transfer students, as well as shortening time to graduation. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its comprehensive, research-based approach which merges financial, academic and social support to retain and graduate STEM transfer students. The broader impacts include strengthening relationships and transfer advisement between the university and surrounding community and tribal colleges, as well as providing a useful comparison of the impacts of residential learning communities on transfer students versus freshmen. The project taps a diverse and talented pool of students to enhance STEM workforce needs in Arizona and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
