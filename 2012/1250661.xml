    <AbstractNarration>1250661&lt;br/&gt;Ma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles show great promise in delivering anticancer drugs more specifically to tumors, thereby reducing the toxic side effects to normal tissues. The passive accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors is due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, caused by the leaky nature of the tumor vasculature and the lack of lymphatic drainage in tumors. The EPR effect is the key to the success of nanoparticle-based drug delivery. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the flow dynamics of nanoparticles in stimulated blood flows and the consequent EPR and margination effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this objective, the PI will construct novel microfluidic devices that mimic blood bifurcation and leaky tumor blood vessels. The trajectory of nanoparticles in stimulated blood flows will then be characterized. Explorations include effects of flow geometry, particle size, and suspending medium rheology on particle margination. The proposed research will strengthen our fundamental understanding of the EPR effect - the hallmark of passive targeted delivery of anticancer drugs. The success of the proposed research will also have far-reaching implications on the rational design of nanoparticles to allow more specific delivery of anticancer drug into tumors, thereby increasing patient comfort during cancer treatment and fulfilling a societal need.</AbstractNarration>
