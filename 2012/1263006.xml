    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at synthesizing a series of new electron deficient semiconducting polymers that can rival fullerenes in electronic properties for applications in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. This proposed work plans to establish the structure/property relationship of these types of organic polymers through structural design, synthesis, and physical studies. A series of new electron-deficient monomers have been proposed, which allow the development of three types of accepting polymers: 1. electron-deficient polymers with tetrahedron atomic centers along the polymer backbone; 2. polymers that can chelate with boron trifluoride to form charge transfer complexes; 3. polymers that exhibit planar structures. Detailed structural and physical characterizations of these polymers will be conducted. Standardized solar cell configuration will be used as a platform to characterize the materials properties. This work will impact basic polymer chemistry and organic electronics. Approaches to integrating this work with educational efforts, especially in attracting underrepresented students and industrial outreach, are also included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To convert solar energy into electricity, positive-negative charge-transporting junctions, "p-n junctions", are needed in inorganic solar cells. Similarly, organic solar cells require both p- and n-types of semiconducting materials. Much progress has been made in recent years in developing p-type semiconducting polymers. However, n-type materials used in organic solar cells rely mainly on expensive fullerene (C60 or C70) derivatives. This project plans to develop electron-deficient semiconducting polymers that rival or surpass the properties of fullerene derivatives and to establish structure/property relationships of electron-deficient polymers. The resulting polymers will be candidates to replace expensive fullerenes. These materials could also find wide applications in organic electronics. The fundamental chemistry developed will enrich our understanding of the synthesis of electron accepting polymers and monomers. The successful completion of this project will have impact in several areas, ranging from basic polymer chemistry, molecular photophysics, materials science, and renewable energy. The proposed work involves an interdisciplinary effort that integrates chemistry, materials science, and molecular photophysics to explore new science, thus offering a broad spectrum of research and educational opportunities to students. Efforts to attract under-representative minority students will be made. Students working in this program will be well prepared for future opportunities in the area of organic/materials chemistry and organic electronic materials. The new materials generated will have impact on sustainable energy and the electronics industry.</AbstractNarration>
