    <AbstractNarration>This GOALI project will examine the combined effect of mechanical, electrical and environmental fields on the structural integrity of glass/polymer composite sheaths as barriers against galvanic reactions in the next generation high voltage polymer based composite conductors. Through this project, our understanding of the combined effects of ozone, pollution, high temperature, mechanical and electrical loads, and acids/moisture on the composites will be significantly improved leading to major advances in high voltage engineering. This research will have very strong interdisciplinary experimental and numerical components. The composites will be subjected to a variety of extreme high voltage/temperature in-service stresses and their failure characteristics will be determined. Various types of transport mechanisms in the composites will be numerically simulated though multiscale modeling to understand the galvanic reaction processes in the composites and the conductors. We will optimize the design of the composites using nanotechnology maximizing their effectiveness as galvanic reaction barriers for future designs of the conductors. The project will be done in very close collaborations with several US utilities and manufactures.&lt;br/&gt;Due to the rapidly increasing demand for electric power and the development of new sources of energy, there is an urgent need in this country to be able to transport more electric power, more efficiently, using the existing rights-of-way. However, the current designs of high voltage conductors based on steel (for strength) and aluminum (for conduction) strands used in regional grids exhibit several limitations. Therefore, new conductors, with significantly better resistance to in-service conditions are being designed. One of them is the Polymer Core Composite Conductor (PCCC). PCCCs are based on a unidirectional polymer matrix composite core with carbon and glass fibers for strength and stiffness, and aluminum strands for conduction. They can transport three times more power than the current designs based on steel and aluminum. And these conductors will be studied in this research in order to improve their design or to replace them with entirely new designs. The project will enhance the reputation of American high voltage manufacturing around the world and will also improve the level of confidence among the potential users of PCC conductors.</AbstractNarration>
