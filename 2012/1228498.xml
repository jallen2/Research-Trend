    <AbstractNarration>Networking Networking Women (N2Women) fosters connections among women in networking and communications research community in which women are underrepresented. This award supports students from U.S. institutions to attend the Second N2Women Workshop co-located with IEEE INFOCOM 2012, the 31st Annual International Conference on Computer Communications. INFOCOM will be held March 25-30, 2012 in Orlando, Florida. The N2Women workshop is scheduled on the day before the main conference begins (Monday, March 26th, 2012), allowing the attendees to form connections that can then be strengthened if they also attend the conference. Priority is given to students who will benefit from attending the workshop, but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. Students attending the workshop are encouraged to stay and attend INFOCOM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal includes contributions that the student participants themselves will gain from and make to the N2Women Workshop; the information and connections that could positively impact their future research, and the co-location that allows them to participate in INFOCOM 2012, a premier conference in networking and communications. The exposure to the technical content of the N2Women Workshop (and to INFOCOM 2012 if they attend) is expected to inspire students to address challenging research problems in their field and to help them meet their long-term research goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal is the professional development of the under-represented graduate students that under this grant are able to attend the N2Women Workshop. The grant provides these graduate students the opportunity to attend high-caliber technical presentations from keynote speakers, be exposed to state-of-the-art research in a poster session, participate in mentoring sessions with leading researchers, and network with fellow graduate students. The goal is to make long-term positive impacts on the students? careers.</AbstractNarration>
