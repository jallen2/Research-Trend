    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop an 840 nm spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for intravascular imaging applications. The system will be designed to provide images equal to or better than what is currently clinically available, and will have higher imaging speeds with lower cost. Intravascular OCT is poised for clinical acceptance and commercial growth, but is still limited by availability and cost. Increasing system speed and reducing cost will accelerate clinical use of intravascular-OCT. The Phase II research will move the system toward commercial readiness by including in vivo imaging in a porcine animal model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the availability of a new imaging tool for the identification and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD affects an estimated 16 million Americans and is the primary cause of heart attacks and strokes, which killed over 631,000 and 137,000 people, respectively, in the United States in 2006. Intravascular OCT provides detailed imaging information on plaque assessment, stent implantation, and stent monitoring over time. Identification and treatment of unstable plaques and other intravascular conditions will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate from CAD. Billions of dollars are spent on imaging and treatment of CAD. An OCT system with increased imaging capability and competitive cost will provide a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art.</AbstractNarration>
