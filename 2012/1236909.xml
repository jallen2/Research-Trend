    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1236909&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research addresses the need to understand workplace exposures to engineered nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;in two ways: (i) by investigating fundamental mechanisms by which engineered nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;may become airborne; and (ii) by developing aerosol instruments suitable for routine workplace and&lt;br/&gt;personal monitoring of nanoparticles in the 1-500 nm size range with the ability to follow transient&lt;br/&gt;that may be responsible for most exposure from well-designed nanoparticle synthesis systems.&lt;br/&gt;Controlled laboratory experiments will also be conducted to develop a fundamental understanding&lt;br/&gt;of mechanisms for nanoparticle release to the air, beginning with studies of the aerodynamic&lt;br/&gt;entrainment from nanoparticle-coated surfaces. The long-standing need for suitable instruments&lt;br/&gt;for monitoring workplace exposures will be addressed by creating a small, simple, and low cost&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticle opposed migration aerosol detector (NOMAD) that will enable exposure assessment&lt;br/&gt;with sufficient resolution to estimate lung deposition patterns. The NOMAD performance will be&lt;br/&gt;compared with conventional approaches to exposure monitoring in nanotechnology laboratories, and&lt;br/&gt;provide personal exposure data that is not presently possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The proposed research will survey sources of airborne nanoparticles using&lt;br/&gt;size resolved instruments with better time response, and broader coverage of the potential size&lt;br/&gt;range than employed in previous studies, thereby enabling detection of transient release events, and&lt;br/&gt;facilitating identification of nanoparticle sources. Subsequent controlled laboratory experiments will&lt;br/&gt;quantify the forces required to entrain nanoparticles from different kinds of surface deposits, and the&lt;br/&gt;extent of agglomeration the airborne nanoparticles that result, thereby laying the groundwork for&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental understanding of potential exposure mechanisms. The new instruments will enable&lt;br/&gt;health effects studies that are clearly needed to understand the risks of nanotechnology, but are&lt;br/&gt;not presently possible due to the cost and complexity of present instruments. With these tools,&lt;br/&gt;continuous exposure data will become a valuable tool in both health effect research and in worker&lt;br/&gt;protection. They will further enable studies of exposures to nanoparticles in the use of consumer&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology products, and from conventional pollution sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The proposed research will provide new insights into incidental processes&lt;br/&gt;that contribute to the release of engineered nanoparticles into workplace air, and the risks associated&lt;br/&gt;with such releases. The new airborne nanoparticle detectors will enable researchers and industry to&lt;br/&gt;monitor nanoparticle exposures with rigor that is not now possible. Moreover, these new detectors&lt;br/&gt;should become the enabling technology for health effects studies that are clearly needed, but not&lt;br/&gt;presently possible.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will have the opportunity to become involved in the project through Caltech?s&lt;br/&gt;Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF). In addition, the Flagan laboratory will recruit&lt;br/&gt;participants from the Minority Undergraduate Research Fellowship (MURF) program as it has in&lt;br/&gt;4 of the last 6 years. We will work with Caltech?s outreach program to invite local area students to&lt;br/&gt;lectures and visits to our laboratory, as well as talk to the students in their schools. Students from&lt;br/&gt;local high schools, particularly those near freeways, will be recruited to undertake science projects&lt;br/&gt;involving measurements of nanoparticles in their home or school environments.&lt;br/&gt;As he has done for 10 years, the PI will continue to co-mentor a First Robotics team at Ramona&lt;br/&gt;Convent Secondary School, a girls high school in Alhambra, CA that has 60% minority enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;This has proven to be a most effective mechanism in stimulating interest in pursuing STEM studies&lt;br/&gt;in college by showing the students that engineering is fun.</AbstractNarration>
