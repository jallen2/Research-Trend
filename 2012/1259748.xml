    <AbstractNarration>This project is continuing the successful S-STEM scholarship program at the university that is increasing the number of students pursuing a computer science major by offering substantial scholarship support. The program places special emphasis on recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups such as women and Hispanics, building on the infrastructure already in place at the university. It also builds on the work of the Department of Computing Sciences that has involved faculty members and students in international conferences, internships, and exchanges. The project integrates the significant academic and financial student support at the university with NSF support for outstanding, financially needy students. It continues the professional development seminar for its participants (and any other majors who want to participate), incorporates aspects of Team Work in Several Time Zones (TWISTZ), and addresses the role and power of computing in the global marketplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project integrates the professional development seminar with the offering of sixteen $8000 NSF-funded scholarships per year to full-time undergraduate computer science majors who have demonstrated financial need and strong academic records. The seminar uses state-of-the-art programs and peer effects to encourage all S-STEM scholars to develop good study habits, to learn how to survey the ongoing advancement of computer science, and to develop critical thinking skills. In addition to career counseling, scholars are being encouraged to participate in funded undergraduate research projects whose project teams are spread across time zones and address needs beyond the U. S. borders. Of particular interest are projects associated with Ethicomp, the international computing ethics community, and the virtual reality tours that the department has created for the Vatican Museum. The university has been ranked by US News and World Reports as the number one regional university in the North for almost two decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is developing a culture that can attract, nurture, and support underrepresented students through its connection with the Multicultural Affairs Office at the university. It includes vital cross-cultural aspects into the world view of computing for students. Over the course of the project, about 20 undergraduates are receiving financial and academic support to become strong computer science graduates. Another 40 students participate in the enrichment seminar and international experiences.</AbstractNarration>
