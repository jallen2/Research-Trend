    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of this project is to develop and implement a new model for sustainable, cost-, energy- and resource-efficient nitrogen removal using the process of anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Anammox presents a cost-effective and energy-efficient alternate for biological nitrogen removal (BNR) relative to conventional approaches, which rely upon sequential nitrification and denitrification. Additionally, anammox bacteria by themselves do not produce nitrous oxide, thereby resulting in a lower greenhouse footprint of anammox BNR processes. The primary focus of this project is the development and application of a new model of wastewater treatment based on anaerobic conversion of ammonia to nitrogen gas, using the anammox process. Specifically, this project aims develop the design configurations, monitoring and control tools that could enable widespread improvements to the current wastewater treatment infrastructure by systematic application of anammox. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adequate management of nitrogen pollution is a significant societal and technological challenge. The USEPA is now considering enforcing more widespread implementation of BNR across the nation in an effort to improve water quality. However, BNR processes are rather energy and resource intensive. Therefore, if not optimally designed and implemented, BNR processes might place an inordinate burden upon the nation's already strained resources. This project plans to develop and implement anammox based process technologies, to ensure that water quality objectives are not in conflict with energy and resource needs.</AbstractNarration>
