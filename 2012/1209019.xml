    <AbstractNarration>Ivy Tech, Indiana's state-wide system of community colleges, proposes to conduct a statewide investigation of differences in the hiring and advancement of STEM women in both full-time and adjunct positions. They have four basic goals including: the collection and processing of institutional data on recruitment, retention, and advancement of women in STEM; review available sources and models for institutional transformation; garner institutional support for transformation; and develop a comprehensive transformation plan. Some of the strategies they will use to accomplish their goals are surveys, focus groups, guest speakers, and visits to other ADVANCE institutions. Information about women in STEM at community colleges is lacking in the literature and as the largest community college system in the country, this proposal presents a unique opportunity to collect a large amount of information about this understudied population. As designed, the potential for model building and significant data collection are outstanding. The enormous role that community colleges play in the production of STEM professionals, including eventual PhD recipients and URM STEM professionals is well documented. Understanding the hiring, retention, and promotion STEM women faculty in this setting would contribute greatly to the literature base.</AbstractNarration>
