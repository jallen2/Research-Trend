    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the NSF Workshop: Data Curation: Ensuring Quality and Access to Enable New Science, to be held in September 2012 in Arlington, VA. The value of data to the global economy has been well-documented and spawned calls for training professionals who practice data curation and stewardship, data analytics, and "big data" management. It is evident that poor data is worse than no data because it wastes time, leads to poor science and decisions, and diminishes trust in the entire data enterprise. Data curation demands tools and techniques at each phase of the data life cycle that lead to effective and efficient data services that people trust. This workshop brings together leading researchers in data curation to establish a research agenda to guide development of these tools and techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will have impact on the emerging data curation research and development community by defining directions for tools and techniques that support selection, metadata annotation, storage, access, use and reuse, and preservation of scientific and scholarly data. Such tools and techniques will make science and scholarship more effective and may be adapted to personal data management applications such as personal health or educational records. The workshop web site (http://datacuration.web.unc.edu/) provides will be used to disseminate further information, including the resulting workshop report that will provide a roadmap for the future data curation research and follow-up activities.</AbstractNarration>
