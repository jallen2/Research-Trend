    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research in support of the 2013 Materials Research Society Spring Meeting titled "Design of Cell Instructive Materials" is cofunded by the Biomedical Engineering program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. This Materials Research Society Symposium will focus on applying basic science and engineering principles that advances in designing cell instructive materials with emphasis on materials to study mechanotransduction, the response of cells to materials, drug and gene delivery, and spatial and temporal regulation of signals. The planned sessions will provide a cutting-edge scientific program and discussion forum that focus on specific fundamental and applied science and engineering challenges that, when overcome, will facilitate the translation of biomaterials and tissue engineering sciences to biomedical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program serves to educate biomaterials and tissue engineering communities in the highly relevant field of developmental biology and to stimulate discussion in current approaches from materials research, engineering and biological perspectives. The symposium has not only excellent geographical diversity, but also includes many women, young investigators, and industrial researchers among the invited speakers and discussion leaders. Participants will have the opportunity to interact with leading scientists throughout the conference, and will be able to present their own work. The planned poster session by students and junior faculty members is expected to be effective means to convey scientific information as well as to develop important synergies and interactions with professional colleagues.</AbstractNarration>
