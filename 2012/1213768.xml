    <AbstractNarration>The proposed work will develop new observations and data from historical ground&lt;br/&gt;rupturing earthquakes to improve understanding of the earthquake rupture process. Prior&lt;br/&gt;observations have worked to define the role of fault geometry in rupture propagation, addressed&lt;br/&gt;and discounted self-similarity in the description of surface rupture slip distributions, shown&lt;br/&gt;clearly that fault rupture is not consistently uni- or bi-lateral, that earthquakes do not consistently&lt;br/&gt;initiate on the section of fault ultimately recording maximum slip, and thatthe relationship&lt;br/&gt;between average coseismic slip and rupture length for large strike-slip earthquakes appears to&lt;br/&gt;require coseismic slip at progressively greater depths below the seismogenic layer as a function&lt;br/&gt;of rupture length. Previous work was been limited by time and funding to a set of about three&lt;br/&gt;dozen large continental earthquakes which shared the characteristics that there existed (1) maps&lt;br/&gt;of the surface rupture trace, (2) maps of the nearby active faults that did not rupture, and (3)&lt;br/&gt;measurements of coseismic offset at many points along the strike of the rupture to define the&lt;br/&gt;surface slip distribution. The resulting compilation has already become a heavily cited and&lt;br/&gt;widely used resource for the larger earthquake physics community. This work will extend&lt;br/&gt;previous analyses to a list of more than twice as many earthquakes that have produced surface&lt;br/&gt;ruptures but for which documentation may not simultaneously satisfy all three criteria. The&lt;br/&gt;premise of this proposal is that many observations and insights are yet to be gained in following&lt;br/&gt;a similar approach and extending the analysis to these additional surface rupturing earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance:&lt;br/&gt;Placing observational bounds on our efforts to understand the physics of the earthquake&lt;br/&gt;process is at the heart of quantifying earthquake hazard imposed by mapped active faults; this is&lt;br/&gt;the broadest and most practical impact of the proposed research. Other researchers have&lt;br/&gt;developed numerical models of earthquake rupture behavior, but knowing how well they predict&lt;br/&gt;real earth behavior depends on observational data from real ground ruptures. Research questions&lt;br/&gt;include how far a rupture can jump from one fault to another, how angle deviations in a fault&lt;br/&gt;trace affect rupture, how deep into the crust rupture extends, and how surface rupture correlates&lt;br/&gt;with expected ground motions. As a practical example, the empirical observations will improve&lt;br/&gt;tools to define the expected endpoints and thus rupture lengths of earthquakes in California.&lt;br/&gt;Funding will also contribute to the training of a graduate-level geoscience student.</AbstractNarration>
