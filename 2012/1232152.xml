    <AbstractNarration>Objective: While wind power is becoming an important source of alternative energy, the adverse effect of wind farms on existing radar systems is raising serious concerns. The objective of this research is to gain an in-depth understanding of electromagnetic scattering from wind farms. Our approach entails: (i) developing simulation techniques to predict and analyze dynamic radar signatures of wind farms, (ii) developing radar facility and measurement techniques to acquire scaled model and in-situ data from wind farms, and (iii) exploiting the knowledge for interference mitigation and turbine monitoring applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will lead to an in-depth understanding of the dynamic radar signatures of large wind farms. In the process, efficient simulation and measurement techniques will be developed to study the scattering from rotating turbine blades. These techniques will be applicable to a much wider class of problems where the main radar features of interest lie in how target structural changes are manifested in the time-varying radar returns. Examples include tracking of human activities and structural monitoring of large buildings and bridges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research will result in a better integration of wind power with existing radar infrastructures. The research findings will lead to technology advancement in interference mitigation and structural monitoring techniques. The developed radar measurement facility will be made available to academic researchers, and should significantly bolster the research and education infrastructure in radar. A number of outreach activities are planned to inspire K-12 students to pursue careers in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
