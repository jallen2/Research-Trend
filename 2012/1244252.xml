    <AbstractNarration>Environmental governance requires participation by people and their local, state and national governments, and decisions have implications across jurisdictions. Cooperation across multiple disciplines from the social and natural and physical sciences is necessary to inform our understanding of how to make decisions based in the best scientific evidence. Yet although environmental systems are of interest across the sciences, and require analysis from multiple sciences, scientists often do not have the collaborations in place concerning how best to research questions of how people constitute, interact with and govern their behavior within complex environmental systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a workshop that will develop collaborations across sciences concerning people's participation in choices about governing environmental systems, addressing governing choices and frameworks across scales of governments. Participants will include engineers, social scientists, and natural and physical scientists from multiple disciplines, all with research priorities concerning governing environmental systems. The workshop will develop collaborations and frameworks in common for understanding how to explain variation in governing strategies. In doing so, it will contribute to the development of concepts across the sciences. In addition, the project's broader impacts will include contributing to policymaking for governments, and training students in issues concerning scientific collaboration as well as environmental sciences.</AbstractNarration>
