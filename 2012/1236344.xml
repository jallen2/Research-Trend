    <AbstractNarration>CBET -- 1236344&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop titled "Strategies for Setting Occupational Exposure Limits for Engineered Nanomaterials" at George Washington University in Washington, DC, on September 10-11, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This workshop will advance our understanding and ability to measure, mitigate, and prevent adverse effects of nanotechnology in the workplace by bringing many stakeholder groups together to advance a common goal of better managing potential occupational health risks from engineered nanomaterials. Approximately 100 occupational health experts from academia, government, industry and non-governmental organizations will present and discuss new information and ideas for establishing occupational exposure limits (OELs) for engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main topics to be addressed by the workshop are:&lt;br/&gt;--What should trigger the need for setting an OEL for an engineered nanomaterial (if an OEL already exists for the bulk form)?&lt;br/&gt;--Approaches Used and Proposed for Setting OELs for Engineered Nanomaterials&lt;br/&gt;--Categorical OELs for Engineered Nanomaterials --approaches and issues&lt;br/&gt;--Comparing Methods Used and Proposed for Setting OELs for Engineered Nanomaterials --Advantages, Limitations, Data Requirements and Research Needs&lt;br/&gt;--Practical Workplace Issues Related to Setting and Using Engineered Nanomaterial OELs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: An intended outcome of the workshop will be a report for publication in a refereed journal. The report will recap the workshop proceedings, identify areas for which there is general consensus among workshop attendees, areas where there is a lack of consensus and areas needing additional research to address issues and questions raised during the workshop. It is anticipated that the authors will also offer specific recommendations as to the types of additional data that would help to address these questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although U.S. occupational health professionals are targeted audience for this first workshop,an additional objective will be to identify potential opportunities for future collaboration with international organizations with the objective of working toward the development of consistent global strategies for setting OELs for ENMs.</AbstractNarration>
