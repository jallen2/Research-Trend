    <AbstractNarration>There are currently very few ways for the blind to navigate a new indoor space without the assistance of a fully-sighted person. The technology proposed by this project is designed to enable a visually-impaired individual to find their way through large indoor environments such as airports, train stations and shopping malls by recognizing semantic and salient visual features of the environment. There is no prior visit or mapping of the environment required, and there is no need to deploy or utilize any special infrastructure like WiFi access points or infrared beacons. Researchers plan to use publically available architectural lay-outs and information about the location of ships, tracks, gates and other visual cues. The platform is a cell-phone mounted on a necklace that provides turn-by-turn directions through an audio-voice command interface. This technology is designed to process video from the cell phone camera in real-time using text and logo detection, localization based on prior knowledge of the layout and integration of accelerometer and visual odometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The blind and visually-impaired population in the United States is large and expected to grow in the future. If successfully implemented, this technology could have broader reaching applications, including many location-based services such as aiding those with spatial learning difficulties or guiding users to a specific location. The project team has the expertise required to develop this technology at a relatively rapid rate and economical cost.</AbstractNarration>
