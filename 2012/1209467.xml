    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Ian Rowen of the University of Colorado to conduct a research project, entitled "Chinese Tourists in Taiwan: Tourism and State Territoriality," during the summer of 2012 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientists are Michael Hsiao and Mau-Kuei Chang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is its contribution to understanding of new developments in cross-Strait relations, which are of major geopolitical importance due to the US' strategic relationships with Taiwan and China. Examining Chinese tourism in Taiwan also sheds light on the political and cultural implications of the rapid development of China's outbound tourist market, soon to be the world's largest, with over 100 million annual visits overseas projected by 2019. This project's theoretical framework brings tourism into broader debates about state territory and spatial practice. Additionally, this project's theoretical framework relates tourism studies to broader geographical debates about state power and spatial practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
