    <AbstractNarration>The molecular mechanisms responsible for aging remain unclear. Proposed theories ascribe aging to a buildup of deleterious mutations or damaged macromolecules, to the differential advantage of some genes early in life that are later detrimental, or to an age-related trade-off between metabolic energy used early in life for reproduction versus energy used for repair and maintenance. These models are not mutually exclusive and each may play a role in the aging process. From studies of model organisms it is known that aging is associated with a decrease in energy metabolism, decreased rates of protein translation, lower protein turnover, and a buildup of damaged proteins. This protein damage is proposed to be a natural by-product of metabolism and lifespan may be inversely correlated with metabolic rate. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes a novel idea about the molecular basis of aging. The PI hypothesizes that damaged proteins that accumulate with aging are increasingly difficult for cells to degrade and eliminate. Cells respond to the accumulation of damaged proteins by enhancing the expression of protein metabolism genes encoding chaperonins involved in protein folding and enzymes involved in protein degradation. The enhanced protein folding capability is proposed to decrease a cellular protein quality control mechanism that minimizes expression of unstable proteins, thus creating a positive feedback loop that causes even more damaged or unfolded proteins to be created. Regulation of the system could be at either the breakdown of the protein and its mRNA, or at the level of gene expression assuming epigenetic mechanisms have evolved to down-regulate mRNAs encoding unstable proteins. The proposed working model is that controlled expression of unstable or weakly folding proteins (i.e., allele-specific gene expression) is a critical quality-control component of the youthful state that is lost in aging individuals, making the aged individual less vigorous and more susceptible to disease. This aging model predicts that allele-specific gene expression and protein quality control will be maintained during lifespan extension by caloric restriction as well as in worm and fruit fly mutants with extended lifespan. The model also predicts that identification of allele-specific gene expression experimentally coupled with computational analysis of relative protein stability will serve as an efficient assay to monitor and assess the progression of aging. This molecular model can be readily tested by combined computational and wet-lab approaches focused on mice, worms, and flies. Proof-of-concept of this novel theory has important broader impacts, leading to the development of new computational approaches for addressing the aging process which may provide diagnostic and computational approaches to mitigate the impact of inherited deleterious genes in humans.</AbstractNarration>
