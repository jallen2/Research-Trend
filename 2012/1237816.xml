    <AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation project from the University of Arkansas (UA) will focus on the exploration and definition of an integrated circuit research platform based on silicon carbide (SiC) technology to develop gate driver and digital control circuitry for integration into advanced power electronic modules with the aim of achieving higher performing integrated power electronics in terms of size, weight, efficiency, and robustness. It is these modules that serve as the basic building blocks of a vast array of equipment including electrified transportation; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; energy exploration; renewable energy and storage interfaces; and grid-connected power electronics. With approximately 30% of all power produced in the U.S. passing through a power electronic converter or motor drive before it reaches its end use, it is crucial that power electronic systems operate as reliably and efficiently as possible. The U.S. DoE estimates that this percentage will increase to 80% over the next 15 years. Wide bandgap-based power electronics, particularly those made with SiC, have been shown to vastly reduce losses (&gt; 50%); while simultaneously increasing power density, resiliency, and reliability. Even though part cost is higher for SiC devices versus silicon, in many cases, overall system costs are reduced through simpler thermal management due to the higher temperature performance offered by SiC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include developing leading-edge mixed-signal circuitry for use in power electronic modules that will influence a vast array of products used by millions in the U.S. In addition, there are the economic impacts of stimulating the creation of numerous jobs, differentiation in the marketplace for the core partners, and fostering a customer-supplier relationship through the three partners as the technologies mature. With the anticipated growth described above, the market potential for these technologies is clearly in the billions of dollars. Another impact is on an emerging workforce. This project will educate graduate and undergraduate students in building innovation capacity to be followed by accelerating innovations. It will also help to attract K-12 students to the electronics field as a relatively mature research platform undergoes a transformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project include the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Computer Science &amp; Computer Engineering at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville; two small businesses in Fayetteville: Ozark Integrated Circuits and Arkansas Power Electronics International; and Raytheon, a large U.S. company.</AbstractNarration>
