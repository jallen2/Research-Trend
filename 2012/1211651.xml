    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to conduct disk-wind simulations that extend previous work from 2-D to 3-D and simultaneously account for radiation, thermal and magnetic driving effects. The program will address the following questions: 1) How are AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) fed on scales of tens to hundreds of parsecs, and what is the relationship between feeding and feedback? 2) How frequent are mass outflows in the NLRs of AGN as a function of intrinsic AGN properties like black-hole mass, luminosity, and Eddington ratio, and what are their mass outflow rates and kinetic luminosities? 3) What is the connection between nuclear star formation and AGN activity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc, a website to distribute data, and a multimedia presentation to attract high school students into science majors.</AbstractNarration>
