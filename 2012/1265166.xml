    <AbstractNarration>Transferring high bandwidth content is a challenge in vehicular and mobile networks that are limited by spectrum scarcity in the unlicensed bands, short connection times, and the cost of cellular data plans. These observations motivate the use of frequency agile cognitive radios as part of the project called CDRIVE (for Cognitive raDio enabled spectRum-aware Intelligent Vehicular nEtworks). CDRIVE involves the use of theoretical analysis tools and exploration of correlation functions. A major contribution lies in creating a new ns-2 based simulation tool that combines spectrum-related functions in a cognitive radio within a vehicular environment. CDRIVE makes advances towards developing a holistic framework for vehicular cognitive radios networks for allocating roadside base station locations that have spectrum database access capability, enhancing the science of collecting spectrum measurements under different topographical conditions, surrounding urban structures and speeds, and devising a new rate control mechanism that anticipates network and correlated road congestions, and intermittent disruptions due to spectrum outages. CDRIVE will yield insights on integrating cognitive radios with spectrum databases, especially for mobile networks, which are now mandated by the FCC. It will provide the theory and practical validation of the best mobility-aware spectrum-sensing strategies, and tightly couple the external environment with the sensing method. It will also shape future safety-related messaging in vehicles, support real-time telemetry analysis, and allow high-bandwidth communication for emergency response personnel.</AbstractNarration>
