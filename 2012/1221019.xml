    <AbstractNarration>PI: Hunt, Heather&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;br/&gt;Title: BRIGE: Nanostructured Optical Materials for Integrated Optics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Novel optical material systems have tremendous potential to revolutionize the design, fabrication, and performance metrics of micro- and nano-scale integrated optical devices and systems. Fortuitously, new synthetic techniques are available to build, at the molecular level, nanostructured materials that can be tailored for a specific function, such as improved optoelectronic properties. Nanostructured zeolite materials have physicochemical properties that may be tailored framework atom substitution, ion exchange, insertion of active guest molecules, such as laser dyes, etc., and surface functionalization, leading to intriguing new chemical, mechanical, and optoelectronic properties that have yet to be leveraged in integrated optical systems. The goal of this BRIGE research project is to fully characterize the effects of molecular tailoring on the optical properties of zeolite structures, and to determine their applicability for and compatibility with integrated optical platforms. Towards this end, three research objectives will be pursued: synthesis of thin zeolite films of various orientations and compositions, optical characterization of these thin film materials, and integration with optical components through standard photolithographic techniques. The exploration of the unique optical properties of nanostructured materials will not only significantly improve knowledge of designing, at the molecular level, material systems for integrated optics, but will also transform the range of techniques and material systems that can be used to improve the overall performance of a variety of optical platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A fundamental approach to understanding the molecular basis of optical properties in nanostructured materials will advance research in the area of integrated optics technology for communications, sensing, and computing, with direct applications in health and safety. A prominent educational component involving "hands-on" educational and outreach activities, in transformative materials, photonics, and nanotechnology research, will target students from traditionally underrepresented groups to broaden participation. Moreover, the broadening participation plan aims to increase female engineering student participation by improving recruitment and retention efforts. Recruitment activities will include K-12 outreach during summer camp programs, and high school and undergraduate student laboratory experiences for students from local schools and regional colleges, including Lincoln University, with predominantly Black and Hispanic enrollment. Additionally, the PI is piloting the Mizzou Engineering Mentoring Program, a new retention effort that provides professional development and personal support for female students via one-on-one mentoring, and networking. This plan will create a more diverse and engaging environment for underrepresented students. These activities will involve secondary, graduate and undergraduate students, and the general public with the goal of broadening participation for underrepresented groups in fundamental science and engineering research in integrated optical systems.</AbstractNarration>
