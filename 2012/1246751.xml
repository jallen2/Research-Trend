    <AbstractNarration>This award will support the travel and participation of 20 US graduate students in the Cities on Volcanoes (COV) conference to be held in Colima, Mexico during November 2012. The aim of this conference is to break down the traditional divisions between volcanologists, social scientists, emergency managers, planners and engineers. The Cities on Volcanoes conference has a multidisciplinary focus with themes and sessions planned to throw together specialists and students in all of these disciplines that are involved in understanding volcano hazards and their impacts on society. As such it is a special opportunity for young scientists in disparate, yet related, disciplines to learn and to build networks as a basis for their future careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference support award will provide 20 leading graduate students from the USA with an outstanding opportunity to build and expand their professional networks across disciplines and international boundaries. This meeting is particularly appropriate for scientists at the early stages of their professional development. The student participants will meet a wide set of professionals, including emergency managers, sociologists and psychologists, planners, medical scientists, and economists. Learning to surmount cultural and linguistic differences and understanding the need for clear communication will be a feature of the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
