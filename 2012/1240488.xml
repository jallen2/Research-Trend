    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sustainability of algal biofuels production has been the subject of recent life cycle analysis studies and resource analysis studies, which conclude that algal biofuel production must be coupled with production of co-products though distributed or consolidated bioprocessing routes which require water and nutrient recycling to be viable systems.The overall goal of this project award made to Professors Gregory L. Rorrer, Debra Gale, Christine J. Kelly, Bettye L. Maddux, J. Antonio Torres and Robert Durst, all of Oregon State University, is to harness the biosynthetic capacities of algae to make unique and valuable coproducts in addition to advanced biofuels in scalable photobioreactor systems. To demonstrate this integrated approach,the research will harness the unique biosynthetic capacities of photosynthetic, biomineralizing diatoms to flexibly make three diverse product streams: N-acetyl glucosamine biopolymer (chitin) microfibers and its monomer glucosamine for biomedical &amp; food applications, lipids or terpenoid hydrocarbons for chemicals and liquid transportation fuels, and metal oxide nanomaterials with a host of unique properties &amp; applications. This project will focus on bioprocess engineering systems approaches to guide the cellular biosynthesis of three valued product streams by diatom microalgae, all within a single organism. One example configuration to be evaluated incorporates three cultivation stages, each carried out at a separate feeding strategy designed to stimulate biosynthesis of a given product. This is one of the awards made by the Emerging Frontiers of Research and Innovation Program (EFRI) at the National Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Achieving the sustainable production of chemicals and energy will be one of the grand challenges of the 21st century. Photosynthetic microorganisms such as algae can capture solar energy to drive the reduction of CO2 to energy-dense molecules. However, coproducts &lt;br/&gt;are also needed to enable the commercial viability of algal biofuels. The diatom-based biorefinery concept can extend beyond &lt;br/&gt;glucosamine, biofuel, and metal oxide nanomaterials as the major products. However, this is an excellent model system to advance fundamental science and engineering understanding of photosynthetic biorefineries, particularly with respect to the bioprocess engineering and underlying cellular processes in photosynthetic algal culture systems needed to orchestrate the flexible biosynthesis of a diversity of valued product streams, not just biofuels, in a scalable context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will use the proposed EFRI project to deliver multiple education and outreach opportunities, designed to bring photosynthetic biorefinery concepts to a broad audience, and to engage under-represented groups in the biosciences and engineering. Specifically, a research-based summer residential camp for high school students from under-represented groups called SESEY, coordinated through OSU, will be enhanced to provide support for four additional student teams on algal biofuel related topics. Design project modules based on photosynthetic biorefineries will also be incorporated into undergraduate bioengineering capstone design courses. Existing programs at OSU, including the College Assistance Migrant Program, will be used to recruit four undergraduate students from under-represented groups for summer research experiences. Finally, a university-level course titled Navigating the Academy in the Biosciences will be developed to provide professional development of graduate students and post-docs from underrepresented groups in the biosciences and bioengineering.</AbstractNarration>
