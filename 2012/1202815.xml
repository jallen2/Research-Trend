    <AbstractNarration>Steering sound beams: Biophysics of public and private signaling in mixed media&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals display an extraordinary diversity of sounds, odors, and colors to communicate within and between species. The efficacy of communication hinges on signal detection by receivers following propagation through an often cluttered environment. Two key solutions to minimizing distortion involve producing signals that are resistant to degradation, and advertising at times and positions that optimize signal transmission. While much attention has focused on the physics of signal design, little research has explored physical mechanisms underlying behavioral strategies aimed at maximizing propagation. This work explores the biophysics of behavioral strategies employed by Neotropical singing mice (Scotinomys) to maximize sound propagation in different social contexts. The goal is to quantify the influence of relative humidity on the active space of advertisement signals, and investigate how postural changes contribute to the directionality and degradation of specific acoustic parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include developing proficiency in physical acoustics, publishing at the interface of biology and physics, mentoring undergraduate students, and improving methods of disseminating research findings to the scientific community and public. Broader impacts include development of inquiry-based curricula aimed at exploring the interface of biology and physical sciences as they relate to animal communication. The fellow will build on existing networks within local communities in Costa Rica where fieldwork is conducted. Students from elementary schools will be trained to assist in collection and presentation of biological data.</AbstractNarration>
