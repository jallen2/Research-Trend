    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research in support of the 2013 American Chemical Society Spring Meeting titled "Bottom-up Design of the Next Generation of Biomaterials" is cofunded by the Interfacial Processes and Thermodynamics Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. This symposium as part of the Division of Polymer Chemistry program will focus on four specific areas related to the bottom-up design of polymeric biomaterials: 1) novel approaches to synthesis and characterization; 2) design and application for drug and gene delivery; 3) design and application in tissue engineering; and 4) design and application for probing biological systems. The planned sessions are expected to provide recent advances in the bottom-up design, synthesis and characterization; and application of polymeric biomaterials for understanding and directing biological systems. This three-day symposium would offer a forum to highlight the recent developments in the field, and to facilitate discussion of what chemical, physical, and mechanical properties are needed for specific biological applications, and how to achieve these through bottom-up design approaches and novel chemistries. This conference would be of broad interest to researchers in chemistry, polymer chemistry, material sciences, bioengineering, biology, and medicine. In addition, this is expected to facilitate a dialogue among polymer scientists, chemists, bioengineers, and biologists to further the design and application of biomaterials through networking and the open exchange of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium is expected to educate both the biomaterials and chemical communities in the highly relevant area on interdisciplinary research (chemistry, biochemistry, analytical science, materials science, and physics). In addition, this will discuss the latest developments, challenges and opportunities in the area of biomaterials and biological materials and their interactions. The planned sessions offer a forum to highlight recent developments in the field, and to facilitate discussion of what chemical, physical, and mechanical properties are needed for specific biological applications and how to achieve these through bottom-up design approaches and novel chemistries. Organizers expect this conference to be of broad interest to researchers in polymer chemistry, organic chemistry, bioengineering, biology, and medicine. Additionally, this conference will be showcasing the advances of interdisciplinary investigators while training young scientists of the next generation. Furthermore, this will be providing nucleation points for new research avenues and fostering the development of the next generation of researchers and educators.</AbstractNarration>
