    <AbstractNarration>Regulation of protein phosphatase specificity in response to nutrient deprivation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although much is known about how protein kinases function to regulate cell signaling pathways, how protein phosphatases are regulated to de-phosphorylate proteins and counteract kinase function has not been established. How serine-threonine protein phosphatases are regulated by extra- or intracellular signals to achieve specificity towards various substrates is poorly understood. Phosphatase specificity towards a substrate is largely controlled by its binding proteins. Protein phosphatase specificity is achieved through the assembly of a trimeric complex in which the catalytic C subunit interacts with the scaffolding A subunit. This AC complex can then associate with over 15 regulatory B subunits through the A subunit. Binding of a specific B subunit determines substrate specificity. Although protein phosphatase complexes function in almost all known signaling pathways such as stress signaling and cell cycle regulation, the central question that remains unanswered is: How are protein phosphatases actively regulated by different signals to acquire specificity despite the promiscuous activity of their catalytic subunit? A specific B subunit has been identified that is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to glucose deprivation. This B subunit may play a critical role in regulating cell survival under glucose limiting conditions. The proposed research will elucidate the mechanisms that regulate phosphatase substrate specificity in response to glucose deprivation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include learning techniques of mass spectrometry and phosphatase assays. Broader impacts include increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities at the postdoctoral level, as well as mentoring high school and college students from disadvantaged groups who will partake in research at the host institution.</AbstractNarration>
