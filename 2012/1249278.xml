    <AbstractNarration>The product the team aims to bring to market is a cloud-based video encoding and transcoding service with superior performance, flexibility and security features. Customers using this service would upload video files through a web portal (or API) for encoding/transcoding into their choice of formats and bit-rates suitable for display on mobile devices. The differentiating features of the planned cloud video product include: (a) fast encoding/transcoding speed with superior video quality, (b) excellent cost/performance, and (c) the ability to support a wide variety of input and output video formats. Implementation of the proposed cloud service will employ distributed computing technologies such as Map/Reduce and Hadoop to achieve significant parallelism in video processing, resulting in efficient use of computing resources and faster processing time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cloud video prototype to be developed in this project is expected to result in a commercial service with significant revenue potential. The product will simplify video encoding and transcoding for a variety of enterprises including content producers, broadcasters and mobile service providers, by providing on-demand and low-cost video conversion services that currently require on-site equipment with related capital costs. If successful, the cloud video technology will thus enable improved and lower cost mobile content delivery benefiting a broad cross section of Internet and wireless end-users.</AbstractNarration>
