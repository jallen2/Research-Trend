    <AbstractNarration>The International Society for Computational Biology is awarded a grant to support student and early-career researcher participation in the annual meeting on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology in Long Beach, CA, July 15-17. The conference holds thematic sessions for invited presentations, tutorial programs on related subjects, and special interest group workshops. Cutting-edge bioinformatics areas presented at the conference include bio-imaging and visualization, databases and ontologies, evolution and comparative genomics, gene regulation and transcriptomics, mass spectrometry and proteomics, population genomics, protein interaction, and molecular networks and structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will assist students and postdoctoral researchers, particularly under-represented minorities, at a critical but resource-limited stage in their careers by partially funding the travel and expenses associated with attending the conference. Through their participation, these students will have the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge research and methods, gain introductions to international and world-renown keynote speakers and senior level scientists, seek out prospective postdoctoral and collaborative opportunities, and meet their peers from all over the world. Results will be disseminated as published proceedings indexed in MEDLINE and Current Contents, and video recordings of selected presentations will be available online.</AbstractNarration>
