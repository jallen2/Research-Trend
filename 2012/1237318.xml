    <AbstractNarration>This Innovation-Corps proposal builds on previous support and is designed to commercialize ongoing research focused on tailored messaging systems involving severe weather events. Success rates of messaging systems have yielded disappointing rates in previous events due to a "one size fits all" approach to broadcast strategies. Extant communication research has concluded that tailored messages have the best chance for influencing behavior and educating receivers. This effort investigates the potential to commercialize the research previously conducted to provide tailored communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved communication of hurricane information promotes more effective protective decision-making thus saving lives and property; the team employed demographic, socioeconomic, physiological, and psychological data to improve the accuracy and efficacy of advisories and warnings for weather systems. There is now an opportunity to make these scientifically optimized systems available to the public. The I-CORPS proposal to examine commercialization potential extends the scientific knowledge gained from the previous studies to improving communication platforms, which is a potential commercial as well as humanitarian opportunity.</AbstractNarration>
