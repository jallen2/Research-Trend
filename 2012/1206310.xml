    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of Delaware aims to develop synthetic scaffolding materials with robust mechanical properties and defined biological activities for use in the engineering of mechanically active tissues. The investigators will accomplish this goal using chemically modified poly (epsilon-caprolactone) as the base material and multiblock alternating copolymers of peptides and poly(ethylene glycol) for bio-functionalization purposes. Novel electrospinning protocols will be developed for the fabrication of fibrous, elastomeric scaffolds that facilitate the infiltration and attachment of stem cells, and at the same time mediate their lineage-specific differentiation. The proposed hybrid systems overcome the major limitations of existing scaffolding materials and are conducive to the successful engineering of mechanically active tissues. The proposed research program integrates well with the University's effort to establish a new biomedical engineering department, providing a fertile biomaterials training ground for undergraduate and graduate students at Univ. of Delaware. It will also allow the investigators work with teachers at the Newark Center for Creative Learning to advance science education and experimental learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tissue engineering is a fast-growing field that aims to create artificial tissues or organs to replace damaged or diseased ones. In healthy tissue, cells reside in a three-dimensional matrix that provides proper mechanical support and developmental guidance. To create artificial replacement tissues, one must recreate the environment in which the cells originally live. The artificial scaffolds must be highly porous, display important biological signals and be able to sustain repetitive mechanical deformation without breaking down. The purpose of this research is to develop such materials that can be used to coax cells to grow, communicate with each other and to produce their own matrices with the correct composition, structure and function. This will be accomplished by combining a base material with the desired mechanical properties with an engineered, protein-like macromolecule that contains repetitive segments of synthetic polymers and natural peptides, through a novel electrospinning process to create matrices with fibers at the nanometer length scale. This work will enable the creation of sophisticated biomaterials to improve human health, thus justifying the public support. The outreach and education efforts with this award will help maintain the global competitiveness of United States. Efforts with this award will include the establishment of a biomedical engineering department at Univ. of Delaware, the training of undergraduate and graduate students, the mentoring of underrepresented minority students and the development of learning tools for a local elementary school.</AbstractNarration>
