    <AbstractNarration>California State University Fullerton (CSUF), the John D. Cooper Archaeological and Paleontological Center, and various Orange County, California high schools and community colleges are engaged through this award in a planning effort to develop a new geoscience paleontology-based internship program for underrepresented minority students. Five workshops that engage representatives from the partner organizations are being held. Major focus areas of the planning activity are to: build understanding and trust among the different stakeholders; identify the institutional, administrative, and logistical barriers to implementing a successful and sustainable internship program; develop co-curricular activities; and, develop a tracking and assessment plan to monitor students participating in the various programs. The ultimate goal of this program is to engage diverse students in geoscience education and career pathways through hands-on, scientist-mentored research experiences based at the Center. The internship will capitalize on the recently established Cooper Center, which offers numerous opportunities for students to learn about fossil curation and preservation and work alongside professional geoscientists. Additional participants include Fullerton Union, Troy Tech, and Magnolia High Schools and Fullerton, Santa Ana, Santiago Canyon, Mt. San Antonio, Orange Coast and El Camino community colleges. This project directly serves the NSF and GEO Directorate goals of broadening participation in STEM disciplines, generally, and in the geosciences, specifically.</AbstractNarration>
