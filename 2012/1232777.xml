    <AbstractNarration>For more than four decades, the Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium has been an annual conference designed to bring together geomorphologists from across the disciplines of geology, geography, and environmental engineering in order to enable them to exchange research results, become aware of new techniques, explore special themes, identify future opportunities, and enhance collaborative networks. The 43rd Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium will be held in September 2012 at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The theme of this symposium is the field tradition in geomorphology. Participants will hear papers, view posters, and engage in field explorations as they reflect on the history of the discipline, acknowledge key contributions by a number of pioneering geomorphologists who have recently passed away, and consider the role of field work as researchers begin to tackle challenging, societally relevant questions involving climate change and sustainable management of the Earth system. The conference proceedings will be published in a special volume of a leading journal. NSF funding will provide support to facilitate the involvement of students and invited presenters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2012 Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium will provide a forum to honor the field tradition in geomorphology and explore its potential to help advance the field in the future. It will facilitate greater cross-fertilization among research groups from different regions, and it will pass on the field tradition to the next generation of geomorphologists to early-career researchers and students.</AbstractNarration>
