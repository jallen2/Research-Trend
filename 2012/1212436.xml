    <AbstractNarration>Workshop on Recent Advances in General Topology, Dimension Theory, Continuum Theory and Dynamical Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nipissing University, North Bay, Ontario will offer a Workshop on Recent Advances in General Topology, Dimension Theory, &lt;br/&gt;Continuum Theory, and Dynamical Systems in order to bring senior and junior researchers and students in these areas together &lt;br/&gt;for a five-day series of talks and seminars. The workshop will be held at Nipissing University campus in North Bay, May 17-22, &lt;br/&gt;2012. It will be jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the Fields Institute of Canada. The scientific focus &lt;br/&gt;of the workshop will be on recent advances in topology, including dimension theory and continuum theory, and dynamical systems. &lt;br/&gt;Senior researchers will share fundamental research techniques and recent results with attendees, including post-doctoral, &lt;br/&gt;graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and junior researchers who received the PhD within the last 6 years. Among other &lt;br/&gt;topics, recent results on the topology of buried points in Julia sets, the solution of Lelek's problem on the span of continua, &lt;br/&gt;and extending isotopies of plane continua, all of which have application in both topology and dynamical systems, will be &lt;br/&gt;discussed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems uses tools from many areas of mathematics, and motivates these same areas by raising questions, both &lt;br/&gt;fundamental and applied. In the workshop, students and junior researchers, whose focus on the way to a PhD has necessarily &lt;br/&gt;often been narrow, will be exposed to research techniques and results that draw from multiple sources. The areas of topology, &lt;br/&gt;dimension theory, and dynamical systems traditionally have experienced overlapping research interests, but it is somewhat &lt;br/&gt;daunting for students to acquire the background needed to work in the overlap. NSF support will enable at least 10 US-based &lt;br/&gt;students and junior researchers to attend the workshop and expand their research horizons. Major speakers with international &lt;br/&gt;reputations are being selected who are active in these research areas. The format of the workshop is designed to maximize the &lt;br/&gt;opportunities for interaction among the participants beyond the lectures. Time is provided in the workshop schedule for both &lt;br/&gt;formal talks and informal interactions among the junior and senior participants, including every afternoon an informal question &lt;br/&gt;and answer session for the students and junior researchers with the day's speakers. The links formed are likely to have &lt;br/&gt;continuing impact on the research direction of both junior and senior participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;url: http://www.nipissingu.ca/topology</AbstractNarration>
