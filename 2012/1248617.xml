    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will allow the optimization of the novel Plasma-shell technology for incorporation into a large area Ultra-Violet (UV) emitting tile for use in germicidal applications. Plasma-shells are small gas encapsulating devices that emit light when energized. This research will focus on improving the transmissivity of the hermetic outer wall of the Plasma-shell to improve overall efficiency. Plasma-shells are lightweight, low cost and extremely rugged devices. The Plasma-shell is the only UV technology that can offer ultra large area completely diffuse (Lambertian) light output, which is very useful for conventional UV sterilization. These attributes will have an even greater impact when used to energize TiO2 in a photocatalytic process. UV activated TiO2 is a powerful catalyst that can be used in the breakdown of chemicals and the destruction of pathogens in contaminated water. However, the efficient scaling of the TiO2 photocatalytic process is dependent on efficiently coupling the UV light source to the TiO2. The envisioned large area low cost Lambertian output from an array of Plasma-shells will provide a previously unavailable lighting option that will make possible the efficient scaling of a TiO2 based water purification system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes a novel technology that will provide a large area, efficient and low cost Ultra-Violet (UV) light source. This research has high commercial potential as the end product will be more efficient, environmentally safe, rugged and more cost effective than the current state-of-the-art UV light sources. Under this SBIR, the focus will be on the optimization of the Plasma-shells as a powerful UV light source to stimulate photocatalytic processes, primarily for water treatment. This will have an impact on a large growing global market. The economic delivery of pure water has societal impact, as many in the world still do not have access to clean water. Low cost, rugged, efficient purification systems that will result from this research will help to spread access to clean water. Additional promising applications for the UV light emitting Plasma-shells include sterilization of surface areas, purification of air, medical light therapy, protein analysis, drug discovery, polymer and ink printing, optical sensors and instrumentation, UV ID verification, barcodes, forensic and bodily fluid detection and analysis, counterfeit detection, and superficial/cosmetic treatment.</AbstractNarration>
