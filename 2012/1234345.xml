    <AbstractNarration>There is growing evidence that genetic variation within and among populations of key species plays an important role in marine ecosystem processes. Several experiments provide compelling evidence that the number of genotypes in an assemblage (genotypic richness) can influence critical ecosystem functions including productivity, resistance to disturbance and invasion or colonization success. However, these studies use only the number of genotypes as a measure of genetic diversity. Recent analyses of species diversity experiments show that phylogenetic diversity may be a more reliable predictor of ecosystem functioning than simply the number of species. However, such approaches have not yet been applied to understanding the effects of genetics on ecosystem functioning. While genetic relatedness within a species holds the potential to predict the outcome of intraspecific interactions, and the functioning of ecosystems that depend on those species, we currently have few data to assess the shape or strength of this relationship. The investigators will build on their own previous work, and that of others, in eelgrass (Zostera marina) ecosystems showing strong effects of genotypic richness on a spectrum of critical ecosystem processes. The investigators will ask whether genotypic richness, or - as in studies at the level of species diversity - genetic relatedness/distance better predicts ecosystem functioning? If genetic relatedness measures are better predictors, then what mechanisms underlie this relationship? Can genetic relatedness predict ecological relatedness? Although the current focus is on eelgrass, the research should be applicable to many systems. The project will assess the relationship between genetic relatedness and phenotypic distinctiveness of a key marine foundation species and use manipulative experiments to test the relative importance of the number of genotypes in an assemblage vs. their genetic relatedness and trait diversity for ecosystem functioning. Specifically, experiments will: (1) characterize the relationship between genetic relatedness and trait similarity among individual genotypes of eelgrass, including responses to experimental warming; (2) compare the effects of genetic relatedness and trait similarity among genotypes on the outcome of intraspecific competitive interactions; and (3) test the relative effect of genetic relatedness vs. number of genotypes of eelgrass on the growth of eelgrass, its associated ecosystem functions it (e.g., primary production, nutrient dynamics, trophic transfer, habitat provision, and detrital production and decomposition). Broader Impacts: Seagrass ecosystems provide important services to coastal regions including primary production, nutrient cycling, habitat for fisheries species, and erosion control. Previous studies have shown these services can be compromised by reduction in the numbers of species of grazers or genotypes, but this study will allow a more predictive approach to diversity loss by integrating the effects of multiple components of diversity and clarifying the extent to which diversity effects can be predicted by the genetic or ecological uniqueness of component genotypes. The PIs will continue to be involved in direct communication of findings of biodiversity-related research to federal and state agencies and other stakeholders. This grant will integrate physiological, community, and genetic approaches to studying marine ecosystem functioning and will train a number of young scientists (postdocs, grad students and undergrads) at this interface. This project will interface with 4 outreach/training programs, including an NSFsupported UBM collaborative program for undergrads, a University of California-sponsored program that brings students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities to UC Davis for summer research experiences at the interface of ecology and evolutionary biology, a GK-12 program based at Bodega Marine Lab focused on coastal marine science; and a program that brings elementary school classes to the campus for a coordinated series of interactive field trips.</AbstractNarration>
