    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Flipping Learning Models to Illuminate Nanomanufacturing and Nanomaterials for Photovoltaics", at the University of Pittsburgh, under the direction of Dr. Paul W. Leu, is to establish an interdisciplinary education and research framework to prepare future engineers to take on the grand challenge of manufacturing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells through the scalable integration of nanomaterials. The National Academy of Engineering has identified making solar energy economical as a grand challenge of the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the critical role of nanotechnology in next-generation photovoltaics and the need for educational programs to prepare future engineers to develop new innovations for this application, the PIs propose to develop an interdisciplinary education and research framework for illuminating photovoltaic devices, nanomanufacturing, and nanomaterial concepts and experimental practices. This project will (1) design a flipped undergraduate course, ENGR 1248: Nanomanufacturing and Nanomaterials for Photovoltaics, where lecturing and reading occur outside of the classroom and active learning involving conceptual exercises, learning tasks, and instructional laboratories occur-in-class, (2) teach this flipped undergraduate course, which will impact 30 to 40 Engineering students per year and be part of the Engineering School's new Nanoscience and Engineering Certificate, (3) advise undergraduate summer research projects through the Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation which will develop about six students per year, and (4) create online content for high school students by extending INVESTING NOW outreach through Pitt's Engineering Office of Diversity that has involved about 150 high school students per year. The proposed project seeks to provide students with (the four I's) inspirational motivation, intellectual foundations, innovation skills, and increased involvement.</AbstractNarration>
