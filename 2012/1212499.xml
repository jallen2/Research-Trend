    <AbstractNarration>Recent years have seen the growth of a new field at the intersection of computer science and economics: algorithmic economics. So far there were few opportunities for students to receive a concentrated exposure to this field. This first-ever summer school on algorithmic economics, to be held at Carnegie Mellon University in Summer 2012, will bring together roughly fifty Ph.D. and advanced undergraduate students from computer science and the social sciences; and top researchers in algorithmic economics, who will give concentrated classes on their areas of expertise. The summer school will cover areas such as mechanism design, equilibrium computation, social choice, social networks, market design, and fair division. The proposed summer school will promote understanding within algorithmic economics, as well as foster collaboration between computer scientists and social scientists. It will emphasize emerging areas in algorithmic economics and help increase interest in these areas, thereby leading to conceptual and technical advances. The summer school will also serve as a basis for future summer schools on algorithmic economics.</AbstractNarration>
