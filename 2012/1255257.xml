    <AbstractNarration>This EARLY concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) focuses on developing a novel multifunctional composite material with self-sensing capabilities for identifying damage initiation and propagation for civil infrastructure applications. Specifically, multifunctional core-shell composite particles, composed of a polymeric core and an inorganic shell, which are responsive to stress, humidity/temperature, degradation, etc, will be designed and synthesized. The chemistry, physics, and structure/property relationship of the smart composite particles will be explored. In addition, the synthesized smart composite particles will be embedded into polymer composites to understand the mechanics of damage initiation through the length scales and monitor/sense damage evolution. The fundamental questions to be addressed are: 1) How to validate environmental responsiveness and multifunctionality in composite particles for civil engineering applications and what are the structure/property relationships? 2) What are the particle-matrix interactions and detection capability of damage precursor under stress, humidity/temperature, or degradation? 3) How does damage affect the mechanics of structural composites?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is anticipated to be transformative since it explores next generation smart composite materials with potentially optimized self-sensing, thermal, electrical, and future self-healing properties. The research output is expected to make a significant impact in a number of new and aging civil infrastructure applications where composite structures are currently inspected with low resolution techniques. The number of failures in civil structures due to environmental conditions or natural phenomena has increased in the past few years. Current state of the art inspection techniques cannot detect damage precursors or even small scale damages. This project has the potential to bring sensing and inspection technologies to the level necessary to provide critical risk assessment information. In addition, the research team will continue their ongoing outreach efforts to mentor graduate and undergraduate students and to engage high school students and teachers. The research team will also participate in the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program at Arizona State University to broaden the participations of underrepresented groups. Finally, the project illustrates a good example of the importance of applying fundamental research to addressing some of the grand challenges in engineering</AbstractNarration>
