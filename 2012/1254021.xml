    <AbstractNarration>This research will advance our knowledge of user-generated doctor ratings on the Internet, thereby providing the basis for improving these systems and increasing their value for better consumer choices. In so doing, the research will achieve a more general advance in our understanding of online reputation systems. The study has three aims: (1) to examine the supply of online doctor ratings, including their prevalence, growth trends, and the factors that affect rating posting behavior; (2) to assess the informedness of online doctor ratings, especially whether these ratings truly reflect the quality of the doctor or whether they are biased and misleading, and (3) to understand the use and impacts of online doctor ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the growing popularity of online physician ratings, there is surprisingly little study of this emerging trend. What motivates patients to provide online ratings? To what degree do the ratings reflect a doctor's clinical quality? How do patients use these ratings, and how are their decisions affected as a result? In what situations should patients be cautious when using online doctor ratings? Can the user interface design and information display be improved to make the ratings more useful? The research represents the first systematic study of these fundamental questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this study will have a direct impact on the policy and practice of quality transparency in healthcare. They will be particularly beneficial for senior citizens, who require more medical services, but they also will be incorporated into new college curriculum. Furthermore, upon completion of the study, the methods and non-proprietary data will be made publicly available to further enhance the research and education infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
