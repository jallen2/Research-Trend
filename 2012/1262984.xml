    <AbstractNarration>This award establishes a new CISE REU site focused on mobile computing security at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis. A team of faculty will lead undergraduate students in hands-on projects based on the latest research on mobile device security, mobile cloud security, and mobile social network security. Working together in small groups, the students will learn how to plan, implement, and evaluate research projects. Participating students will have access to an internal cloud computing platform as well as smartphones and tablet computers. Through this program, participants will gain first-hand experience in research and graduate student life, which will help them make informed decisions in pursuing postgraduate studies as well as in choosing professional careers. This project is co-funded by the CISE Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) Cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The intellectual merit of this proposal includes a faculty with expertise in mobile and cloud computing security, an important and timely area of computing that is of national interest. Students will acquire first-hand experiences with state-of-the-art technologies, which are often inaccessible to them due to high acquisition and maintenance costs. Through this REU grant, students will work with faculty mentors in completing cutting-edge research projects that have the potential to change our everyday computing experiences. By the end of program, students will acquire valuable skills, gain a broader and deeper understanding of research, and develop greater confidence in their abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The broader impact of this proposal is to help students tap into cutting-edge research, to boost their interests in science and engineering, and to inspire them to pursue postgraduate education in these fields. The team is committed to recruiting underrepresented minority and female students, as well as students from institutes with inadequate resources to conduct research in mobile computing security. Thus the project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.</AbstractNarration>
