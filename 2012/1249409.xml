    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER proposal, developing a dense deformable object tracking method for testing and ground-truthing highly dynamic maneuvers of robotic vehicles, offers to prototype a radically new approach to instrumentation for highly agile machines of many types. Using heterogeneous fusion of numerous sensing modalities, the PI proposes to create a high resolution, high bandwidth map of deformable and articulated bodies such as cars with suspensions, humans, legged robots, and such for the performance evaluation and algorithm development for these highly dynamic research artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This work will facilitate a wide variety of research, including studies of agile robotics in dynamic environments. The impacts to robotic science, especially agile and fast moving robots, are clear. The system will also have impact on any other science, such as human motion analysis, ergonomics and medical rehabilitation, where accurate, dense tracking and mapping of deformable scenes is required.</AbstractNarration>
