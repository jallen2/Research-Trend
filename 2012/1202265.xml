    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to demonstrate one of the most critical components of Silicon nanophotonics - systems consisting of optics and electronics in a single chip for low power high data computing- an on-chip optical isolator. The program will investigate the feasibility of the device from its theoretical requirements and performance to a fully demonstrated device. Optical isolators used to eliminate parasitic reflections that are detrimental to the stability of the system. The program will aim to demonstrate a small footprint isolator device that is electrically operated and is CMOS compatible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the program is the advancement of nanophotonics research and all of its practical implementations as it will provide a solution to the long-standing problem of on-chip optical isolation while maintaining CMOS compatibility. Furthermore, the fundamental knowledge gained in this research is also applicable to other novel photonic structures as its foundation lies in studying allowed photonic transitions in different optical structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the enhancement of knowledge and broader participation of undergraduate and graduate students across a variety of disciplines related to photonics. Among the proposed activities the PIs will develop a seminar series to provide a forum to enhance the knowledge transfer between students across different field, introduce novel research areas in the ECE curricula and involve undergraduate students in the research program. The PI will also expand the current Women ECE program in Cornell university which has already impacted a large number of female graduate students in Cornell University.</AbstractNarration>
