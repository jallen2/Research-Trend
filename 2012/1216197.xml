    <AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Robust Statistics (ICORS) has been an annual international conference for the past 12 years. The ICORS meeting for 2012 (ICORS2012) will be held in the University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont from August 5-August 10, 2012. The conference will span five days with double sessions for most of the days. The lectures will include invited speakers, chosen with the help of suggestions from the steering committee; theme based invited sessions organized by the individual organizers, contributed sessions and poster sessions. The funds from NSF are primarily to support approximately 15 junior researchers and graduate students from within the United States. The conference is cosponsored by the Minerva Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the ICORS conferences is to bring together researchers interested in robust statistics, data analysis and related areas. This includes theoretical and applied statisticians as well as data analysts from other fields, and includes leading experts as well as junior researchers and graduate students. The ICORS conferences create a forum to discuss recent progress and emerging ideas in the area and encourage informal contacts and discussions among all the participants. The ICORS2012 will be the first such conference to be held in the United States. This is important since it will encourage a larger participation of researchers, and in particular young researchers, from the United States, to engage in research interaction and exchange of ideas with their colleagues from other countries. It is anticipated that the conference will continue to also have a large international representation. The ICORS2012 will contribute to the enhancement and improvement of scientific activities through presentations of latest research results, intensive discussion after presentations, and informal exchange of ideas. The meeting will help collaboration among researchers of diverse backgrounds and geographic locations. The meeting will also contribute to educational activities, as it will attract a substantial number of junior researchers and students to interact with senior researchers in the field.
