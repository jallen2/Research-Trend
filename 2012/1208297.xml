    <AbstractNarration>This project provides funding to support the participation of US researchers in the two-week long research school Senegal Workshop on Geometric Structures and Control Theory that will be held at the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar (Senegal) from May 7 to May 18, 2012. The workshop will explore recent advances in symplectic geometry, contact geometry, sub-Riemannian geometry, as well as hyperbolic geometry, with a special emphasis on the interplay between all these aspects of geometry and applications to control theory. More information about the program can be found at the website: http://cimpadakar2012.ucad.sn/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the meeting is to bring together experts and young researchers working in geometry and control theory. The workshop introduces graduate students and young researchers to current research topics in geometry and control theory. In addition, it provides an opportunity for international collaboration between researchers and encourage cross fertilization between different relevant topics.</AbstractNarration>
