    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1212234, Khine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: Micro- and nanotechnologies have emerged to become one of the most ?game changing? fields in science over the past few decades. In particular the ability to control and manipulate matter at small length scales has already led to major advances in a range of different areas such as microelectronics, energy, biomedicine and environment. Given the increasing amount of interest in this area the ?Micro- and Nanotechnology in Medicine Conference? (MNMC) aims to bring together leading experts in the area of micro- and nanotechnology to present the latest work on the use of various types of technologies for addressing a range of different challenges that are of importance for biomedicine and education of engineers at the interface of engineering, medicine, and biological sciences. This conference will be held in Hawaii, on Dec 2-6, 2012. The conference organizers have partnered with IEEE-EMBS (IEEE- Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society), one of the leading societies at the interface between engineering, biology and medicine, to present a program that is highly rich in both intellectual merit as well as educational opportunities. In particular the conference brings together students from various academic institutions with world leading experts in a small and intimate setting that will enable ample opportunities to network and learn. The conference will focus on a number of unique areas that are highly inter-related yet not fully put together in a similar program. These areas include fundamental science of micro- and nanofluidics and small matter to applications in engineering the environment of cells using various ?small-scale? technologies, developing devices to detect and analyze molecules for biosensing and global health applications. Another unique aspect of the conference is the involvement of people from companies. The proposed conference will generate a range of opportunities for students and young investigators to learn about the process of developing and commercializing a technology from industry speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The potential impact of this proposed MNMC is far-reaching. Because this conference combines fundamentals of micro and nano science and engineering with their applications in medicine, it will catalyze conversations between otherwise disparate fields. Various biomedical grand challenges facing our society and the world can be addressed in part or in whole by interfacing biology and medicine with nanotechnology. By drawing leaders from each of these fields together to discuss ways of addressing important medical issues with the most cutting edge technology in an intimate venue, it will enable progress at the interface of science, engineering, and medicine. To maximize the broader impact of such a promising conference, several approaches are proposed to raise awareness, with the larger scientific community as well as engage participation by under-represented minorities by hosting:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Workshops for students to engage more intimately with thought leaders. Students can get to know leaders in the field through workshops to help guide and further their careers. Having access to mentors is a critical component for a successful education, and therefore providing a forum to engage mentor and student interactions would help facilitate this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine Panel Luncheon. With still so few women in engineering and science, a panel luncheon in which women can learn from established role models as well as open a dialogue on how to best attract and engage women in these burgeoning fields is needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Best poster awards for undergraduates and for graduate students. poster competitions will be held to encourage the highest quality research and presentation at the undergraduate as well as at the graduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Travel grants for US students. These grants will enable students who otherwise cannot afford to come to participate in this conference. The grants will be distributed based on merit (quality of paper submission) with consideration for inclusion of under-represented minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>
