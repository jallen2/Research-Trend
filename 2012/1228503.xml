    <AbstractNarration>Autism presents major public health concerns. Almost one in every hundred children born today has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most research has been directed to causation and treatment of ASDs in childhood, although much remains. However, little is known about these children as adults: how they adapt; their social, legal, and medical needs; their challenges and successes. As they become adults, persons with ASD may face many different concerns, including employment discrimination, independent living, educational needs, health insurance, medical treatment and capacity to consent, risks of exploitation in business dealings, guardianship and conservatorship, and more. The affective disabilities characteristic of ASD also may affect work performance, relationships, community living, social and recreational opportunities, abilities to access governmental services, encounters with law enforcement, and other legal needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Utah's postdoctoral fellow in Law and Social Science will develop an understanding of the experiences of adults with ASD and their legal needs. Unique data resources are available at the University of Utah, including families involved in long-term genetics research in the Utah Autism Research Program and the extensive family and other data in the Utah Population Database. Individuals in these families will also be able to provide valuable insight into attitudes about the growing number of genetic tests becoming available for ASD. From these data, the fellow will identify issues facing adults with ASD, research the experiences and needs of adults with ASDs, and explore unmet legal needs of these adults and their families. Mentoring the fellow are law faculty at the S.J. Quinney College of Law, social scientists, physicians, and lawyers representing persons with disabilities at the Utah Disability Law Center. A planned outcome of the project is the identification and recommendation of legal proposals that may be critical across the life cycle of people with ASD.</AbstractNarration>
