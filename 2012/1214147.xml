    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a three-day workshop at the FLASH center in Chicago on visualization and analysis for astrophysics simulation codes, focused primarily around the yt package. The workshop covers various aspects of yt, including introductory material, advanced usage and mechanisms for community involvement. Expected outcomes of the workshop include instruction on how to speed up analysis and visualization of astrophysical simulations; expansion of the user and developer base of yt, encouraging further development and support of new codes; and nurturing collaborations between computational astrophysicists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this workshop include the dissemination of educational curricula related to the commonly-used yt analysis toolkit and a specific activity on public outreach and education through scientific visualization. Extensive curricula and worked examples will be made available online and will provide a resource for new users and early stage researchers to learn how to utilize this package and decrease the time necessary to learn a new system and productively analyze data.</AbstractNarration>
