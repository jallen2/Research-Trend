    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation makes two main theoretical contributions. First, the theory provides an explanation for contemporary patterns of descriptive representation in the legislature. Second, Party Fit Theory has implications that extend beyond the realm of descriptive representation and politics.  The theory offers an additional explanation for the persistence of polarization.  Party Fit Theory suggests that it may be difficult to elect moderate candidates to a polarized political environment.  This dissertation advances both the representation and partisan polarization literatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation seeks to explain partisan differences in representation by developing a theory of Party Fit. Party Fit Theory suggests that a party's ideological reputation sends messages about the type of candidate that belongs in the party. This project focuses on three mechanisms to explain differences in descriptive representation. The first hypothesis explores patterns of attraction among potential members of the legislature. The second hypothesis analyzes patterns of retirement among members of legislature. The third hypothesis examines patterns of support from party activists. A notable feature of the project is that Party Fit Theory is tested on data from within and outside the legislature, whereas previous research tends to focus on one or the other in isolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research contributes to the broader academic and non-academic communities. The findings will be presented at academic conferences and submitted to scholarly journals, and the datasets generated will be made publicly available to scholars. In the future, the Co-PI will teach classes on representation, and the research will enhance the teaching, training, and learning of undergraduate and graduate students. The project also has important consequences for American politics and the quality of representative democracy. We must consider how partisan dynamics affect the election of representatives. This dissertation provides the most complete picture to date of the impact of partisan polarization on representation.</AbstractNarration>
