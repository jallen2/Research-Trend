    <AbstractNarration>Commutative algebra and representation theory are two flourishing areas of research in algebra. For commutative algebra, early on, its roots in algebraic geometry and number theory provided the major influences, while representation theory was partly motivated early on by problems in physics. More recently there has been significant interaction between these two areas. Some of this interaction goes back to the work of Auslander, his students and collaborators in the 1970s, but the last decade or so has seen a striking resurgence of new ideas and research in the overlap, as exemplified by recent work of Avramov, Buchweitz, Burban, Huneke, Iyama, Reiten and Yoshino, to name only a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been relatively few joint meetings in the U.S. allowing researchers in commutative algebra and representation theory and their students to interact. It is vital to support the continued interactions between the areas by bringing together top researchers to report on their findings and to establish new cross disciplinary collaborations. Equally important is a gathering where recent doctorates, graduate students, and faculty from primarily teaching institutions can learn about recent developments and establish research connections with other workers across the two fields. To address these issues, the investigators plan a three-day conference at Syracuse University. The conference will take place on April 13-15, 2012. Leading researchers from both commutative algebra and representation theory will speak on their findings. Ample time for discussions will also be available to provide an opportunity for the participants, including the speakers, to establish new cross-collaborations. We intend to recruit an audience in which graduate students and recent doctorates are significantly represented. The URL for the conference is http://www.commalg.org/ROBfest/</AbstractNarration>
