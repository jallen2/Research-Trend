    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Janis Louie of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. This project focuses on the preparation of a variety of cyclic and acyclic compounds from environmentally friendly and readily available starting materials. Previously, transition metal catalysts that mediate the cycloaddition of unsaturated hydrocarbons and heterocumulenes had been developed in Professor Louie's laboratory. This project focuses on the elucidation of the mechanism of these cycloaddition reactions in order to develop more efficient metal-mediated reactions. Expanding the scope of these metal catalyzed cycloaddition reactions will also be a focus. In addition, further studies of a recently discovered important intermediate in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions will be pursued. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Louie's research efforts revolve around the development of facile transition metal-mediated methods for the formation of cyclic and acyclic compounds. In addition, new methods for utilizing benign starting materials will be evaluated. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on any area of activity in which the synthesis of molecules is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and biological and chemical research. In addition, this project will provide training opportunities for students from the pre-undergraduates to post-doctoral level.</AbstractNarration>
