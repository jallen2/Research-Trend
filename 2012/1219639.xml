    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0546574&lt;br/&gt;Wanpracha Chaovalitwongse&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers University New Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: NOVEL OPTIMIZATION METHODS FOR COOPERATIVE DATA MINING WITH HEALTH-CARE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an urgent need to advance and apply quantitative and qualitative approaches to the study of&lt;br/&gt;epilepsy and brain disorders. As uncontrolled epilepsy poses a significant burden to society due to as-&lt;br/&gt;sociated healthcare cost, this project is aimed at the development of an automated seizure prediction&lt;br/&gt;system and brain abnormal activity classifier. To achieve this goal, optimization-based data mining&lt;br/&gt;(DM) approaches will be developed to quantitatively analyze the brain activity through electroen-&lt;br/&gt;cephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed DM techniques will excavate hidden patterns/relationships&lt;br/&gt;in EEGs, which will give a greater understanding of brain functions (as well as other complex sys-&lt;br/&gt;tems) from a system perspective. Specifically, a new DM paradigm for the seizure prediction and&lt;br/&gt;brain activity classification will be developed based on novel optimization-based DM techniques for&lt;br/&gt;feature selection, clustering, and classification. The proposed research will contribute to the computer&lt;br/&gt;science, engineering and medical communities along the following four lines: (1) the development of&lt;br/&gt;novel mathematical models and optimization techniques for DM problems and time series analysis,&lt;br/&gt;(2) the implementation of statistical techniques to detect patterns from selected features/clusters&lt;br/&gt;for predicting seizures and classifying normal and epileptic EEG activity, (3) the utility of detection&lt;br/&gt;theory and the experimental designs to assess and validate the efficacy, robustness, and uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;of the proposed DM paradigm as well as fine-tune the optimal parameter setting, (4) the extension&lt;br/&gt;of the fundamental research findings in optimization and DM to other cross-disciplinary research,&lt;br/&gt;which will constitute a new avenue of research in optimization-based DM and time series analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is very crucial to decision making processes in real world problems. Success&lt;br/&gt;of this research will advance the state-of-the-art in the field of optimization in DM, and have a&lt;br/&gt;greatly significant impact on medical research. The research scope in this proposal touches upon&lt;br/&gt;several emerging optimization and DM problems, which are driven by ever growing computational&lt;br/&gt;power. The proposed research has shown a broad impact on many research fields including computer&lt;br/&gt;science, operations research, computational biology, and logistics. The scope of this project itself&lt;br/&gt;will broaden opportunities and enable the participation of all citizens women and men, underrep-&lt;br/&gt;resented minorities, and especically persons disabled by epilepsy. Success of this proposal in seizure&lt;br/&gt;prediction research will relieve the anguish from this life-threatening disease and improve the life&lt;br/&gt;quality of at least 2 million Americans (14 millions worldwide), who are currently suffering from&lt;br/&gt;epilepsy regardless of race, age, or gender.</AbstractNarration>
