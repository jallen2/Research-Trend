    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Massachusetts Boston to organize and conduct a workshop for the NSF BIO Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program Directors. The workshop is scheduled for April 12-14, 2012, in Arlington, VA. Over 150 participants are expected to attend, and a Leadership Council has been formed to assist in the planning. The goals of the workshop are to (1) enhance the opportunities presented by the BIO REU Common Assessment Tool (2) advance Ethics/Responsible Conduct of Research training at the undergraduate level, (3) share ideas for improving individual program implementation including reporting; and (4) discuss best practices in student recruitment, international and interdisciplinary research experiences, and mentor training. These goals will be accomplished through presentations and breakout groups and through opportunities for discussion and networking among participants. A final report will be submitted to NSF that will summarize the workshop findings. A website for BIO REU program directors, faculty, and students has been developed and launched (http://www.bioreu.org) and will be used to facilitate implementation of recommendations from this workshop. The PI, Alan Christian, may be contacted for more information at Alan.Christian@umb.edu.</AbstractNarration>
