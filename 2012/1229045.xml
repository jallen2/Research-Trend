    <AbstractNarration>As imaging technologies have developed, scientists and engineers have leveraged these advances to remotely sense the environments in which we live to complement and/or replace in situ measurements of the same. Remote sensing has evolved to include photography, sonar, radar, radiometry and most recently LiDAR (light detection and ranging). This award will provide a ground-based LiDAR system, also known as a 3D terrestrial laser scanner, for use by researchers, research trainees and students from throughout the University of Vermont (UVM). The instrument will rapidly produce 3D digital datasets and scans over time will result in 4D data that can capture the evolution of environments over days, seasons, and/or years. The instrument will be used to monitor natural environments such as snowpacks, streambeds, agricultural land and forests. In addition, the instrument will be used to assess built historic, civil and transportation infrastructure. The project team comes from diverse fields as civil, electrical and environmental engineering, geography, geology, forestry and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3D terrestrial laser scanner will provide new and unique capabilities to the State of Vermont's only research University and will enable new interdisciplinary research at UVM and new collaborations throughout the State. The acquisition is also synergistic with existing entities at UVM working in the areas of transportation, spatial analysis and complex systems. Finally, the instrument will provide new opportunities for UVM students by enhancing the Engineering curriculum and an existing minor in Geospatial Technologies.</AbstractNarration>
