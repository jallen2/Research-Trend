    <AbstractNarration>This project supports travel grants to US students and junior faculty to participate in the 31st IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS)(http://web.mst.edu/~cswebdb/srds2012/)being held in Irvine, CA, USA, October 8-11, 2012. This is a high quality technical conference for researchers and practitioners who are interested in reliability, security, availability, privacy, and safety of distributed systems. It typically attracts 100-125 papers, 25-30 accepted papers, and 75 to 100 attendees. In addition, the conference also has workshops and PhD forum activities. The middle-sized nature of this conference makes it suitable for extended technical discussions among participants. Being held in the US to enable participants from the US to learn about the computing profession and research environment around the world will likely to have an enriching effect on the fledgling research careers of the awardees and start off discussions between them and the academic and industrial participants from US, Europe and Asia in general.</AbstractNarration>
