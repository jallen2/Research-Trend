    <AbstractNarration>This award will enable continuation of research and development of plans for an underground accelerator laboratory that would address fundamental questions in nuclear astrophysics like understanding the origin of the elements and the chemical evolution of the universe. The goal is to eventually address three long-standing fundamental problems in nuclear astrophysics: solar neutrino sources and the core metallicity of the sun; carbon-based nucleosynthesis; and neutron sources for the production of trans-iron elements in stars. Each of these processes requires precise measurements of very low-energy nuclear cross sections. However, because of the small cross-sections and large radiation backgrounds in the typical laboratory environment, the use of underground-based low-energy accelerator facilities is required to advance our knowledge of low energy stellar reactions. The Dual Ion Accelerator for Nuclear Astrophysics (DIANA) is a proposed next generation underground accelerator laboratory providing enhanced capabilities in terms of substantially higher ion beam intensity, different ion species, and broader energy range than those at current facilities. It would enable measurements of solar burning cross-sections at lower energies with higher precision and enhance our knowledge of more complex reaction mechanisms during late stellar burning. This award provides support for research and development, feasibility studies of underground sites, and project development and definition so that the DIANA team can further advance the design activities and deliver reliable cost and schedule estimates. This work builds upon the conceptual design that was developed for the Homestake Mine in South Dakota. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If DIANA is eventually built, the facility will host a large number of graduate student and postdoctoral researchers and users, contributing to training professionals in the areas of radiation physics and nuclear technologies, which are essential for the national needs in medicine, energy production, defense, industry, and government. An outreach program will be developed in collaboration with the Joint Institute of Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA). It will take advantage of the opportunities offered by an underground location and will be organized in coordination with local colleges and outreach organizations.</AbstractNarration>
