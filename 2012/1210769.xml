    <AbstractNarration>Although most plants are essentially stuck in one place for most of their life cycle, they are able to move to new and sometimes distant locations as seeds. Understanding how seeds move or "disperse", is important for determining a plant species' ability to traverse increased distances to find suitable habitats as those habitats change naturally or through the actions of humans. The availability of nutrients might strongly affect the number of seeds a plant can produce, the quality of those seeds, and how far they can disperse. To understand how changes in nutrients might influence seed dispersal, tallgrass prairie seeds will be collected along a north-south gradient from Texas to Minnesota from plots to which nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium have been added. Dispersal patterns are difficult to understand because most prairie seeds are too small for traditional tracking devices. To combat this difficulty an alternative approach will be used: the "flight" of seeds will be studied in wind tunnels, using aerodynamic engineering technology to determine the distances seeds can travel. These distances will be used to make predictions about the ability of different plant species to move between disparate habitats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will immerse undergraduate students in both the Engineering and the Biology Departments at Iowa State University (ISU) in research that integrates biology, mathematics, engineering and technology. This unique approach will allow for broader thinking of young scientists. In addition, the cross-departmental nature of this project will give students and faculty the chance to expand the current scope of their research studying seed dispersal from many angles. Results from this research will be incorporated into ISU curriculum through undergraduate seminars developed by graduate students. The importance of integrating engineering, math and technology into the biological sciences will also be presented through various interactive activities to elementary and middle school students through local programs that encourage exploration of science at a young age.</AbstractNarration>
