    <AbstractNarration>The Pierre Auger Observatory is the world's largest experiment to measure the properties of cosmic rays with energies above 10^20 eV. The origin of these cosmic rays remains a profound and compelling mystery in particle astrophysics. Auger is a hybrid detector consisting of two coincident but distinct detector systems: (1) an array of 1,660 water-Cherenkov Surface Detector stations spread over an area of 3,000 square kilometers for detecting air shower particles on the ground; and (2) a set of four Fluorescence Detector telescopes which provide calorimetric measurements of the development of cosmic ray showers as they propagate through the atmosphere. During the past few years, Auger has reported several important results that place significant constraints on theory and provide essential clues as to the origin and nature of the highest energy cosmic rays. This award will support the research activities of the High Energy Particle Astrophysics (HEA) group at Case Western Reserve University. The group has central responsibility for GPS event timing and calibration, and for monitoring the performance of the telecommunications system on a daily basis. The PI also serves on the Auger Observatory Technical Board as Task Leader for telecommunications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The group's expertise in custom wireless communication systems, non-imaging optical systems, and precise nanosecond GPS timing has led to several methods and instrumentation that may have applications to other scientific, technical and industrial fields. The group has worked with approximately 30 undergraduate research assistants over the past nine years. The PI is also active in a variety of education and outreach programs such as after school programs.</AbstractNarration>
