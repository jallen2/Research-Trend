    <AbstractNarration>One of the most computationally challenging tasks in Numerical Linear &lt;br/&gt;Algebra (NLA) is the estimation of the trace or the determinant of functions &lt;br/&gt;of matrices. The computational difficulty arises for very large matrices &lt;br/&gt;where the computation of the entire spectrum is infeasible. Traditionally, &lt;br/&gt;this problem is approached through stochastic techniques, such as Monte &lt;br/&gt;Carlo, where each step involves the solution of a linear system of equations. &lt;br/&gt;Deterministic techniques could provide approximations much faster but &lt;br/&gt;introduce bias in the result. This research will employ a combination of &lt;br/&gt;these techniques. Deterministic techniques involve novel uses of &lt;br/&gt;traditional NLA tools such as low rank approximations, deflation, and &lt;br/&gt;preconditioners, not only for speeding the solution of linear systems but also &lt;br/&gt;for reducing the variance of the stochastic process. The team plans to use Hadamard &lt;br/&gt;vectors, which are popular in coding theory, with an ordering induced by &lt;br/&gt;hierarchical graph-coloring, to produce a deterministic sequence of sampling &lt;br/&gt;vectors for Monte Carlo that exploits the structure of the matrix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although most of these techniques address the general NLA problem, the &lt;br/&gt;motivating application is lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD). The goal &lt;br/&gt;of LQCD is to calculate the properties, structure, and interactions of hadrons,&lt;br/&gt;the basic constituents of matter. Computation of observables in LQCD entails &lt;br/&gt;averaging of correlation functions over an ensemble of gauge fields. &lt;br/&gt;These correlation functions often require the trace of the inverse of a large &lt;br/&gt;sparse matrix, or the ratio of determinants of two such matrices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is increasingly clear that there is an opportunity for real gains by &lt;br/&gt;harnessing the synergy between randomized and deterministic techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Based on such an approach, this research will advance the current &lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art in NLA, while transforming some of the standard computational &lt;br/&gt;practices in LQCD. It will also be useful in other disciplines, as the &lt;br/&gt;problem is common in many statistical applications, in data mining, &lt;br/&gt;in uncertainty quantification, as well as in quantum physics applications &lt;br/&gt;such as quantum Monte Carlo.</AbstractNarration>
