    <AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue experiments to measure thermal conductivities and related properties of small-molecule organic semiconductors, important for many anticipated applications including thin film transistors and thermoelectric power generators. Whereas several rules correlating electronic properties and crystal structures have been developed over recent decades, the same is not true about understanding thermal transport; in addition, traditional techniques for measuring thermal conductivity often don't work well for many organic crystals, for which crystals are small and thermal conductivities low and anisotropic. The PI and his students will use a number of static and dynamic techniques, some developed in this project, to measure thermal conductivities of bulk crystals and thin films, relevant for most devices. The aims are to both gain understanding of what limits and controls heat conduction and to screen materials for possible applications. In addition to Ph.D. students, who will gain extensive experience in different experimental techniques, the project will employ undergraduate education majors, who will gain valuable experience in doing scientific research which they can share with their future pupils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue experiments to measure thermal (heat) conductivities and related properties of small-molecule organic semiconductors. These materials are being explored and developed for a number of applications, including as thin-film transistors, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. For transistor and solar cell applications, it is important that the materials have sufficiently high thermal conductivities so that heat generated in their operation can be efficiently carried away. For thermoelectric applications, on the other hand, one desires a low thermal conductivity so that one can easily establish a temperature drop across the sample. The PI and his students will use a number of techniques, some developed in this project, to measure the thermal conductivities of both bulk crystals and thin films, relevant for many applications, of select materials. In addition to Ph.D. students, who will gain extensive experience in different experimental techniques, the project will employ undergraduate education majors, who will gain valuable experience in doing scientific research which they can share with their future pupils.</AbstractNarration>
