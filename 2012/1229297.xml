    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-29297&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Nooshabadi, Saeid&lt;br/&gt; Kuhl, Scott; Wang, Chaoli&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Michigan Technological University&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI/Dev: Infrastructure for Research in Multi-view Video, Graphics, Visualization and Immersive Virtual Environment Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, developing an instrument consisting of a large-scale tiled display, multiple video capture cameras, and a high-performance GPU cluster for large-scale data analysis and visualization, and multi-view coding and rendering, aims to enable a significant amount of research where graphics, vision, and multi-view video converge (including image-based modeling and rendering (IBMR) and MPEG-4/7). The instrument additionally includes augmentation of traditional interfaces that support research in 3D merger of graphics and video-coding, augmented reality and human perception research. It will also be used a to further advance the development of novel algorithms and techniques for large-scale data analysis and visualization, immersive virtual environments and image coding, as well as their on-going collaborations with scientists and researchers at national laboratories and industry. As evidenced by the availability of very large flat-panel displays and basic tracking systems such as Xbox Kinect, these types of coders, displays, and tracking systems should become more mature and affordable in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed instrument can greatly impact the areas of telemedicine, manufacturing, and robotics. It can also be used for classes on computer graphics, virtual environments, data visualization, multi-media, and computer gaming. The PIs propose to organize summer programs to attract high-school students into &lt;br/&gt;science and STEM related areas.</AbstractNarration>
