    <AbstractNarration>This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the University of California-San Diego (UCSD). The focus of the multidisciplinary site is on cyber-physical systems research motivated by real world challenges in exploration and scientific discovery. The site expands the successful UCSD Engineers for Exploration program to include students from other universities. The program's aim is to give a unique experience for motivated students by providing an intimate mentored lab environment at UCSD, and a structured collaboration with scientists, explorers, and engineers at the UCSD partner organizations. These partner organizations include the National Geographic Society, Hubbs SeaWorld Research Institute, the research arm of the San Diego Zoo, NOAA, the Organization of Latin American Subacuatica (OLAS), the Waitt Institute, and the Canadian Department of Environment and Conservation. The program provides undergraduates with a unique opportunity to develop technology that will be deployed across the world; the projects involve scientific research that literally spans across every continent and into the far corners of the globe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The REU participants will be exposed to exciting research projects centered on exploration and scientific discovery while utilizing a vast array of engineering disciplines across a wide range of research topics. They will work with accomplished faculty and scientific mentors using state-of-the-art facilities to perform cutting-edge cyber-physical systems research. In addition, they will be exposed to extensive professional development activities through weekly research skills workshops, an undergraduate research conference, and a REU journal club. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The site will seek a range of participants from diverse backgrounds who may not otherwise have the opportunity to participate in research. The projects are aimed at creating technology for conservation, cultural heritage, and exploration, and ultimately deployed in the field by scientists and explorers around the world. The REU participants will work closely faculty, scientists, postdoctoral scholars and graduate students. Together with the planned community building activities, this will make the REU site a positive and memorable experience, encouraging REU participants to pursue further training. Finally, the program provides leadership training to the graduate student and postdoctoral mentors. This will benefit the countless others whom they will train throughout their careers.</AbstractNarration>
