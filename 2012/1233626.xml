    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports research on a novel fabrication methodology for creating smart polymer surfaces and nanostructures that are capable of changing shapes at nanoscale. The proposed methodology combines the nanofabrication capability of nanoimprint lithography (NIL) with the stimuli-responsive 'shape memory' effect of network polymers. An experimental platform will be developed to precisely determine the geometry and the energy associated with the nanoscale shape change, which, in turn, will enable systematic examinations of how the NIL parameters such as temperature, pressure and processing time influence the nanoscale shape memory effect. A range of bulk shape memory polymers with systematically-varying chemical and physical properties will be studied for their applicability as the proposed new class of smart surfaces and nanostructures. In addition, unique applications enabled by this new fabrication methodology in areas of optics and biomaterials will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of the research will advance our current understanding of nanoscale shape memory effect of polymers, and shed light on the entropic (or rubber) elasticity of polymers at length scale approaching the network structures. The research will also provide a new methodology for fabricating smart polymer surfaces and nanostructures at low cost and without the need for complex chemistry, and establish the structure-processing-property relationships needed for using this methodology for scalable manufacturing. This research will also enhance the professional development of graduate students, promote diversity in science and engineering disciplines, and enrich K-12 outreach, with a focus on emerging polymer-based nanofabrication technologies.</AbstractNarration>
