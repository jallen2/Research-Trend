    <AbstractNarration>This project supports the research focused on computational stereoscopic imaging for enhanced visualization at Portland State University. Stereoscopic 3D enabled devices are becoming more ubiquitous, providing their users with a more immersive experience. However, there exists a gap between the increasing demand of stereoscopic content and the limited capability of stereoscopic content production. Stereoscopic content needs to be carefully produced to avoid 3D fatigue. This project enables research to bridge this gap by establishing a stereoscopic imaging, displaying, and system infrastructure to support the research on computational stereoscopic photography and cinematography, stereoscopic systems support, and next-generation multi-lens stereoscopic imaging. This infrastructure consists of a comprehensive spectrum of stereoscopic imaging equipment and a range of stereoscopic displays. The stereoscopic imaging equipment includes both the state-of-the-art commercial cameras and the development of a platform to mimic next-generation multi-lens imaging devices. A particularly important component of this project is to develop a large, diverse set of conventional stereoscopic videos and multi-lens stereoscopic imaging data that will be shared with the community to promote computational research on stereoscopic 3D. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project helps to better understand the relation between capture, compression, and display, and to facilitate the production of high-quality stereoscopic content to reduce the side effects such as 3D fatigue and headaches that people have from viewing low-quality stereoscopic content. The research results are disseminated through conference and journal publication and the research data, particularly the stereoscopic video library, is shared online.</AbstractNarration>
