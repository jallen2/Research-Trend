    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to conduct experimental investigation of novel nonlinear material and&lt;br/&gt;waveguide designs and to develop a compact, integrated photonic device platform for nonlinear optical&lt;br/&gt;devices operating in the mid-infrared spectral region. There is a current dearth of nonlinear optical&lt;br/&gt;devices in the mid-infrared and the proposed research program aims to fill this void.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits are: (1) novel device architecture for slow light propagation with low loss and (2)&lt;br/&gt;new tunable light sources and amplifiers for the mid-infrared frequency region. The slow light devices&lt;br/&gt;are based on photonic crystals to enable dispersion engineering necessary for slow light but has radically&lt;br/&gt;different designs to circumvent the fundamental limits imposed by scattering loss. Additionally, the&lt;br/&gt;devices will be implemented in a chalcogenide material system, with high nonlinearity and Raman gain,&lt;br/&gt;long infrared transparency, and a high glass transition temperature.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are many. First, the proposed work will broadly impact the applied physics and&lt;br/&gt;materials science world by providing a new class of devices based on nonlinear-enhancement from slow&lt;br/&gt;light. The capability of ultralow threshold for nonlinearities will open a wide application space for the use&lt;br/&gt;of&lt;br/&gt;devices with standard, low cost lasers. The potential to demonstrate a low-threshold nonlinear optical&lt;br/&gt;device in the mid-infrared will be transformative for applications in sensing, spectroscopy,&lt;br/&gt;communications, medicine and more. The project is also designed to integrate research with education at&lt;br/&gt;both undergraduate and graduate levels, attract underrepresented minority students, and offer outreach to&lt;br/&gt;general public.</AbstractNarration>
