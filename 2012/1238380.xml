    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit and Objectives&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit and objectives of the meeting are to provide an open, inclusive, and interactive forum that provides an effective learning environment for all participants, especially undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. NSF funds are requested to increase the breadth of participation to include many young researchers that have an interest in plant cell biology. The meeting will include oral presentations, posters, workshop, and time for informal discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;1) To provide an open and inclusive forum for oral presentations that allow all labs to share research results. Lead PIs will provide brief 5 minute overviews of each research area to define key knowns as well as important knowledge gaps. Student and post-doc presentations will be geared toward teaching all participants basic methodology as well as data interpretation. Ample time will be devoted for discussion.&lt;br/&gt;2) To provide an opportunity for all participants to present and discuss their results in evening poster sessions.&lt;br/&gt;3) To conduct hands on workshop on fundamentals of fluorescence microsopy, with an emphasis in colocalization analysis. Kevin Eliceiri from the Madison Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI) will give a workshop on using ImageJ for data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;4) To provide a forum for students and post docs to publish interesting images in a web based cell image gallery.</AbstractNarration>
