    <AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project entitled - A Problem-Based Learning Approach to Teach Gaming and Development of Gaming Instructional Modules to Enhance Student Learning in Lower Level Core Courses - has the goal to implement a problem-based learning approach to teaching game development that focuses on developing critical thinking in game design and development of gaming instructional modules to enhance student learning in lower level core Computer Science courses. The objectives are: to develop gaming instructional modules; to enhance the Computer Science course curriculum with problem-solving activities based on gaming instructional educational modules to improve students' understanding of the theoretical concepts; to prepare competitive engineers and computer scientists at Bowie State University, a Historically Black University; to assess and evaluate student understanding; and to disseminate the project findings through journal articles, conferences and colloquia presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables of this project will be a repository of gaming instructional modules that could be integrated in any computer science curriculum with minimal modifications to existing courses. Outreach activities include the use of networking sites such as Facebook and YouTube, which will lead to increased public interest in the field of Computer Science and help to recruit students from underrepresented groups to pursue STEM careers. The students trained and educated will be better positioned for admittance to graduate school and employment in a constantly evolving interdisciplinary workforce.</AbstractNarration>
