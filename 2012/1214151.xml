    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Diane K. Smith of San Diego State University develops new methods to control supramolecular structure through electron transfer. The first set of projects builds upon previous work with two hydrogen-bond systems by exploring different means to create redox-dependence in existing three and four hydrogen-bond homo- and heterodimers. The second set of projects addresses the need to develop strong, selective, on/off redox-dependent binding systems that work in aqueous solution. A completely new approach based on the use of radical pi-dimerizations will be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many advanced applications of supramolecular chemistry will require some means to control structure using an external signal. Electron transfer is a particularly attractive approach because it provides a natural conduit between the nanoscopic world of supramolecular assemblies and the microscopic realm of conventional electronics. The new possibilities for electron transfer signaling opened up by this research may impact a number of future technologies, including molecular electronics, smart materials, and molecular machines. More immediately, it will provide excellent education and training to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are from groups under-represented in science.</AbstractNarration>
