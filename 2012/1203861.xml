    <AbstractNarration>Brominated flame-retardants (BFR) are ubiquitously distributed in the environment and capable of being transported to the arctic by long-range processes (i.e., global distillation). The proposed research would measure BFR concentrations in air and water, and study processes that control their fate in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and light from surface water bodies at the Toolik Lake long-term ecological research (LTER) station. Specific objectives include:&lt;br/&gt;1. measure BFR levels in air and water bodies at the Toolik Lake LTER;&lt;br/&gt;2. collect, isolate, and elucidate the structural and photolytic properties of DOM from water bodies at the Toolik LTER;&lt;br/&gt;3. study BFR partitioning to DOM and assess the role of DOM composition on this process;&lt;br/&gt;4. measure the degree to which direct and indirect photolysis occurs for BFR in the respective presence and absence of DOM using solar simulators and natural sunlight at Toolik Lake; &lt;br/&gt;5. identify the reaction products produced by the phototransformation of BFR; and&lt;br/&gt;6. elucidate reactive pathways that control the phototransformation of BFR in the presence of DOM. &lt;br/&gt;This project would study a BFR environmental pathway that is a critical link in the bioaccumulation of these substances in the arctic food chain. It would primarily provide lab and logistical support for a doctoral student, and would also support an undergraduate assistant during the summer field season. The investigators plan an active outreach program including interfacing with the LTER Schoolyard program and ARCUS, and the graduate student would maintain a research blog.</AbstractNarration>
