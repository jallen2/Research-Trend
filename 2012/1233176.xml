    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate a low cost, high speed, tunable NanoMachining approach using sharp cantilever tips with the help of ultrasonic vibration. The controllable ultrasonic vibration between the tip and the sample enables tunable fabrication of features across a wide dimensional range in one pass with high efficiency. This research incorporates process innovation and process modeling (empirical models for analysis of the nanomachining process with respect to material, geometric and process parameters) to create a novel manufacturing process for high rate nanofabrication. A high speed, high precision nanopositioning stage will be explored to fully utilize the high rate capabilities of the ultrasonic vibration assisted nanomachining process to create a novel manufacturing system, capable of high-throughput fabrication of 2D and 3D nanoscale features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will advance the emerging nanomanufacturing industry by providing a low-cost, high-throughput method for the fabrication of 2D and 3D nanostructures. Considering the cost and high investment of other nanofabrication approaches (e.g. e-beam lithography, EUV-lithography), the results from this research will provide a transformative and efficient framework for the fabrication of nanoscale features and devices with the potential to contribute to many evolutionary products, such as nano-electronics, solar cells, photonics, and biomedical devices. Moreover, this research will integrate broad discoveries in nanotechnologies, nanofabrication, mechanics, process modeling, and instrumentation into a high rate, cost effective nanomanufacturing system. Meanwhile, the planned multidisciplinary research-based education program will link the research outcomes and students? activities to the needs of contemporary industry for nanotechnology, nanofabrication, and instrumentation. The research results will be broadly disseminated through technical publications, workshops, regular and short courses, and K-12 outreach program.</AbstractNarration>
