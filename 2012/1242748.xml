    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing support for graduate students to attend a workshop organized in conjunction with the fall 2012 annual symposium of the Association for Advancement in Artificial Intelligence. The workshop entitled Artificial Intelligence for Gerontechnology was held November 2nd to November 4th, 2012, in Arlington, Virginia. Gerontechnology is an interdisciplinary academic and professional field combining the study of aspects of aging and technology to address the challenges arising from the demographic changes due to aging society. Artificial intelligence techniques are considered to be among the key components of the solutions within the gerontechnology domain supporting care for elders. Intellectual Merit: The symposium advances the state of the art in artificial intelligence by considering problems and solutions that are inspired by the challenges in developing gerontechnology. Specifically, the topics addressed include the following: 1) novel approaches for dealing with sparsely annotated data, 2) innovative machine learning techniques that can improve the generalization of technological solutions across a wide range of real-world settings and 3) design of modeling algorithms that take advantage of domain knowledge. Broader Impacts: While the goal of the symposium was to advance the field of AI with the focus on elder care applications, the solutions resulting from the symposium can also be applied to other health care areas such as assisting chronic patients in hospitals and homes. In addition, the educational aspect of this workshop provides the opportunity to educate future workforce with expertise at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence and care for the elders.</AbstractNarration>
