    <AbstractNarration>SES-1203474&lt;br/&gt;Jane Sell and Tony Love&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: How Power Affects Empathy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study examines the relationship between power, gender, and the ability to predict human behavior, a phenomenon closely related to empathy. Specifically, this study answers the question: Is the ability to predict another person's behavior more affected by power, by gender, or a combination of both? The project is grounded in social psychological literature and interdisciplinary research on the role of non-verbal communication. Previous research has found that women are more empathetic and are better able to predict the behavior of others than are men. One possible explanation for these findings is that women are socialized how to be empathetic, whereas men are taught to devalue this ability. Alternatively, women may be better predictors because they usually hold less powerful positions. Thus, women learn that predicting the behavior of more powerful others can benefit them. Because men are, on average, more socially, economically, and physically powerful than women, men may learn that their own lives are not affected meaningfully by predicting the behaviors of others. This study will explore the effects of power and gender by conducting an experimental study of participants engaged in power-balanced and power-imbalanced tasks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This study informs our understanding of how power differentials shape interactions between people. Findings from this project may be of interest to the general public as well as employers and policy makers. Findings may also have implications for how men and women negotiate professional relationships. Findings will contribute to extant research by discerning whether accuracy in role-taking is a function of individual attributes or structural position.</AbstractNarration>
