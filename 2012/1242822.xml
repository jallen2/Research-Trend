    <AbstractNarration>The Tebenkof Bay Project was funded by the National Science Foundation as part of PI Herbert Maschner's dissertation research. The project resulted in Maschner's PhD dissertation (1992), contributed directly to Ames and Maschner's book "The Peoples of the Northwest Coast (1999)," and a special section published in (1991). Data from this research was used in 16 articles and chapters, and dozens of conference presentations. As part of this project, over 75 boxes of midden remains, including nearly 100,000 fish bones, were collected. In recent years a number of new science research initiatives in ancient DNA, stable isotopes, elemental analysis, and fisheries studies have requested samples from this collection. However, in order to be fully useful for these new techniques, the collection needs to have an updated catalog and archival storage system. This project provides support for cataloging the collection, creating the metadata to facilitate access, and preparing the collection to be returned to Alaska and stored at the Museum of the North where the data can be easily accessed by scientists and interested Alaska Native community members.</AbstractNarration>
