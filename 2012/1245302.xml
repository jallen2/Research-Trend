    <AbstractNarration>Depletion of nonrenewable resources, air, water, and soil pollution, global warming, depletion of stratospheric ozone and forests, scarcity of water for drinking and agriculture, and excessive population growth are among the major challenges to the global society. The United Nations indicated in the Brundtland Report1 that the ?current patterns of resource consumption and environmental degradation could not continue as they were and in order to reduce the problem facing us, society must act as a whole.? Today, environmental sustainability, energy sustainability, manufacturing sustainability, process and product sustainability, water sustainability, business sustainability, etc., are studied and practiced extensively. How to ensure engineering sustainability becomes a focal point for long-term development. The chemical and allied industries have been working collaboratively towards solutions to the pressing issues that we need to address today and in the future. This has greatly stimulated the academic institutions to develop sustainable-engineering-focused innovative and aggressive research and educational programs. A forum for the researchers and practitioners in this area to share their research and educational experience will be highly desirable. Therefore, the 3rd International Symposium on Sustainable Chemical Product and Process Engineering on Sustainable Chemical Engineering is proposed that is planned to be held in Dalian, China, June 2-5, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The 3rd symposium will have the following main objectives: (i) to share knowledge and research experience in studying economic, environmental and social sustainability, (ii) to assess the state-of-the-art green chemical product and process engineering, (iii) to bridge the gap between research and development, strengthening the linkage between academia and industries, (iv) to discuss research directions for the chemical and allied industries to move towards sustainability and educational approaches for the integration of industrial sustainability into the chemical engineering curriculum, and (v) to explore opportunities for international collaboration in the proposed technical areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The project will facilitate US researchers/educators to exchange knowledge with leading researchers and educators in over 10 countries, and help the US delegates identify international collaboration opportunities in the research and education of sustainable chemical engineering. Junior faculty and researchers as well as graduate/undergraduate students, especially those in the underrepresented ethnic groups, will be encouraged to participate in the symposium. This symposium will also include two mini-workshops for catalyzing international collaborations on sustainable chemical engineering research and education</AbstractNarration>
