    <AbstractNarration>This research will explore the role of the bacterial protein SeqA in genome stability. This important but poorly understood protein appears to be involved in protecting cellular DNA during replication from deleterious recombination events. Themes established here can be extrapolated to other organisms and potentially lead to the development of genome manipulation procedures in important and diverse bacterial systems. This work will also help explain how a large and important family of mobile DNA elements or "jumping" genes that can move between sites in the DNA are capable of disseminating genetic information across vastly different types of bacteria using a protein called TnsE. This work also indicates features that are conserved across the most distantly related organisms on earth while highlighting a feature that allows a parasite to adapt to specific types of bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will be disseminated widely at multiple venues including national and regional meetings. Tn7 is an important tool for modifying the genetic content of a broad variety of bacteria for basic science and industrial applications. The work will continue to facilitate such efforts. In addition to training a graduate student, the work will also involve multiple undergraduates in meaningful research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
