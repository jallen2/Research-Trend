    <AbstractNarration>This award partially supports a series of three national and international Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia organized by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) for early career researchers: the German-American Frontiers of Engineering (March 29-31, 2012, in Potsdam, Germany), the U.S. Frontiers of Engineering (September 13-15, 2012, in Warren, Michigan), and the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering (October 29-31, 2012, in Irvine, California). Each symposium focuses on four topical areas. The topics for the 2012 symposia are the following: engineering materials for the biological interface, serious games, climate engineering, vehicle electrification, robotics, smart grid, bio-inspired materials, massive data management, engineering for natural disasters, engineering for energy sustainability, engineering for agriculture, and image management/video analytics. About 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S. symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate. Each two and one-half day symposium includes four formal sessions, technical tours, break-out sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative research partnerships. Sessions consist of presentations on cutting-edge research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields relevant to the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FOE symposia provide early career scientists and engineers the opportunity for sharing research insights and techniques to foster new collaborations and, in the case of the bilateral meetings, deepen technical and cultural understanding between the countries' participants. The symposia foster interdisciplinary and international collaborations and serve as a reference point for many of the emerging frontiers in research and innovation in the United States. American innovative capacity is strengthened through these exchanges. Papers from the U.S. FOE symposium will be published in a volume available on the National Academies Press website at http://www.nap.edu.</AbstractNarration>
