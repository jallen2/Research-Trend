    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. The 17th Annual Meeting of the RNA Society will be held May 29-June 3, 2012 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The meeting will bring together scientists working on many aspects of RNA biology. There will be numerous sessions covering a broad range of topics including: RNA-protein interactions, non-coding RNAs, ribosomes and translation, RNA-protein architecture, RNA-seq and computational structure prediction, RNA turnover, interconnections and regulation, ribozymes and riboswitches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. As in the past, the meeting will include special events aimed at engaging students and postdocs. The roster of speakers is diverse and includes many junior scientists. The format of the meeting (short talks, workshops and poster sessions) offers an excellent opportunity for sharing latest research findings and for building the kinds of professional networks that are so crucial to scientific success.</AbstractNarration>
