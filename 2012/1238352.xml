    <AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Marc Bermann, Hugo Ikehara will investigate changes in prehispanic settlement patterns and elite activities during the Late and the Final Formative Periods (1200- 200 B.C.) in the Nepeña Valley, Peru. This time period has been identified as one of marked societal transformation on the prehispanic Peruvian North Coast, including the disintegration of the overarching Cupisnique-Chavín religious tradition, considered one of the ideological foundations for local and regional political leadership. However, practices related to this cult were abandoned before 750 B.C. in the Coast and around 500 B.C. in the Highlands. The following period has been characterized as a time of intensified conflict and social reorganization. The research will explore the proposition that in this relative political and ideological "vacuum," varied and alternative power strategies, rooted in ideology, economic processes, or military force will quickly arise, as ambitious leaders search for the most effective new means of establishing authority or power. As a way of better understanding archaeological "collapse," this research aims at identifying the factors that might shape different political trajectories in such settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the focus of this research is archaeological, the level of social organization observed in prehistoric Peru bears significant resemblance to many parts of the present day countries in the developing world. The project provides insight into how, over the long term, political and social organization changes in response to collapse of central authority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in the Nepeña Valley has shown that part of this process was the abandonment and construction of large public architecture centers. Mr. Ikehara's research will involve a four-month, 100% archaeological survey of the Upper Nepeña Valley, mapping of major centers, and a program of intensive surface collection. The data generated will be used to address issues of: (1) regional political organization; (2) the nature of public ceremony, and its role in local and regional social integration; (3) the forms and variability in power strategies pursued by elites, and (4) demographic trends and changes in man-land relationships. Recent improvements in survey methods and in local ceramic chronology will permit multiscalar study of continuity and change in elite activities from the Late through the Final Formative Period. The proposed research therefore aims at producing a better understanding of sociopolitical flux in the Andean past, and exploring how such flux can be studied without excavation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include: the implementation of long-term research that will serve as a framework for integrating current research at different sites in the valley, as well as the results of archaeological research from decades past; an Andean test of a survey methodology that has proven effective in China, Colombia, and other regions around the world. Project results will be disseminated in peer-review publications in the United States and in Peru, and the data will be made available to a global public online through the University of Pittsburgh data base in comparative archaeology website. Peruvian students from different universities will participate in the fieldwork, and will be trained in current survey techniques. Special reports from the project will be disseminated to cultural heritage authorities in Peru to aid in planning for site conservation and tourism.</AbstractNarration>
