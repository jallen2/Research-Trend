    <AbstractNarration>Historically, many of the most important advances in cellular neurobiology have been made studying mollusks, such as squid and snails, as model systems because mollusks have exceptionally large nerve cells. The giant nerve cells of squid enabled the analysis of the mechanism of the action potentials found in nerve cells and the mechanisms by which neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, are released at synapses. Snails, with their very large nerve cells and simple neural circuitry, have enabled major advances in our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. Many key cellular and molecular discoveries in mollusks have proved generalizable to the brains of mammals, because these mechanisms have been conserved throughout evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will bring together neurobiologists who work on two important molluscan groups, the simpler gastropods (e.g. snails) and the more complex cephalopods (e.g.squid and octopus) to freely discuss their latest findings. Octopus and squid represent advanced forms of intelligence that evolved entirely independently from vertebrates. These distinct forms of intelligence have the potential for providing influential models for developing artificial intelligence and computer-controlled precise motion of artificial appendages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will generate novel collaborations among attendees, particularly because this is a unique venue for discussions between leaders in gastropod and cephalopod neuroscience. Cellular, molecular and genomic advances in gastropods have the potential for greatly benefiting research in more complex cephalopods. Abstracts of talks will be available on an open website, along with new methodologies presented. This will accelerate the pace of research, leading to new discoveries that can provide insights into the basic functioning of the brain. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will present their research to senior scientists in the field, and interact with them at mentoring sessions, which will benefit their development as researchers.</AbstractNarration>
