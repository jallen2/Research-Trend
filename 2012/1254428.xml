    <AbstractNarration>Whether aerosols are internally (multicomponent) or externally (one component) mixed impacts aerosol-cloud interactions. The approach of this CAREER project centers on developing innovative modeling tools for quantifying the impact of per-particle (single) aerosol microphysical and chemical properties on aerosol-cloud interactions, on the micro to global scale. The work is motivated by growing observational evidence that shows tremendous variations in the chemistry and dynamics at a single-particle level. At present, however, the impacts of these variations are largely unquantified since in current regional or global models this complexity is not well-represented. This contributes to the large uncertainties in assessing the impact of aerosols on climate, limiting us from predicting the future impacts of air pollution on climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive education and outreach plan that focuses on enhancing "climate literacy" along with the the recruitment of students into the STEM fields is integrated with this research. The educational program targets students and teachers at the middle-school level, students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and the wider community.</AbstractNarration>
