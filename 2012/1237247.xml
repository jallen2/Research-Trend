    <AbstractNarration>This Innovation Corps project will explore the potential of developing a marketable innovation based on the use of 3-ketoacyl ACP synthase III (KASIII) enzymes. KASIII catalyzes the first carbon-carbon forming reaction in fatty acid biosynthesis, and thus determines the chemical nature of the omega of the fatty acids produced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed innovation is based on engineering of of the biocatalyst, KASIII, and would result in the production of bi-functional molecules that can act as the monomer percusors for making bio-based plastics. This innovation will provide novel bi-functional, bio-based feed stocks to the emerging bio-renewable chemical industry for the production of novel "green" plastics and specialty chemicals. The proposed I-Corps team envisions a technology that will be initially targeted to the synthesis of hydroxy-fatty acids, but can be readily advanced upon to produce other bi-functional monomers (e.g., amino-fatty acids, which can be used to produce polyamides). If successful, this technology will lead to chemical products that can act as substitutes for petroleum-based chemical products, and be precursors for novel bio-based products.</AbstractNarration>
