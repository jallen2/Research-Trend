    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to design and fabricate compact, low-threshold and narrow-linewidth microcavity-based mid-IR sources and to demonstrate their application as key components for ultra-sensitive gas detection. The approach is to use high optical quality (high-Q) Whispering-Gallery Mode (WGM) resonances in rare-earth-doped fluoride glasses microspheres and microdisks; these will be optimized to demonstrate narrow-linewidth ?comb-like? mid-IR luminescent sources and tunable low-noise mid-IR lasers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The convergence of two recently emerging areas in photonics, i.e. mid-IR rare-earth-doped glasses and high-Q optical microresonators, not only enables the possibility of demonstrating novel mid-IR laser and sensor technologies, but also lays the groundwork for further investigation of different aspects of high-Q mid-IR resonances in areas such as nonlinear and quantum optical phenomena. Operation in the mid-IR regime and sensing based on the absorption spectrum of the target molecules will reduce the need for surface functionalization and affinity-based detection that is currently used in almost all high-Q WGM optical biosensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed mid-IR sources have immediate application in basic research on nonlinear optics, biochemistry, and sensor technology. Low-power, low-weight, compact, low-cost and high-sensitivity WGM-based mid-IR sources will benefit society in areas such as biomedical research, environmental control, medical diagnostics and microfabrication. The multidisciplinary nature of this project will stimulate collaboration among different departments at the University of New Mexico. The PIs have also developed plans for collaboration with minority serving colleges, K-12 and post-secondary teachers and students.</AbstractNarration>
