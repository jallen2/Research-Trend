    <AbstractNarration>Effects of nutrient availability and warming on greenhouse gas fluxes from lowland tropical forest soils: An integrated approach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The response of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes to multiple and interacting global change factors, such as warming and increased nutrient availability resulting from changes in biogeochemical cycles, is poorly understood in tropical forests but will certainly play a key role in the future global climate. This study will use a novel, integrated approach, that includes simultaneous measurements of three of the most important GHGs (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)) both in the field and in the laboratory, to advance our understanding of how increased nutrient availability and warming influence fluxes of these GHGs from soils in a lowland tropical rain forest in Costa Rica. This study will provide a new perspective on biological and physical controls on these fluxes after chronic (5 years), relatively large scale (30 x 30m), and replicated (N= 6) nutrient manipulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will broaden conceptual understanding of lowland tropical forest ecology by investigating belowground processes and fluxes, and will enable the Fellow to acquire new methodological and analytical tools. Data stemming from this project will be relevant to calibrate models used to generate regional or global emission inventories. The proposed research will broaden conceptual understanding of lowland tropical forest ecology by investigating belowground processes and fluxes, and will enable the Fellow to acquire new methodological and analytical tools. Data stemming from this project will be relevant to calibrate models used to generate regional or global emission inventories. In addition, exploring GHG emissions that occur at the soil-atmosphere interface is an essential part of the effort to integrate land management strategies with climate change mitigation and adaptation in the tropics. Finally, this project will provide opportunities for training of undergraduate minority students, and will include mentoring for Costa Rican and US students through participation in field and laboratory work.</AbstractNarration>
