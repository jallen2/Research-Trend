    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry supports the research efforts of Professor Chae S. Yi of the Marquette University to investigate the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of transition metal-catalyzed coupling reactions involving unreactive carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon, and carbon-nitrogen bonds. The first objective of this research is to develop and utilize novel, catalytic carbon-hydrogen coupling methods directed towards the synthesis of complex organic molecules. The research elucidates the molecular mechanisms exhibited by a variety of ruthenium catalysts. The second objective of this research project involves the development of novel, catalytic carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond activation methods from biomass-derived substrates. These studies advance fundamental knowledge in catalytic bond activation and functionalization methods. Such reactions are of fundamental importance due to the enormous synthetic and economic potential of realizing cost-effective and environmentally-benign products from petrochemical and biomass-derived agents. The products of these reactions are of importance in the petrochemical, fine chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. The research effort trains graduate and postdoctoral students to contribute to the highly-skilled U.S. chemical workforce. Professor Yi recruits students from local and regional colleges as well as internationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faced with growing environmental pollution from petrochemical use, one of the most urgent challenges in catalysis research centers is the development of new catalytic processes that give the desired products without forming wasteful byproducts. Transition metal catalyzed bond activation methods such as those described by Professor Yi hold tremendous potential in achieving energy-efficient and ecologically-friendly syntheses of organic chemical commodities. Professor Yi's group investigates a number of highly selective syntheses that employ readily-available alcohol substrates, tolerate a wide range of functional groups, and generate only water as the by-product.</AbstractNarration>
