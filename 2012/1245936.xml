    <AbstractNarration>Clemson Next-Net models a next-generation evolutionary campus network and services for productive and innovative research and education. The project builds upon existing work to expand Clemson's networking capabilities, enable Software Defined Networking (SDN) in at least 20 buildings on campus, and integrate high-speed campus research and education locations into the campus and national OpenFlow based infrastructure. The completed network extension will support significant new scientific research and education opportunities for multiple departments, colleges, and research groups across Clemson that require access to remote instruments and/or transfer large datasets. The project also facilitates future advances in Clemson?s networking infrastructure and its ability to connect to the national infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides a template for other universities who are planning similar campus network transformations and are working directly with Clemson on cross-campus projects in and beyond this project. Outreach, education, and training activities are also engaging faculty, students, and IT staff on campus and across campuses to leverage the created SDN network environment for their research, education, and operational needs. Such a quantum change in their perception of the networking and computing mechanism will provide users the basis and incentive to create new use cases with the technology.</AbstractNarration>
