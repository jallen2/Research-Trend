    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Perspectives in Harmonic Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory, and Partial Differential Equations, and Their Applications to Several Complex Variables" that will be held from September 13-15, 2012, on the campus of Temple University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference brings together a diverse group of mathematicians specializing in the fields of harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, partial differential equations, and several complex variables with the overall objective of fostering collaborations between the participants on problems of common interest and facilitating access to each other's expertise. The purpose of the event is to present some of the recent significant theoretical advances in the aforementioned areas to an audience comprising both experts and young analysts. It is the hope of the organizers is that, as a by-product of the conference, a plan will emerge for coordinating attacks on certain problems arising in physics and engineering for which the lack of smoothness (caused by domains with intricate/irregular geometry, including slits and fractures) is a natural feature. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
