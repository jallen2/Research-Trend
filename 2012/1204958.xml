    <AbstractNarration>The Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center (ATEEC) provides resources, support and professional development for educators; curriculum and educational materials for grades 10-14; and environmental and sustainable energy best program practices, articulated 2+2+2 programs, and other ATE center environmental and sustainable energy curricula. The goal of the ATEEC Resource Center is to partner with business, industry, governmental agencies, professional organizations and academic institutions to provide a resource center of exemplary educational materials, curricula and pedagogical practices for the purpose of educating technicians in environmental and sustainable energy technology. The Center has the following objectives: 1) provide support and mentoring for institutions that wish to start or improve educational programs in environmental science and sustainable energy technologies; 2) provide services to ATE projects; 3) establish and support additional industry, business and academic partnerships; 4) promote technician careers and visibility in environmental and sustainable energy technology; 5) address technician knowledge, skills and competencies needed for the evolving, converging and emerging technical workplace; and 6) screen, validate, update and broadly distribute exemplary materials, curricula and pedagogical practices adapted or designed by ATE centers and projects and other sources. The strategies, events, conferences, forums, Institutes, web seminars and other activities lead to an integrated approach to enhance the content of and pedagogical approaches to STEM programs and curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ATEEC Resource Center is important for the nation's economy as green jobs need workers proficient in math, science and technology for the rapidly changing areas of environmental and energy technology. ATEEC works with business and industry, educators and government agencies to disseminate exemplary educational materials, curricula and resources in the areas of environmental and energy technology to high school and community college educators and students as well as technicians across the country. ATEEC?s structure lends itself to efficient and rapid dissemination and is built upon a model of institutional collaboration and networking.</AbstractNarration>
