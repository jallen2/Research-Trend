    <AbstractNarration>The western Atlantic is a biologically diverse marine environment where powerful ocean currents can play a significant role in the formation and persistence of marine species. The aim of this project is to investigate how major current forces as well as climatic and geographic processes have contributed to the diversification of western Atlantic seahorses and pipefishes (Syngnathidae). Most species of Synganthidae have the potential to disperse passively by rafting on floating vegetation, a biological trait well suited for studying the long-term and contemporary effects of ocean currents on population connectivity. The investigators will reconstruct DNA genealogies and integrate GIS-based environmental data to estimate contemporary and historical species distributions while examining the impact that gene flow and climatic history have had on these co-distributed taxa. By using recent advances in next-generation DNA sequencing methods, questions regarding what drives diversification in this group of fishes will be addressed. This will contribute to a better understanding of how ecological and evolutionary processes shape today?s Syngnathidae populations and provide further insight into the dispersal potential of fish in the western Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robust inference of gene flow directionality and demographic history among populations may prove a cost effective alternative to traditional ecological surveys and prove useful in the estimation of population connectivity for marine reserve placement and management. The information gathered in this research will serve as the basis for a website aimed at implementing and interpreting gene flow inference for conservation management. In addition, the pursuit of these objectives will include the training of undergraduate students from Queens College, New York, in molecular ecology and evolution research.</AbstractNarration>
