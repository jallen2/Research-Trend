    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Graham Kent of University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign to conduct a research project, entitled "Linking Chinese agricultural practices to increased production and environmental integrity," during the summer of 2012 at China Agricultural University in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Dr. Daoliang Li.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the use of both underutilized and new remote sensing and geographic information system technologies to identify optimal agricultural production strategies. Conservation and production strategies to improve water quality are a key component in improving these strategies. Steadily increasing demand for agricultural products to satisfy the diverse needs of a growing population for food, fiber and now fuel has long been the main driver behind agricultural water use. Poor water quality contributes to diminished productivity, increased treatment costs, damaged global ecosystems, and increased health risks to humans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
