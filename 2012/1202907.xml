    <AbstractNarration>The Mathematics And Earth Science Teachers' Resource Organization (MAESTRO) is a Track 1: Proof-of-Concept partnership project between James Madison University and Harrisonburg City and Page County Public Schools in Virginia. MAESTRO focuses on improving public Earth System Science literacy, through a regional collaboration of in-service and preservice teachers with STEM faculty, as well as the strategic goals of developing the future geoscience workforce and supporting regional networks that strengthen geoscience education. The partnership is combining mathematics and Earth science instruction in middle and high schools by developing an integrated mathematics and Earth systems science approach to instruction in Grades 6 and 9, where Earth science concepts are typically taught, along with pre-algebra and algebra. This curricular integration is intended to enhance the mathematical skills and confidence of students through concrete, Earth systems-based examples, while increasing the relevance and rigor of Earth science instruction via quantification and mathematical modeling of Earth system phenomena. MAESTRO emphasizes the development of mental networks and inquiry as means to support student metacognition in multidisciplinary aspects of quantitative Earth systems science. The project involves two summer professional development workshops and academic year Lesson Study (structured teacher collaboration). Site-based case studies, developed in collaboration between teachers and JMU faculty members, provide a tangible, relevant setting in which students can apply and understand mathematical applications and scientific processes related to evolving Earth systems. The research component of MAESTRO is focused on the impact of local field-based case studies on student performance in, and perception of, mathematics and Earth science, as well as the impact of Lesson Study on the teachers' ability and willingness to integrate STEM concepts in the classroom. It is anticipated that the proposed integration across grade bands will first strengthen students' interests in mathematics and science (a problem in middle school) and subsequently reinforce the relevance of other sciences (a problem in high school), both in support of Earth systems literacy. Quasi-experimental evaluation of the impact of this program on participating educators is being used to document project outcomes and indicate the potential of this integrated approach as a model.</AbstractNarration>
