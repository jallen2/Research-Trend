    <AbstractNarration>This project is to produce a new data set of gravity waves in the upper stratosphere based on Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) measurements from the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite. The CIPS data set at ~50 km altitude will provide measurements of gravity waves observed in CIPS measurements of ozone albedo that complement the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) measurements from the Aqua satellite at ~35 km. The postdoctoral fellow will work with CIPS researchers to produce the data set of waves and then work with the AIRS research team to analyze the gravity waves and understand their geophysical significance. The work builds on an ozone retrieval algorithm for CIPS data that was recently developed by the principal investigator (PI) as part of his PhD work. This project will be carried out at Virginia Tech under the mentorship of Dr. Scott Bailey and at NWRA in Boulder, CO under the mentorship of Dr. M. Joan Alexander and with the participation also of Dr. Cora Randall at University of Colorado, who is the PI on the CIPS instrument. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort will result in a new dataset for gravity waves which covers a segment of the spectrum which isn't presently well constrained by observations. The dataset will be made publicly available so that it can be used by the community to help advance our understanding of gravity waves and their effects on global circulation. The fellowship is crucial to the development of a young researcher who has already&lt;br/&gt;shown significant potential through his strong contributions to the AIM mission. The research project coupled with a strong mentorship program as well as teaching and faculty development opportunities will yield a valuable, productive member of the aeronomy community.</AbstractNarration>
