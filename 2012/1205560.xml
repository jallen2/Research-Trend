    <AbstractNarration>This project establishes a fundamental analytical and design framework for highly resilient wireless networks based on the study of the qualitative and quantitative properties of the largest connected component. The essential mathematical basis for this study comes from the theory of percolation. Building on recent results in continuum percolation, the project designs network structures to greatly enhance the resilience of large-scale wireless networks to node and link failures resulting from attacks, natural hazards or resource depletion. Expected results from the project include (1) deeper understanding of percolation processes and resilience in large-scale wireless networks with multiple transmission power levels and channel fading, (2) analysis of network resilience to degree-dependent and cascading node failures, (3) design of wireless networking structures which maximize resilience to random node and link failures, (4) understanding of percolation and resilience in wireless networks described by signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio models and directed graphs, and (5) percolation and resilience in mobile wireless networks. This project will (1) have direct and long-term impact on the reliability and security of wireless network architectures used in national&lt;br/&gt;security, commercial enterprise, scientific exploration and research, health services, and other important social projects, (2) impact undergraduate and graduate education through a planned course, (3) enhance research and education infrastructure through partnering with other university departments, government research institutions, and industry, and (4) enhance scientific and technological understanding through publications as well as participation in multi-disciplinary conferences and workshops.</AbstractNarration>
