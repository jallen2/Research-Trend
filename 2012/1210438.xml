    <AbstractNarration>This study examines the factors that drive individual differences in foraging behavior within fish populations (bluegill and bass) and measures the consequences of these behaviors to juvenile growth and survival. Using novel techniques that allow individual fish to be monitored within a semi-natural pond, researchers will be able to determine the activity, habitat use, growth, diet, and survival of individually marked bluegill in the field and compare these responses to measures of shy-bold foraging behavior assessed in the laboratory. There is growing evidence that many species of animals exhibit individual differences in behaviors as a result of a tradeoff between growth and survival: for example, bold individuals may have higher feeding rates and growth rates, but also suffer higher mortality. This study will be among the first to test for this tradeoff in a natural habitat, as well as measure the ecological relevance of laboratory-based behavioral measures by determining whether shy-bold behaviors measured in the laboratory are correlated and consistent through time in a field context. This study has significant broader impacts, as the focal species (bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass) are two of the most important sport fish in the U.S. and the results of this research will help inform the better management of these species with regard to how variation in foraging behaviors impact juvenile growth, survival and vulnerability to recreational angling. The work enhances research training opportunities for undergraduates working on the project as well as the Ph.D. student directing this research. Participation by the Ph.D. student in two ongoing, NSF-funded K-12 projects will more broadly disseminate the results of this research through the development and use of inquiry-based science modules in local school classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
