    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to understand and remediate factors that reduce the retention and success of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students attempting to complete a 2+2 plan at Pennsylvania State University (PSU). The goal is to bring the retention and graduation rates of 2+2 STEM PSU students from other campuses at least into parity with students that begin and remain at the University Park campus of PSU. This is accomplished by implementing a multifaceted advising, career counseling, and mentoring program, combined with $4,000 scholarships that will provide 2+2 students with the support they need to succeed in math and science majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program helps to weld a cadre of students into a community that allows a methodical investigation into the impact of each of the targeted interventions. This knowledge will be incorporated into a long-range plan for making successful strategies and interventions available for all Eberly College of Science students enrolled in the 2+2 plan, so that the project's potential impact reaches approximately one thousand students who will transfer to PSU University Park during the project period. This project is a model for retention efforts in STEM for students moving from community colleges to four-year institutions and the results will be shared broadly with the higher education community.</AbstractNarration>
