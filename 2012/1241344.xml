    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this research are to study and control the spin properties of semiconductor quantum dots using simultaneous optical and microwave field excitation. The approach is to use optical fields to create atomic transitions while simultaneously using a microwave field to induce spin flips, allowing access to atomic transitions that are normally forbidden due to spin selection rules. This method will be used to achieve coherent control of dark excitons in an indium arsenide quantum dot .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The proposed research will enable the study of fundamental spin properties in semiconductors, which is of central importance to a broad range of research fields including condensed matter physics, quantum optics, quantum information, and spintronics. It will also allow the probing and control dark of exciton states whose properties are poorly understood. Control of dark excitons further provides a method for storage and re-release of single photons, and can serve as a quantum memory for future quantum computers and quantum networks, as well as new opto-electronic and magneto-optic devices that use quantum properties to achieve improved functionality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This research will advance scientific knowledge in a broad range of fields that include optics, microwave engineering, and atomic physics. It could pave the wave for future exponentially faster quantum computers and unconditionally secure quantum networks. It will also provide research and educational opportunities for graduate students, and promote undergraduate and high school research through participation in the Summer Research Program at the Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics.</AbstractNarration>
