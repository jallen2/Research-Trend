    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to (1) enrich and enhance the Fish Collection of the University of Washington (UW), (2) secure and improve a unique and irreplaceable biological resource, and (3) resolve a critical hazardous materials issue by relocating, curating, and integrating a huge and diverse collection of fish otoliths (which have enormous realized and unknown potential value) built over the past 40 years by NOAA Fisheries personnel at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to resolving an urgent hazardous-materials issue, educational opportunities for student training in collection management will be offered to graduate students as well as undergraduates. Otolith biology is already a part of the lab portion of the PI's 300-level "Biology of Fishes," which attracts about 130 undergraduates annually but, to further undergraduate participation, the PI will serve as UW sponsor for two, 10-week, "otolith" internships as part of AFSC's long-standing summer internship program. Aspects of the project will also be added to our well-established and ever-popular program of public outreach, which provides educational opportunities to an average of about 550 visitors to the Fish Collection annually. Project personnel will also work closely with AFSC personnel in assisting with their on-going contributions to education by way of the annual NOAA Science Camp for local high schools, Seattle Science Center research exhibits, and Seattle Aquarium events.</AbstractNarration>
