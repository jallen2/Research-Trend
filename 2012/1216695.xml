    <AbstractNarration>The computing industry is currently producing and developing chips that include processor cores of different types. The move towards heterogeneous chips is due to two trends: the ability to squeeze more transistors on each chip and the improved power-efficiency of using specific cores for specific purposes. This research project extends the inter-core communication systems and precise specifications of homogeneous chips to heterogeneous chips. The benefits of extending homogeneous communication paradigms include improved performance and improved power-efficiency, and preliminary results show orders of magnitude improvements in both metrics. Society relies upon computers for ever more purposes, and qualitatively improving their performance and power-efficiency are critical to future computing platforms. Furthermore, by extending homogeneous specification methodologies, this research project facilitates chip testing and validation for heterogeneous chips, which is a significant fraction of industry effort in chip development, and eases the programming of these chips, which is among the biggest challenges in computing today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project consists of two technical thrusts. The first thrust is the development of memory systems for heterogeneous chips. Rather than treat a heterogeneous chip as two distinct systems that happen to share a chip, the goal is to closely integrate the heterogeneous cores in a systematic fashion that enables most communication between cores to be performed via on-chip caches rather than via off-chip memory. The second research thrust is to extend the notion of a computer architecture--an implementation-independent specification of a processor's behavior--from homogeneous systems to chip-wide heterogeneous systems. This research project involves the design and experimental evaluation of heterogeneous processor chips, and the bulk of the experimental work uses full-system simulation and experiments on purchased hardware. The contributions of this project will be heterogeneous processor chips that have significantly greater performance and power-efficiency, as well as implementation-independent architectures for heterogeneous chips. Society will be using heterogeneous processor chips in personal computers, in smartphones, and via cloud-provided services. Qualitatively improving these chips will enhance user computing experiences and enable new and exciting computing applications.</AbstractNarration>
