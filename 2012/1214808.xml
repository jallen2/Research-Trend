    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel meso-scale combustion based power generation system (MPGS). Meso-scale engines using liquid fuels have theoretical energy densities tens of times greater than the best battery technologies. The theoretical advantages of such systems have gone unrealized due to inherent difficulties encountered when attempting to miniaturize macro-scale engines. The proposed technology was conceived specifically to take advantage of scaling effects to enhance engine performance. A joint analytical and experimental program will be conducted to demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the MPGS. The anticipated outcome of the research effort is successful testing of the critical-path system components for the MPGS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a viable alternative to batteries for portable power in the 10 W to 100 W range. The proposed MPGS has the potential to overcome many limitations of batteries and fuel cells. Such a device has significant commercial potential and many societal benefits. A laptop computer could operate for 30 hours on a single methanol fuel canister. Unlike batteries, which require a long recharge time, a new fuel canister could be inserted for continued off grid power. A soldier could travel lighter, faster and longer without needing to replace batteries in flashlights, communications equipment or personal cooling garments. Greater mobility and quality of life would be possible for patients that use portable oxygen concentrators or other portable medical equipment.</AbstractNarration>
