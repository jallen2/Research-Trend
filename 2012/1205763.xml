    <AbstractNarration>The Nuclear and Particle Physics group at Norfolk State University is engaged in experimental studies on the physics of the strong interactions. We are interested in testing basic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) signatures. Our research is based at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab - JLab). Our group is involved in hardware construction for the ongoing 12-GeV upgrade at JLab (we are participating in the construction of a Pre-Shower Calorimeter), and in the data analysis of previous experiments. Our main research centers on the photo- and electro-production of mesons and the study, through full Partial Wave Analysis, of multi-particle final states. In particular, we are working on the analysis of data from two CLAS and CLAS data-taking runs, both exploring the production of exotic hadrons and expanding meson spectroscopy. These studies will continue after the upgrade, at CLAS12 (part of the 12-GeV upgrade), using virtual photons (electron scattering at very small angles) at low momentum transfer. We are also part of the PRIMEX collaboration for high precision measurement of the neutral pion two-photon decay width that will be extended to include the etas and eta-prime channels in the upgrade and the Heavy Photon Search experiment that will search for special extensions of the standard model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this experimental program, NSU faculty and undergraduate students will directly participate in the construction of hardware and analysis of data from experiments in the forefront of nuclear physics research. NSU is one of the leading HBCUs in the country and its main campus is conveniently located a short distance from Jefferson Lab. A main objective of this project is to provide opportunities to under-represented minorities and strengthen diversity in nuclear physics research.</AbstractNarration>
