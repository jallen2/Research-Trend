    <AbstractNarration>Spotting paths and planning maneuvers: How birds fly through a complex cluttered world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flying animals regularly navigate through forests, urban settings, and other very complex environments at high speeds. These flights require, 1) rapid visual recognition of the surrounding environment, 2) quick and accurate planning of unobstructed paths, and 3) accurate maneuvers. These three behaviors are interdependent: vision informs path planning which defines the maneuvers to be performed whose execution presents a new scene. Despite a long history of work seeking to understand how birds process visual information, plan paths, and the aerodynamics of their maneuvers, little work has explored how these aspects work together in the real world. This work is investigating the feedback between vision, path planning, and aerodynamic maneuvering in the real world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellow is developing instrumentation which pigeons (Columba livia) can carry in backpack-harnesses during free flight. This instrumentation, consisting of video devices and inertial sensors (IMUs), will allow researchers to record wing kinematic data, visual environment data, and flight paths over long outdoor flights through natural environments. As part of this work, the fellow will offer lectures on recent advances to high school biology teachers through Harvard Life Sciences? Outreach Program, and develop exhibit material for the Harvard Museum of Natural History focusing on the mechanisms required for successful biological flight. Additionally, increased understanding of these natural processes will inform future engineering efforts to produce fully or partially autonomous micro aerial vehicles.</AbstractNarration>
