    <AbstractNarration>The National Collegiate Inventors &amp; Innovators Alliance (NCIIA) proposes to scale the I-Corps program by supporting the program at campuses in geographically-diverse locations across the U.S. NCIIA will work with original members of the I-Corps teaching team to implement two additional workshops. Feedback from the evaluation process will inform improvements in both the instructor-training program and the I-Corps curriculum. NCIIA Course and Program grants support the development and implementation of experiential education programs that teach engineering and science students to apply innovative and entrepreneurial thinking to their coursework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the I-Corps program is to determine the commercial feasibility of technology derived from NSF-funded research. Participants will leave the program with an expanded skill-set that will give them the tools necessary to evaluate and translate their research into applications that can benefit society. This program will support an initial a network of instructors who can improve and adapt the program model as it is disseminated to new institutions and regions.</AbstractNarration>
