    <AbstractNarration>This project will deploy a pilot OpenFlow network (a form of Software-Defined Network [SDN]) for the Computer Science and the Physics and Astronomy buildings at the University of Washington. This capability will enable high-performance layer-2 connections to the desktop for both GENI experimentation and for high performance computing applications. The project will provide an opportunity to develop an operational model for the innovations promised by OpenFlow and advance the understanding of how to integrate OpenFlow into campus networking infrastructures. Travel budget is included for sharing and presentations of findings to the broad GENI community and non-technical user communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although OpenFlow is currently being widely discussed and are key elements in the GENI architecture, there is little operational or campus-level architectural experience with using it. In particular, the integration of OpenFlow and other SDN technology into science DMZs and other issues of campus security and policy are not fully understood in operational contexts. The project outcomes include reporting of results and lessons to other campus network operators and to SDN researchers and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;OpenFlow and other software defined networking approaches have the potential to transform highcapacity data transfer and networking in our emerging world of data-driven discovery. The UW's OpenFlow proposed deployment, along with the commitment of a full-time engineer devoted to managing the facility in an operational network setting, will advance our understanding of these methodologies and serve to inform our broader campus-wide network planning and deployment efforts prospectively. The University of Washington will share data from these pilot deployments with both the University of Washington research community and more broadly with the Research and Education Network Community, including at one NSF sponsored conference for such purposes.</AbstractNarration>
