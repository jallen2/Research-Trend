    <AbstractNarration>SES - 1226416&lt;br/&gt;Mary Campbell&lt;br/&gt;Ellen Franklin&lt;br/&gt;Amal Rahhal&lt;br/&gt;University of Iowa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Health Care Providers and Patient Interactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on extant research showing that demographic characteristics impact most social interactions and a range of life course outcomes. Debate continues about the impact of phenotypical differences on the quality of interactions in the health care context. To that end, the project examines how patient characteristics affect interactions with health care providers. The central hypothesis being tested is whether the content and quality of interactions between health care providers and their patients is indeed affected by phenotype and skin tone. The study permits comparisons not only between racial groups (e.g., whites and African Americans) but also within racial groups (e.g., darker- vs. lighter-skinned African Americans and Latino/as). To test this hypothesis, the project relies on field experiment methods. Specifically, videotapes of medical students practicing medical history interviews with "standardized patients" (actors) will be analyzed for both verbal and nonverbal interaction dynamics. The benefit of this field experiment is that it takes place in a realistic setting rather than a lab and yet it still provides a standardized encounter in a similar environment. Analysis methods include quantitative modeling (HLM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research may inform our understanding of how individual-level interactions, in addition to well-understood factors like access to health insurance or preventative care, influence group disparities in health outcomes. Findings may be of interest not only to policy makers but to insurance providers, the medical community and medical schools charged with developing training, assessment, and intervention programs. The project also broadens the participation of underrepresented groups and students in STEM-related research.</AbstractNarration>
