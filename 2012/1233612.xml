    <AbstractNarration>Reef-building corals are in decline worldwide due in part to climate change and other human activities, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand what aspects of coral biology are degraded by environmental stress which then leads to coral mortality. It is now widely known that corals harbor communities of bacteria and archaea that are believed to play important roles in maintaining the health of their hosts, but we lack any appreciable understanding about the identity of the microbial associates regularly residing within healthy, reef-building corals. This project asks the central question; do reef-building corals harbor fundamental or persistent microbial associates that are symbiotic within their tissues? In order to address this hypothesis, the investigator will assess the identity of the bacterial and archaeal microbes using a variety of molecular and microscopy approaches that includes the identification and localization of a widespread group of coral bacterial associates belonging to the genus Endozoicomonas. The results of this study will then be used to develop additional questions about the role of these microbial associates in nutrient cycling and how they contribute to the health and survival of corals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have a significant impact on our understanding of microbial associations in healthy, reef-building corals and support the development of a coral microbe database for the broader scientific community including coral scientists in countries with limited financial resources. Both undergraduate students as well as local high school students will be trained in research techniques and mentored by the investigator and discoveries resulting from this project will be communicated to scientists and the public through open-access publications and news releases. The principal investigator will also engage with the public and K-12 students during outreach efforts on the importance of coral reefs to society.</AbstractNarration>
