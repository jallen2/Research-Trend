    <AbstractNarration>This is funding to support participation by approximately 8 graduate students (about half of them from U.S. institutions) along with senior members of the community (faculty and industry researchers) in a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) to be held in conjunction with and immediately preceding the 2012 International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR 2012), which will take place November 6-8, in Atlanta, and which is organized by the IEEE Computer Society with academic sponsorship from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). For over a decade, ISMAR (and its forerunner events, IWAR/ISAR and ISMR) has been the premier international conference on research into the science, technology, applications and uses of Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR). The proliferation of powerful mobile hardware has opened up new avenues of research into MR and AR while enabling corporate and consumer applications on a wide scale. Across this spectrum fascinating new types of user interfaces, technologies, and concepts are beginning to emerge. The field is highly interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together technologists, educators, humanists, artists and social scientists, among others. ISMAR is one of the largest meetings devoted to the advancement of mixed reality, augmented reality, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction with the physical world, and encourages six different submission types: Papers and Posters, Workshops, Panels, Tutorials, Demonstrations and Contests. Because of the diverse fields relevant to mixed and augmented reality, ISMAR content is organized in two tracks: The Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) program and The Arts, Media and Humanities (AMH) program. The top papers are often extended, reviewed, and submitted for publication in the prestigious IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. More information about the conference may be found at http://ismar.vgtc.org/. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be the first Doctoral Consortium held in conjunction with an ISMAR symposium. The goal is to provide the students with an opportunity at a critical time in their careers to present their work to a group of mentors and peers from a diverse set of academic and industrial institutions, to receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the ISMAR community. To these ends participants will be asked to prepare both a technical presentation and a poster describing their work. A pre-event social dinner on Sunday evening will allow the attendees (students, mentors and organizers) to get to know each other. On Monday morning the attendees will meet for an informal breakfast at 8:00 AM, after which each student participant will have 50 minutes devoted to his/her research, beginning with a presentation for approximately 30 minutes followed by about 20 minutes reserved for an extensive discussion with the other graduate student participants and the senior researchers. The discussion will be facilitated by the Doctoral Consortium co-chairs and mentors, with the goal of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the research, challenges and issues, implications of the results, potential suggestions for additional approaches or follow-on work, and career guidance related to the student's work and area. The posters will be on display during the main ISMAR conference poster sessions (in which the students will be expected to participate), and will be marked as being part of the Doctoral Consortium. All results from the Consortium, including the procedures followed, will be archived in an ISMAR 2012 DC binder as a reference for the next year's conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The organizers will take steps to achieve a diversity of research topics, disciplinary backgrounds, methodological approaches, and home institutions among the students to ensure that they meet people outside their own specific area. Factors such as gender and ethnicity will also be taken into account, with an emphasis on including underrepresented groups. To further increase diversity up to half the student participants may be invited from abroad but NSF funds will be used to support the 4 expected students from U.S. institutions of higher learning plus one international student; the organizers will work with colleagues in Europe and Asia to secure other funding for the remaining international students.</AbstractNarration>
