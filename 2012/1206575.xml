    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Michigan Ann Arbor is to develop novel nanofibrous hollow microspheres as injectable carriers for patient-based stem cells to regenerate cartilage. This project will investigate the role of the architecture of polymers as injectable scaffolds prepared from star-shaped poly(L-lactic acid). The project will study the self-assembly of hollow microspheres and will develop the relationships between the structure and functional properties of these hollow microspheres. State-of-the-art treatments for destroyed/damaged joint cartilage are seriously limited. Tissue engineering has thus far failed to regenerate high-quality cartilage for clinical application. Scaffolds play key role in cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation, and 3D tissue regeneration. The proposed fundamental studies are expected to lead to rational design of novel cell carriers. The technology will not only facilitate the realization of regenerative therapies, but also enables mechanistic investigations into the interactions between biomolecules and biomaterials. As an integral part of this proposed research project, there are three educational and outreach components: 1) to mentor an interdisciplinary and multi-level research team; 2) to incorporate the newest research findings from this project into class-room teaching; and 3) to organize interdisciplinary symposiums to promote idea exchange and facilitate interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary collaborations among peers and general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disability with arthritis and chronic joint inflammation affect about one third of adult population in the US, and is one of the leading cause of disability. The cost of this public health condition is expected to increase as the U.S. population ages. Surgical intervention is frequently required to repair deteriorating joint cartilage because of its limited self-healing capacity. Although several cartilage substitutes have been developed, to date none has successfully replaced normal joint cartilage. Cartilage defects and wounds are usually irregular in shape. Thus fluid-like injectable formulations are highly desired for easier filling and minimally invasive procedures. This project will develop novel injectable cell-carriers for cartilage regeneration, potentially enabling a patient-based stem cell therapy for millions of patients suffering from degenerative cartilage diseases and traumatized joint wounds. As an integral to the research project, there will be significant educational components to facilitate the training of researchers and educators in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary topics including biomaterials that are expected to ensure the continued growth of the field of biomaterials and regenerative medicine.</AbstractNarration>
