    <AbstractNarration>In the wider computing community, there is substantial debate about how best to address the educational challenges of producing graduates who are well qualified and meet the cybersecurity needs of the country. The primary purpose of this project, led by ACM's Education Board, is to contribute to the resolution of these issues. A Leadership Group, composed of cybersecurity experts / leaders from universities, community colleges, industry and government, is providing important information and guidance on how best to stimulate high quality higher education in cybersecurity and what form that should take. A stand-alone report on the results is being published and made widely available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately this activity is about taking initial steps that will lead to the development of a new set of professionals in cybersecurity. The implications for this are considerable. Apart from producing skilled graduates who can serve industry, business and government needs, this activity leads to a greater awareness of the challenges of cybersecurity education within educational institutions and beyond. Intended outcomes are an improved level of faculty expertise, doctoral studies in the area and eventually this should act as a stimulant for certain kinds of cybersecurity research.</AbstractNarration>
