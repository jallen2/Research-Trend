    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to engage pre-college students in fundamental and innovative education and research projects during the summer, using system engineering concepts in solving energy and power system problems. The approach will include lectures on engineering systems, problem solving, simulations and hands-on experiments. The priority will be to attract and nurture these curious students to participate in engineering research projects of national interest. An external review of activities will include industry experts and others. Furthermore, to ensure the goals of the program are met, a professional consultant in engineering educational assessment will provide the matric for tracking and evaluating the impact of the program in the students and their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Develop an innovative engineering system research model for evaluating performance and health of energy and power systems using research fundamental techniques and creativity. The products developed will form a basis for prototypes of needed tools for analysis of energy networks. The work will be done using a team based approach with faculty and graduate student mentors. Case studies to test innovation of the design and validate its robustness will be undertaken by the students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The education and research activity will attract underrepresented minority to participate in the STEM project area. Work done will be posted on the web for other outreach programs. To ensure the goals of the program are achieved, a tracking of the students' performance will be in place and the lessons learned and its impact on the role of youth in the competitive energy economy.</AbstractNarration>
