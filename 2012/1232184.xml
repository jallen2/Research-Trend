    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to study novel device concepts in split-off quantum dots and to develop high performance photodetectors responding up to the terahertz range. The unique integration of split-off transitions allows genuine bound-to-bound transitions in quantum dots, multi-color operation and tailoring spectral response, while having the advantage of three-spatial confinement for carriers. The approaches are to investigate photovoltaic structures containing quantum dots and dots in wells. The ultimate goal is to develop split-off quantum dot photodetectors operating at elevated temperatures with high detectivity and sensitivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to develop a novel technology for optoelectronic devices. The proposed novel concept of split-off quantum dots addresses limitations presently associated with regular quantum dot photodetectors, yielding higher performance. Covering the entire range from visible to infrared, split-off quantum dots can also be an ideal photovoltaic material for fully absorbing solar energy reaching the Earth. Hence, this project should advance the optoelectronic device field and innovate the renewable energy arena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the new device concepts for quantum dot semiconductor research which could not only drastically improve detector technology but also revolutionize the solar energy conversion research. The education and outreach efforts will provide highly competent post-doctoral, graduate, undergraduate students and K-12 teachers (P-16) supported by NSF REU/RET supplements in both fundamental research and the state-of-the-art technological area. Highly sensitive detectors operating at high temperatures will have a vast range of applications in military/defense, industrial, and civilian endeavors, creating major potential economic advantages.</AbstractNarration>
