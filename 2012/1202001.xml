    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop and analyze multiple-input multiple-output optical communication systems using light-emitting diodes and a focal plane receiving array to provide reliable and secure communications under both static and mobile scenarios. The proposed approach explores novel spatio-temporal processing, effective modulations that exploit diversity and multiplexing,&lt;br/&gt;and hybrid optical/radio frequency communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes: (1) development of transmission techniques and receiver signal processing algorithms to provide high data rate communication using light-emitting diodes under channel impairments and varying transmitter-receiver distances, (2) modulations and adaptive mode analysis for hybrid optical/radio frequency systems, (3) investigation of indoor and outdoor channel effects on the proposed algorithms including acquisition and tracking, (4) testing and validation of key ideas on an experimental test bed, and (5) exploring design optimization using channel codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include high speed optical communication system development that can integrate well with energy saving light-emitting diode lighting technology. The proposed research can offer secure communication solutions to inter-vehicle and vehicle-to-hub communications, and communications in indoor and factory facilities. The work can also inspire new receiving device&lt;br/&gt;developments with novel sensing and communication architectures offering potential benefits to society. Students will be trained in theory and in the laboratory, and efforts will be made to attract students from underrepresented groups. Plans are included to demonstrate this research to local high school students to help motivate them to pursue engineering studies.</AbstractNarration>
