    <AbstractNarration>Now in its twentieth year (2011-2012), the NYC LSAMP involves 17 of CUNY?s 18 academic campuses, including the Graduate School and University Center. The Collaborative Infrastructure at CUNY allows for adaption and adoption of best practices in educational pedagogy, and cutting edge STEM research. Alliance activity in Phases I, and II (1992-2002) centered on adoption and adaption of the Collaborative Learning Approaches, Workshop and Peer Led Team Learning Models, and the TINTO models to increase the number of students who would successfully complete the STEM gatekeeper courses. Phases III and IV led to institutionalization of Phase I and II practices, and an increased focus on the Research and Training of LSAMP Scholars and access to Graduate Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities 2012-2017 will build on the institutionalized activities across CUNY to increase the annual BA/BS degree production in STEM to 1000 degrees per year from 700 per annum. Continued focus at the Community College will result in 1) early intervention, 2) greater transfer rates, and 3) degree completion/retention in the STEM disciplines. LSAMP Research and Training activities will 1) expand the diversity and multidisciplinary nature of the 21st Century STEM training, 2) increase the number of opportunities to LSAMP participants, and 3) offer early introduction to research resulting in an increased number of students attracted to the STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following are program activities for NYC Alliance 2012-2017: &lt;br/&gt;? Student Success towards Graduation in STEM &lt;br/&gt;? Partnerships and Collaborations &lt;br/&gt;? Community College Focus &lt;br/&gt;? International Summer Opportunities for Research Training &lt;br/&gt;? Research and Training n CUNY and Nationally &lt;br/&gt;? Summer Opportunities for Research Training &lt;br/&gt;? Preparing Future Faculty</AbstractNarration>
