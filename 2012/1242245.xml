    <AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place on January 2-15, 2013 at the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María in Valparaiso, Chile. Organized by Dr. Lorena Barba, an assistant professor in Mechanical Engineering at Boston University, the institute will consist of a series of advanced lectures and hands-on tutorials on the mathematical models that describe our understanding of ocean phenomena affecting coastal areas, and the use of state-of-the-art computer simulations of these physical processes to predict their effects. The PASI will bring together distinguished scientists in applied mathematics, ocean dynamics, physical oceanography, atmospheric and ocean coupled phenomena, computer science, and civil engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this PASI is to train a cohort of young scientists in this rapidly growing field, providing a solid foundation for their involvement in active research in tsunami and storm-surge simulation. In addition to the exposure and mentoring of young scientists to state-of-the-art methods in modeling, this PASI will foster international collaboration among researchers from the US and the Americas. Dr. Barba will lead mentoring activities for the young researchers attending, and strive for broad participation by leading efforts to recruit student participants from underrepresented groups. The dissemination plan for this PASI includes the production of videos and materials that will be made freely available online.</AbstractNarration>
