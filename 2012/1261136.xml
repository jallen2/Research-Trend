    <AbstractNarration>The primary goals of the project are to validate the concept of newly developed co-ex blown film processes and to develop new materials for the filament of 3-D printing technology which may help in reducing the amount of persistent non-biodegradable plastics waste. This project has the potential to be a leader in producing multilayer co-ex films made of biodegradable cornstarch thermoplastic (TPS) hybrid materials and biodegradable filaments for 3-D printing through green innovation. At the end of the project, researchers plan to demonstrate the following capabilities: biodegradable multi-layer films produced by novel processes, new biodegradable filaments for 3-D printing, and 3-D prototype products made of the new biodegradable materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been a recent global interest in replacing petroleum-based synthetic polymers with biodegradable hybrid materials to use renewable resources and potentially reduce the amount of persistent non-biodegradable plastics waste. If successful, the outcomes of this project would result in a new biodegradable multi-layer film. Additionally through this project researchers plan to develop an educational model focused on green innovation to promote undergraduate research in the STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
