    <AbstractNarration>Addressing the gap between scientific evidence, behavior, and policy is central to moving society toward a sustainable energy path. An increasingly rich body of work in the social and behavioral sciences is examining human motivation and decision making. This research may hold the key to understanding energy sustainability, but its results are seldom integrated into the technical and energy policy communities. This researcher will manage a workshop to develop detailed plans for building a Research Coordination Network focused on energy production and use decisions that bridges the social science, technical, policy and practitioner communities. The workshop will also establish a standing forum at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to facilitate ongoing dialogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By connecting social science researchers whose work can directly inform government agencies, professional societies, academic researchers and non-governmental organizations, this workshop will facilitate new interdisciplinary collaborations that will have a lasting impact on future social and behavioral energy research. It will provide the basis for new energy technologies and policies and will advance an agenda for future social and behavioral research on energy production and use.</AbstractNarration>
