    <AbstractNarration>Males often compete for the opportunity to mate; in promiscuous species, this battle continues after mating, as sperm compete to fertilize eggs, thereby driving the rapid evolution of male reproductive characteristics. This study will use a genetic cross between two species of deer mouse, one promiscuous and one monogamous species, to answer two critical questions: (a) which traits contribute to sperm competition success? and (b) which genetic regions are responsible for these traits? By competing mice with different reproductive characteristics in fertilization contests, and by identifying associations between these characteristics and specific genomic regions, this work will identify the traits and genes molded by sperm competition. This novel study will first ascertain which traits are subject to this critical evolutionary force, and then determine their genetic basis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In conjunction with the project will be public outreach efforts, including the design and implement of an eight-week curriculum on adaptation for students in grades four and five at a Boys &amp; Girls Club in Somerville, Massachusetts. The majority of students in this club come from low-income families in an underserved community. The project will also include mentoring of undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
