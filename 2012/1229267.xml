    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Deborah Gross from Carleton College and colleagues Steven Drew, Gretchen Hofmeister, David Alberg and Joseph Chihade will acquire an high pressure liquid chromatograph interfaced to a mass spectrometer (HPLC/MS). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterizing the structure-function relationships of enzymes; (b) quantification of dopamine in rat brains; (c) mapping the interface between an enzyme and its RNA substrate; (e) synthesis and/or characterization of small to mid-size molecules; (f) complex organic compounds formed in secondary organic aerosols; and (g) forensic applications in determination of date-rape drugs and fingerprint measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An HPLC-MS combines the physical separation capability of liquid chromatography with the mass analysis ability of mass spectrometry. The liquid chromatograph with pressure separates a mixture into its molecular components. These components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into a parent ion and fragment ions and their mass/charge ratios are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows determination of the masses of the particles, their chemical composition and enables one to deduce the structure of the substances in a complex mixture. The instrumentation provided by this award will provide faculty and students the opportunity to pursue research projects at Carleton College and St. Olaf College using modern, state-of-the-art instrumentation. It will also be used in several laboratory courses to train significant numbers of students in the use of this important analytical technique.</AbstractNarration>
