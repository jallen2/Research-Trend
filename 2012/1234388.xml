    <AbstractNarration>Because 70% of marine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is found in the deep ocean, it is important to determine its sources and sinks to understand its role in the global carbon cycle. Unfortunately, the sinks for DOC at depth remain largely unknown; however, limited data has suggested that photochemistry may influence the removal of deep refractory DOC. A scientist from the University of Georgia will use field and laboratory irradiation experiments to quantify the photochemical rates controlling (1) direct loss of DOC and photoproduction of carbon monoxide, a significant product resulting from DOC oxidation, (2) common optical tracers of organic carbon such as colored dissolved organic matter and fluorescent dissolved organic matter fading; and (3) two reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide) that reflect the role of oxygen in DOC photochemistry. The study will focus on the north Pacific, where the lowest deep ocean DOC concentrations are found which most likely reflect the presence of an aged and refractory carbon pool. Layered in the top 1000m above this deep DOC is a concentration gradient that will allow comparison of waters with different DOC concentrations, ages and apparent refractivity. Results from the study will be used to quantitatively reevaluate this basic question that now constrains global DOC models: Does photochemistry have a significant role in the removal of the massive amount of refractory DOC that is pooled in the deep sea? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impacts, based on established links with K-12 teachers, the scientist and his students plan visits to local schools to present their science, as well as have a website entitled "ask the oceanographer" and maintain a live blog during their cruise. Results from this study will be included into class materials dealing with the carbon cycle. One graduate and three undergraduate students would be supported and trained as part of this project. It is anticipated that undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups would be recruited via the University of Georgia's Summer Undergraduate Research Program.</AbstractNarration>
