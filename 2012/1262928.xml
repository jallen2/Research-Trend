    <AbstractNarration>This funding renews a highly successful CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Houston. The theme of this site is algorithm design and analysis focusing on real-time, parallel, data-intensive problems in large-scale heterogeneous, and highly distributed modern computing environments. Students will receive ten-week intensive training in specific research fields as well as basic research skills including literature review, algorithm design and implementation, experiment setup, data analysis, technical writing and presentation. The research projects are interdisciplinary and an emphasis will be placed on teamwork and collaboration. Local researchers from the Texas Medical Center, NASA Johnson Space Center, and oil industry will helps provide mentoring to the students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site will introduce 30 undergraduate students (over three years) to computing research, with a goal of directing more U.S. undergraduates into graduate computing programs. The host institution is both a Hispanic Serving Institution as well as a Minority Serving Institution, so this project will help attract minority students into STEM programs.</AbstractNarration>
