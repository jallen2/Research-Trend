    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Jeremy Hasselbauer of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to conduct a research project, entitled "Methods for controlling mid- to high-rise structures during earthquakes," during the summer of 2012 at National Center for Research in Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientist is Chin-Hsiung Loh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in the insight provided into optimal control strategies for semi-active mass dampers. Using the cutting edge facilities at NCREE, investigation into different control strategies may result in superior control of structures during seismic events, improving the safety of structures and the inhabitants. In addition, the research contributes to increasing the safety of structures in heavily populated regions subject to damage by earthquakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
