    <AbstractNarration>The development of sustainable and renewable energy supplies represents one of society's greatest challenges. Biofuels are widely regarded a key component of a new energy economy. The future production of fuels, chemicals and products from biomass will require a complex series of integrated chemical conversion steps ('biorefining'). This REU Site Program engages students in cutting-edge research for the production and conversions compounds that are of importance in biorefining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional focus of this REU site program is integration, both across academic disciplines and across four different institutions in close proximity. Participant interaction with researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) [central (host) institution], Colorado State University (CSU), Colorado School of Mines (Mines), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides unique exposure to science and engineering careers. These institutions have partnered to form the Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels (C2B2): a cooperative research and educational collaboration devoted to the conversion of biomass to fuels and other products. As a result of interacting in this dynamic 'virtual center' environment, students exit the site program equipped with an understanding of university, federal, and industry research partnerships. Moreover, during the summer program participants from various disciplines must collaborate to find science- and engineering-based solutions to challenges faced by renewable energy technologies. Students gain first-hand experience in interdisciplinary research and development problem-solving techniques and work together to create meaningful progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A principal objective of this site program is to encourage promising diverse students, particularly women, underrepresented minorities, and students from primarily undergraduate institutions, to pursue careers in engineering and science research. Today's undergraduate students are fueled by the motivation to make a difference in the world. This program is specifically designed to attract participants from populations traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering and simultaneously reflect the cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional nature of modern research, especially in renewable and sustainable energy. This program introduces participants to the professions of scientific investigation and engineering. It furthermore encourages participants to complete bachelor?s degrees in pursuit of more advanced science, math, and engineering graduate education. Participants gain scientific and engineering maturity and are better prepared to enter a scientific career as a knowledgeable team contributor. It is expected that many participants will utilize this training to become the academic and commercial leaders of the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."</AbstractNarration>
