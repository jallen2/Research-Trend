    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to The University of Iowa that will provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. The scientific focus of the research program is microbiology. The purposes of the program are to encourage students to pursue a career in basic science and give them the skills to succeed in that path. The Department of Microbiology has about 25 faculty who will serve as mentors. Each student will conduct an independent laboratory research project under the guidance of a faculty and a graduate student co-mentor. Lectures, workshops and social activities will expose students to graduate school and other career options, will include training in ethics and the responsible conduct of research, and will promote informal interactions. At the end of the summer, students will present their findings at a University-wide symposium. Students will also be encouraged to present their findings at regional and national meetings. Students will receive a stipend and money for travel and living expenses. The program is open to undergraduates who are interested in scientific research and are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Recruitment will use both traditional mailings and various forms of electronic outreach. Special emphasis will be given to recruitment of students from demographic groups that are underrepresented in the sciences and/or students from small colleges where opportunities for research are lacking. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in the biological sciences. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The impact and success of the program will be assessed by various means, including tracking of students and use of an REU common assessment tool.
