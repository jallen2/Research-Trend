    <AbstractNarration>Viral communities of the Papua New Guinea avifauna &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Migratory birds spreading avian flu, bats serving as SARS reservoirs, and the spread of West Nile virus have highlighted the importance of epidemic disease in today's globalized world. Understanding the processes that facilitate disease spread in wildlife is crucial for conservation and human health. Using new and previously collected samples from Papua New Guinea, the evolution and distribution of viruses will be described. High throughput, metagenomic sequencing will be conducted using blood samples and cloacal swabs collected from hundreds of birds across 20 islands. The resulting data will be used to assemble virus genomes and classify viruses. This information along with information on island characteristics (i.e., size, isolation, human disturbance, avian community) will be used to test hypotheses regarding the factors underlying viral evolution and biogeography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide critical insights into the importance of variation in geography, human influence, and host species to the spread and distribution of pathogens, and a basis for improving models of disease emergence. In conducting this research, the Fellow will develop new quantitative, computational, and laboratory skills, which will enhance her ability to develop, lead and carry out a multi-faceted, cross-disciplinary research program on wildlife disease ecology. In addition to conducting research, the Fellow will mentor undergraduates through the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) Summer Systematics Institute, and develop skills in teaching the public about science through CAS's museum programs. This project will also provide excellent opportunities for both minority undergraduate students in the Bay Area and Papua New Guinea locals to learn to conduct research, allowing the Fellow to continue to work towards her goal of broadening participation of minorities and women in science.</AbstractNarration>
