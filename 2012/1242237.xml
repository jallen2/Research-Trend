    <AbstractNarration>This project is to determine the commercial value of the fluorogenic linker technology. The fluorogenic linker is defined by two functional groups that are initially non-fluorogenic chemical handles which specifically react with each other to form a fluorescent linkage. These chemical handles are readily incorporated in polymers, small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules. The result is a conjugation approach that allows for non-destructive, highly sensitive reaction monitoring, which will be necessary in screening reaction conditions, optimizing conjugations between two molecules, and determining conjugation efficiencies. The proposed project is to assess the value of a fluorogenic linker technology that provides a well defined procedure that guides any researcher with little knowledge in chemistry to link two different molecules together, and then verify the linkage through fluorescence. The procedure will not require extensive purification for downstream applications, provide higher sensitivity in determining conjugation efficiency, and shorten processing time for potential use in high throughput systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linking two different molecules has a significant role in development of therapeutic agents and materials development. For instance, linking a disease homing signal and a therapeutic drug can yield tissue specific delivery to avoid side-effects by reducing administered drug concentrations, and increasing targeted drug delivery. Such uses are common for many biopharmaceutical and biotech companies that rely on developing new protein-based therapeutics. The proposed project provides a practical approach to monitor these linkages in a highly sensitive manner. The result will have the potential to streamline discovery process, provide more effective drug conjugates for tissue specific delivery, and reduce exposure to harmful organic solvents that can cause both medical and environmental damages.</AbstractNarration>
