    <AbstractNarration>PI: Wang, Qing&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1235761&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Pennsylvania State Univ University Park&lt;br/&gt;Title: Novel Single-Ion Conductors for Lithium-Ion Batteries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to give a completely new direction in the development of high-performance electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries, this project examines single-ion conducting (SIC) electrolytes, a unique alternative to traditional lithium-ion battery electrolytes. Expected lithium-ion-transference number of unity can potentially eliminate electrolyte polarization losses in the cell that develops in a binary salt system, resulting in an increase in power capacity. The improvements are significant for applications where a high discharge rate is desired, such as electric vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the properties of the SICs with systematic structural variations by utilizing a comprehensive suite of characterization techniques along with electrochemical measurements to gain fundamental insight into the how the structure characteristics influence the film morphology, Li+ conduction, mechanical and thermal stability, electrochemical properties, and mechanisms of ion dissociation and transport that are desperately needed for this field to advance. The battery performance will be examined to establish full pictures of the structure-property-performance correlations. In addition, the influence of the SIC membranes on the formation, composition and morphology of the solid-electrolyte interface layer and their impacts on the cell performance will be examined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, if successful as planned, will open a completely new direction in the development of high-performance electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, it will shed light on the fundamental understanding of ion transport and polymer electrolytes which are relevant for a range of advanced technologies such as actuators, alternative battery membranes, and fuel cells. The project will train scientists and engineers capable of working in the interdisciplinary field of energy storage. Through the collaboration with Seoul National University, the graduate students will gain valuable experience in the international research and education. Particular attention will be given to recruiting women and under-represented minority undergraduate research assistants through the Penn State Minority Undergraduate Research Experience, and Women in Science and Engineering Research programs.</AbstractNarration>
