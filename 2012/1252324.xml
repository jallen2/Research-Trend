    <AbstractNarration>CALLING ALL EXPERIMENTALISTS &lt;br/&gt;A WORKSHOP TO BUILD A COMMUNITY NETWORK FOR SHARING AND MANAGING EXPERIMENTAL &lt;br/&gt;DATA AND TECHNIQUES - YEAR 1: EXPERIMENTAL STRATIGRAPHY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wonsuck Kim, Leslie Hsu, Raleigh Martin, and Brandon McElroy &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1250525, University of Texas, Austin &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;Research in experimental Earth surface processes and subsurface stratal development is in a data-rich era with rapid expansion of high-resolution, digitally based data sets that were not available even a few years ago. Multiple millions of dollars have been invested into recent updates in flume laboratories for the science of surface processes and subsurface architecture. These facilities are evolving along with advanced technology and methodology to allow a greater number of more sophisticated experiments at larger scales and finer resolutions than those that could ever be achieved before. In anticipation of the need for storing vast amounts of raw and analyzed data, a coherent effort is required at the community level. PIs envision guiding development of resources to increase the utility of laboratory data beyond its original study, adding an efficient channel for collecting and sharing experimental data, and fostering greater connectivity between the experimentalist community, computer modelers, and field geologists in the context of experimental data. They intend to provide two-way communication between EarthCube and workshop participants. First, the results of this workshop will feed into the EarthCube effort by providing detailed information from disciplinary scientists. PIs will solicit data and informatics needs from the community and contribute these requirements to the EarthCube effort in the relevant discussions and groups (e.g. Data Discovery, Interop, and Semantics groups) on the EarthCube website. Second, they will serve as spokespersons for the EarthCube effort by informing their community of the current developments and needs that have been learned from attending EarthCube events (Hsu has attended the November charrette and has applied to attend the June charrette).</AbstractNarration>
