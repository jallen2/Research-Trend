    <AbstractNarration>The following EAGER supports an innovative project to create greater public access to data and data visualization tools in order to more fully engage scientific information about the Arctic in public discourse. The PI convincingly argues that with global environmental change, increasing sea ice and ice sheet melting, increased interest in natural resource development, tourism, arctic shipping, human migration, etc. the Arctic region is increasing in importance within critical public discourse. The researcher contends that this discourse needs easily accessible, highly accurate data in a form that the public will find useful. This project is a pilot application of the Jefferson Institutes long standing Patchwork Nation data visualization tools to a critical region of the Arctic, the Barent region of Northern Europe and Russia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to construct Patchwork Barents, the researchers will assemble a Barents data portal pooling public data and building on the existing data visualization engines built for Patchwork Nation. In this way, the research team will generate an embeddable Barents data map, equipped with tools for uploading new datasets and creating visual data displays. In addition, these will be matched with weekly reporting from representative Barents communities and two pan-Arctic analytical posts on the Patchwork Nation main page &lt;http://www.patchworknation.org/&gt;. The research team will utilize the Arctic Social Indicators report and leverage existing efforts to compile Arctic data at the county-equivalent (NUTS3 ? regions used by the EU?s Eurostat agency) level, including the Community Climate Change Survey, SEARCH, AON-SI, and H3l (Humans, Hydrology, and High Latitude NCAR data set) projects. Added to this will be physical and social science data from other publically available sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a unique effort to match emerging tools for popular data visualization and community-centered data with public county-equivalent scientific data on the Arctic. Ultimately, the aim is to empower citizens with the tools to learn and share more about their own community and to place their community into the context of intuitively similar and dissimilar places nationally and across borders. This project fulfills a part of the NSF's mission to make science data more accessible and useful to broader public audiences.</AbstractNarration>
