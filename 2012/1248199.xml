    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1248199 PI: Mefford, Olin T. ORG: Clemson University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Travel Scholarships for Frontiers in BioMagnetic Particles 2013&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This proposal seeks support for travel awards for graduate students, post-docs, and faculty from underrepresented groups to attend the Frontiers in BioMagnetic Particles III Symposium inTelluride, CO, June 2-4, 2013. This will be a three-day symposium focused on the characterization and control of magnetic carriers. The symposium will cover topics on magnetic particles for: (a) biomedical imaging and sensing, (b) magnetic separations, (c) drug delivery, hyperthermia, and biomedical applications. There will also be a separate student session on career development with panelist from academia, industry, and government. A well-structured agenda is presented in the proposal, and appropriate lead speakers have been lined up for each session. This is a crosscutting topic that benefits from input across the scientific, engineering, and medical fields, and the symposium is well designed to facilitate meaningful discussion among representatives of all of these communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: Scientific and technical broader impacts in the fields of drug delivery, nanoparticle mediated therapies, and medical imaging are expected. Financial support is requested to provide four travel awards at $1000 each to support graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and young faculty. Awardees will be selected on the basis outstanding scientific contributions, as judged by submitted presentation abstracts, and the perceived level of need. At least two awards will be reserved for women and unrepresented minorities. Funding priority will be given to graduate students attending their first national meeting, junior faculty giving an oral presentation, and researchers belonging to underrepresented groups. The existence of potential funding for travel support will be described in advertisements for the symposium. Requests for travel awards will be accepted at the time of abstract submission and selections made by the organizing committee.</AbstractNarration>
