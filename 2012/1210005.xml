    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Lauren Elizabeth Jarocha of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to conduct a research project, entitled "Electron paramagnetic resonance studies of radical reactions to improve solar cells and artificial photosynthesis," during the summer of 2012 at Tokoku University in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. The host scientist is Seigo Yamauchi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is related to the development of a detailed understanding of the role structure and mechanism play in proton-coupled electron transfer reactions (PCET). This type of reaction is important in both artificial photosynthetic devices and dye sensitized solar cells. Proton coupled electron transfer reactions involve radical intermediates, which can be studied directly by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The proposed work explores ruthenium based oxidative catalysis and reductive quenching proton coupled electron transfer reactions using high-field time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance to obtain accurate information on the structure, dynamics, chemical properties, and mechanism of these reactions, which will be helpful in designing more efficient chemical reactions for use in solar cells and artificial photosynthetic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
