    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative research study seeks to develop a detailed, empirically grounded understanding of new engineers'transitions from schools to workplaces, and thereby to identify continuities and discontinuities between undergraduate education and professional practice in engineering. The study builds upon NSF-funded research by two of the investigators that followed engineering students through their undergraduate engineering experiences; this project represents a next step towards improving engineering education and furthering learning sciences research in neglected areas like STEM workplace learning. The engineers studied in this project will be recent graduates, taking positions typical of students from their institutions, and in economically important or expanding engineering sectors. The central methodology will be learning ethnographies, an innovative approach using ethnographic fieldwork to discover what these new engineers need to learn, how they learn it, what they appear to adapt or use readily from their prior educational experience, and the consequences of these for their workplace participation and developing identities as engineers. The learning ethnographies will ground two further aspects of the study: a comparison of workplace practices with those of these engineers' undergraduate programs, and a survey generalizing ethnographic findings to a broader population. Women and members of underrepresented minority groups will be oversampled to provide a basis for comparative analysis intended to understand distinctive experiences and challenges that members of these groups may face as they move into the workplace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lack of continuity between school and work in engineering is often noted, but details of mismatches are insufficiently understood to effectively inform practice; this research addresses this gap in understanding. For industry, it can inform reorganization of workplace practices to better facilitate transitions from school to work. For undergraduate programs, the research can provide a basis for educational practices to be adopted or deemphasized, allowing schools of engineering to better prepare students to be creative and successful engineers. For students, this research may lead to the development of more relevant and practically useful engineering knowledge and more accurate understandings of their possible future careers. It is also expected that this research will inform attempts at recruitment and retention of members of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
