    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to be able to replace human agents with&lt;br/&gt;artificial agents in studying two-player games. This project, if&lt;br/&gt;successful, will greatly enhance the ability of economists to test&lt;br/&gt;economic theories by partially replacing laboratory experiments with&lt;br/&gt;simulations. Over the last decades laboratory studies have proven&lt;br/&gt;invaluable both for the validation (and invalidation) of economic&lt;br/&gt;theories, and for the practical purpose of testing mechanisms (such as&lt;br/&gt;auctions) in the laboratory prior to practical implementation. The&lt;br/&gt;ability to use simulations with artificial agents in place of&lt;br/&gt;laboratory experiments with live human beings will both reduce the&lt;br/&gt;cost of validation and testing, and make it possible to explore&lt;br/&gt;quickly a much wider range of theories and policy alternatives. It&lt;br/&gt;will also enhance our understanding of human behavior and enrich our&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the connection between human and artificial intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agent-based modeling is an emerging and attractive approach to&lt;br/&gt;validating economic theories. Existing research has focused on simple&lt;br/&gt;and naive agents. This project proposes as the next step to develop&lt;br/&gt;artificial human (economic) agents capable of mimicking the behavior&lt;br/&gt;of human laboratory subjects in the context of two player simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;move games. Substantial and detailed data is available on human play&lt;br/&gt;under these conditions. Existing algorithms fall only slightly short&lt;br/&gt;of the ability to mimic human play but do not yet implement fully&lt;br/&gt;autonomous agents. Based on hidden Markov models, the PIs propose to&lt;br/&gt;develop and investigate a framework of belief learning that is broad&lt;br/&gt;enough to encompass many existing learning algorithms including&lt;br/&gt;reinforcement learning, fictitious play, and smooth fictitious play.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, based on this framework, the PIs propose to derive more&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated learning methods to fully develop artificial agents. This&lt;br/&gt;research will pursue two important directions. First, the PIs will&lt;br/&gt;introduce the initial calibration of priors based on available&lt;br/&gt;information and a cognitive hierarchy model. Second, the PIs will allow for&lt;br/&gt;the reconsideration of the existing model when "surprises" occur. The&lt;br/&gt;project will lead to the next stage of research in both economics and&lt;br/&gt;computer science in broadening the class of artificial agents to&lt;br/&gt;attack broader and more economically important tasks. It will also&lt;br/&gt;enrich the research on graphical model learning for artificial&lt;br/&gt;intelligence.</AbstractNarration>
