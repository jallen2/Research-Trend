    <AbstractNarration>The Conference on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory will be held at the University of Missouri-Columbia on November 17-19, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference brings together experts working on geometric methods in the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras and related topics, and beginning researchers in this area, such as graduate students and postdocs. There will be expository and other research talks on topics such as: degenerations of modules and the geometry of orbit closures in module varieties; generic representation theory of quivers with relations; moduli problems for finite dimensional algebras; semi-invariants for quivers with or without relations; universal deformation rings and their connection to moduli spaces; commutative/non-commutative desingularizations. This conference will help strengthen and advance the interaction of geometry and representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main objectives of the proposed Conference on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory is to introduce beginning researchers in representation theory to the power of geometric methods. These methods have become more and more fundamental in many areas of mathematics, and in particular in the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The key note speaker for this conference will be Birge Huisgen-Zimmermann who will give two one-hour lectures which will be accessible to graduate students and postdocs. There will also be several expository lectures given by well-known experts. The remainder of the lectures will be research talks given by both senior and junior mathematicians. This will include several talks given by graduate students and postdocs related to their theses. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere in which new collaborations can be formed and young researchers have the possibility to learn about cutting-edge geometric methods in representation theory. Moreover, the conference will enable junior representation theorists to present their work and interact with the broader community, which are crucial activities in the pre-employment season in the fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about the Conference on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory at the University of Missouri-Columbia can be found at &lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.uiowa.edu/~fbleher/CGMRT2012.html</AbstractNarration>
