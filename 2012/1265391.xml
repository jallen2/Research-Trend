    <AbstractNarration>A new center is to be planned named the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Social Technologies and Analytics. The planned I/UCRC intends to conducts research of high-end applications for accessing the Social Media data ecosystem, where Social Media refers to how users generate content, exchange information and share ideas in public and private platforms over the Internet. Research foci of the planned center include Big Data analysis, cyberinfrastructure, mobile applications, technology and people, business intelligence and society and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The social media ecosystem represents a significant and growing global resource that offers a wide and varied set of new applications with potential impact spanning the private and public sector. The planned center has the potential to build a corporate, government and university cooperative to address research challenges in this area and accelerate its growth. The planned center would engage students at all levels and train them in through its research. The effort will draw on existing university programs to engage a diverse set of participants.</AbstractNarration>
