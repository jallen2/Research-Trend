    <AbstractNarration>Solid-State Sensors and Actuators Workshop (Hilton Head 2012)&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will disseminate MEMS research and technology breakthroughs. The workshop consists&lt;br/&gt;of 26 contributed oral papers, and 89 contributed posters. There will also be an open poster&lt;br/&gt;session where recent work (and educational programs) can be discussed.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will have broad impact for the entire MEMS community. The knowledge gained and&lt;br/&gt;experiences shared from the workshop will be captured electronically and broadly disseminated&lt;br/&gt;via a website. By receiving travel support, students will get the opportunity to present their&lt;br/&gt;newest research results among their peers. The discussions which result from such presentations&lt;br/&gt;are invaluable as an educational aid. Benefiting from the recommendations and improved teaching&lt;br/&gt;and training, students will be better prepared for both MEMS research and MEMS-focused careers</AbstractNarration>
