    <AbstractNarration>This award supports graduate student participation in the 22nd International Symposium on Gas Kinetics (June 18-22, 2012; http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/events/GK2012/). The biennial, week-long meeting on the University of Colorado campus in Boulder, CO includes the chemistry research themes: Alternative Fuels and Renewable Energy, Combustion Chemistry, Atmospheric Chemistry, Multi-phase Chemical Processes, Heterogeneous Chemical Processes, Fundamentals of Chemical Reactivity (Theory), Experimental Methods and Applications, and Ions and Chemical Processes. The symposium consists of distinguished invited speakers as well as contributed oral and poster presentations. Enrollment for the symposium is approximately 200 delegates. The broader impacts of the symposium derive from offering an opportunity for young scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in atmospheric chemistry as well as other leading fields in chemistry. Graduate students are encouraged to present the results of their own research at this meeting. Students (U.S. citizens) from underrepresented groups in the field will be targeted for receiving support.</AbstractNarration>
