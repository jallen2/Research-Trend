    <AbstractNarration>Urban centers worldwide are threatened by earthquakes. The effects of an earthquake on a community depend on the magnitude and location of the earthquake as well as on how well the community has planned for the future earthquake. Community resiliency to an earthquake depends on the capacity of individuals, households, businesses, and region to survive and to recover after a disaster strikes. The best lessons for earthquake resiliency can be obtained by the study of what worked and didn't work in regions that are struck by earthquakes. This proposal will design and conduct a focused earthquake reconnaissance effort to accelerate learning about seismic resiliency, such that a significant leap in knowledge can be made. The proposed research effort builds on the acclaimed multi-decade and multi-disciplinary EERI Learning From Earthquakes (LFE) program, but it proposes a major change and refocus of the LFE program to achieve the target result of superior understanding of community resiliency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multidisciplinary Seismic Resilience Panel will guide earthquake reconnaissance to maximize resilience learning relevant to the U.S.; to conduct post-earthquake reconnaissance efforts focused on seismic resilience; to develop methods for systematic data collection, archiving, and dissemination of the findings; and to prepare a synthesis report summarizing the principal findings of the project. The intellectual merit of the proposed program lies in (a) defining the key physical and human elements that contribute to, or inhibit, seismic resilience in U.S. communities, and (b) exploring those elements through focused earthquake reconnaissance in the U.S. and worldwide, as appropriate. In the process, better understanding of the physical, social, economic, governance and institutional factors that facilitate or slow recovery will be achieved. By understanding these complex conditions and their interactions in the post-disaster environment, the grand challenges that need to be addressed will emerge. Through the solution of these challenges advancement in resilience knowledge will be gained. The ultimate goal is to improve the seismic resilience of communities in advance of disasters.</AbstractNarration>
