    <AbstractNarration>This workshop, supported by the Division of Chemistry, aims to identify knowledge gaps and develop an action plan to fill these gaps in order to address one of the grand challenges in chemical sustainability: design of chemical products with minimal unintended biological activity. As such, the workshop will define the required advances and synergistic collaborations to meet this challenge starting from existing tools, knowledge, data and infrastructure. Furthermore, the workshop will help identify specific areas where incentives for innovation are necessary to address the goals of safer chemical design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will explore interdisciplinary approaches and articulate a systems-level view of design of chemical products with minimal unintended biological activity. This will require collaborative efforts from representatives in chemistry, chemical and environmental engineering, toxicology, public health, environmental health sciences and public policy. A structured approach to the complex and multidisciplinary nature of the underlying science will provide educational benefits to the community, enabling the development of unique curriculum and outreach materials. A peer-reviewed consensus publication written by workshop participants will raise awareness of the current state of the science and future needs to achieve the goal of designing safer chemicals from first principles.</AbstractNarration>
