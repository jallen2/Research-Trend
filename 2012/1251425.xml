    <AbstractNarration>In a large-scale destructive event one of the great challenges for public health workers and rescue teams is to have stable and accessible emergency communication systems that are compatible with the needs of the users. Mobile technology is rapidly being integrated into the to first responder environment, yet little research currently exists regarding the use of communication platforms and Internet social networks for emergency response; as a consequence, there exists a gap in the body of knowledge regarding the most effective and efficient use of mobile communication platforms in disaster response. The PI's objective in this exploratory research is to lay the foundation for a human-centered methodology to evaluate critical human factors and ergonomic issues that can be addressed through the use of mobile technology in the preparation and response phases of emergency management. Because similarities exist between the 2011 earthquake in the Northern Virginia region of the United States and the Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake of 2010, her approach is to initiate an international research collaboration between the US and NZ to address research questions such as: What are the current and emerging technologies used by emergency management personnel (including first responders and volunteers) in the preparation and response phases of disaster management? What are the human factors and ergonomics challenges to emergency management personnel that can be addressed through the use of mobile technology? How does the use of emerging technology and social networking impact the performance of emergency management personnel from a human factors perspective? Can a mathematical model be developed to measure the usability, relative importance and reliability of essential technology in the preparation and response phases of disaster management? The work will include review of data from the Christ Church earthquakes and on-site data collection in New Zealand using mock scenarios and observation analysis of emergency managers during training exercises in the Emergency Operations Center Lab at Massey University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Technology can be rendered useless in extreme situations absent appropriate communication and task performance protocols. So establishing guidelines and communication protocols for ergonomically sound task performance in emergency management has the potential to transform the response to human needs in catastrophic events. Project outcomes will lay the foundation for maximizing communication resources for first responders during relief efforts while significantly impacting the quality of aid rendered.</AbstractNarration>
