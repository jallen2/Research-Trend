    <AbstractNarration>The project will fund extended research visits of U.S.-based graduate students to select European research groups working in robotics/artificial ntelligence. The students will work on a research project side by side ith researchers in the group they are visiting, participating in active esearch projects with their European hosts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are twofold, to develop human resources and o advance science. From the human resources perspective, the project ill broaden the preparation of the students by exposing them to new research paradigms and approaches; it will reinforce the students' motivation and interest for a career as a scientist; it will increase the students' awareness of different research cultures, lifestyles, and academic systems, opening up new career opportunities for them and&lt;br/&gt;making them competitive in the global market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the perspective of advancing science, the project will create synergies and build research bridges between the European hosts and the students' home research groups. This will facilitate long term research collaborations between U.S. and European research groups. This will benefit society by promoting research progress and increase the worldwide competitiveness of the U.S. high-tech industry.</AbstractNarration>
