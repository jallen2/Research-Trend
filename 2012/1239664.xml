    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial for support for participants at the 2012 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Solid State Studies in Ceramics: New Insights and New Paradigms for Fracture and Deformation in Ceramics, to be held August 12-17, 2012 at Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA. The biennial conference focuses on topics at the leading edge of ceramics research; in 2012, this GRC will focus on research frontiers in ceramics with respect to fracture and deformation of ceramics, including exploration of new theories and computational and experimental approaches that push the boundaries of our understanding mechanical behavior of ceramics and the behavior of technical and structural ceramics under unique or extreme environments. Applications in which such knowledge is critical include failure prevention in ceramics for energy applications, such as in electrochemical cells for fuel cell and battery applications, new designs to withstand high temperature environments such as hypersonic flight, innovative methods to fabricate high strength ceramics for structural applications using low cost materials or low energy-consuming routes, novel approaches to using ultralight porous ceramics, and applications to fracture of brittle material in biology, human health, and anthropology. Technical ceramics are used in a wide range of everyday applications, from oxygen sensors in our cars to bone replacements in our bodies to streetlights in our neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this conference is to better understand why and how fracture and deformation occur in technical ceramics so that failure can be prevented. The Gordon Research Conferences are unique in that they focus on work in progress, encouraging speculation and extensive discussion of new concepts. By disseminating new insights from theory and experiment, considering both basic materials and applications, it is hoped that the understanding and evaluation of future directions for this field will be enhanced. This GRC comingles eminent researchers, junior investigators, and students and provides a unique forum for the exchange of ideas and the development of new collaborations among all participants. This NSF grant will be used to defray conference expenses for junior researchers who otherwise would be unable to attend due to a lack of funds, with an emphasis on support of women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
