    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow 54 undergraduate students to participate at the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) annual meeting in order to enhance students, graduate school and academic prospects, as well as to connect students with engineering educators. Specifically, this grant will provide travel funds for undergraduate students, both from 2-year and 4-year colleges and graduate students, to participate in the SHPE 2012 annual meeting (November 14-18, 2012, Fort Worth, TX) for three purposes: (1) to allow students to participate in the SHPE annual undergraduate and graduate technical paper and poster competitions; (2) to allow students to participate in graduate school and young investigator workshops, through the GEM GRAD Lab and Graduate Institute of the SHPE conference; and (3) to connect students and Hispanic Engineering faculty in order to open opportunities for postdoctoral positions, Research Experiences for Undergraduates, and research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;By fostering the participation of 54 undergraduate students at Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) annual meeting, the program supported by this award has the the potential to become an important, large-scale, activity to increase the number of Hispanic engineering faculty numbers in the United States, as it consists of a multi-tiered approach starting with undergraduates and moving all the way up to current faculty members.</AbstractNarration>
