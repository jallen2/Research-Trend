    <AbstractNarration>1236451&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Georgiadis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aging and obesity are associated with reductions in lean body mass and increases in fat mass, both leading to declines in strength and physical function. Elderly women are particularly prone to disability as they have more fat mass, less skeletal muscle mass and strength, and are less physically active compared to their male counterparts. Determining fitness for the elderly who are overweight or obese by using non-invasive means will facilitate intervention by diet and exercise. This project is motivated by the need to measure the relative benefits of these interventions to increase leg muscle quality, which is a measure of physical fitness. Recent research has demonstrated that Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can measure the local properties of directional water diffusion and lipid concentration in the human muscle. A systematic study of the thigh muscles of 47 elderly women differing in weight and fitness level has just been completed, including a follow-up study after exercise training and weight loss of the obese subgroup. Strong correlations were found between overall fitness and MRI measures related to transport of water inside the muscle fibers. The overarching aim of this project is to interpret these results by simulating the way MRI encodes information and applying these simulations to understand the transport of metabolites within the muscle fiber. Human muscle is a complex hierarchical tissue, so the focus of this project is on a multiphase model that can accommodate the muscle structural changes relevant to aging and obesity. Starting from the MRI data acquired, the model will include an ordered or disordered array of myofibrils and lipid domains inside the muscle fiber, and multiphase transport of water, certain metabolites, and calcium ions will be simulated numerically. The model parameters will then be altered judiciously to study various scenarios of mass transport related to impaired metabolism inside the muscle fiber. The key objective of the proposed research is the combination of numerical modeling with data obtained from non-invasive imaging techniques, such as MRI, which will offer insights into muscle physiology and metabolism previously only available from invasive techniques requiring muscle biopsy. The connection between local directional diffusion and the distribution of the lipids inside the muscle has not been explored, because ostensibly such measurements have not been possible until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the 81 million baby boomers currently living in the US, 70% of women over 60 years of age are overweight or obese. The transformative part of this project is the use of MRI technology available in the local clinic to connect the physical fitness of the individual with the physics of mass transport inside the muscle. In addition to helping plan the clinical intervention in order to prevent the onset of disabilities, this project will improve scientific knowledge of how the aging muscle utilizes energy derived from lipids. Knowledge gained from this research effort can be incorporated into classical engineering courses, or new interdisciplinary courses. The future establishment of an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program focusing on Transport Phenomena in Muscle and Central Nervous System is also planned.</AbstractNarration>
