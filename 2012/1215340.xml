    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing an automated mortar dispensing system, a major component of a semi-automated masonry (SAM) robotic system. The current technology challenge is the development of a mortar dispensing system that can accurately replicate the art of manual mortar preparation and application. This means a system that can account for the variability of mortar batch production as well as maintaining the chemical and material requirements to relevant standards. This technical effort will focus on key variables involved, such as reaction heat, pH, viscosity, moisture retention, time variables and temperature/humidity conditions. One of the major challenges of an automated mortar dispensing system is the variability created by onsite weather conditions. This Phase I project will allow us to investigate the feasibility of developing a measurement and control system that can accurately determine the quality of the mortar and adjust as necessary to produce consistent mortar that meets the requirements of the SAM system. Masonry jobs are dynamic work environments that need to be adjusted and corrected in real time, presenting numerous challenges for automation, but if successful, the potential benefits are enormous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, the SAM robotic system, is intended to revolutionize the masonry construction industry. The system will significantly increase the throughput of brick masonry production. Our core technology incorporates proprietary sensing and control systems, with the dispensing of mortar to achieve information-driven automated bricklaying. Brick-based construction represents a significant portion of the global and US economies with over $20 billion spent on all masonry work in the US, and over $5 billion spent on commercial brick masonry. This segment of the construction industry has seen little innovation over the recent decades. The SAM system will provide a per-job cost savings of over 30% based on increased productivity of the masonry crew. This significant increase in the efficiency of masons will make brick masonry more affordable. By using more technology in the masonry industry, it will be easier to recruit younger talent to an industry with an aging work force. The increase in the use of bricks in construction, especially in regions that are susceptible to extreme weather conditions, will provide many environmental and customer benefits such as increased durability, insulation, fire resistance, and lower maintenance. These in turn will lead to energy and resource conservation.</AbstractNarration>
