    <AbstractNarration>With the exponential increase in the size, complexity, and rate of acquisition of diverse types of data, there an urgent need for new techniques for managing and analyzing such data. In this context, there is a critical need for benchmarks to facilitate evaluation of alternative solutions and provide for comparisons among different solution approaches targeted to big data applications. Benchmarks need to capture a variety of characteristics of big data storage, management, and analytics including new feature sets, enormous data size, largescale and evolving system configurations, shifting loads, and the heterogeneous technologies of big-data and cloud platforms. The benchmarks are inadequate for assessing emerging big data platforms, systems and in software such as SQL, NoSQL, and the Hadoop software ecosystem; different modalities or genres of big data, including graphs, streams, scientific data, document collections, and transaction data; new options in hardware including, HDD vs SSD, different types of HDD, SSD, and main memory, and large-memory systems; and, new platform options that include dedicated commodity clusters and cloud platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Big Data Benchmarking 2012 represents an important step towards the development of a suite of benchmarks for providing objective measures of the effectiveness of hardware and software systems dealing with big data applications. The objective of this invitation-only workshop is to identify key issues and to launch an activity around the definition of reference benchmarks that can capture the essence of big data application scenarios. The effort aims to arrive at a set of objective measures and benchmark datasets to characterize and compare the performance of and the price/performance tradeoffs of alternative solutions for big data storage, retrieval, processing, and analysis problems. The workshop brings together a group of about 40 experts from academia and industry with backgrounds in big data, database systems, benchmarking and system performance, cloud storage and computing, and related areas.The industries represented range from hardware, software, analytics, and applications. The group will develop a draft of a report describing a big data benchmark suite that will be widely disseminated on the web and through presentations and oureach activities at the relevant conferences and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The availability of the big data benchmark suite will facilitate research and technological advances by providing objective measures for comparing alternative solutions to key big data problems.</AbstractNarration>
