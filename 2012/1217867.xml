    <AbstractNarration>Macro molecular complexes that act as nano-scale machines provide the&lt;br/&gt;function of biological systems. Understanding the geometry and functioning of&lt;br/&gt;the complex as a machine, for instance, how do the various parts move relative&lt;br/&gt;to each other, is a central goal of biology. Cryo electron microscopy provides&lt;br/&gt;one noisy image of each of many (e.g., 100,000) instances of the complex. The&lt;br/&gt;objective of this research is to compute a statistical description of the machine&lt;br/&gt;from the images and then compute a mechanical model of the machine from&lt;br/&gt;the statistical description. Understanding how existing complexes function is&lt;br/&gt;central to engineering changes in their function. Achieving changes would have&lt;br/&gt;broad impact, for instance, in cancer treatment (inhibiting complexes that pro-&lt;br/&gt;tect tumor cells by pumping chemotherapy drugs out of tumor cells) and in&lt;br/&gt;improving the efficiency of complexes involved in the production of biofuels.&lt;br/&gt;Further impacts include the training of two Ph.D. students who will come from a diverse pool of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complex in question will be described as a weighted sum of basis functions with random&lt;br/&gt;Gaussian weights. A maximum likelihood estimator is used to estimate the&lt;br/&gt;mean and covariance of the weights. The estimator is computed by an expecta-&lt;br/&gt;tion maximization algorithm which requires substantial computation due to the&lt;br/&gt;unknown projection directions of the images. A "spring and mass" mechanical&lt;br/&gt;model in thermodynamic equilibrium predicts the mean and covariance. By&lt;br/&gt;comparing the predictions of the mechanical model to the estimated mean and&lt;br/&gt;covariance by Kullback-Leibler divergence, the parameters in the mechanical&lt;br/&gt;model are estimated.</AbstractNarration>
