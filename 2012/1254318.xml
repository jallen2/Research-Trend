    <AbstractNarration>1254318&lt;br/&gt;Segatori&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoparticles are now being engineered for a variety of important applications, ranging form diagnostics and therapeutics to energy production and materials. A number of nanoparticles of different size, shape and composition enter the cell through endocytosis and activate cellular clearance mechanisms and, particularly, autophagy, which is the main catabolic pathway that eliminates cellular waste and foreign material. Interestingly, impaired or inefficient autophagic activity is linked to accumulation of cellular waste material and development of a number of cancers, ageing and metabolic diseases. The project team recently developed a set of analytical tools to quantify the cellular clearance capacity and cell model systems to measure the accumulation of cellular waste. The overall research goal of the proposed project is to engineer the cellular clearance pathway using nanoparticles. To achieve this goal, the research team will identify nanoparticles that enhance clearance of toxic cellular waste material and will use these nanoparticles to investigate the molecular mechanism involved in regulation of autophagy. This study will lay the groundwork for developing novel therapeutic strategies to treat pathologic conditions associated with autophagy dysfunction, ranging from ageing and metabolic diseases to cancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will provide the basis for the development of educational and training platforms, with the ultimate educational goal of diversifying the pool of students interested in biomolecular engineering and of increasing the retention of underrepresented groups - particularly girls and women - in STEM disciplines. To this end, the project integrates educational objectives relevant to high school students, undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award is co-funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) through the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program, and by the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET).</AbstractNarration>
