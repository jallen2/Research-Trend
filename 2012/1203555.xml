    <AbstractNarration>1203555-Craver&lt;br/&gt;There is much current interest in rare earth elements (REE) as a result of their critical uses in industrial and military applications in products such as biomedical instrumentation, green energy products, and . However, there is little information on their environment, health, or safety impacts, particularly as nanomaterials. This work will begin development of protocols to examine possible harmful effects of these nanomaterials and pave the way for a broader examination of this class of nanomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will (i) establish reliable analytical techniques and experimental methodologies, (ii) assess the magnitude of the impact of REE nanoparticles (nREE) to different populations of microorganisms, and (iii) generate preliminary data for further work. Cerium and Dysprosium nanoparticles will be characterized and examined with respect to their impact on E. coli bacteria. Ceria impacts have been well-studied and will be used as a control, while the effects of dysprosium nanomaterials are unknown. Effects on cells such as viability, membrane permeation, cell growth, respiration, compartmentalization within the cells, effects of different media chemistries will be examined. Methods developed in this research will provide both new information about the impact of this rare earth and the means of examining other materials in the same class. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will provide fundamental data regarding the potential toxicity of nREEs and REE ions released from these nanoparticles and nanoproducts. Additionally,information regarding the fate of these materials in a variety of natural water conditions will be evaluated. This information will help to understand the impact of the materials once released into the environment. Graduate and undergraduate students will work on this research including 2 Hispanic students. The work will be incorporated into the PIs courses and the results disseminated through scientific and public media.</AbstractNarration>
