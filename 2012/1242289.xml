    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for two special sessions at the annual American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) meeting that will be focused on "Emerging Areas in Polymer Science and Engineering." The PIs have organized these sessions to highlight recent advances in polymer science, focused on experimental, theoretical, and simulation topics of interest to the broad polymer community. Each session will contain academic researchers from various stages in their careers discussing timely and important topics. Furthermore, these sessions will emphasize the breadth and depth of on-going and emerging polymer-related activities in the chemical engineering community. The sessions will take place during the 2012 Fall AIChE Meeting (October 28-November 2) in Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the two special sessions is to highlight new areas of polymer science and engineering, as well as to underscore emerging opportunities and unexplored themes in more established areas of polymer science. Though the talks cover an array of polymer science topics, the overall theme is the use of nanoscale engineering of polymer systems to manipulate materials structure, properties, and function. The combination of the talks in each session will highlight recent theoretical, simulation, and experimental advances in polymer science and engineering, providing an overview of several cutting-edge methodologies being employed to tackle key problems related to energy storage and generation, drug delivery, nanoscale templating, coatings, nanocomposites, and biomaterials. The speakers represent a diverse group of polymer scientists in terms of research topics, research methodology (experimental/theoretical/simulation) career status, gender, and ethnicity.</AbstractNarration>
