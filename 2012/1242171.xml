    <AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Improvement of Nanoscale Device Education via Theory, Experimental Design, and Characterization", at Purdue University under the direction of Dr. Michael T. Harris, will develop a new path for undergraduate students interested in developing a strong nanotechnology background that starts in their First-Year Engineering courses and can continue throughout their career at Purdue University. The components of this program span from classroom instruction through laboratory experiments and finally, to hands-on summer research programs for interested students. In particular, the educational thrusts will focus on the fabrication of novel devices for clean energy generation and storage applications, advanced bioengineered devices, and the development of sensing platforms for enhanced homeland security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the inherently interdisciplinary nature of nanoscience and nanoengineering education, the proposed projects will allow for unique extensions in the fields of chemistry, materials engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and bioengineering. Specifically, 100% of first year engineering students will be impacted (~2000 undergraduate students/year), ~200 sophomore and junior engineering students per year (~10% of all undergraduate engineering students/year), ~1% of all undergraduate students (20 engineering students/year) will participate in 3-month faculty-led research experiences through this program. Successful education of these talented undergraduate students will lead to a well-trained nanotechnology-based workforce capable of manufacturing devices for the next generation of biomedical and energy-generating devices.</AbstractNarration>
