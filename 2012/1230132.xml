    <AbstractNarration>This pilot project is an exploratory study of alpine cairns on Baranof Island in Southeast Alaska. This is an archeological investigation engaging experts in the fields of archaeology, botany, and ethnohistory in a multidisciplinary study of upland cairns (artificial arrangements of stacked rocks or mounds of stones) in southeastern Alaska. The PI argues that very little has been done to explore the upland archaeology of the region and nothing is known about the functions of the cairn sites. It has been hypothesized that these structures were used for hunting blinds, burials, boundary markers, etc. The research team proposes to survey the sites and disassemble selected cairns in order to gain data on their age and function. It will also gather oral history from Tlingit elders in the region to determine the extent of their knowledge about traditional Tlingit activities in the alpine areas, the cairns, and perhaps some insights into their function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will recover data relating to ages, functions, and distributions of cairns on mountains Southeast Alaska. Cairns appear to be quite prevalent in this region of Alaska but their distribution, specific topographic settings, and functions remains unknown. This investigation has the potential to feed into a much broader research agenda that examines the evolution of social complexity among hunting and gathering groups, one that sheds light on early native North American social and cultural organization. In addition, the project will test an innovative methodology, lichenometry, for dating these rock cairn sites; and is in addition, an innovative project that brings together archaeology and oral historic methods and data to provide new insights on these structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the project includes partnerships with the US Forest Service (USFS) and local Alaska Native communities interested in the data uncovered by the project. Native communities are very interested in learning more about their ancestors. Native high school and/or college students will be included in the field team and communications with tribal leadership will be enhanced through daily/weekly information exchanges between the PI and tribal liaisons. Investigative data will be utilized by the USFS in developing their plan for protection, preservation and interpretation of their alpine cultural resources.</AbstractNarration>
