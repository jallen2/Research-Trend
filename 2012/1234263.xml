    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to elucidate the governing parameters that determine the structure and cohesive properties of polymer-grafted particle assemblies and to establish the knowledge base that will enable the efficient molecular-engineering of nanoparticles that are capable to form mechanically robust array structures. The assembly of nanoparticles into array structures is of central importance to the integration of nanoparticle systems into device architectures for applications ranging from photovoltaics to solid state lighting. A major barrier in the scalable production of self-assembled particle array structures is the brittle nature of particle solids that promotes crack formation during the processing. The proposed study will establish a novel methodology to enhance the cohesive interactions between particles by binding of polymeric ligands to nanoparticle surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed research will provide new opportunities for the facile fabrication of polymer nanocomposites with prescribed microstructure and enhanced performance and fuel a range of transformative technological innovations, for example, in the area of solid state lighting for which alone the market is estimated to grow to $14.3B by 2013. This research grant will enable cross-disciplinary training for one graduate student and several undergraduate students in the critical areas of polymer and nanoscale materials. Collaboration with ongoing programs funded through the National Science Foundation will promote the participation of minority students and underrepresented groups. This research grant will support the teaching of a new course and encompass the development of a teacher workshop on "nanotechnologies for sustainable energy technologies" as well as a new module to "The Science Van" program that is aimed at supporting STEM education in underfunded schools in the Pittsburgh area.</AbstractNarration>
