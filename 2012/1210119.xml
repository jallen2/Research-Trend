    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Jonathan Sherette (Jessica Sherette) of The University of Texas at San Antonio to conduct a research project, entitled "Exploring core problems in computing the similarity of surfaces," during the summer of 2012 at Pohang University of Science and Technology in Pohang. The host scientist is Hee-Kap Ahn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in its potential impact for applications which require computing the similarity of surfaces. These applications range from problems in computer aided design to ones in evolutionary biology. In addition, computing the similarity of surfaces is a theoretically challenging problem with an active research community. This research project explores core problems in computing the similarity of surfaces with the aim that a better understanding of the theoretical complexity of these problems will facilitate innovation in these wide-ranging practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
