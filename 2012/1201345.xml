    <AbstractNarration>A workshop on "Cohomology and Support in Representation Theory and Related Topics" will be held at the University of Washington, Seattle, on August 1 - 5, 2012. Following seminal work of Daniel Quillen, cohomological support varieties have been studied and seen numerous applications to the development of the representation theory of a wide array of structures: finite groups, Lie algebras (and superalgebras), finite group schemes, Hopf algebras, small quantum groups, and general self-injective algebras. In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in unifying the theories for different structures. Further, the notion of "support" itself has evolved considerably from its initial definition in terms of the cohomology of a finite group to a much more category theoretic concept. The workshop "Cohomology and Support in Representation Theory and Related Topics," following on the footsteps of the summer school on the same topic, will be an opportunity to summarize the history of this theoretical tool, to report on recent progress on multiple fronts, and to prepare a new cadre of mathematicians to continue the extensive development and applications of supports in many different areas of mathematics. Additional information on the workshop can be found at http://www.math.washington.edu/~pischool/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop "Cohomology and Support in Representation Theory and Related Topics" will bring mathematicians from different areas together to foster interaction and find new connections between multiple fields united by their use of the concept of "support" and will introduce a new generation of young researchers to the field. The organizers of the workshop are Christopher Bendel (University of Wisconsin-Stout), Henning Krause (Universitat Bielefeld), and Julia Pevtsova (University of Washington). There are twenty four confirmed/tentatively agreed speakers which include leading researchers in several different areas of representation theory, commutative algebra, and triangulated categories from around the world. The workshop will follow directly on the footsteps of a summer school for graduate students and recent PhDs to be held one week prior at the same location. The summer school will present three series of lectures introducing young mathematicians to several active directions of research within the broad field to be covered more deeply during the workshop. Such a juxtaposition will provide the junior participants with a valuable opportunity to take the foundational knowledge they acquire during the summer school and use it to delve into current problems during the workshop. Taken together, the summer school and the workshop are aimed to be both a thorough survey on the exciting recent developments in the field and the venue for an active discussion of future prospects and open problems.</AbstractNarration>
