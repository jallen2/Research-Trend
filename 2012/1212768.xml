    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to assess the merit and developmental feasibility of a Web-platform for creating and delivering next-generation virtual patient case encounters. These case encounters will enable self-directed class and team-based active learning exercises that incorporate automated concept and skill proficiency assessment. Educators will be able to objectively assess patient assessment and diagnostic reasoning proficiency as well as understanding of the underlying basic science concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial impact of this project is to improve student educational outcomes and enable compliance with educational reform directives from accreditation authorities and school administrators. We project revenue in excess of $6 million from the North American UME market alone by the fourth year after commercial availability. Lastly, US Universities are one of the few US industries with a positive balance of trade and reputation for international excellence as evidenced by the US being the educational and practice destination of choice for many foreign medical students. The broader impact/commercial potential is to use internet technology to project US leadership in healthcare education internationally, and thereby generate US jobs and positive foreign exchange in a strategically important yet heretofore technologically neglected market</AbstractNarration>
