    <AbstractNarration>1265974 Ohio University; Gerardine Botte &lt;br/&gt;1266092 Washington University; Venkat Subramanian &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will be will be dedicated to the improvement of chemical and biological processes utilizing novel, electrochemically-focused approaches. Ohio University and Washington are collaborating to establish the proposed Center, with Ohio University as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center (CEProTech) will focus both on the classical electrochemical engineering applications (chloro-alkali and aluminum processes, batteries, hydrogen production, etc.), as well as the development of more radical and transformative applications: utilizing electrochemical systems and approaches for conventional processes that typically forego electrochemical methods (remediation, advanced synthesis, production of specialty gases &amp; chemicals, and hemodialysis, among others). CEProTech envisions that through the diverse applicability of the electrochemical science, the comprehensive collection of resources assembled for the Center, and the aid of its strong assortment of industry supporters, the Center will have significant impact across a variety of market sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research conducted at CEProTech has the potential to increase national economic security through improved energy independence, environmental protection, and job creation. With the support of our diverse assortment of industry members, the Center hopes to sustain a holistic portfolio of novel, advanced and industrially applicable research. CEProTech intends to have an experienced multi-disciplinary team, including a significant percent of underrepresented groups of faculty, research scientists, and numerous undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-docs. The proposed Center also plans to expand an already strong platform of educational activities (graduate courses, topical workshops, and outreach programs) to provide interdisciplinary education and training in the field of electrochemical engineering, through specialized workshops, international conferences (with selected papers published in the Journal of Applied Electrochemistry), industry oriented seminars and conferences, webinars, long-distance education and workforce development for manufacturing electrochemical devices. The Center will encourage a broad dissemination of learning through its continuing education activities to assist engineers in industry, as well as engineering students, in acquiring knowledge of electrochemical processes and systems to better prepare them for careers and career advancements in the industry.</AbstractNarration>
