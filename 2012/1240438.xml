    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) Origami Design for the Integration of Self-assembling Systems for Engineering Innovation (ODISSEI) award is to study a new class of origami by means of polymer sheets that fold in response to external triggers (i.e., light), for hands free folding. Folding occurs in response to the localization of energy to hinges that are defined on the polymer sheet by Deskjet printing. The appeal of this approach is its simplicity, versatility, and ability to harness the multitude of 2D patterning techniques to convert surface patterns on pre-strained polymer sheets into 3D objects within seconds upon exposure to a stimulus. The team, which includes two artists/designers who specialize in surface design and sculpting, a mechanical engineer with expertise in multi-scale mechanics of materials, a mathematician with 35 years of origami experience, and materials/chemical engineers, seeks to study experimentally and model computationally the folding process to create new multi-functional 3D structures that can form rapidly with precise control over shape. We will explore experimentally and model the scaling laws of folding, the rate of folding, and the mechanics of folding to develop compliant folding mechanisms. Our interdisciplinary team will collaborate to advance our scientific objectives while broadening participation of underrepresented groups and developing outreach modules on origami for K-12 students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generation of novel structures based on folding/unfolding of 2D sheets is expected to lead to a novel paradigm towards developing materials with unprecedented function/property. Our approach has significant commercial relevance because it is compatible with both low-tech, high throughput 2D patterning techniques (e.g., roll-to-roll patterning) as well as 2D patterning of electronics and photonics. Packaging or manufacturing of unfoldable materials employed in various technological applications (including those relevant to the Air Force, such as, unfoldable air foils for precision airdrop of humanitarian supplies) constitute examples of structures that will benefit from the research effort. We will develop a means of attracting local K-12 teachers and students to take part in our interdisciplinary research endeavors through educational and outreach programs at NC State University, Elon University, and at Meredith, a neighboring women?s college. The outreach programs will be developed and distributed synergistically by our team featuring artists, a former high school teacher, a mathematician who teaches origami, and engineers / scientists from NC State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported in part by funds from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.</AbstractNarration>
