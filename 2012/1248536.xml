    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new and improved sensor material to detect the vapors of peroxide-based homemade explosives. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense have identified peroxide-based homemade explosive detection as a top priority need. Terrorists worldwide continue to carry explosives onto airplanes and transport them through the mail. In addition, sixty percent of US and Allied deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan are related to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Vaporsens is developing a revolutionary detector capable of continuous, non-contact detection of explosive threats. The sensor material to be used in the detector can identify the majority of explosives - with the exception of peroxide-base explosives. To develop this multi-target detector, the company must demonstrate the feasibility of detecting peroxide-based explosives with its novel sensor material. The outcome will be a highly sensitive peroxide sensor material ready to be to be integrated into our multi-target explosive detector product. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address our homeland security needs to chemically detect explosives accurately, quickly, and in a non-intrusive manner. The small, fast-acting detector will be ideal for portable explosive detectors and also for integration into existing security monitoring, building ventilation, and detection systems. Furthermore, the development of such a technology is feasible from an investment standpoint because potential commercial value is high.</AbstractNarration>
