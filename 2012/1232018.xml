    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to advance the fundamental understanding and further develop new device architectures based on the use of low dimensional carbons (nanotubes, graphene) as electronically gated contact electrodes. The PIs have already demonstrated new devices exploiting the phenomenon. Specifically, a new architecture transistor that overcomes the inherent mobility limitations of organic semiconductors and a solar cell having a power conversion efficiency that can be dramatically improved by electronic gating. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in the promise to 1) deepen the theoretical understanding of the phenomenon by developing a comprehensive model that captures essential physics of low-dimensional-carbon-contacts and related vertical devices, 2) provide design rules for exploiting this property in devices that establish the benefits and the limits, and 3) expand the range of the devices in new directions and from individual components to functional circuits (e.g. inverters, logic gates, ring oscillator). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: organic semiconductors have physical limitations that bound the range of what they can do. The transformative aspect of this project is that the devices to be developed will greatly extend that range allowing for faster, higher density, plastic electronic circuits, brighter, more energy efficient displays, and higher efficiency solar cells. The educational and outreach activities will include translating the research progress to the undergraduate and graduate course materials, developing a web-based learning module, supervising minority and female student research through the outreach programs in University of Florida, and providing early exposure of K-12 students to electronics technology through the Student Science Training Program.</AbstractNarration>
