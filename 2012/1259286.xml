    <AbstractNarration>This project is designed to provide scholarships to academically talented students with financial need majoring in computer science and engineering technology. The primary goal is to offer support and experiences so that students are qualified upon graduation to enter graduate school or employment in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) profession. To accomplish this goal, the project is recruiting 20 students who are eligible for the state-wide, merit-based Legislative Incentive for Future Excellence (LIFE) Scholarship and who are also eligible for the Federal Pell Grant. The project is actively recruiting underrepresented STEM students, including women. In addition to scholarship support, the scholarship students are participating in pre-college bridge programs; academic advising and mentoring programs; individual/group tutoring and study sessions; and activities designed to enhance their opportunities for internships and/or undergraduate research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholars are being recruited from high schools served by Upward Bound Science and Math programs and from other rural South Carolina school districts where there are large concentrations of families living below the poverty line. A two-week intensive precollege bridge program is helping to prepare scholars for the rigors of STEM studies. Scholars are also registering with the Career Center at the university so that they make take advantage of internship, career development, and employment opportunities. Faculty members are serving as academic advisors and mentors to the scholars and coordinating study sessions with the Honors College, which has an established tutoring program operated by professionals and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is contributing to the body of research on the effectiveness of using scholarships to recruit students into STEM disciplines; their retention and persistence in STEM; and their entry into the STEM workforce or graduate school. Scholars are participating in academic enrichment activities as they join other scholarship recipients at the college in the development of an interdisciplinary learning community. The university is also offering opportunities for scholars to work with faculty and staff to participate in organized research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The program is increasing enrollments of minority students, including female students, in the fields of computer science and engineering technology. Their entry into the STEM pipeline is helping to meet the shortage of computing and engineering professionals as well as broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities and women in the STEM workforce. Scholars and faculty members are interacting with teachers and students in secondary schools during recruiting activities, which is encouraging and motivating more high school students to study STEM.</AbstractNarration>
