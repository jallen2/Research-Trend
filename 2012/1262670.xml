    <AbstractNarration>The American Student Placements and Internships in Rehabilitation Engineering (ASPIRE) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program is funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Engineering Education and Centers. Rehabilitation engineering employs a systematic approach to the design, modification, customization and/or fabrication of assistive technology for persons with disabilities. Research efforts in rehabilitation engineering are focused on identifying and addressing problems critical to achieving and maintaining the highest possible level of function in areas related to mobility, communications, sensory (e.g., hearing, tactile, vision), and cognition and in activities associated with employment, independent living, and education. The primary objective of the ASPIRE REU program is to provide an exemplary mentoring and resourceful environment that enables undergraduate students to 1) transition from dependent to independent thinkers, 2) develop a sense of excitement about entering an engineering or technical field and 3) be well prepared for their future careers. Recruitment initiatives emphasize minorities and students with disabilities. Additionally, students who come from institutions with limited research opportunities will receive special consideration. Seminars, workshops and field trips supplement the educational experience outside of the laboratories. Students in this REU Site are an active participant of a multi-disciplinary research team and acquire ownership of part of a larger-scale or pilot research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the ASPIRE REU program is about empowering undergraduate students with the confidence, experience and skills necessary to excel in graduate studies and in their future careers as engineers or scientists, all within the context of rehabilitation engineering projects whose byproducts increase the independence of people with disabilities. Program mentors are well experienced in providing the appropriate level of guidance needed to support the students' independent development of these attributes. Students in this REU develop a sense of worth that comes from being an integral part of something 'bigger'. Moreover, this REU Site provides opportunities for students to work on projects that have direct application to the betterment of society. Having this experience early in their academic careers not only raises awareness to the social obligations of being an engineer, but also provides a "beyond the classroom experience" that brings purpose and meaning to an engineering curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
