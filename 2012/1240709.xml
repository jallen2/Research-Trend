    <AbstractNarration>This award is being used to conduct a review of the GLOBE program data collection protocols, instrumentation specifications, and associated Teachers Guide, which was last re-written in 2003. This effort builds on a panel convened in January 10-11, 2011, which reported that the science content of the GLOBE protocols is overall still quite relevant, but in need of minor updating (as opposed to a complete overhaul). The Teachers Guide is being reviewed on an investigation area by investigation area basis, in order to better identify specific areas that need addressing. Five sub-groups addressing major sections of the Teachers Guide related to Atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;Hydrology, Soil, Land Cover, and, Earth as a System/Phenology are meeting meeting virtually through web conferencing tools. These sub-groups consiste of discipline and program experts with considerable expertise and insight into the working and implementation of these protocols. Each sub-group is reviewing the state of the science protocols within that topic area and identifying those that need updating or long-term augmentation; prioritizing the proposed modifications; and assessing the suitability of protocols for on-line as opposed to hands-on training, as well as the need for more customized training requirements. A panel report addressing these topics will be issued by July 6, 2012. A revised GLOBE Teachers Guide will complement and better integrate with the revised GLOBE web site and database as well as prepare the program for new mobile technologies and the 2013 renewal of the GLOBE management contract.</AbstractNarration>
