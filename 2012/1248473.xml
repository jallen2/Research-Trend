    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the&lt;br/&gt;problem of learning predictive models of individual choice behavior using sparse&lt;br/&gt;information on the behavior of any single individual. The intellectual merit of the&lt;br/&gt;project is developing a novel parsimonious view of this problem by modeling&lt;br/&gt;choice behavior as a distribution over permutations of alternatives, and making&lt;br/&gt;this view implementable at scale. A unit of data in this paradigm is a single&lt;br/&gt;comparison between two alternatives. Data of this sort can be derived in a variety&lt;br/&gt;of contexts ranging from product reviews to transaction data. While being a&lt;br/&gt;parsimonious modeling viewpoint, exact computation, or even representing such&lt;br/&gt;models is intractable. The project will focus on developing approximate solutions&lt;br/&gt;that, in the spirit of recent advances in high-dimensional statistics, exploit the&lt;br/&gt;potential of sparse approximations to such models. Given the vast quantities of&lt;br/&gt;data available to build such models it will be important for the algorithms&lt;br/&gt;developed to be amenable to parallelization in a manner reminiscent of the&lt;br/&gt;Map/Reduce computational paradigm. The algorithms developed will fit this&lt;br/&gt;paradigm with key algorithmic steps decomposing across data collected for a&lt;br/&gt;single individual. In summary, this project will develop a massively parallelizable&lt;br/&gt;approach to modeling individual choice behavior using unstructured data from a&lt;br/&gt;variety of sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project rests in enabling the&lt;br/&gt;emerging, all pervasive transition from 'search' to 'discovery'. This transition can&lt;br/&gt;be witnessed in sectors ranging from e-commerce to offline retail to matching&lt;br/&gt;impressions to advertisers on demand side platforms. The key stumbling block in&lt;br/&gt;this transition is the seeming requirement to build attribute rich models for a given&lt;br/&gt;context as opposed to a black box approach. The approach taken in this project&lt;br/&gt;is of the latter variety. As a concrete example, the task of merchandising requires&lt;br/&gt;an offline retailer to decide on the right assortment of products to carry in&lt;br/&gt;segments ranging from tooth paste to clothing; the approach here will power such&lt;br/&gt;decision making in an entirely data driven fashion. In a different direction, serving&lt;br/&gt;ads based on models that capture a surfer's preferences across the various silos&lt;br/&gt;of products and topics on the web can be enabled at scale and incredible&lt;br/&gt;granularity using the approach here. The level of granularity made possible by&lt;br/&gt;the approach here cannot be achieved with 'parametric' attribute driven&lt;br/&gt;approaches. In summary, the tools developed in this project have the potential to&lt;br/&gt;do for `discovery' what the PageRank algorithm did for search.</AbstractNarration>
