    <AbstractNarration>The first step in speech comprehension is to break up the speech signal and identify the individual words. To do so, one must locate where one word ends and the next begins. Unlike in written text, where there is a visual gap between pairs of words, no such reliable cue for word boundaries exists in spoken speech. Research has shown that native English listeners can utilize a set of cues to segment continuous speech, including the structure and meaning of sentences, knowledge of what constitutes a real word in English, sensitivity to whether a sound is allowed in a certain position in the word, and the emphasis given to a part of the word. However, it is not clear whether these segmentation cues are used by nonnative listeners in a similar fashion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of cues may be influenced by nonnative listeners' English proficiency. Beginning or intermediate second language (L2) learners may have less established knowledge about what constitute a real word in English. Also, L2 learners' use of cues may be influenced by the characteristics of sounds in their native languages. Four groups of participants, including a monolingual English group and three nonnative groups (Mandarin, Korean, and Spanish), will participate in four experiments. Each experiment will examine how L2 learners differ from native listeners in the use of cues and how the three L2 groups differ from each other as a result of their native language experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding speech is a critical component in language acquisition and identifying cues that can facilitate this process will benefit both learners and teachers. There are nearly 40 million L2 learners in the U.S.; improved English proficiency will help them become more competitive and productive in the work place. This study also contributes to the training of a promising young researcher.</AbstractNarration>
