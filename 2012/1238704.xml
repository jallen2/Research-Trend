    <AbstractNarration>This project will conduct analytical studies on multi-hop wireless networks under a realistic shadowing model with an important boundary effect taken into consideration. The project will investigate the critical transmission power required for each node to ensure that the network is connected asymptotically almost surely under a shadowing model, and explore the relation between the probability that the network is connected and the probability that the network has no isolated nodes. The impact of radio irregularity on network connectivity and radio interference in practical multihop wireless networks under the shadowing model will be examined. The ultimate goal of this project is to make significant improvements for research and education in computer science at Paine College and increase the participation of African American undergraduate students in computer science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid proliferation of mobile and wireless devices provides an excellent opportunity for theoretic research in the wireless networking area. The log-normal shadowing model is a realistic radio propagation model which has been widely used. The important boundary effect must be taken into consideration in any practical multihop wireless networks. Under such a shadowing model with the boundary effect included, little is known about connectivity of practical multihop wireless networks and the impact of radio irregularity on connectivity and interference. The results of this research will be of interest in areas such as throughput capacity, virtual backbone, topology control, routing protocols, information theory and networking. Multihop wireless networks are expected to play a key role in solving problems such as securing our homeland, protecting the infrastructure, monitoring conditions in the biosphere, or in the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses.</AbstractNarration>
