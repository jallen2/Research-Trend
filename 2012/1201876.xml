    <AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation project investigates the differential scale in which locust outbreaks are managed in West Africa. Institutions are often mismatched to the problems they are mandated to resolve. This mismatch is often of spatial scale, such as, national agencies mandated to solve problems of international scale, or international organizations mandated with local-scale management issues. Such institutional mismatch poses an intellectual puzzle common to numerous ecological and public health management regimes, which include water pollution control, vector disease prevention and climate governance. The study is concerned with how scientific and technical experts operate and adapt within agencies assigned to resolve precisely these mismatched crises. It focuses on national and international efforts to manage an agricultural pest hazard that is especially adept at evading and exceeding state capacity: the swarms of Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria) that periodically threaten crops throughout Western and Northern Africa. To this end, the study examines the social and technical practices of, and interactions amongst, locust scientists and locust management experts and technicians in (1) a locust science research center (in France), (2) a national locust control center (in Mali), and (3) meetings of international agencies mandated with the coordination of scientific expertise, management activities, and funding allocation related to locust control efforts. Interviews on, and observations of, the activities of the concerned actors will supplement analysis of various document materials (locust science literature, conference proceedings and crop protection agency reports) to determine how perceptions of locusts and their control vary between groups, experts and authorities, which factors direct and control the flow of locust control resources, and how and whether each of these vary over time and across agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By explaining how and why certain locust management practices are favored, and in response to what challenges or opportunities, the study will identify the source of specific lapses in management capacity, which in turn will allow more informed decision-making and risk analysis, providing opportunities to amend the nature of pest control within international development efforts. This holds out the prospect for reducing the financial as well as environmental costs of interventions, and making them more amenable to explicit political negotiation by diverse publics. At a broader level, the results of this study will help re-think the role of technical and scientific expertise in the networks of international development aid and knowledge, their relation to the challenges of state-making, and will help find ways to increase the fit between institutions and ecological management. These problems are crucial to strategies to both enhance food security and to govern real and pressing environmental problems throughout the world. Dissemination is planned for academic and non-academic audiences. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a graduate student to establish an independent research career.</AbstractNarration>
