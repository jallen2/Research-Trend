    <AbstractNarration>Malaria parasites in the genus Plasmodium are well known as causing disease in humans, but half of the roughly 200 species in this genus use lizards as their vertebrate hosts, and many of these species can be found in lizards in Panama. These parasites have been the focus of studies on ecology, epidemiology, and behavior, but their taxonomic classifications and patterns of diversification remain unclear, and this has hindered their use as a model for studying disease. The first goal of this study is to resolve the taxonomy of these Panamanian parasites. Malaria parasite species are traditionally classified based on differences in their morphology, but the simple and changing morphology of the Panamanian species has confounded taxonomists for decades. Their taxonomy will be revised by analyzing genetic information using novel species-delimitation methods. The second goal of this study is to clarify the patterns of diversification in the widespread lizard parasite Plasmodium floridense. It is distributed in southern North America, throughout the Caribbean, and in Middle America, but like most malaria parasites, its history of colonization remains unknown. Newly collected samples from Panama will be combined with previously collected samples from across the parasite?s range, and these will be used to elucidate the parasite?s pattern of diversification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be disseminated broadly and used to promote teaching and learning. Curriculum materials will be developed in partnership with the Gottesman Center at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) to be used in New York City high school biology classrooms. Lectures and laboratory activities will also be developed as part of the Science Research Mentoring Program at the AMNH. Both will introduce urban high school students to the vast diversity of parasite species from across the tree of life. Finally, results of this research will be posted over several entries on two blogs, each of which is well established and has a wide readership, to facilitate the dissemination of the research to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
