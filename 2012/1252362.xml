    <AbstractNarration>The School of Mathematics of the Georgia Institute of Technology will host the ``First International Conference on Dynamics of Differential Equations" in Atlanta during March 16-20, 2013. See http://www.hale-conf.gatech.edu&lt;br/&gt;The conference is dedicated to the memory of Professor Jack K. Hale -- a world renowned leader and pioneer in many areas of dynamics of differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the conference are to foster scientific exchanges, promote interdisciplinary studies, enhance international collaborations, and train graduate students and young researchers in various aspects of dynamics of differential equations. The scientific focus of the conference centers around dynamics of ordinary, partial, and functional differential equations, as well as related modeling and computational methods. The conference includes four two-hour long tutorial sessions, two Hale memorial lectures, thirteen plenary lectures, and four parallel themed sessions with morethan one hundred invited and contributed presentations, and a poster displays. It is expected that between 150-200 people will take part in the conference, nearly half of them from the USA, and at least one-third graduate students or young researchers, which have been specifically targeted as participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will serve both as a training opportunity and as a moment to foster and strengthen stable international collaborations. For example, associated to the conference, there are four 2-hour long tutorials aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduates, and there will be large number of participants from the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The emphasis of this conference will be on the mathematical side of dynamical systems, rather than the applications or experimental side of it. Although a substantial number of plenary and invited talks will be related to applications, the overall goal is for new mathematics to emerge as a result of the challenges presented by the applications themselves, rather than on their phenomenological aspects. Graduate students and young researchers are expected to comprise at least one third of the 150-200 expected participants.</AbstractNarration>
