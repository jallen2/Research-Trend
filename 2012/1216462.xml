    <AbstractNarration>The quantification of animal movement is an important tool in diverse research disciplines within biology. For example, geneticists developing new mutants use locomotion to describe changes in phenotype for thousands of lines, neuroscientists use movement to understand how the brain works, and changes in animal migration patterns are providing understanding of the effects of global climate change. Endeavors ranging from the scale of the movements of cells within developing embryos to continental and ocean migration patterns are benefitting from new advances in computing, automated tracking, and imaging. However, many of the newest tools are being developed within academic laboratories and, even if offered freely, may require specialized skills in engineering to utilize. A second challenge for all such projects is the need to develop mathematical approaches to the analysis of the large data sets produced via automated tracking and movement assessment systems. Thus, advances in computing and sensor hardware have created unprecedented opportunities that are nonetheless unavailable to many biologists. As a first step to address this problem, we have organized a symposium where potential users can become aware of the new tools available. The program is designed to encourage interactions among the audience members and with invited speakers to create opportunities for collaboration and shared development that would not otherwise be possible. The symposium will include presentations by eleven speakers including one graduate student, four postdocs and junior fellows or faculty. The collection of speakers illustrates a major effort to recruit among the most important contributors to this integrative topic while simultaneously broadening the participation of under-represented groups at the interface of engineering and biology.</AbstractNarration>
