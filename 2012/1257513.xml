    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a workshop that will explore the potential for in the area of ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. The workshop be held in Kunming China in October 2012. Investigators from the United States and China will discuss research priorities and ways to collaborate and explore the potential for joint US and China research in the area of ecology and evolution of infectious disease, and stimulate awareness of the crosscutting benefits of such efforts. Cross-cultural and interdisciplinary knowledge and novel insight will be gained as well as lasting collaborations towards uncovering key questions in this arena. Current research in the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases is often directed nationally. Focused, international efforts will permit investigators to share information, training, and experience as well as work on a level that reflects the reality that diseases are not restricted to national boundaries. By igniting investigative interest on an international level, costs effective strategies from shared funding and research efforts will evolve.</AbstractNarration>
