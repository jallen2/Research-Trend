    <AbstractNarration>The proposal will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs and young faculty in the "Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems Workshop" that will be held at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from March 22 to March 25, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference focuses on a fundamental theme in ergodic theory: connections between ergodic theory and number theory. Several of the topics covered are central in extremely active areas of current research in ergodic theory; ergodic properties of interval exchange transformations and of Teichmuller flows, the pointwise or norm convergence of nonconventional ergodic averages, rigidity of group actions. Young researchers are given ample opportunities to speak, to talk and to participate in the conference activities.</AbstractNarration>
