    <AbstractNarration>In an effort to address the disproportionately low representation of women of color in the STEM disciplines, the Institute for Womens Policy Research (IWPR) will host a high-level convening of national experts on women of color with the intent of producing a report that will not only explore the challenges that women of color face in the STEM disciplines, but also put forth promising programmatic and policy changes for increasing the representation of women of color in STEM careers. The IWPR report will be disseminated widely through a broad range of networks and organizations, including relevant professional societies, foundations, academic institutions, policymakers interested in STEM, and gender related organizations. It is envisaged that the work of IWPR will result in expedited progress in increasing the representation of women of color. Additionally, this activity may also provide a foundation upon which alternative strategies for women from other special populations can be built.</AbstractNarration>
