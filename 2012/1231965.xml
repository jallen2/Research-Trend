    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to identify magnetic geometries with ?constant? distribution of magnetic flux, and to demonstrate magnetic components with energy density 30%-50% higher than state of the art. The approach is organized into three tasks: Synthesis of Constant-Flux Magnetic Geometries, Electro-Magnetic Modeling, and Broader Impact. Inductors with multiple windings will be identified based on synthesis factors, and verified by finite-element simulation. Practical processes will be identified for manufacturing of the selected geometries. Design-oriented models will be developed for performance metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;At least 30% of the volume in commercial inductors stores no or negligible energy. The ?constant-flux? concept improves energy density by filling the available volume with as much magnetic (core) materials as practically feasible, then dispersing the windings to shape the distribution of magnetic flux, e.g., to distribute magnetic flux uniformly. Guiding principles will be developed from the structural and field standpoints to realize the constant-flux concept. Performance metrics, such as inductances, capacitances, and quality factor will be modeled, quantified, and compared with the corresponding benchmarks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;Demo modules will be developed for rising junior and senior high-school girls who participate in a summer camp called C-Tech2 (Computer and Technology and Virginia Tech) to develop and sustain the students? interest in engineering and sciences. Through an interdisciplinary program called Scieneering, sophomore and junior Scieneers will be selected to execute part of the research plan. Industry mentors will be invited to help establishing a path to commercialization.</AbstractNarration>
