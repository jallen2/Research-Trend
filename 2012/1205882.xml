    <AbstractNarration>Gravitational waves are a straightforward but profound prediction of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. They have never been directly measured, but the ripples in space time produced by distant violent astrophysical events will soon be detectable by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), with detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington. LIGO's detectors use precision laser interferometry to measure the relative motion of exquisitely isolated test mass mirrors due to the extremely small fluctuations in the difference of the 4km-arm lengths. Louisiana State University (LSU) is located approximately 40 km from LIGO Livingston (LLO) and has a long-term collaborative relationship with LIGO as a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), an international group of hundreds of scientists researching the technology for gravitational wave detectors and analyzing the data taken with LIGO detectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the LSU group will be used to allow the PI to fulfill her duties as the elected spokesperson of the LSC; to characterize data from the subsystems of Advanced LIGO detectors as they are installed, allowing the improvement of the data quality and astrophysical reach of the detectors; and to research ways to improve the calibration methods used for the Advanced LIGO detectors. In addition to advancing the science reach of Advanced LIGO detectors, the award will develop scientific human resources (graduate students and postdocs). Moreover, the members of the LSU group supported by this award will disseminate the results of their research to the general public and work to increase the participation of under-represented minorities in scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
