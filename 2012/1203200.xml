    <AbstractNarration>Despite an optimistic outlook for professional employment in the field of water and waste water supply and treatment, industry experts report there are not enough trained workers to fill positions in the Inland Empire, a region of Southern California comprising San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. Encompassing five objectives, this project is advancing water and waste water supply technical training, initiating regional coalition building, and preparing students to meet existing employer requirements for trained technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to:&lt;br/&gt;1: Enhance and expand the Water Supply Technology (WST) curriculum to include innovative courses that align with industry standards and provide up-to-date technical education. &lt;br/&gt;2: Form the Inland Empire Water Consortium by bringing together water suppliers, water agencies, and wastewater treatment facilities to offer internships and job opportunities, and assist with providing funding to prepare low-income students. &lt;br/&gt;3: Expand the internship program of the college by offering at least 20 new internships. &lt;br/&gt;4: Conduct outreach to increase the demographics of women and minority students employed in the water and wastewater industry. &lt;br/&gt;5: Evaluate and disseminate project outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The limited supply of water as a result of population growth, pollution, and global warming has become not only a national, but a global issue. This project aims to serve as a national model that can be replicated in other regions of the United States, particularly in regions where water is becoming scarce. The WST Program at the college has been offered for more than 30 years, and the department estimates that more than 80% of the workforce in the water industry for the surrounding area has been trained through the program. To meet demand, the curriculum has been expanded from eight courses to 20 courses over the last six years. By developing curriculum which incorporates the latest technology and industry standards, the college is leading the way for young students and workers seeking retraining to enter a growing job market and developing a program that sets a standard for WST programs that can be adopted across the nation. Through this project, students receive a two-year degree and obtain state certifications and work experience required for employment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is a collaborative effort among industry, educational institutions, and government agencies. Thus far, the project has secured support from 20 agencies whose representatives currently serve on the Advisory Board. These agencies include the Metropolitan Water District, the largest water supplier in southern California. The Inland Empire Water Consortium is being built through a model that is designed to track student program completion and employment. The expanded curriculum meets a need for training that has been requested by industry representatives to advance the skill sets of technicians to meet emerging industry trends, such as increasing requests for water audits and expertise in reducing outdoor water usage. This project is also contributing to a knowledge base of what factors and program components best support the participation and retention of women and minorities in the sciences. Dissemination is through a consortium Web site, a curriculum guide, a published project evaluation, and workforce development reports.</AbstractNarration>
