    <AbstractNarration>Crabs, lobsters, and shrimp are ecologically and economically important crustaceans in marine environments. The hard, calcified shell provides protection and support, but restricts growth. As a result, these animals must periodically shed the shell, a process called molting. Upon molting, animals stretch the new shell before it hardens, providing more space for tissue growth. The entire process is controlled by molting hormone produced by a pair of molting glands. Little is known about the signaling genes that control the molting gland, in particular the genes required for committing the animal to molt. This "point of no return" decision is critical for survival and growth in all crustaceans. The research supported by this award will address the question: "What are the endocrine and molecular mechanisms controlling molting in crustaceans?" The studies will focus on the roles of the molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH), a global translation regulator called mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), and a number of growth factor signaling pathways that mediate critical transitions in molting gland physiological states. The project involves a team of investigators from four universities using state-of-art DNA sequencing technologies to create a complete catalog of all the genes expressed in the molting gland, and physiologic assessment of the molting process. The research will identify genes essential for the activation of the molting gland and its regulation, both positive and negative, by environmental signals. The broader impacts of the award will include both educational, and resource benefits. The project will train 1 postdoc, 4 graduate students, and 6-8 undergraduates in molecular biological and biochemical techniques, as well as provide summer research experiences for 3 underrepresented ethnic minority undergraduate students. The results of the research will be compiled into a database that will be a valuable resource for researchers to manage fisheries, develop effective aquaculture practices, and mitigate the harmful effects of pollutants and climate change. Other results from the project will be disseminated through a symposium/special session at the 2015 SICB meeting, a public display at Bodega Marine Lab, a K-12 outreach program, and publication in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
