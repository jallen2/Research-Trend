    <AbstractNarration>The Moab Topology Conference will be held May 30 to June 1, 2012. This will be the second topology conference held in Moab, Utah. The focus of the conference will be on geometric and quantum topology. In recent years, these two areas have experienced increasing overlap, and topological quantum field theory predicts that many invariants in quantum topology are closely related to geometric counterparts. For example, the volume conjecture of R. Kashaev, H. Murakami, and J. Murakami asserts that the volume of a hyperbolic knot is determined by asymptotics of colored Jones polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will further advance the development of these subjects, as follows. First, it will provide opportunities for those conducting cutting-edge research in both fields to present their results. Second, to provide background and training, excellent expositors in the two areas will offer introductory talks. And third, the conference will provide a venue for discussion and collaboration among established researchers and junior mathematicians in both fields. Participants will include many graduate students and early career mathematicians, as well as mathematicians from underrepresented groups.
