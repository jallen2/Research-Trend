    <AbstractNarration>MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) transistors, being on/off switches, have served as an ideal match to the abstractions of switching functions and Boolean logic, which (together with von Neumann architecture) form the underpinnings of modern computing. While current computing platforms are well-suited to applications that involve arithmetic computations and storing and retrieving large amounts of data, they are known to be highly inefficient - requiring orders of magnitude more energy consumption - for performing tasks that humans routinely perform, such as visual recognition, semantic analysis, and reasoning. The key insight behind the proposed research is that emerging spin torque based devices make it possible to realize the neuron functionality in a highly energy efficient manner, well beyond the capabilities of CMOS (complementary MOS). This is due to two factors - the inherent match between the characteristics of these devices and the functionality of a neuron (leading to a drastic decrease in the number of devices required), and the possibility of ultra-low voltage operation (~20mV). Inspired by this vision, the PIs (principal investigators) propose a research program that spans from devices to architectures to investigate spin-based neuromorphic computing. The goals of the proposed research are to (i) establish the benefits of spin-based device technologies for neuromorphic computing (where CMOS implementations are energy-inefficient), (ii) synergistically explore spin devices, circuits and architecture in a regime where these devices are integrated with CMOS to augment its capabilities and (iii) incorporate the findings from the proposed research in education and outreach programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will leverage outreach programs at Purdue, including the outreach program at NCN (Network for Computational Nanotechnology), and the Women and Minority in Engineering programs in the College of Engineering, to involve undergraduates and minority students in the proposed research. The PIs will develop a summer REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program that builds on their prior experience in integrating undergraduate students into their research groups. The broad nature of the proposed project provides an attractive opportunity for undergraduate students to not only explore novel research, but also get exposed to the emerging fields of spintronics and neuromorphic computing. The project will also establish research, mentoring and education partnerships with primarily undergraduate and minority serving institutions.</AbstractNarration>
