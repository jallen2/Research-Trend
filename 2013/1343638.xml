    <AbstractNarration>1343638 - Keller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sustainable Nanotechnology Conference will be held in November 3 - 5, 2013 in Santa Barbara,California, supported in part by National Science Foundation resources. The 2013 conference will build on the previous year's focus on lifecycle assessment, green synthesis, green energy, industrial partnerships, and environmental and biological fate, and will include additional emphasis on economic and societal aspects of nanotechnology. In particular, sessions on Sustainable Manufacturing, Tools for Achieving Sustainable Nanotechnology, Nano-economics, and Nano science and engineering in agriculture and food systems will serve to provide more emphasis to these aspects of sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central objective of this conference is to bring together scientific experts from academia, industries, and government agencies from around the world to present and discuss current findings on the subject of sustainability of nanotechnology. The Sustainable Nanotechnology Conference will be held in November 3 - 5, 2013 in Santa Barbara, California. Sustainable development has been defined as the balance of economic success, environmental protection and social responsibility. Sustainable nanotechnology strives to ensure that industrial growth is sustainable while maximizing benefits and societal acceptance. The current challenge, however, is that many existing nanotechnologies are not sustainable on account of their dependence on large quantities of energy, water, and solvents. In addition to being excessively resource and energy intensive, some existing nanomanufacturing processes utilize non-renewable materials, and their impacts on human health are not clearly understood. The conference program will address the critical aspects of sustainable nanotechnology such as life cycle assessment, green syn thesis, green energy, industrial partnership, environmental and biological fate, the economic and societal aspects of nanotechnology, and the overall sustainability of engineered nanomaterials. The conference will also foster new collaboration between academic and industrial participants. This community of users, researchers and developers of engineered nanomaterials will provide a long-term, scientific assessment of where the science is for sustainable nanotechnology, where it should be heading, and what steps academics, government agencies, and others can take now to reach targeted goals. The 2013 SNO Conference will build on the previous year's focus on lifecycle assessment, green synthesis, green energy, industrial partnerships, and environmental and biological fate, and will include additional emphasis on economic and societal aspects of nanotechnology. In particular, sessions on Sustainable Manufacturing, Tools for Achieving Sustainable Nanotechnology, Nano-economics, and Nano science and engineering in agriculture and food systems will serve to provide more emphasis to these aspects of sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sustainable nanotechnology conference will draw attention to the use of nanomaterials to alleviate adverse consequences from the greenhouse effect, exhaustion or abundance of natural resources, and environmental impacts due to the use of non-decomposable materials/composites. It is anticipated that 200-250 industrial partners, materials scientists, government stakeholders, physical and social scientists, engineers, and toxicologists, will participate. The relatively small group of participants will be ideal to promote vigorous discussion and an interchange of ideas. The conference will attract at least 25 participants who are junior scholars (doctoral and postdoctoral students). Thus, the conference will provide networking opportunities for scientists at different career stages. The two and half day schedule will foster interactions between young investigators and more established researchers. The SNO Conference is of particular importance to new investigators as there are few if any similar conferences that address the broad topic of Sustainable Nanotechnology. In addition, several scientists from underrepresented groups in science will play key roles in the conference. Participants of the Sustainable Nanotechnology conference will come from not only the US but around the globe, ensuring a diverse and expert group to facilitate stimulating discussions.</AbstractNarration>
