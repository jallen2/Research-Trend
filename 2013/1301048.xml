    <AbstractNarration>The role of inorganic geopolymer technology in sustainable development has recently been manifested in a great number of research activities and publications. To date, a wide array of viable applications of geopolymer has been explored, some of which have been demonstrated in field pilot projects. Yet, its potential applications in geotechnical engineering, particularly as a cementitious material for soil improvement, have rarely been studied. Collaborative research under this award will fill this gap, by exploring geopolymer as the next generation soil stabilizer for geotechnical applications. The research program includes: (1) studying the viability of geopolymers for soil improvement, and (2) revealing the fundamental science on the nanoscale geopolymer-clay interactions and hence the soil cementation and stabilization mechanisms. This study will also create the enabling knowledge on multiscale chemo-microstructural-mechanical modeling of geopolymer-improved soils. Integrated experimental and computational work, consisting of materials synthesis and processing, microstructural characterization, multiscale mechanical testing, molecular simulations, and multiscale modeling, will be conducted to achieve the aforementioned goal so that the emerging geopolymer technology can be exploited by geotechnical engineers for sustainable construction. This study is potentially transformative by introducing an innovative, "green" cementitious material to geotechnical engineering research and practice, with the potential to evolve into a series of new technological and economic advancements. Successful completion of the project will further advance currently ongoing worldwide efforts in sustainable infrastructure construction, environmental protection, and energy conservation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this study is expected to result in benefits to diverse industries such as infrastructure materials and construction, energy conservation, waste utilization and reduction, and environmental protection, because geopolymer is regarded as a "green," energy- and environment-friendly material. This study also tackles a combination of global sustainability issues (e.g., CO2 emission, energy conservation, and environmental protection), and hence is expected to generate significant technological, environmental, and economic impacts. Concurrent education and outreach activities will be integrated into the research to disseminate knowledge, provide training, and facilitate technology transfer. First, outreach will be achieved by high school visits, presentations, attending science fairs/symposia, and other special "MA-Strive" and "La-STEM" programs to attract more students to STEM. Second, undergraduate and graduate training and mentoring are an integrated part of this research, with particular emphasis on women, minority, and/or disadvantaged students. Third, the project's impact will be extended, via meetings and conferences, to engineers in private industries and state agencies through proactive participation in local engineering societies' activities, and prompt dissemination of research findings.</AbstractNarration>
