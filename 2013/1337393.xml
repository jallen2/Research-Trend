    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to devise novel methodologies and&lt;br/&gt;devices for problems in computational science and engineering that&lt;br/&gt;require high-intensity of arithmetic operations (also known as&lt;br/&gt;Floating-point Operations Per Second, or ``FLOPS''). Among the many&lt;br/&gt;hurdles faced in research and development of such compute-intensive&lt;br/&gt;technologies is achieving energy-efficient utilization of the&lt;br/&gt;available computing resources. Similar to the miles/gallon metric used&lt;br/&gt;in automotive design, one is interested in a metric that can be used&lt;br/&gt;in the design of new computing technologies: optimizing&lt;br/&gt;FLOPS/watt. This research will be on designing novel algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;architectures that optimize this metric. These algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;architectures will be customized to a particular class of scientific&lt;br/&gt;computing problems: tree-based finite element methods and N-body&lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is possible to devise algorithms that parallelize well and are &lt;br/&gt;energy efficient (i.e., produce high ``percentage-of-peak''&lt;br/&gt;measurements). Often, however, such algorithms sacrifice work&lt;br/&gt;optimality. It is much more difficult to design algorithms that do so&lt;br/&gt;while achieving both work optimality and energy efficiency. This&lt;br/&gt;on-node utilization wall---a chronic problem since the early&lt;br/&gt;nineties---not only remains unresolved but has become more acute with&lt;br/&gt;the emergence of deeper memory hierarchies and manycore and&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous architectures. At the same time, there is a large&lt;br/&gt;untapped potential by not only adapting algorithms to architectural&lt;br/&gt;changes, but instead driving architecture design from algorithm&lt;br/&gt;requirements. This research will identify the design space for&lt;br/&gt;tree-based algorithms (under the constraints of work-optimality and&lt;br/&gt;maximum concurrency), evaluate performance of state-of-the-art codes,&lt;br/&gt;and explore custom algorithm/hardware platforms. A number of broader&lt;br/&gt;impacts are anticipated from this project. The target methodologies&lt;br/&gt;find applications in earth sciences, engineering, cosmology, biology,&lt;br/&gt;and data analysis. Along with the research activities, an educational&lt;br/&gt;and dissemination program will be designed to communicate the results&lt;br/&gt;of this work to both students and researchers, as well as a more&lt;br/&gt;general audience of computational and application scientists.</AbstractNarration>
