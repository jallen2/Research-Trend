    <AbstractNarration>This REU site will actively involve students in all phases of exciting, applied geophysical research using modern field equipment and computer processing/interpretation tools. The program will begin with learning some advanced geophysical theory and applications through lectures, discussions and demonstrations, and scientific research practices. These activities will be followed by data collection in the field, data analysis/processing, and modeling/interpretation. Students will work with faculty, teaching assistants, and industry experts in geophysical surveys such as seismic reflection and refraction, gravity, magnetics, temperature logging (geothermal studies), and electromagnetics. Each student will also complete data processing, interpretation and modeling of a selected geophysical data set and makes reports (oral and written) on their research and results. Additional research experience is included in a follow-up workshop in January. Typically, more than half of the REU students will also supported, for professional development, to attend a scientific to present their results in a poster or oral presentation. The REU site will engage up to 12 rising seniors in a 4-week field research experience, followed by a 1-week data modeling effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geophysical research for this year will include our basin-scale studies of the Rio Grande rift (RGR) area and archaeological geophysics studies of the San Marcos Pueblo site where we have been collecting and interpreting data for several years. The basin-scale geophysical work in 2014 will extend an existing SAGE RGR transect to the West into the deepest part of the Santo Domingo basin of the RGR. The profile is just west of the Santo Domingo Pueblo. We will be working on Pueblo land and will have some Santo Domingo Pueblo students (and most likely some Cochiti Pueblo students - for a total of six Pueblo students) participating in seven days of the REU program to provide them with and introduction to the geology of the RGR and New Mexico and introduce them to geophysical and geological field work and methods. The 2014 field area and geophysical research will also target geothermal exploration through temperature logging and analysis. Our profile is in an area of thick tertiary sediments that are likely to have low thermal conductivity that could cause temperature anomalies. The profile is also immediately adjacent to an area of young volcanic centers so we will have some interesting geothermal data to interpret and compare with our other geophysical results. This project is supported in collaboration with the Department of Energy, Office of Geothermal Technologies Program.</AbstractNarration>
