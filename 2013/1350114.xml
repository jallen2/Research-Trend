    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: Nano Electro Mechanical Resonant Sensing Platform for Chip Scale, High Resolution and Ultra-Fast Terahertz Spectroscopy and Imaging &lt;br/&gt;Matteo Rinaldi, Northeastern University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Terahertz (THz) radiation, which lies in the frequency gap between infrared and microwaves, has remarkable potential for diagnostic and imaging applications, among many others. However, inherent technological limitations drastically limit THz generation and detection, a fundamental challenge known as the "THz gap". The objective of this CAREER proposal is to develop a groundbreaking long-range, integrated research and educational program focused on the investigation of new approaches to chip-scale, high-resolution, ultra-fast THz spectroscopy using a new generation of Nano-Electro-Mechanical System (NEMS) devices. The proposed research and educational program will enable the realization of a new class of high performance NEMS resonant THz detectors based on the integration and co-design of advanced piezoelectric nanostructures and photonic metamaterials. This project will address the following: (1) Investigation of innovative efficient piezoelectric transduction of high-frequency bulk acoustic modes of vibration in suspended nano-plates with strong and spectrally selective absorption characteristics to THz radiation. (2) Exploration of the thermal detection capabilities of such piezoelectric resonant nano-plates. (3) Investigation of innovative and advanced NEMS structures based on the integration of metamaterial THz absorbers with Aluminum Nitride (AlN) Nano-Plate Resonators to enable the implementation of a set of spectrally selective THz NEMS resonant detectors that can potentially cover the entire THz spectrum of interest. (4) System-level implementations of chip-scale sensing platforms for THz spectroscopy and imaging through fundamental innovation in wafer level packaging, circuit design and differential measurement techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This long-range integrated research and educational program will lead to a transformative NEMS THz detector technology that will enable the use of THz technologies in a wide variety of applications that could significantly impact the quality of life in different aspects, such as health, security and sustainability. Simultaneously, the proposed program will educate a cadre of experts needed for a full exploitation of these new THz technologies. The following goals will be targeted through outreach, education and technology transfer: (1) Bringing awareness to K-12 and undergraduate students, in collaboration with The Center for STEM Education at Northeastern University, with the integration of "NanoTech Units" into existing summer programs in which students will interact closely with the Principle Investigator (PI) and his graduate research assistants. (2) Hands-on demonstrations at large public venues. (3) Results dissemination through strategic use of online resources. (4) Education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in collaboration with industrial partners on the "Northeastern University Cooperative Education" basis in order to help the students developing the knowledge, awareness, perspective, and confidence necessary to bridge academic research and market needs. (5) Graduate and undergraduate courses development, including topics relevant to the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>
