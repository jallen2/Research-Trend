    <AbstractNarration>Human society is faced with an increasing number of problems including&lt;br/&gt;stubborn diseases and international security/climate threats. The&lt;br/&gt;computer simulations and advanced data management methods necessary to&lt;br/&gt;solving these societal problems can only be realized through increased&lt;br/&gt;use of parallel computing at all system scales, including desktops,&lt;br/&gt;servers and the cloud. Efficient large-scale parallel computing&lt;br/&gt;however requires advanced parallel programming methods. Such methods,&lt;br/&gt;unfortunately, have a greater proclivity for software bugs that&lt;br/&gt;increase cost through lost cycles on super-computers and these same&lt;br/&gt;bugs undermine confidence in simulation results. This research&lt;br/&gt;addresses the challenge of developing parallel computing software by&lt;br/&gt;creating new scalable methods to support advanced parallel programming&lt;br/&gt;models that provide rigorous guarantees on program correctness. The&lt;br/&gt;societal impacts of this work stem from increasing reliability of&lt;br/&gt;software powering the national infrastructure, advanced educational&lt;br/&gt;methods to train future generations, and pedagogical material in the&lt;br/&gt;form of course notes and software for broad dissemination. It also&lt;br/&gt;helps maintain the United States in a leadership situation with&lt;br/&gt;respect to the available talent pool in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Providing rigorous guarantees on correctness of existing parallel&lt;br/&gt;computing software requires that two classes of methods be developed,&lt;br/&gt;evaluated, and taught widely: scalable code-level (static) checking&lt;br/&gt;methods, and downstream detailed (dynamic) checking methods. This&lt;br/&gt;project develops these novel and much-needed correctness checking&lt;br/&gt;methods around the Habanero Java programming and compilation&lt;br/&gt;system. The research is to augment the system with correctness&lt;br/&gt;obligations emitted during compilation and checked at all later stages&lt;br/&gt;of translation and deployment. A key highlight of the project's&lt;br/&gt;approach is that it allows some of the correctness obligations to be&lt;br/&gt;checked statically in the context of safe subsets of Habanero Java.&lt;br/&gt;Obligations that are not able to be statically checked, especially for&lt;br/&gt;larger subsets of the Habanero language, are marked for checking&lt;br/&gt;dynamically through novel active-testing methods. An Operational&lt;br/&gt;Semantics written in the Coq notation lends cohesion to the work by&lt;br/&gt;ensuring that the division of correctness checking between static and&lt;br/&gt;dynamic techniques is sound. In summary, this research helps advance&lt;br/&gt;the science of parallel programming in terms of rigorous correctness&lt;br/&gt;checking methods, while at the same time contributing to the broad&lt;br/&gt;practice of programming at all scales from desktop to cloud&lt;br/&gt;computing and high-end scientific simulations.</AbstractNarration>
