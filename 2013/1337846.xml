    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to Northern Kentucky University (NKU) for the acquisition of field-portable x- ray fluorescence (XRF) technology for undergraduate research and education. XRF technology will advance and broaden socio-ecological teaching and research at NKU. Specifically, XRF will be used to analyze soil lead concentrations in Cincinnati, OH in order to better understand potential tradeoffs with urban gardening activities and learn how information about the landscape can be used to predict areas of elevated lead. Understanding the distribution of a critical urban pollutant will improve our understanding of the important link between urban structure and function, advancing urban ecological theory. In addition, data and predictive models of lead distribution will be shared with community partners and local health agencies to inform the design of safe urban gardens and protect human populations from lead exposure. XRF will advance ongoing projects on plant and microbe community effects on ecosystem processes. This research will deepen our understanding of ecosystem processes by examining linked biogeochemical cycles, specifically the role of heavy metal dynamics in structuring aquatic ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental data, including heavy metal and nutrient content of soil and sediment samples will be collected, analyzed, and archived by undergraduate students through existing and newly developed courses in NKU's Environmental Science Program. Data will be used in introductory courses to teach basic concepts of data analysis and in upper level courses to teach concepts of sample design and data collection. XRF technology enhances infrastructure for mentoring students in both education and research. Acquisition of XRF technology strengthens NKU's mission to provide undergraduate students with valuable research experience that expands future career options. Undergraduate students and the surrounding community will benefit from a greater understanding of coupled human-environment interactions that drive the spatial distribution of heavy metals in urban soils.</AbstractNarration>
