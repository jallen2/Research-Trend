    <AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research and thereby the students to culturally and geographically relevant research is an important step in producing retained students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sisseton Wahpeton College (SWC) will implement an associate of arts degree in the behaviorial sciences. This degree program will incorporate research in the development of the curricula and as a component of the educational experiences for students. Core research concepts such as data collection and analysis, evidentiary standards, ethics, technical writing skills, and critical thinking will be integrated throughout the curriculum by the utilization of course modules. These modules will be designed to expose students to authentic research activities in the behavioral sciences. By utilizing this design all students, even those enrolled in introductory courses, will have the experience of employing research methods. The program being proposed will include a wide range of disciplines within the behavioral sciences. The design provides students with a strong foundation in the field, which allows for more options as they pursue baccalaureate degrees at other institutions. SWC and its university partners are committed to the creation of program-to-program articulation agreements and enhancing student support services for matriculating students into baccalaureate degree programs. With this focus on transfers to other universities, the project will examine the following research question: Are completion rates higher for American Indian students that begin at a tribal college than those who begin at a mainstream college? Additionally, the project evaluation plan will provide insight into effective strategies for community colleges that seek to strengthen instructional capacity in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
