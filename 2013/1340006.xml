    <AbstractNarration>The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), in partnership with the New York City Department of Education, the New Teacher Center (NTC), and the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research is extending its Masters of Arts in Teaching Residency program with specialization in Secondary Earth Science (AMNH MAT). The only informal science education institution to offer a master's program leading to certification in teaching, the Museum is moving to institutionalize this pioneering approach to the preparation, induction, and retention of STEM teachers. This five-year NSF Teaching Fellows project helps address the documented shortage of Earth science teachers in NYC by supporting a cohort of 15 teacher candidates as they complete a master's degree in education and begin their teaching careers. The 36-credit, 15-month MAT program, led by a team of education and science faculty, includes two five-month teaching residencies in NYC high-need schools that involve both ELL and special needs rotations. Teaching Fellows receive mentoring, both from residency school teachers and Museum educators. The program also includes a six-week summer residency at the Museum teaching NYC students in the Museum's education programs, and a six-week summer science practicum with Museum scientific staff and postdoctoral fellows. After completing their MAT degree, Teaching Fellows complete four years of teaching in high-need schools, receiving two years of induction support that includes online mentoring through the NTC's e-Mentoring for Student Success (eMSS) and New Teacher Academy sessions at the Museum followed by two years of additional professional development support provided by the Museum's Gottesman Center for Science Teaching and Learning. AMNH is recruiting Fellows through broad outreach to geoscience majors while also seeking career changers and individuals of diverse backgrounds. In preparing teacher candidates for certification and developing effective teachers, the project is advancing knowledge in the field of STEM teacher preparation and retention. The AMNH MAT model focuses on clinically-rich museum and school-based residency experiences that are central to preparing teachers combined with extensive mentoring during the first two years of teaching, which are critical toward supporting retention efforts. The project also involves opportunities for scientific research, access to scientific collections and halls, and ongoing professional development opportunities after induction. The results provide evidence for assessing and designing programs drawing on the AMNH MAT model and lessons learned from supporting new teachers during their first years of teaching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project presents a new approach to STEM teacher preparation that leverages the unique strengths and resources of an informal science education (ISE) institution. The project demonstrates the potential of ISEs nationwide to help address the nation's critical need for qualified STEM teachers and to contribute more broadly to reform by strengthening the formal role of science-based cultural institutions in science education. It presents an important model of science and education faculty cooperating in program delivery and for ISE-non-profit teacher preparation and retention partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
