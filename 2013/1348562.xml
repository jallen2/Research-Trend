    <AbstractNarration>1348562&lt;br/&gt;Aggarwal&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is expected to have impact on not only the research direction, but also the awareness that knowledge exists and is being developed to sustain our energy use, particularly related to the combustion processes. The location for the workshop has been chosen to be in India with two chief goals in mind. First, to foster the international collaboration in solving the world?s energy needs and concerns, which falls within NSF?s mission. Secondly, India is a fast developing economy, where the need and consumption is expected to grow rapidly. While more than 70% of the world?s energy is delivered by combustion process and while US and India are major, populous countries in the world , both countries face and should combat the issues and needs for the sustainability of future energy use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned workshop will provide a forum for the dissemination of knowledge and exchanges of ideas, challenges and opportunities in the new emerging technologies for distributed combustion (high temperature air combustion, homogeneous charged compression ignition (HCCI) engine combustion, mathematical modeling, micro-combustion, thermal management, advanced&lt;br/&gt;laser diagnostics and combustion control. The challenges posed by the new low grade fuels and advances in renewable energy and clean combustion technologies can bring together sound contribution from collective interaction amongst researchers from academia, industries, research institutions and government labs. The goal is to develop some guidelines and priorities for near and far term goals in the above areas with identified future research activities that can benefit the broader combustion community.</AbstractNarration>
