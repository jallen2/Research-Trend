    <AbstractNarration>2013 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium&lt;br/&gt;Student Awards Support Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2013 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Radio and Wireless Week (RWW), hosts five conferences that focus on wireless components, circuits and systems. Four IEEE societies sponsor (1) The 13th Topical Meeting on Silicon Monolithic Integrated Circuits in RF Systems (SiRF); (2) The Power Amplifiers for Radio and Wireless Applications (PAWR) Conference; (3) The Wireless Sensors and Sensor Networks (WiSNet) Conference; (4) The Biomedical Wireless Technologies, Networks, and Sensing Systems (BioWireleSS) Conference; and (5) The Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS). Each meeting is co-located at the same venue and allows technologists to network on recent advancements. Specific topical areas are addressed in the individual meetings but the co-located venue allows for interaction across multiple areas. Each of the five conferences selects finalists from the accepted student author submissions to compete in student poster competitions. The students are judged by their technical program committee in five different categories: novelty of paper, quality of poster, quantity of information presented, preparedness of the presenter, and interest to the RWW community. This proposal is written to request funds to support prizes for the individual student competitions. Up to 25 finalists will present their work in a special poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research involves the gathering of academic and industrial specialists within an intimate venue to discuss the current and future trends of wireless technology for applications of national and international interest. The five conferences focus on circuits and systems for advanced biomedical applications and sensor systems with special emphasis on power amplifiers and silicon technologies. Each year 400 attendees from academia and industry participate in these meetings. Peer-reviewed oral and poster presentations will be made along with IEEE Distinguished Lecturer talks given within the four-day meeting. The most recent results from RF to terahertz frequencies will be discussed and four high-impact workshops will be given at the start of the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal include the opportunity to highlight quality student research being pursued at US and International Universities. Students gain technical experience by presenting their research in a friendly poster competition environment. This opportunity supports the STEM pipeline by identifying young engineers and scientists and encouraging them to continue working in this highly technical field. The student finalists and winners will be recognized at the annual awards banquet.</AbstractNarration>
