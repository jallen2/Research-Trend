    <AbstractNarration>Explosive growth in data volume, heterogeneity, and complexity imposes unprecedented challenges in data analysis and organization in data centers. RAID particularly XOR-based RAID plays an important role to provide both reliability and high performance storage services for these data centers. However, they suffer from problems on the scalability issue due to multi-folded factors, including: heterogeneous RAID layouts and various erasure codes, high overhead of existing scaling process to significantly downgrade the storage performance, and lack of bidirectional scaling support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to address the scalability challenge for storage systems in large data centers. This project designs novel techniques to exploit XOR-based parity codes to achieve efficient scaling, develops a series of scalable XOR-based erasure codes to bridge the relations among heterogeneous RAID forms for interoperability, and integrates various erasure codes in a framework to provide a unified user interface for RAID scaling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will facilitate the storage systems to effectively tackle the scalability challenge in large data centers. It cohesively investigates how to utilize and integrate proper RAID scaling technologies to improve the scalability of storage systems. This project will yield fundamental contributions to research on efficient big data management in high-performance data centers, and greatly contribute to enabling high-performance computing systems to stay on track of their historic scaling, and hence benefit numerous real-life data-intensive applications such as biology, chemistry, earth science, health care, and so on.</AbstractNarration>
