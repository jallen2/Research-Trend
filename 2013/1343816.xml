    <AbstractNarration>EarthCube Building Blocks: Community Inventory of EarthCube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability&lt;br/&gt;(CINERGI) Collaborating Institutions: University of California San Diego, Arizona Geological&lt;br/&gt;Survey, University of Chicago, Columbia University, The Open Geospatial Consortium This building&lt;br/&gt;block project focuses on constructing a community inventory and knowledgebase on geoscience&lt;br/&gt;information resources to extend work on interoperability-readiness and meet the challenge of finding resources across&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, assessing their fitness for use in specific research scenarios, and providing&lt;br/&gt;tools for integrating and re-using data from multiple domains. This capability is a key EarthCube&lt;br/&gt;mission mentioned in reports of several EarthCube domain workshops and roadmaps. We envision&lt;br/&gt;a comprehensive system linking geoscience resources, users, publications, usage information,&lt;br/&gt;and cyberinfrastructure (CI) components. It will supplement information included in existing&lt;br/&gt;data discovery catalogs by integrating feedback from users on their experience with resources,&lt;br/&gt;by providing characterization of resources in an interoperability assessment framework, and&lt;br/&gt;by supporting registration of mappings between information models and vocabularies to assist&lt;br/&gt;data integration. To assess interoperability among components an open source validation mechanism&lt;br/&gt;will be implemented. The system will enable community input and access by geoscientists via&lt;br/&gt;online user interfaces, and will provide documented web service APIs so that inventory information&lt;br/&gt;can be easily browsed, analyzed, and integrated within the emerging EarthCube CI. The project&lt;br/&gt;team will collaborate with related EarthCube efforts, including Building Blocks, RCNs, domain&lt;br/&gt;workshop and the Test Enterprise Governance. The PIs will work with researchers from selected geoscience domains&lt;br/&gt;(stratigraphy, hydrology, critical zone science) to validate and demonstrate advanced features&lt;br/&gt;of CINERGI in specific research context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CINERGI is a direct response to the communitys need for easy discovery, assessment, and utilization&lt;br/&gt;of CI resources, expressed by many EarthCube stakeholders. It is a fundamental building block&lt;br/&gt;of an Earth Science CI and will serve geoscientists across all domains to efficiently and&lt;br/&gt;in more informed manner use existing and emerging resources for productive and transformative&lt;br/&gt;research. It will also help CI experts and computer scientists to align new developments better&lt;br/&gt;with existing resources such as vocabularies, ontologies, data exchange protocols, or metadata&lt;br/&gt;schemas.</AbstractNarration>
