    <AbstractNarration>This project is establishing a regional laser and fiber optic (LFO) technology center to serve states in the southeastern United States: Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, South Carolina, and North Carolina. It is working with a network of 10 colleges and more than 250 companies that are participating in this regional center. Goals are 1. Continue study of the specific technician needs of the laser and fiber optic industry in the southeast region and establish education programs and strategies, priorities and timelines to satisfy these needs. 2. Better define the specific area of focus for each partner college and create education programs with the college. 3. Expand the coalition of partner colleges with LFO education programs to meet industry needs. 4. Enlist faculty and industry representatives to provide advice and direction for the Center's activities. 5. Create an outreach education program for middle and high school science teachers, counselors and administrators that focuses on LFO topics in order to provide a pathway into the college LFO programs. 6. Recruit and assist returning veterans and minorities to enter LFO programs in the southeast U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The college (IRSC) has been a partner of OP-TEC, the NSF/ATE National Center for Optics and Photonics Education and has a large program. During this collaboration with OP-TEC, IRSC authored educational modules in the areas of optical imaging and solar energy technology. IRSC is also closely collaborating with Corning Fiber Optical Systems for training on the latest fiber optic technologies. Employers prefer hiring local talent because of the high turnover rate they have experienced with technicians hired from out of state. This project is working to establish additional LFO education opportunities at other colleges in the region located close to employers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Lasers and fiber optics technologies are advanced technologies enabling complex, sophisticated, and very expensive instrumentation used in the biomedical field, life sciences, remote sensing, and information technology. The United States commands global leadership in these technologies, producing high-wage jobs in the U.S. There is an urgent need to increase the number of LFO technicians to satisfy the high demand, maintain our world leadership, and create more high-paying jobs. The principal partner colleges have a proven record of operating successful LFO programs. The PIs are experienced in the field in establishing programs, working with business and industry, and developing networks of industry and college contacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The Center is collaborating with the National Center, OP-TEC, to coordinate and contribute to regional and national needs in LFO. LFO technicians' starting salaries are well above the national average, thereby elevating the graduates' economic status. The partnerships created by the educator and employer networks are having a beneficial and lasting effect not only to the local region but to the entire nation. In addition, the PI, as member of the advisory board of the Gender Equity Cooperative, is organizing events aimed at attracting more women and minorities into this program. Participating in the Veterans' Retraining Assistance Program and enrolling cohorts of veterans in LFO and Photonics program can further assist returning veterans. These continuing initiatives are being duplicated at partner colleges.</AbstractNarration>
