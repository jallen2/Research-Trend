    <AbstractNarration>1359025&lt;br/&gt;Klewicki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past decade has seen transformational advances in turbulence experimentation and simulation, and these have allowed the unprecedented capability to study the detailed temporal and spatial structure of turbulent boundary layers. Furthermore, recently developed facilities and sensors around the globe are now allowing access to turbulence structure at significantly higher Reynolds numbers than previously studied. As a result, our understanding of boundary layer dynamics is now progressing at an ever increasing pace. It is timely to review, discuss and advance beyond these developments. The proposal seeks funds to partially cover expenses related to the organization of a workshop on "High Reynolds Number Boundary Layer Turbulence: Integrating Descriptions of Statistical Structure, Scaling and Dynamical Evolution", to be held at the campus of the University of New Hampshire, from November 20-22, 2013. The workshop will be targeted specifically to high Reynolds number turbulence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Boundary layer dynamics are pervasive in numerous scientific processes and technologically important applications. For these reasons, the capacity to better predict boundary layer behavior, and especially at high Reynolds numbers, persists as a high value objective. The specific aims of this workshop are to (i) provide an interactive setting where the latest findings of this rapidly advancing field can be presented and discussed at length, and (ii) bring together the established and emerging protagonists of boundary layer research (experts in experiments, simulation and analysis) with a cadre of applied mathematicians who are leaders in advancing the systematic development of reduced order models of complex fluid flows. An overarching aim is to more deeply explore how our new and emerging understandings of boundary layer dynamics can be used to benefit the development of more accurate, computationally efficient and more well-founded models of the high Reynolds number boundary layer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Better understanding of turbulent boundary layers at very high Reynolds numbers will lead to improved understanding of a number of engineering and physics problems, such as aerospace applications, meteorology and weather prediction, pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere and in rivers and oceans, energy production with wind farms, etc. This understanding may also allow the design of fluid transportation systems or vessels that require less energy to operate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will bring together researchers who work on a number of allied problems, but, in many cases, are not yet natural collaborators. The expertise of the attendees is chosen to cover the disciplinary foci that are deemed to span the elements required to develop and refine the systematic construction of the accurate reduced order models for the high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer; a timely goal that now seems within reach. Given this, the proposed workshop will promote two primary broader impacts. The first is directed toward the formation of a research community whose members have an understanding of the full scope of elements that must rationally be understood if the envisioned modeling paradigm(s) are to be realized. The second is to initiate collaborations amongst the participants, and thus substantively promote the specific areas of inquiry required to advance reduced order model development and implementation. While there will be no formal proceedings of the workshop, the individual presentations will be collected in electronic form, and will subsequently be made available on a public website.</AbstractNarration>
