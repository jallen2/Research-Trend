    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to Santa Clara University to acquire a cutting-edge confocal microscope. Students and faculty performing research in anthropology, biology, bioengineering, and chemistry will use this confocal microscope. This microscope allows researchers to make accurate and precise measurements in three dimensions over time. This microscope enables faculty and students to collect critical scientific data that will help address core questions in molecular and developmental biology of both plants and animals. This microscope will also be used to study the interaction of certain widespread chemicals with common protein structures. The three dimensional shape of fossilized plant cells will be captured on this microscope, and that information will be used to inform models of past environments and plant evolution. Additionally this microscope will be used to study the chemistry of specific emulsions, and to help develop fluorescent proteins switches that will aid scientists in multiple fields. Overall, a broad group of university faculty members and mentored student researchers will use this microscope to study key questions in multiple areas of biology and chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Santa Clara University is a primarily undergraduate university with student learning at its central focus. The introduction of a confocal microscope to campus will greatly enhance the opportunities for students to engage in scientific inquiry, while producing useful data. SCU science graduates often go on to medical school, graduate school, and the biotech industry. The success of SCU students is attributed to the hands-on experiences they receive in the laboratory and classroom. Students will be educated to use the confocal microscope in multiple faculty research labs and in several classes. The training they receive in quantitative and fluorescence microscopy will prepare them well for careers in diverse STEM fields. The microscope will be used in an annual outreach event to attract first-generation college students to the SCU science departments. This microscope will be used to address important scientific hypothesis and to train a diverse set of students. Exposure to this microscope will leave a positive impact on students, by increasing their scientific literacy and enabling them to pursue careers in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
