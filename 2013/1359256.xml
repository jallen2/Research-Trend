    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site Program at Clarkson University is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers, and has the theme of "Advancing Sustainable Systems and Environmental Technologies to Serve Humanity" (ASSETs to Serve Humanity). Program objectives include: (1) improve educational pathways to advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers, (2) serve traditionally underrepresented students and students from colleges and universities lacking research opportunities in STEM fields, (3) develop a STEM workforce of actionable leaders on environmental sustainability, and (4) teach students to effectively communicate scientific research to shape future policy. Environmental leadership is promoted through engagement of ten or more undergraduate student participants in professional development activities and transformative research in sustainable and resilient energy and infrastructure; sensing, identifying, and mitigating emerging pollutants and other risks; and transformation of social policy and behaviors related to infrastructure, energy, and environment. Twenty faculty members of nine departments in the sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities, and economics mentor participants on a self-contained portion of a larger research project. Students are instructed on hypothesis-driven research, data analysis, and effective dissemination of research results. Students participate in research group meetings, present their work at a University-wide undergraduate research symposium, write a final report, and are encouraged to publish their work with their mentor in peer-reviewed publications. Professional development includes graduate school preparation and workshops led by faculty mentors related to sustainable energy, sustainable infrastructure, and sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental hazards. Follow-on field trips to nearby locations that tie thematically to the workshops demonstrate real-world applications. Community-building activities foster cohesiveness among students. Formative and summative assessment assures program goals are accomplished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site Program at Clarkson University is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers, and has the theme of "Advancing Sustainable Systems and Environmental Technologies to Serve Humanity" (ASSETs to Serve Humanity). Achieving environmental sustainability and resilience to changing global conditions requires technological advancement produced by globally-competent engineers and scientists capable of adapting to the challenges of environmental, social, and cultural change. Twenty faculty members of nine departments in the sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities, and economics provide integrated sustainability education, graduate training, and hands-on interdisciplinary research opportunities that spark the imaginations of young minds towards production of a STEM workforce of future engineers and actionable leaders on environmental sustainability. The ASSETs to Serve Humanity REU Site program has a proven record of full participation of women, persons with disabilities, underrepresented minorities, and high-achieving faculty mentors that understand the benefits of a diverse REU cohort. Recruitment and engagement is designed to assure continued excellence. Similarly, ASSETs to Serve Humanity REU participants have a proven record of scientific advancement reflected in peer-reviewed publications, presentations at state, national, and international conferences, research awards, and patent applications from their research at Clarkson University. Through this high degree of research dissemination, participants in the REU Site program at Clarkson University drive technological innovation needed to maintain public well-being in a more crowded and resource-limited world, and to improve the economic competitiveness of the United States. Several research projects are driven by academic-industry partnerships with goals of technological development and creation of economic opportunities and new jobs in technological fields. The information gained is transferrable towards new operations broadening the impact of these activities to society.</AbstractNarration>
