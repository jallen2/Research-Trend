    <AbstractNarration>This award provides continued support for the particle astrophysics group at the University of Chicago to participate in the operation and analysis of data from the Very Energetic Radiation- Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). VERITAS is an array of four 12-meter Cherenkov telescopes that use the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique to detect and characterize the flux of 50 Gigaelectronvolt (GeV) to 50 Teraelectronvolt (TeV) photons from astrophysical sources. The VERITAS project has been very successful over the past few years of operations providing important measurements of high-energy emission from supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, gamma-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei. A recently completed upgrade, which updates the telescope cameras and trigger systems, should lead to even greater sensitivity and promises to further accelerate the scientific output of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Chicago group has been a key participant in the VERITAS project since its inception. From design and construction to commissioning and operation and now to analysis and interpretation, Chicago has assumed leadership roles in all aspects of VERITAS. The specific scientific interests of the group involve the study of Galactic sources, including supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as more general questions in particle astrophysics. In addition, the group will work to develop new hardware and technologies suitable for use in the next generation of ground-based TeV gamma-ray observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The field of TeV astronomy has impacts on many other fields of science, from the study of the high-energy particle acceleration to fundamental physics questions such as the nature of Dark Matter. The data from VERITAS have been combined with data at other wavelengths to provide unique insights into the high-energy processes powering astrophysical objects. The VERITAS project involves both graduate and undergraduate students in significant roles. There is a strong local outreach effort at the University of Chicago, which involves a successful partnership with Adler Planetarium for producing public lectures and classes for high school teachers. Finally, the continued development of the TeVCat resource will expand the visibility of TeV astrophysics beyond the high energy gamma-ray community.</AbstractNarration>
