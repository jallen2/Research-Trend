    <AbstractNarration>PI: S.P. Dinesh-Kumar (University of California-Davis)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Robert Gilbertson, Diane Ullman, and Ilias Tagkopoulos (University of California-Davis)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomato is the second most important vegetable crop in the world. Tomato production in the US and worldwide is threatened by two devastating insect-transmitted viruses - tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). Management of these viruses is difficult and often relies heavily on the use of insecticides to control the vectors. Insecticidal control is often ineffective, has negative human health and environmental effects, and can lead to selection of insecticide-resistant forms of the vectors. In tomato, the Ty1 locus for TYLCV and the Sw5 locus for TSWV are major genetic resistance sources, and both have been introgressed into commercial tomato varieties. However, very little is known about the mechanisms involved in Ty1- and Sw5-mediated resistance. This project will provide new insights into the nature of and interplay between mechanisms of plant resistance and susceptibility to infection by insect-transmitted viruses. These studies will provide insights into whether similar or different pathways are targeted by RNA (TSWV) versus DNA (TYLCV) viruses during infection and/or host defense. The project will then use the results from these studies to optimize and validate a new approach called miRNA-induced gene silencing (MIGS) that can be used to assess gene function in tomato. If successful, the outcomes of this project will likely lead to a new generation of antiviral strategies against these viruses. The project will also provide a 10-week training program every year for undergraduate students from Sacramento City College and high school students from Davis Senior High School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genetic resistance mediated by Sw5 and Ty1 loci introgressed from wild tomato relatives into cultivated tomato provides the best source of protection against TSWV and TYLCV, respectively. The investigators of this project hypothesize that Sw5- and Ty1-mediated recognition of TSWV and TYLCV trigger early and discernable transcriptional changes that involve common and specific immune signaling networks. In addition, infection of these viruses on susceptible tomato genotypes induces transcriptional changes that promote virus virulence. To gain insights into the transcriptional changes, the investigators will use RNAseq approach to identify differentially expressed transcripts during TSWV and TYLCV resistance and susceptible responses in tomato. Computational methods will be used to analyze RNASeq data to identify key common and specific genes that are differentially regulated during TSWV and TYLCV resistance and susceptible interaction. The project will optimize and validate the MIGS approach for gene function studies in transgenic tomato by targeting known candidate genes. The optimized MIGS approach will be used to evaluate function of selected differentially expressed genes during TYLCV and TSWV resistance and susceptible interactions in tomato. Results from the project will likely provide insights into designing new generation of strategies to control not only TYLCV and TSWV but also other important plant pathogens. All data and biological resources will be accessible to the public. All RNAseq data will be deposited and available through GEO. All MIGS vector and candidate target gene constructs will be available upon request and through Addgene (https://www.addgene.org/) and ABRC (http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~plantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm). Seeds from transgenic tomato lines will be available through the Tomato Genetics Resource Center at UC Davis (http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/).</AbstractNarration>
