    <AbstractNarration>This project, centered in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin (UTCS), is creating the InfoSec Scholars for Service program. Participating students join a community of scholars built around the research of the Center for Information Assurance and Security (CIAS), the rigorous coursework of the InfoSec Certificate program, and an extensive public service career development program. The InfoSec Scholars program graduates a cadre of well-trained cybersecurity professionals with preparation for success in cybersecurity jobs at public agencies; and provides UTCS with stronger ties to government entities and added educational and research options for all students. The program's goals are to 1) prepare students with the academic knowledge to be successful cybersecurity professionals, 2) provide students with the career development skills to be successful public servants, 3) increase student involvement in cybersecurity research, and 4) place 100% of program participants in summer internships and full-time jobs in cybersecurity at government agencies. The intellectual merit of the InfoSec Scholars program is the project's ability to generate further development of a community of cybersecurity scholars at a top-ten research institution and to improve cybersecurity skill sets within government agencies. The strength of the Center for Information Assurance research unit, robust undergraduate and graduate research programs, strong infrastructure in support of students' career development, and a culture of faculty and staff involvement in students' intellectual and professional growth position it to successfully implement a model SFS program. The broader impacts of the program are the development of a hub of cybersecurity education at a leading institution in an important high tech region and the creation of a model program that engages students in cybersecurity research and education. The program brings a diverse group of bright, young professionals into cybersecurity jobs in government service benefiting the Nation by strengthening the country's information security infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
