    <AbstractNarration>This award enables Villanova to purchase and further develop an interactive virtual reality system known as a System for Immersive Video Research, Immersive Learning, and Visualization Support for Research (CAVE) at Villanova University. The Falvey Memorial Library at Villanova will house the facility. CAVE technology's ability to provide immersive experiences of rendered environments is well-known. This project proposes development of a CAVE system with mobile immersive spherical video technology to capture photorealistic representations of real world environments without involved modeling. This development project has two facets. The first lies in the integration of mobile immersive spherical video camera equipment with a CAVE to display real-world environments, thereby reducing environmental modeling time. This approach will permit greater usage of CAVE technology for disseminating immersive views of significant locations or phenomena without concern for the displayed material appearing too unrealistic. The second facet is the project's visualization support for research across many domains. CAVE placement near the greater Philadelphia area will permit increased public access to the learning possibilities of the equipment, as well as support the collection and dissemination of immersive videos of culturally significant locations such as the Vatican Museum's facilities that are often not able to be visited by large crowds. Understanding how to systematically use CAVE technology in libraries has the potential to transform these institutions into social and collaborative environments, called public Collaboratories. Classrooms for CAVE use will be established.</AbstractNarration>
