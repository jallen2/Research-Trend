    <AbstractNarration>Improved forecasting of precipitation within extratropical cyclones requires continued integration of observations and models to understand the evolution and processes associated with precipitation bands. Mesoscale banding within the comma-head portion of Northeast U.S. cyclones has been documented to cause localized intense precipitation rates and amounts. The life cycle and microphysics of the primary band within the comma head in the presence of mid-level frontogenesis and reduced stability has been documented, but there has been less attention investigating storms with multiple bands. The underlying hypothesis is that many of the quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) errors associated with winter storms are the result of difficulties in models predicting these multi-bands given their smaller spatial scales, more convective characteristics, and their upscale growth to a single band.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team will integrate modeling and observational study to understand the spectrum of precipitation features within extratropical cyclones over the Northeast United States. Use ~20 years of radar data from the WSR-88Ds, several years of Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) at the major airports, upper air soundings, observations from a vertically pointing radar, a disdrometer, and Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) at Stony Brook, NY on Long Island, as well as high resolution gridded analyses and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) predictions to characterize banded precipitation and ice microphysics and to evaluate model output. The goal is to characterize band lifecycle and tracks of cells and bands around the cyclone and to quantify the importance to storm precipitation accumulation of multi-banded structures relative to other precipitation features. We will also identify what set of parameters are needed to realistically model multi-banded precipitation. Our work will address the parameterization of ice microphysics and mesoscale predictability of banded precipitation using an ensemble of historical runs and sensitivity studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Improvement in QPF during the cool season continues to lag our ability to predict the pressure and geopotential height fields within winter storms. This award will improve the understanding of the spectrum of precipitation features within the comma head of a mid-latitude cyclone by completing a comprehensive climatology of the genesis, growth, and decay of bands and cells over the Northeast U.S. region using an feature-based tracking algorithm. To date, there have also been no modeling studies using real cases focusing on the multi-band genesis and evolution around a mid-latitude cyclone, and the microphysical verification within all scales of bands has been limited. This work will provide an improved understanding of banded precipitation, which can be applied to other regions with bands within the comma head. Our ground-based microphysical work will evaluate and improve our new microphysics parameterization focusing on improving riming representation within models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Major winter storms in the northeast U.S. have wide ranging societal and economic impacts. The New York City Metropolitan Area is the home to nearly 20 million people and is a major transportation hub along the East coast. This area has been hit by several major storms in recent years (http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/html/hazards/winter_history.shtml). The results from this project will help improve existing conceptual models used by forecasters to anticipate banded precipitation within the comma head as well as to improve the QPFs within mesoscale models. Dr. Colle and Dr. Yuter will each support one graduate student per year under this award. Several undergraduate research assistants will also be trained to do data processing and analysis. Their results will be presented by the students as posters at research symposia such as the ones held by NCSU and Stony Brook each spring and summer. Results will also be disseminated in conference presentations and journal articles. Additionally, Dr. Yuter plans to present a few general audience talks about snow and winter storms at local North Carolina science museum.</AbstractNarration>
