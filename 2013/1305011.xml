    <AbstractNarration>The partnership of the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation (New Mexico AMP, Senior Alliance) represents the state's public two-year postsecondary institutions and the state-supported four year universities. New Mexico AMP?s continuing goal is to increase the quantity and quality of minority students who complete B.S. degrees and who are currently underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. Specific attention is given to ensuring these students are well prepared to enter the STEM workforce and providing then with the encouragement, incentive, and motivation to pursue graduate education. Program activities attend to individual student retention and progression as well as to understanding the aggregation of student progression to graduate school entry and promoting the replication of best practices both within New Mexico and nationally through dissemination efforts. The Project Goals are as follow: &lt;br/&gt;-Increase the number of STEM students transferring from 2-year to 4-year institutions.&lt;br/&gt;-Refine and incorporate academic, curricular, and co-curricular enrichment activities designed to increase the quality of STEM graduates and increase the motivation, performance, and progression of talented students in preparation for graduate studies.&lt;br/&gt;-Provide direct student support for academic year and summer enrichment activities.&lt;br/&gt;-Increase URM STEM graduates by 23% over the previous five-year average of 528 to 650 per year.&lt;br/&gt;-Demonstrate an increase in the progression of undergraduate students to graduate school entry.&lt;br/&gt;-Maintain and continue to build meaningful partnerships with colleges and universities, school systems, government agencies, national laboratories and centers, industry, private foundations, and STEM professional organizations to support student development and success.</AbstractNarration>
