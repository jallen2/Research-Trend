    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER grant uses a combination of laboratory studies, computer modeling, and field experiments to test the relative influence of temperature stress and energy limitation on the upper vertical limit of an intertidal barnacle (Balanus glandula). Understanding the mechanisms by which temperature limits an organism's success is critical to generating accurate predictions of the effect of climate change on biological systems. Past work in this field has emphasized the direct physiological stress of extreme temperatures, but it is unclear if such extreme conditions limit species in the wild. Alternately, animals may simply lack enough energy to defend against thermal extremes that they could otherwise tolerate. This work has three main objectives: 1) to extend an existing modeling approach in physiology (Dynamic Energy Budget) for use with intertidal species, which alternate daily between marine and terrestrial conditions, 2) to use the model, in conjunction with field experiments, to test the hypothesis that energy limitation, rather than direct thermal stress, limits the success of B. glandula in the wild; and, 3) to use field and laboratory measurements to explore how thermal tolerance and success differ between barnacle populations from California and Washington. Altogether, these projects will improve our understanding of the thermal physiology of B. glandula, specifically, and of the role of energy limitation in thermal stress, more generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated education plan of this CAREER grant contains three specific objectives: 1) to use research opportunities to attract and retain students in biology majors, 2) to improve the retention and performance of women and minority undergraduates in an introductory biology course, and 3) to improve the understanding of science by the general college population. The grant activities will include: generating new research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students, the piloting of a research experience program for sophomore-level students, the establishment of a peer-study program for students in an introductory biology course, and the development of a new course for non-science majors that emphasizes scientific literacy. The educational effectiveness of these programs will be rigorously tested and the results will inform the future teaching activities of the PI, her department, and the greater academic science community. The broader impacts of this CAREER grant will be 1) broadening the participation of women and under-represented minorities in science, 2) improving biology education and the educational skills of the PI, 3) increasing public scientific literacy, and 4) informing our understanding of the biological consequences of global climate change, a critical societal need.</AbstractNarration>
