    <AbstractNarration>This award to the National Academy of Sciences will result in the appointment of a study committee to examine anticipated priorities and associated tradeoffs for advanced computing in support of NSF-sponsored science and engineering research. Advanced computing capabilities are used to tackle a rapidly growing range of challenging science and engineering problems, many of which are compute-, communications-, and data-intensive as well. The study committee will consider: (1) The contribution of high end computing to U.S. leadership and competiveness in basic science and engineering and the role that NSF should play in sustaining this leadership; (2) Expected future national-scale computing needs: high end requirements, those arising from the full range of basic science and engineering research supported by NSF, as well as the computing infrastructure needed to support advances in modeling, simulation and data analysis; (3) Complementarities and tradeoffs that arise among investments in supporting advanced computing ecosystems; software, data, communications; (4) The range of operational models for delivering computational infrastructure, for basic science and engineering research, and the role of NSF support in these various models ; and (5) Expected technical challenges to affordably delivering the capabilities needed for world-leading scientific and engineering research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interim report, to be delivered within 12 months of the project start, will identify key issues and discuss potential options. It may contain preliminary findings and early recommendations. A final report, to be delivered within 24 months of the project start, will include a framework for future decision-making about NSF's advanced computing strategy and programs. The framework would address such issues as how to prioritize needs and investments and how to balance competing demands for cyberinfrastructure investments. The report will emphasize identifying issues, explicating options, and articulating tradeoffs and general recommendations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced computing capabilities are central to many areas of basic science and engineering, and are being used to tackle a rapidly growing range of challenging problems. This activity will inform future strategy and investments for delivering these capabilities. The committee reports will address such issues as how to prioritize needs and investments and how to balance competing demands for cyberinfrastructure investments. The results of the study are intended to inform decision-making about future NSF investments in advanced computing. The reports will also be a valuable resource for (1) science and engineering researchers that use or might use advanced computing capabilities (for whom the report would provide an useful overview of opportunities, challenges, and future directions) and (2) those conducting R&amp;D on future high-performance computing (for whom the report would provide a useful view of emerging science and engineering requirements).</AbstractNarration>
