    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Arianna Lark of University of Iowa to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at Nagoya University in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. The project title is "Imaging Neuronal Activity to Identify the Role of Novel Steroid Hormone Receptors in Stress Behaviors." The host scientist is Dr. Azusa Kamikouchi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steroid hormones such as estrogen and testosterone play many important roles in behavior and development. Steroid hormones are generally thought to bind to receptors within cells and modulate gene expression. However, besides this relatively slow steroid signaling pathway, there are other faster pathways steroid hormones can initiate. In one of these noncanonical pathways, steroid hormones bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) at the cell surface and set off a cascade of changes which can quickly modify the cell. In neurons, these fast changes to the cell may alter its activity within its network; this in turn can alter the behavior of the organism. Several of these receptors have been recently identified including a GPCR for estrogen in humans. Unfortunately many results from studies of this receptor have been conflicted likely due to the high complexity of the mammalian system. Recently a cell membrane-bound steroid hormone receptor, DopEcR, has been identified in Drosophila (fruit flies). Drosophila has a simpler nervous system with many tools to manipulate genes and is an excellent model to study the mechanisms underlying regulation of behaviors. It has recently been identified that mutants for Drosophila DopEcR have defects in a behavioral response to stress: starvation-induced sleep suppression. Starvation induced sleep suppression has been observed in humans, rats and flies and likely results from an evolutionarily conserved response to food scarcity which overrides sleep urges to induce food searching behaviors. Dr. Kamikouchi and colleagues have expertise in a technique to image activity of the neurons in a living fruit fly. Using this technique this project identifies starvation initiated changes in neuronal activity mediated by DopEcR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, these results are expected to lead to a better understanding of the function of membrane-bound steroid hormone receptors within the brain as well as a greater general understanding of behavioral regulation by steroids.</AbstractNarration>
