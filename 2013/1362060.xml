    <AbstractNarration>In Phase II operation, the I/UCRC for Advanced Particulate Systems and Surfactants (CPaSS) intends to address challenges which fall under two broad categories: 1) characterization of particles and surfactants at nano and molecular scale, predictability in tuning their performance, and environmental and physiological compatibility, and 2) elucidation of understanding of structure-property-performance relationships in particulate/polymer/enzyme systems. To address challenges in fabrication of particles and surfactant systems with tunable properties, development of predictive models to understand their behavior in industrially relevant environments is needed. This requires understanding the mechanisms by which particulate and surfactant systems of different properties behave under industrially relevant dynamic systems - a major theme of the center's Phase II research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate and Surfactant Systems are vital to virtually every major industry including pharmaceuticals, detergents, cosmetics, liquid crystals, micro-electronics, advanced ceramics, petroleum and fuels, minerals, agriculture, biotechnology, photography, and paints and coatings. Center research can contribute to efficient process development leading to more effective and less costly consumer products; tools and protocols to screen greenness of reagents and particles together - the platform for many industrial, household and healthcare products. CPaSS is committed to continue and increase the enrollment of women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities during Phase II through stronger interactions with college and university programs that support recruitment of such students into the STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
