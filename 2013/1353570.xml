    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to use an innovative approach to metabolically engineer algae that will enable low-cost, carbon-free hydrogen production at medium to large scale. The metabolic pathway for hydrogen production in microalgae is tightly regulated. Process models for hydrogen production are based on anaerobic sulfur-deprivation preventing generation of oxygen, which inactivates hydrogenases. However, hydrogen yields are too low for an economical commercial process. Hydrogen production rates are difficult to improve due to complicated metabolic pathways guarding hydrogen production. Novel proprietary Chlamydomonas strains with synthetic genes for hydrogenase and maturation proteins were created and proven in Phase I. This project will continue the metabolic engineering to increase electron availability for hydrogenase and develop stable strains for scalable and commercially viable production of hydrogen. The proposed research will expand fundamental understanding of: 1) electron flow toward algal hydrogenases under sulfur-rich conditions and sulfur-deprivation, 2) requirements for maturation of hydrogenases, and 3) requirements to protect hydrogenases from oxygen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the commercial generation of cost-effective, renewable, and environmentally clean hydrogen that could greatly impact the nation's ability to reduce its use of foreign oil and create many new jobs. The commercial hydrogen production currently is burdened by major dependence on electricity and carbon dioxide emission. The proposed approach provides a commercial process for hydrogen production that will generate electricity and sequester carbon dioxide. The abundance of low-cost, renewable hydrogen should expand hydrogen markets to generate electricity and fuel vehicles. Just 200,000 ha of algal ponds using improved strains could displace 20% of imported crude oil. Thus, the project will have great commercial impact by enhancing national energy security. Moreover, this technology will promote diversification and sustainability of agricultural production in the U.S. through development of algae farming, which will not require arable land. Potentially, this technology will produce the most ecologically clean biofuel theoretically available, and could have great social impact by decreasing the carbon footprint and promoting economic diversification in rural areas.</AbstractNarration>
