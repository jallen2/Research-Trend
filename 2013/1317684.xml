    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator proposes to carry out an integrated, comprehensive research program which combines theory and innovative numerical methods with state of the art experimental work for the investigation of two-phase systems with a magnetic fluid component. This project aims at developing effective, predictive computational tools as well as to advancing the understanding of these two-phase, complex (non-Newtonian) flows. While magnetic fluids are technologically important on their own they also constitute an excellent model system (due to their low dimensional configuration space) for scientific study of complex fluids as well as for active suspensions. Consequently, the proposed research can have a wider impact in the multiscale modeling and computation of more general two-phase flows with a complex fluid component. The specific objectives of the proposed work can be summarized as follows: 1) to develop innovative, effective micro-macro numerical approaches for magnetic fluids and two phase flows with a magnetic fluid component in 2D and 3D and to apply them for the prediction and investigation of the dynamics and rheology of these complex fluid systems, 2) to use specifically targeted experimental work to validate the new computational approaches as well as to provide a feedback mechanism to the theory, 3) to formulate simplified models based on the an increased understanding of the rheology of magnetic fluid systems obtained by a combination of numerical and experimental work, and 4) to advance a fundamental understanding of the microphysical mechanisms that influence the (macro)rheology of magnetic fluid droplets and emulsions under the presence of a magnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic fluids, also known as ferrofluids, are manmade colloidal suspensions of magnetic nano-particles in a liquid carrier. Emulsions consisting of suspended magnetic fluid droplets surrounded by a continuous phase offer a high potential for technologically important applications such as the design of new smart materials and drug targeting. To this end, as in other applications such as polymer and advanced material processing, it is necessary to predict or manipulate the dynamics of their droplet microstructure. This can be done with a combination of mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and experimental work which the investigator proposes to develop and integrate as part of this project. The broader impacts of the proposed activities also include education, the integration of people from underrepresented groups, and potential industrial relevance. The proposed research will play a central role in the education and training of a new cadre of computational math students who will learn to work in an interdisciplinary, international team.</AbstractNarration>
