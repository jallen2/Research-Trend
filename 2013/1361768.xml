    <AbstractNarration>The Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is designed to support improvements in the scientific, mathematical, engineering and&lt;br/&gt;technological education infrastructure in (a) tribally-controlled colleges and universities, or (b) those colleges that serve significant numbers of Alaska Natives or Native Hawaiians. Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIPs) are offered as a TCUP strand for meritorious projects that focus on smaller scale transformative efforts. The Stone Child College (SCC) TSIP is designed to directly benefit students' academic performance in STEM, foster greater mathematics preparation for future students who enroll at this or another institution of higher education, and broadly impact the community served by the college with increased mathematics literacy and performance. It will also increase the diversity of the STEM workforce by increasing the mathematics success of American Indians seeking to enter STEM studies and fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will improve students' mathematics competency, reducing their need for and time spent in remedial coursework, and enhancing the college's mathematics courses by: (a) providing local high school seniors the opportunity for an early assessment exam; (b) conducting specialized intensive sessions, some targeting college freshmen and some provided for any student who wishes to increase his or her math competency; and (c) reassessing and updating the mathematics curriculum to ensure it aligns with the standards of four-year institutions, to increase students' successful transfer to baccalaureate programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the Stone Child College TSIP is to effect long-range improvement in STEM education and to increase the flow of Native American students into scientific technological careers. This will be accomplished through two primary objectives. The first objective is to operate a Targeted STEM Infusion Project with 12 students per cycle. There will be three cycles per year, and each cycle will last eight weeks. The first two cycles in a year will focus on college freshmen and sophomore students who are in need of assistance to raise achievement levels so they can remain on track for a timely college completion. The third cycle will be open to any students at any level who will benefit from supplemental instruction in STEM fields. The second objective of the Stone Child College TSIP is to reassess and update the mathematics curriculum at Stone Child College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, 36.5% of the students entering SCC were required to take remedial math courses. As a result of this placement, students have to attend SCC for a minimum of two extra semesters. The Stone Child College TSIP is going to create three math learning courses each year. The objective of the three courses is to enhance the learning of the students and to help them complete the SCC math requirements in a timely manner. As a result of the enhanced knowledge through the project, more students will be placed in STEM occupations.</AbstractNarration>
