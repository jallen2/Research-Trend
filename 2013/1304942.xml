    <AbstractNarration>In this project the investigators will focus on development of biophysical models of multiflagellar locomotion in bacteria and use of the models to gain an understanding of the principles underlying locomotion phenomena. They will explore the parameter and design space, to help build an understanding of how the biological systems evolved to become the way they are. Principal aims include the development of mechanistic models for the dynamics of multiflagellar locomotion at a number of levels of description, and application of these models toward understanding various observations of bacterial swimming. In particular, one broad theme that appears upon examination of the experimental observations is multiplicity. Why are there multiple modes of bacterial swimming? Why do many species have capabilities to swim with multiple flagellar modes? Is one of the selective advantages of multiflagellar swimming the multiple possible configurations of the flagella? The proposed work will begin to systematically address this theme by building and applying models that begin to approach the physical complexity of a real multiflagellar organism, will substantially advance this understanding, contributing not only to fundamental microbiology but to many applications, such as soil remediation and prevention of infections, that are closely linked to bacterial motility. By shedding light on how bacteria swim, the proposed work will also strengthen the intellectual foundations for development of artificial microscopic swimming machines. The graduate students who will be educated during the conduct of this research will gain a unique combination of expertise in biophysics and computational mechanics. As part of the present project, in addition to participating in the proposed research, undergraduates will be involved in a K-12 outreach project involving the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.</AbstractNarration>
