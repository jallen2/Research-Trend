    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Harold, Michael&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Houston&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1332300&lt;br/&gt;Title: NASCRE 3: Chemical Reaction Engineering for a Sustainable Future -- Addressing New Challenges and Revisiting Persistent Problems in Energy, Environmental, and Chemicals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will provide funds to support the participation of young researchers (students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty) from US institutions in the 3rd North American Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering (NASCRE 3). The symposium will take place in Houston, TX, USA, during March 17-20, 2013. The theme of the symposium is: "Chemical Reaction Engineering for a Sustainable Future: Addressing New Challenges and Revisiting Persistent Problems in Energy, Environmental, and Chemicals Research". Advisors will be asked to nominate students and postdoctoral researchers working in their research groups; the nomination package will include a letter of recommendation and the CV of the nominee. Junior faculty members will simply submit their CVs. The NASCRE 3 Scientific Committee will evaluate the applicants and select the candidates who will receive the partial support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The U.S. faces imposing challenges in energy and the environment that require new technologies that will sustain the planet yet meet the needs of a robust society. Many of these challenges require expertise in converting raw materials, including the biomass feedstocks and the burgeoning supply of natural gas, to transportation fuels and intermediates, without compromising the environment. The theme of this symposium is to capture the essential role that chemical reaction engineering (CRE) plays in addressing these challenges. NASCRE 3 will feature communications of recent research on CRE fundamentals, enabling technologies, and advanced materials for advanced fossil fuel recovery and refining methods, environmental technologies for mobile and stationary sources, advanced power generation devices, and biomass conversion to fuel and chemicals. NASCRE 3 complements the International Symposiums on Chemical Reaction Engineering (ISCRE), held every two years at alternating venues in North America, Europe, and Asia. NASCRE 3 occurs at the midpoint between ISCRE meetings held in North America, and in so doing ensures that reaction engineering researchers stay well connected. NASCRE 3 will include plenary lectures on current topics, oral and poster presentations, two workshops on computational methods in theoretical catalysis and reaction and transport systems, and plenty of opportunity for individual discussions. The proceedings will be published as a special issue of Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research (IECR). With the central theme being energy, environmental, and the fundamentals of chemical reaction engineering, participation in this symposium is to convey to young investigators the many exciting intellectual challenges in the field. The presentations and interactions will expose them to innovations and should inspire them to synthesize their own ideas, which are central to further developments in the above-mentioned industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The knowledge generated by the CRE community is central to the continuing success of various industries and the US economy. Over the past few years, there is the feeling that the CRE community has been shrinking, e.g., as evidenced by the rather small number of junior faculty. NSF support for up to 100 NASCRE participants will provide a vehicle to increase attendance of young investigators including people from underrepresented groups, and continue the CRE mission. To further increase impact, NASCRE 3 will disseminate information through its web site and a dedicated IECR issue of accepted papers and plenary perspectives.</AbstractNarration>
