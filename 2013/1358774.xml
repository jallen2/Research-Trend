    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Blacic proposes to initiate a new international collaboration with Dr. Changsoo Shin at Seoul National University in South Korea to apply his method of obtaining background sound speed models in the solid earth from marine seismic data (Laplace domain inversion, LDI) to&lt;br/&gt;the ocean itself. Dr. Blacic and a student from Montclair State University will visit Dr. Shin?s laboratory at Seoul National University to work on the initial adaptation of the LDI method and to participate in planning meetings with Dr. Shin and his students. Dr. Shin will coordinate the necessary work on the LDI computer program, will provide expertise on the LDI method, and will provide access to the computer program for rapid code testing. Dr. Blacic will develop the synthetic seismic data sets for code testing and provide expertise on issues related to adapting solid earth-based seismic processing techniques to seismic oceanography data. Students at both Seoul National University and Montclair State University will be involved in the proof-of-concept work and project planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Blacic will be including material on seismic oceanography in the undergraduate and graduate geophysics course she will be teaching at Montclair State University beginning in Fall 2013. Results of this project will make up a part of that material. A student at Montclair State University, whose student body is &gt;60% female and &gt;30% minorities, will be involved in the project planning and initial phases of the research. The student will participate in the visit to Seoul National University and will thus have the opportunity to learn about international project planning as well as computer modeling and coding techniques. The student will also give a presentation at Seoul National University on seismic oceanography. After returning to Montclair, the student will prepare the results of the initial application of Laplace domain inversion to synthetic seismic oceanography data sets for presentation at Montclair State University's Student Research Symposium and/or a national scientific meeting.</AbstractNarration>
