    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-1321752&lt;br/&gt;Hank Smith, MIT&lt;br/&gt;Support of student travel to the EIPBN conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide travel support to enable students to attend The 57th International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication, 2013, to be held at the Gaylord Opryland Resort, Nashville, Tennessee, May 28 to May 31, 2013. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This is a major conference in the fields of nanofabrication, electron and ion-beam lithographies, photon and imprint lithographies, particle-beam optics, and forefront applications of nanofabrication. This travel aid will enable students to present their research to a high-level international scientific community. They will observe how scientists and engineers exchange innovative ideas and other information, and they will hear first-hand presentations of up-to-date research results in nanoscale science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Learning how a technical conference serves as a venue for conveying information to others is an important element of a graduate student?s education. Also important is leaning how to present, in a cogent and understandable way, the results of one?s research. The requested support will help to accomplish these ends. At the conference, students will make important personal contacts and learn of employment opportunities. At a special student breakfast, the conference organizers will describe to the students optimal techniques for presenting scientific information and how the conference program is put together. The provision of support will greatly ease the burden on students in finding funds needed to attend a conference, especially early in their academic careers, when this lesson can be most formative.</AbstractNarration>
