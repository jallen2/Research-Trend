    <AbstractNarration>CBET 1336425&lt;br/&gt;Baikun Li&lt;br/&gt;University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study aims at developing a new generation microelectrode (ME) with easy fabrication, sturdy structure, simple setup and capability of simultaneously measuring multiple parameters at multiple points to profile the spatial distribution of contaminants, thus providing useful information to elucidate their fate. All-in-one microelectrode chips (AIO MECs) provide real-time, continuous, and accurate monitoring of physical-chemical variation following system shocks. With the water/sediment interface as the target, four tasks will be conducted. First, as the precursor of the AIO MECs, one-dimension MECs (1D MECs) will be fabricated using photolithography to produce sturdy MEs on silicon chips. The position of each ME will be known so that the 1D MECs are capable of profiling along the depth of samples without the need of micromanipulators. Second, AIO MECs will be developed by patterning multiple 1D MECs onto a single chip, so that one chip can simultaneously measure multiple parameters at multiple points. Third, the applicability of 1D MECs and AIO MECs will be examined under two shocks (concentration- and flow rate-dependent shocks) in lab-scale tests and lake sediments. Finally, the short-term (days) and long-term (months) impacts of shocks at the water/sediment interface will be monitored in real-time mode. The MEC profiles will be integrated with models to elucidate the migration fates of contaminants, which will provide timely restoration protocols for site cleanup before irreversible deterioration of the natural environment. This proof-of-concept work will provide real-time monitoring of physical-chemical variations (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorous, redox potential, and proton) after shocks, and allow fundamental understanding of the dynamic transport of contaminants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By developing the new generation ME technology to achieve real-time monitoring of contaminants after shocks, the proposed research will impact protection and restoration of vital ecosystems, maintaining environmental sustainability for future generations. The AIO MECs will lead to compact and simple monitoring kits that will revolutionize real-time monitor of diverse systems including large-scale contaminated sites and harsh environment (deep sea sediment). Multiple outreach initiatives including workshops and high school seminars will promote the scientific/engineering competence of underrepresented groups. The research will strengthen an existing collaboration with water industries to achieve real-time in situ monitoring of natural and engineered systems. Finally, the new generation ME technology for profiling water qualities and contaminants will be a strong force to promote environmental engineering research and education in the State of Connecticut and New England area.</AbstractNarration>
