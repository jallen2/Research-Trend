    <AbstractNarration>The Latin American Conference on Probability and Mathematical Statistics (CLAPEM, by its initials in Spanish) is the main event in probability and statistics in the region, having been held roughly every two to three years for almost 30 years. The series of CLAPEMs has greatly contributed to the development of probability and statistics in Latin America, and the NSF has provided support for the conference during the last 15 years. Accordingly, this award will provide travel support for four senior and at least eight junior U.S.-based researchers who will be participating in the XIII CLAPEM, to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, from September 22nd to September 26th, 2014. The event includes a diverse and high-quality scientific program with short courses (Theory of Statistical Learning, Mathematical Genetics and Bioinformatics, and Quantitative Risk Management), plenary talks (High Dimensional Data Analysis, Stochastic Processes, and Quantum Information Theory), special thematic sessions (Functional Data, Particle Systems, Sampling Methods and Random Segmentation Models, among others), and contributed oral and poster presentations. The participants include researchers from all over Latin America, Europe and the United States, providing an excellent forum for the development of collaborations and for the recruitment of highly qualified foreign students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation (NSF) has long recognized the importance to the United States of the participation of U.S.-based researchers in international scientific events. In particular, NSF has long supported the participation of U.S.-based researchers in the Latin American Conference on Probability and Mathematical Statistics (CLAPEM, by its initials in Spanish). This award will support the participation of both junior and senior researchers working at U.S. institution in the upcoming XIII CLAPEM, which is to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, from September 22nd to September 26th, 2014. The participation of these researchers in the XIII CLAPEM will have a positive impact in the region (by increasing the quality of the conference's scientific program and facilitating collaborations between U.S.-based and Latin American researchers) and in the U.S. (by maintaining our country's international leadership in research on probability and statistics and helping to attract the best and brightest young Latin American minds to graduate programs in the U.S.).
