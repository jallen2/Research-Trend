    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project (IIS-1320046, IIS-1319606) designs a 3-dimensional immersive visualization environment for volume data that is critical in a variety of application domains, such as medicine, engineering, geophysical exploration, and biomechanics. For example, biomechanics researchers examine volumes derived from insect scans to understand how form relates to function, particularly in regard to how insects create internal fluid flows. For effective analysis of a 3D volume, scientists and other users need to integrate various views, peer inside the volume, and separate various structures in the data. However, despite many advances in volume rendering algorithms, neither traditional displays nor traditional interaction techniques are sufficient for efficient and accurate analysis of complex volume datasets. This project develops an approach for interactively exploring and segmenting volume datasets by combining and extending: (1) utilization of advanced, high-fidelity displays based on virtual reality (VR) technologies for improving the visual analysis of volume data, and (2) the use of natural, gesture-based 3D techniques. Using controlled, empirical studies with real-world volume datasets from biomechanics and other biological sciences, the investigators are determining what characteristics of advanced displays can lead to faster, more accurate visual analysis. Iterative design and evaluation methods are being used to develop usable and natural 3D interaction techniques with which users can explore the interior of volume datasets. Beyond the empirical findings of these studies, an important outcome of the project is the design of a next-generation volume data analysis system that can be used by scientists and researchers to improve the efficiency and accuracy of their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected results will provide a deep understanding of visualization principles fostering further advancements in the realm of volume data analysis. Easier, more accurate, and faster analysis can lead to improvements in healthcare, breakthroughs in science, and advances in education. For example, this work may lead to insights into fundamental physiological mechanisms of feeding, breathing, and circulation in insects - one of the most important animal groups on earth. There are millions of insect species living in almost every habitat, and their lifestyles have profound impacts on human societies. Their effects in areas such as agriculture and health can be both positive (e.g., pollination) and negative (e.g., crop damage, disease), and understanding their fundamental physiologies is critical to controlling their impact. The project provides opportunities for interdisciplinary educational and research activities for graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach activities to underrepresented students. The results of this work will be disseminated broadly via publication in archival journals, peer-reviewed conferences, and online forums. The project website (https://research.cs.vt.edu/3di/node/188) will provide access to research results, including data sets and software.</AbstractNarration>
