    <AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, this project further develops the Nanotechnology Center for Biomedical, Environmental and Sustainability Applications at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM). The Center's mission is to combine transformational research and education efforts in the area of nanoscaled materials by focusing on: biomedical, environmental remediation, and sustainability applications. Faculty members involved in the Center will investigate application-oriented processing of materials with properties and applications that depend on phenomena occurring at the nanometer scale: (1) Medical and Biological Applications; (2) Remediation of Recalcitrant and Emerging Contaminants from the Environment; and (3) Sustainability. This project will establish effective means to institutionalize research and education aimed at founding a sustainable platform at UPRM of international recognition. Through formative and summative assessments, a systematic project evaluation will provide information to ensure continuous improvement, focusing on achieving the proposed objectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Three interdisciplinary research groups will focus on the following areas: (i) Development of new nanoscaled materials for cancer therapy assisted by the application of magnetic fields and specialized light sources. Toxicity and transport will be assessed using model human cancer cell lines and other appropriate models. The goal of this research team is to create non-invasive therapeutics for treatment of patients suffering from diverse forms of cancer. (ii) Fabrication of a novel series of composites for the removal of emerging contaminants from water sources, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and selected pathogens. Additionally, researchers will work on processing new porous adsorbents for the selective and efficient capture of CO2 from the environment and enclosed habitats. (iii) Finding new nanocatalysts for the conversion of renewable resources. This research group will also develop new nanostructured composite materials using polymers as the main component and combined with specialized constituents, which are intended for the next generation of fuel cells applications. Finally, high performance and sustainable (low-energy consuming upon fabrication) concrete mixes will be formulated using specific nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Biomedical, Environmental and Sustainability Applications will develop technologies for cancer therapy, water disinfection and air cleaning, and sustainability. Despite dramatic improvements in cancer chemotherapeutics, there is still an unmet need to understand the underlying causes of treatment failures. The knowledge acquired through the proposed activities will become invaluable for the development of novel cancer therapies and materials with applications in medicine. Center goals will also address global environmental challenges associated with water and air. Sustainability-related research will also be impacted by the Center. At the undergraduate level, the Center will impact the Undergraduate Certificate in Materials Science and Engineering program, as well as undergraduate research courses in the various engineering departments. The Center for Biomedical, Environmental and Sustainability Applications will develop a competitive cadre of Hispanic professionals well-prepared to contribute to the Nation's nanotechnology workforce.</AbstractNarration>
