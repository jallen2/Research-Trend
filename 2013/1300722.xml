    <AbstractNarration>Through this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting Prof. Gregory B. Dudley of Florida State University to develop new methods for the synthesis and strategic application of alkynes. The alkyne functional group is becoming increasingly prominent as chemists place greater emphasis on conservation (atom economy), efficiency (step economy), and simplicity (click chemistry). New methods for alkyne synthesis are needed to fuel the growth of modern alkyne chemistry. The research efforts at Florida State University will focus on de novo creation of CC triple bonds by fragmentation, retro-cycloaddition, and other entropically favorable processes. Special emphasis will be placed on the synthesis of alkynes that are needed for specific applications in the molecular sciences but that cannot be prepared by direct substitution of acetylene. Strategic applications of the resulting alkynes will be developed as an integral part of the research process, including the chemical synthesis of bioactive natural products and of strained cycloalkynes of relevance to bioorthogonal chemistry. The strained cycloalkynes will be designed and evaluated in collaboration with the co PI, Prof. Igor Alabugin of Florida State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alkynes are high energy hydrocarbons containing triple bonds. The impact of alkyne chemistry transcends traditional boundaries of chemical synthesis. Alkyne chemical reactions are instrumental to many techniques in bioimaging, pharmaceutical synthesis, advanced materials research, etc. These techniques therefore depend on convenient access to the requisite alkynes. The proposed research is expected to lead to more efficient production of high-value alkynes and to a better fundamental understanding of alkyne reactivity. This research program is fully integrated with university education efforts. The organic methodology and synthesis research opportunities associated with this project will prepare student participants to excel in an innovation-based economy. Science communication is an important part of this preparation. In addition to disseminating research results to the scientific community, program participants communicate broadly with the public, including K-12 students, through various outreach programs. These programs target local and global audiences to promote awareness of the increasingly global, diverse, and multidisciplinary chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
