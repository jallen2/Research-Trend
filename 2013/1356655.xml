    <AbstractNarration>Identifying genetic variation underlying complex phenotypes aids the understanding of their biology. Complex phenotypes characterized by a variety of features are often associated with substantial phenotypic variation. Current statistical methods are ineffective to address this phenotypic heterogeneity, and hence lack of power to associate genetic variants with the phenotype. This project aims to design new algorithms that differentiate homogenous subtypes of a complex phenotype that are most informative in genetic analysis, and identify genetic variants that are associated with the subtypes but cannot be detected by the non-differentiated phenotype. The validity of the subtypes will be proved in multiple scales including the evidence from genomic structure and phenotypic features. The new algorithms will be validated in the areas of genetic selection for complex traits of agriculturally-important animals and plants. This project serves a vehicle to train graduate students in the multidisciplinary methods involving computer science and biology, and allow them to apply the methods in a variety of biological fields. A new course in the bioinformatics field will be developed for senior undergraduate students. High school educational materials will also be developed to educate high school students about how to mathematically model biological data so it solves biological problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will derive novel analytics based on quantitative genetics theory and machine learning theory to refine complex phenotypes for enhanced discovery of genotype-phenotype correlations. Using empirical and statistically rigorous methods, this project will derive composite traits, as functions of multiple phenotypic features, that are optimized with respect to narrow-sense heritability, and that map readily to specific genomic regions. Two statistical models for estimating narrow-sense heritability will be considered: one based on sample pedigrees, and the other directly uses the whole-genome markers. To identify multi-scale evidence of a subtype that is characterized by a composite trait, a new machine learning framework will be derived to jointly analyze genotypes and phenotypes. By testing the algorithms in the analysis of large-scale biological databases, the new algorithms will derive highly heritable composite traits for feed efficiency of dairy cattle and adaptive traits of soybean to improve their genetic selection. The algorithms developed in this project will also advance the machine learning field by defining and addressing new research problems, such as the joint model inference using data from multiple sources, probabilistic clustering based on matrix decomposition, and quadratic optimization for heritability estimation. This project will yield user-friendly software tools that can be broadly deployed to biological research areas that study genetics of complex phenotypes. The validated methods and software will be disseminated through the PI?s laboratory website http://www.labhealthinfo.uconn.edu/home/ which provides more information of this project.</AbstractNarration>
