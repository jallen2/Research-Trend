    <AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Design of Experiments (ICODOE 2016) will be held at the University of Memphis on May 10-13, 2016. The design and analysis of experiments is at the foundation of the scientific method; it is used in applications across all scientific disciplines and engineering. The conference will help in the advancement of knowledge in the area of experimental design as prominent researchers from all over the world will be participating in the conference. This award provides travel support to increase the number of junior researchers who are able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of the conference is to encourage and support young researchers in the field, to make them aware of the latest developments, and also to bring them together with established researchers in experimental design. The conference will also catalyze research in new directions by bringing together leading researchers from all over the world in the area of design and analysis of experiments and practitioners in the pharmaceutical, chemometric, physical, biological, medical, social, psychological, economic, engineering, and manufacturing sciences. Topics of the conference include design of experiments for big data, design for uncertainty quantification, computational methods, and computer experiments. The focus will be on emerging areas of research in experimental design as well as innovations in traditional areas.
