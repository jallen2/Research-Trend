    <AbstractNarration>Postdoctoral Fellow: Matthew A. McCary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1611638&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Matthew A. McCary is "Understanding how resource subsidies alter aboveground-belowground interactions in different terrestrial ecosystems." The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Claudio Gratton, Anthony Ives, and Randall Jackson. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to understand how resource subsidies from aquatic habitats affect interactions between aboveground and belowground communities on land. Resource subsidies, i.e., fluxes of resources to an ecosystem from outside of its boundaries, can have important effects in recipient ecosystems. However, it is unknown how nutrient subsidies affect aboveground-belowground interactions that occur within different types of recipient ecosystems. Because aboveground and belowground communities are intrinsically linked, feedbacks between these two subsystems have major implications for ecosystem dynamics. The Fellow is testing the hypothesis that characteristics of the recipient ecosystem, particularly plant productivity and structure, will influence how resource subsidies alter aboveground-belowground interactions. The study system, Lake Mývatn in northeastern Iceland, is known for its high rate of production of aquatic insects (midges), which emerge, mate and die on land, thereby providing a resource subsidy to the surrounding terrestrial landscape. Because resource subsidies are widespread, testing this hypothesis is critical to building a general theory of ecosystem structure and functioning. The Fellow is pursuing two objectives: (1) to determine how the structure of recipient plant communities directs midge resources to either the aboveground or belowground food web; and (2) to compare the subsequent changes to aboveground-belowground interactions once resource subsidies have entered the detritus-based food web in recipient ecosystems of low versus high plant productivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow is being trained to master techniques in plant ecology, food-web interactions, and statistical modeling to evaluate ecosystem-level processes. The Fellow is broadening the participation of underrepresented groups by recruiting Native American, African American, and Hispanic students via an undergraduate Summer Research Internship program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) that specifically supports research experiences for undergraduate students in Iceland. Furthermore, the fellow will re-start UW's dormant chapter of SEEDS (the Ecological Society of America's Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability), a program to stimulate involvement of underrepresented students (particularly undergraduates) in ecological research.</AbstractNarration>
