    <AbstractNarration>Nonlocal dispersive wave equations have been recently applied in many areas such as electromagnetism, acoustics, cosmology, elasticity, biology, hydrodynamics, viscoelasticity, seismics, water wave, plasma, quantum mechanics, brain and consciousness, and so on. However, their nonlocality introduces considerable challenges in both mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. This project seeks to address fundamental issues related to mathematical modeling and numerical simulations of nonlocal dispersive wave equations as well as their solution properties. The proposed project will bridge the gap between different areas, enhance interdisciplinary research, and advance the application of fractional differential equations in practice. Since nonlocal wave equations have broad applications in physics, chemistry, biology and engineering, the research in this project has great potentials to advance the research and technology in relevant areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of this research are to build mathematical and numerical treatments for the nonlocal Schroedinger wave equations, and to provide a deeper understanding of the modeling with long-range interactions, so as to advance their application to problems with nonlocality. In this project, both the discrete nonlinear Schroedinger (DNLS) equation with long-range interactions and the fractional nonlinear Schroedinger (fNLS) equation with the fractional Laplacian will be investigated. Integrating the discrete and continuous models offers a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of the nonlocality of the Schroedinger wave equations. On the one hand, accurate algorithms will be developed to improve the efficiency and reduce the computational costs in simulating the DNLS with large lattice sites, especially in two- or three-dimensional lattices. On the other hand, efficient and accurate numerical methods for discretizing the fractional Laplacian will be designed and applied to study the properties of the stationary states and dynamics of fNLS. The study on the DNLS and fNLS will provide a deeper understanding on modeling and properties of long-range interactions, as well as is benefitting the development of numerical algorithms for fractional differential equations.</AbstractNarration>
