    <AbstractNarration>Convergence of the North American tectonic plate with the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and Explorer plates creates the Cascadia subduction zone, extending 1100 km from northern California to Canada's Vancouver Island in the Pacific Northwest. Offshore where the tectonic plates meet, a thick wedge of sediment develops. The sediment wedge forms as a result of erosion on land and transport of the sediment away from the coastline, and the wedge is thickened by the compression resulting from the two plates sliding by each other. Recent great earthquakes and tsunamis around the world have heightened the awareness of the natural hazards posed by the processes occurring along the Cascadia margin. Many of these processes are linked to the sediment wedge, particularly the failure of sediment slopes that may lead to landslides and generate local tsunamis. This project will help to identify the processes controlling the initiation of slope failure on the sediment wedge at the Cascadia margin. Understanding the paths and triggers for sediment slope failures is key to unraveling the history of past earthquakes and assessing the associated earthquake, tsunami, and submarine landslide hazards. The project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary examination of recent temperature, pressure and seismic data returned from the Cascadia Initiative program of Ocean Bottom Seismometer deployments off of the Cascadia subduction zone has shown that slope failures and sediment flows can be triggered not only by local great earthquakes, but also by the seismic waves from distant earthquakes, including the 2012 Mw8.6 event off the coast of Sumatra. If this interpretation is substantiated by further processing and interpretation of the related data during this project, it will have a major impact on several current scientific issues, including (1) identification of megathrust earthquake recurrence intervals, (2) the amplification of surface seismic shaking by the thick sediments in the accretionary margin wedge, and (3) the transfer of organic carbon within sediment debris flows that originate on the shallow continental shelf and end with burial in the abyssal plain, a key marine component of the global carbon cycle. The end product of the project will be a new model to identify sections of the Cascadia margin that may be prone to slope failures.</AbstractNarration>
