    <AbstractNarration>The Earth's magnetic field is generated by fluid motions deep within the molten iron outer core. Owing to its remoteness, direct observations of core motions are not possible. This limitation hinders our ability to understand the physics that control the dynamics and evolution of the core and the observed geomagnetic field, and places an emphasis on the development of more accurate modeling techniques. The proposed work will investigate the physics of the core and associated magnetic field via the development and simulation of new mathematical models that will allow systematic variation of the ingredients thought to be important in the core. This is an interdisciplinary project that brings together scientists from both the geophysics and applied mathematics communities who possess skill-sets in the important application areas of modeling, computation and experimentation. The proposed work will provide valuable training for a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher in the nationally important scientific and mathematical fields of geophysics and applied mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of direct observations of the core hinders our ability to understand the details of geomagnetic field observations and make predictions on its temporal evolution. Overcoming this limitation requires the further development of accurate models and the theoretical understanding of various flow regimes that might be possible within the core. Presently, direct numerical simulations of the geodynamo lack consensus on the precise nature of the dominant force balances in core turbulence due to lack of spatiotemporal scale separation resulting from finite computational resources. This proposal seeks funding to investigate dynamical regimes that are thought to be relevant for the Earth's liquid outer core and the geomagnetic field via a combined approach of numerical simulations and asymptotic model development that is guided by data obtained from ongoing laboratory experiments. A major goal is to explore and advance our understanding of the dynamical and statistical consequences of differing force balances in core turbulence settings by explicitly controlling the relative strengths of an externally imposed magnetic field and the system rotation rate.</AbstractNarration>
