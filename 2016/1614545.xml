    <AbstractNarration>It is now a well established fact that the proton and neutron are made from constituents known as quarks and gluons. The research supported by this award investigates how a property of the proton called spin is distributed among its parts. The goal is to extract the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton and compare this with theoretical predictions. The group will also search for indications that strongly interacting matter is expected based on symmetry principles. For example, interactions of neutrinos with nuclei is important for the understanding of supernova explosions. In addition, this group will measure the lifetime of the free neutron, since this is important input to test the Big Bang theory of element creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the research supported by this award investigates: (1) How the spin of the proton is distributed among its parts. Particles emitted when high-energy beams of spin-aligned protons collide in the STAR detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider can reveal how much of the proton's spin is carried by its gluons or by different types of quarks and anti-quarks. The group will search for the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton and explore spin differences among antiquarks. They will also measure how polarized quarks turn into mesons and baryons and search for indications that strongly interacting matter breaks mirror symmetry;(2) The properties and interactions of neutrinos in nuclei with a large number of neutrons and protons: this is important for the understanding of supernova explosions; (3) How long the free neutron lives: this is important input to test the Big Bang theory of element creation; and (4) whether or not neutrons possess exotic interactions that are not (yet) a part of our current list of forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities of the group will contribute toward educating the next generation of skilled PhD scientists for jobs in research and teaching universities, industry and national labs, and medical and computer technology. The investigators co-organize and lecture at summer schools. They participate in the NSF REU program. They mentor their postdocs to facilitate their future entry into teaching and research institutions and the scientific community. They develop undergraduate laboratories emphasizing nuclear technology, bring undergraduates on field trips and assist with programs that encourage pre-college participation in the Indiana University science curriculum. They engage bright young undergraduates in science through jobs or projects, which develop the research skills they will need for success in graduate school. They reach out to the local community through a variety of activities to awaken the interest of students in the local public school system by visiting local high school science classes, acting as judges in local science fairs and for the State Science Olympiad, and presenting physics demonstrations at the Indiana State Fair. They actively recruit female and minority applicants for positions at all levels within the group and the physics department by serving on selection committees for faculty searches and research fellowships for women. They work to make their activities known to the public at large through laboratory tours and Open House presentations, science cafe discussions, radio interviews, and press releases in the local media.</AbstractNarration>
