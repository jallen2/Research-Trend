    <AbstractNarration>The 13th meeting of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA) will take place in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, from June 13-17, 2016. (See https://bayesian.org/content/isba-2016-world-meeting.) The International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA, www.bayesian.org) was established in 1992. Its mission is to promote the development and application of Bayesian statistical theory and methods useful in the solution of theoretical and applied problems in science, industry and government. The ISBA meetings are important venues for the exchange of research ideas in Bayesian statistics. This award will provide funding for US Ph.D. students to attend and participate in this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting on Bayesian analysis will be held June 13-17, 2016, in Sardinia. The conference will include short courses, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The oral presentations include the De Finetti Lecture by Persi Diaconis (Stanford University) and the Susie Bayarri Lecture by James Scott (University of Texas). NSF funding will allow US Ph.D. students to attend and participate in this meeting.</AbstractNarration>
