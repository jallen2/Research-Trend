    <AbstractNarration>Chestnut Hill College (CHC) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is designing, developing, and implementing a new degree program to produce cybersecurity professionals, an employment sector with a critical shortage throughout the country. CHC's cybersecurity program will be the first undergraduate degree to be offered in the Philadelphia region. Fifteen students are expected to enroll as new cybersecurity majors each year. The unique factors of the program are: (1) involving industry experts with real-world experience in the creation and implementation of the academic curriculum, (2) wide-ranging infusion of cybersecurity principles in all information technology and computer science curricula offered by CHC, and (3) hands-on skills development with actual hardware and software, not just virtual environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction with the cybersecurity community will allow CHC to incorporate state-of-the art applications, based on real world situations, into the development of the new academic program. In addition to assisting with curriculum design, subject matter experts will serve as adjunct teachers. All recruited subject matter experts have extensive backgrounds in cybersecurity and are recognized as leaders in the industry and government agencies, such as the FBI and DHS. The opportunities for students to work with real-world experts will enhance their understanding of the role of cybersecurity in today's complicated technology environment. CHC will share the process of creating the new curriculum through the academic--industry expert partnership with other colleges throughout the nation. In addition, the team will apply for the designation as a National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) program, jointly sponsored by The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and The National Security Agency (NSA).</AbstractNarration>
