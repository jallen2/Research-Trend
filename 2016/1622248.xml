    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is providing better method for connected systems and devices to interact with each other. Current solutions require many months of development and cost of development and maintenance can be overwhelming. The proposed technology offers a way for interaction between systems and devices to be configured rather than programmed. The technology also provides a way for services to be configured by the user, rather than relying on developers to create nodes or connectors. This is made possible through abstracting out the interaction layer of software stack and creating a generic algorithm for interaction to be configured. Much like when routers first came out, technology of abstracting out a portion of software stack opens up opportunity for market to perform tasks that once were programmer dependent. Abstraction of router code enabled growth of Internet. We believe abstraction of Interaction code will enable IoT to be widely deployed. Societal impact is achieved through large number of interactive solution being created, and exponentially growing number of sensors and devices to be utilized in full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to solve the problem of creating interaction between services being programmer dependent. In order for services to interact, they need to be able to connect, communicate, and then interact. Industry has done a great job in abstracting out various components of application layers to provide connectivity and communication between two services. However, interaction logic has always been software developed. It is the single largest bottleneck in Internet of Things (IoT) solution creation, deployment, and operation. All available tools for integration are development tools. New method of creating solutions is being proposed where a solution is designed and deployed around configured interaction logic. This is different to many development tools that allow communication between services through custom service bus, messaging protocols, and APIs. Interaction logic sits on top of communication and connectivity layers. Technology involves methods and apparatus to enable interaction between all connected things, and for enabling dynamic mapping of interactions through service elements. The technology will provide easy, rapid, and cost effective proliferation of IoT solutions. Since IoT solutions are mostly interaction between devices and applications, abstracted out interaction logic allows entire solutions to be created through configuration of interaction logic.</AbstractNarration>
