    <AbstractNarration>NSF RAPID funding is provided to study the microbial consumption of methane in soil during and following the 2015-2016 Southern California Natural Gas Leak. The gas leak was the largest such event in US history. Methane is flammable gas. Increasing concentrations of methane in the atmosphere can have a potent "greenhouse" effect. This NSF RAPID award will support the characterization, identity and activity of methane-consuming microorganisms in the soil in response to the gas leak, to better understand ecosystem-level impacts of the disaster. Atmospheric measurements of leaking methane will be compared to measurements of soil microorganisms near the site of the gas leak, as well as tracing the flow of methane-derived carbon through the soil ecosystem over time. The data collected in this time course study will assist with future modeling of the contribution of soil-associated microorganisms to global methane cycling. Understanding the fate of methane released from this extreme event has benefits to both the scientific research community and to public safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soil carbon derived from methane is hypothesized to measurably increase as a result of the gas leak. The known microorganisms that consume methane for energy and carbon occur within distinct phylogenetic lineages, and the soil microbial community (as well as overall carbon flow) is expected to measurably shift as a result of this leak. Specific components of the research to measure such changes include: (1) Detailed monitoring of methane and ethane emissions including air and soil concentrations, during and following the leak. Methods employed to monitor methane levels will include surface instrumentation, spectrometry measurements from air in collaboration with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute of Technology faculty, satellite observations, and field measurements. (2) Regular and frequent targeted sampling of soils during and following the period of active natural gas emission. (3) Identification and characterization of the soil microbial response to methane enrichment. (4) Assessment of changes in the soil microbial community and microeukaryotes associated with input of methane-derived carbon. Laboratory methods for these latter components include microbial community profiling with high throughput sequencing, RNA-based activity assays; DNA-based stable isotope probing with 13CH4 to trace methane derived carbon into the local microbial community, and rate measurements of methane metabolism in laboratory-based chamber incubations of collected soils. Sites surrounding the leak event and background areas will be sampled over a regular time course to track population dynamics during and following the gas leak. Results will be shared among collaborating scientists and rapidly disseminated through scheduled public talks, conference proceedings, and publications. In addition to the research goals, the project will include training opportunities for an undergraduate and a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
