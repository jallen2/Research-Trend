    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for a Conference on Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation in Plants to be held July 14-15, 2016 at the Austin Convention Center in Austin, Texas. The format of the meeting, which includes oral presentations and poster sessions, will provide a highly interactive environment to facilitate the sharing of latest research developments in this exciting field of plant biology. The program will also include career-building opportunities for young and early-career scientists, thus contributing to development of a new generation of plant scientists. The timing of this meeting--immediately after, and at the same site as, the American Society of Plant Biologists' Plant Biology 2016 Conference--is intended to make attendance convenient and affordable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is crucial to many fundamental plant processes, and recent discoveries have highlighted many new regulatory mechanisms impacting pre-mRNA processing, RNA modification, and RNA stability. This conference will provide opportunities for scientists to exchange ideas concerning these new models of gene regulation and their impacts on plant growth and development, including responses to various abiotic and biotic stresses. Discussions will also include novel experimental and computational methods that permit collection and integrative analyses of high throughput data. The conference will have broad impact on scientific career development by promoting participation of women and members of underrepresented groups and by providing early-career researchers with structured opportunities to network and form collaborations with experts in the field.</AbstractNarration>
