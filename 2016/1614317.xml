    <AbstractNarration>This award supports U.S. participants in the XXI Coloquio Latinoamericano de Algebra to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from July 25 to 29, 2016. The meeting is organized by leading algebraists from various universities in Latin America and is open to participants from around the world. The conference will contribute to the development of research by establishing and promoting connections between researchers and universities in and outside Latin America; introduce graduate and advanced undergraduate students to areas of active current research in algebra; disseminate new problems and directions of research; and help young researchers build a network of collaborations. In addition, the meeting presents researchers from the U.S. with the opportunity to interact with colleagues from all over the world and to meet with prospective students from Latin America who may be considering continuing their careers in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebra is a fundamental building block in the edifice of Mathematics. The 13 plenary speakers have been chosen from a select pool of scientists at the forefront of the research in the various disciplines within algebra. Four of them are women. Five are based at US institutions, five are based in Europe and three in Latin America. They all have confirmed their participation. The plenary lectures will be held in the mornings followed by theme-centered parallel sessions in the afternoons, and a poster session. In addition, 4 courses aimed at graduate students and young researchers will be offered during a parallel school (Escuela Santalo).
