    <AbstractNarration>The University of Montana is building a collaborative effort involving three major state universities and a tribal college. Its two main goals are to prepare high school teachers to teach new computer science (CS) courses in a manner that is sustainable over the long-term, and to expand CS curriculum in Montana's high schools with a special focus on improving the diversity of students who engage in CS. This project represents the first of its kind in the state of Montana due to its scope, the partnerships involved, and the potential to expand the number of students introduced to a wide variety of CS topics at an earlier age. The end result promises to be a broader population of high school students who engage with CS, who go on to major in a computing field, and who ultimately land in successful, high-paying and fulfilling professions. This project can change the economy and the future of Montana, and prepare a more diverse group of young people to take over the next generation of computing in our country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To expand the current offerings of CS courses in Montana high schools, this effort includes the Joy and Beauty of Computing (JBC) course developed and piloted at Montana State University and rolled out to Bozeman High School, and a second CS Principles course. Activities shown to improve diversity (mentoring, pair programming, role models, etc.) will be integrated into course offerings, dual credit opportunities will be available for students, and high school teachers will participate in team-teaching arrangements and on-going professional development (PD) workshops. The educational assessment portion of the project centers on the high-level question: Does the two-course CS curriculum broaden interest and participation in high school CS career pathways? A set of sub-questions that focus separately on student participation and teacher participation will guide the data collection and analysis portion of this study. Six critical measures will be used: pre/post surveys, interviews, CS course enrollment data, artifact reviews, classroom observations, and case study. Formative and summative summaries will be provided each year by Cedar Lake Research Group to inform the research.</AbstractNarration>
