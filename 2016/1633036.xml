    <AbstractNarration>Scientific discovery is a collective process based on collaboration, assessment and consensus. But the enormous expansion of scientific research makes it difficult to tell which intellectual efforts forge collective advances. Better models for identifying and tracking scientific movements from the vast collections of articles, books, grants, and patents that compromise scientific and academic work is crucial to improving our nation's ability to make advances in science and industry, helping policy makers, funding agencies, and venture capitalists as well as scientists and scholars themselves. Our project studies innovation by collecting and analyzing texts in vast collections of scientific and other scholarly articles, books, grants and patents. By looking at the subtle patterns of language and how they change over time, we can describe and predict where and when collective trends of knowledge innovation emerge and decline; which scientific ideas and movements result in translational knowledge key to industry and health care; and what the key drivers are for such collective intellectual movements. This work is helping identify where the potential is greatest for innovation, which fields are most primed and receptive to the arrival of new discoveries, and the times and places where resources have the greatest influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on a large dataset of texts the researchers have compiled on US research activity from 1990-2016, including scientific articles, grants, and patents, and by disambiguating and linking mentions of individual people across these datasets. This project uses topic modeling and other natural language processing algorithms to identify distinct intellectual movements in these corpora by drawing on the sub-languages that characterize them, also applying methods to validate and evaluate these movements. This allows the researchers to model the trajectories of movements over time with tools like latent growth mixture modeling and k-spectral clustering, identifying the mechanisms associated with each movement, how they rise and fall over time, and how they translate into industrial or health applications. For example, the project studies how the trajectory of intellectual movements is a function of their environment and competing research efforts, and show the ways in which it depends on the timing and magnitude of key resources (e.g., money, recognition, new recruits and trainees, social networks of support, or the coherence of the knowledge itself). In such a fashion, this work is an important first step in unraveling the recipe for innovation as a collective, episodic process.</AbstractNarration>
