    <AbstractNarration>The manufacture and assembly of three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures which can provide significant new capabilities for science and technology are challenging to achieve using existing engineering methods. This Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) award seeks to utilize theoretical and experimental approaches to develop and optimize cost-effective methods to create large numbers of precisely patterned and integrated 3D-nanostructures with high quality device grade materials such as silicon, compound semiconductors or piezeoelectric ceramics. 3D nanomanufacturing by imprint and strain engineering (3D NISE) is a new methodology to enable cost effective nanomanufacturing by combining methods to pattern and manipulate properties in thin films at the nanoscale. The proposed interdisciplinary research will be infused into coursework via new curriculum elements in design, modelling and manufacturing. The project will facilitate research experiences for undergraduate and K-12 students and make a special effort to include students from underrepresented groups. In addition, through hosting research experiences, creating travelling exhibits, multimedia and by interactions with the press, 3D NISE will attempt to excite the appeal of advanced nanomanufacturing to the broader public and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award seeks to combine top-down stamp based parallel patterning and transfer processes with bottom-up paradigm of self-assembly via curving, bending, buckling and folding to form 3D nanostructures in a highly parallel and cost-effective manner. The research seeks to incorporate parallel planar patterning processes into 3D assembly processes; build in material heterogeneity specially to create functional devices such as transistors, sensors, analog, antennas, optoelectronic and energy harvesting / storage elements and investigate and optimize the manufacturing process. The project will utilize a systematic approach driven by design, mechanics multiscale modelling and simulations to enable structures to be created using computer models for increased precision, tunability and yield. Significant engineering and material challenges will be overcome to develop this reproducible fabrication paradigm including the development of high-throughput transfer and molding protocols, modules for alignment, statistical design of experiments, theoretical models that link the nanoscale to the macroscale while accounting for the underlying physics at different scales, manipulation of adhesion, and defect metrology.</AbstractNarration>
