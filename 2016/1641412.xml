    <AbstractNarration>This project supports hosting a Global Environment for Network innovations (GENI) Regional Workshop (GRW) on May 23, 2016 at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. The intent of this GRW is to continue to broaden the GENI user community, introducing new educators and researchers in the northeastern US geographic region to GENI. Four GRWs in total are planned for 2016, one held about every three months (i.e., March (most recent workshop), May (this workshop), September, and December), scattered geographically across the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed GRW will promote innovations in research (e.g., network science, security, services, and applications) and education (e.g., the development of new coursework assignments and projects using the GENI infrastructure). The workshop will enable participants to engage in a range of activities designed to improve their understanding of and expertise in: &lt;br/&gt;1) Resources available for utilizing GENI in undergraduate and graduate education. &lt;br/&gt;2) Utilizing the GENI infrastructure in experimental research, including state-of-the-art developments in wired, wireless, cloud computing, software defined networking, and network function virtualization. &lt;br/&gt;3) Working through a variety of "hands on" tutorials, obtaining network and compute resources at locations around the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop serves as a venue for the exchange of ideas, a discussion of challenges of experimentation in research and classroom settings, and a showcase for technology experimentation on GENI.</AbstractNarration>
