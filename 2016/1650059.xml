    <AbstractNarration>Bacteria interact with their environments, and with each other, at the chemical level. A methodology called mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for the imaging of chemical distributions, but standard MSI platforms lack the spatial resolution needed to examine the chemical exchange between microbes in microbiome contexts, e.g. the scale of single bacterial cells or groups of cells. The HSR-MSI platform and accompanying protocols the researchers develop will provide a critical new tool for advancing our understanding of the basic biological and chemical mechanisms that govern microbiome function, namely the exchange of metabolites at the scale of single microbes in situ. As such, the project directly addresses the critical gap in tools available to identify the metabolic activities specific to particular microbes within a microbiome, and seeks to facilitate the elucidation of biochemical communication between microbes, and between microbes and their hosts. The researchers are well-equipped to undertake the proposed activities since 1) they have direct access to a dedicated high-resolution mass spectrometer for long-term experimentation and 2) they have training that spans the disciplines of microbiology, mass spectrometry (including MSI), and ecology. The integrated HSR-MSI system and protocols that they develop will be readily implementable in any facility with a comparable high-resolution mass spectrometer. To facilitate this goal, their efforts will utilize components with minimal hardware modifications and lead to a set of easily implementable protocols for standardized sample preparation. Doing so ensures that their advances can be rapidly adopted by the broader scientific community engaged in microbiome research. One postdoctoral fellow will gain interdisciplinary training in microbiome analysis and innovative MSI techniques. Starting in the fall of 2016, the researchers will partner with the UC Berkeley Biology Scholars Program (BSP), which works to make scientific careers accessible to students from diverse backgrounds. Over the past 20 years, there have been ~2000 BSP graduates; and 80% are from low-income backgrounds and/or are the first in their family to attend college. This fall, the BSP is piloting a new initiative called the Program for Early Researchers, which provides stipends, travel funds, and a limited research budget to enable URM undergraduates to become involved in research for the first time. The investigators will recruit at least two URM undergraduate students each year, for the two-year funding period. These students will be immersed in cutting-edge microbiome research while working closely with the postdoctoral scholar whose primary research activities are outlined in this application. Additionally, the PI will serve as a pro-active mentor to these students throughout the academic year, and continue to engage with them as they consider and apply for graduate schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop a widely accessible version of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) with spatial resolution sufficient to visualize chemicals originating from single bacterial cells, and a set of companion protocols for robust chemical imaging of microbiomes. In support of the first goal, the researchers will optimize the performance of a newly developed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) source. This source uses enhanced laser optics and ion funnel technology to dramatically boost instrument sensitivity. The researchers will systematically optimize the laser, vacuum, sample voltage, ion funnel, and other parameters to obtain the maximum spatial resolution achievable with this source, which is theoretically capable of detecting chemicals made by single bacterial cells. In support of the second goal, the researchers will develop a standardized set of protocols that facilitate both the identification of individual bacterial cells via microscopy, and optimized application of MALDI sample matrix that insures high-quality, reproducible results with high-spatial-resolution (HSR) MSI. As a test plant/microbiome system, the researchers will use legume root nodules that contain a relatively simple bacterial community, which includes multiple members with specialized metabolisms. This system is ideal in that it represents a tractable model microbiome for study with HSR-MSI, is chemically complex, and is of agricultural importance.</AbstractNarration>
