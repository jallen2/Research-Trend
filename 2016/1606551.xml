    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will be held in Lyon, France, and will bring together international experts from the US and France to discuss advancements in cyberinfrastructure (CI). The specific focus will be on commonalities that exist between cluster, cloud, and data analytics computing. CI has become of growing importance to nearly all NSF research, which makes increasing use of computational simulation and large-data analysis methods. The results will be published in an open report as well as in several journal papers. They will contribute to and leverage new ideas in cluster, cloud, and data analytics computing for the benefit of the research community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The architectural similarities between the above issues, and the fact that high performance clusters typically make up the major compute nodes of computational grids and clouds, means that deployment, operational, and usage issues surrounding computational clouds form a superset of the issues that revolve around clusters. The workshop will discuss topics such as extreme scale performance and related software development issues, common protocols and APIs necessary to facilitate seamless movement, recombination and analysis of large data flows, creating dramatically easier programming paradigms for highly parallel systems, creating tools that can support application development in highly virtualized environments, and system management problems that arise in multicore-heterogeneous architectures and data intensive applications.</AbstractNarration>
