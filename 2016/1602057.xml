    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating recently developed technology for the regeneration of damaged dentin and pulp tissue, which is needed for the cure of dentin hypersensitivity (DH). DH is a dental condition that inflicts severe pain in majority of people sometime during their lifetime. The currently available products attempt only to treat the symptoms temporarily, and there is no lasting cure of the problem. This project focuses on nano-macro porous glass fabrication technology and applying a new class of bioactive materials to the regeneration of dental tissue. The resulting glasses, which have tailored amorphous multiporous (TAMP) structure, promote the growth of bone as well as soft tissue. The project will result in new TAMP compositions and establish their potential for the regeneration of damaged dentin and pulp tissue to cure DH. The selected TAMP powders that comprise of interconnected nano-macro porosity, which can be tailored to desired surface area, have the unique potential to cure the problem at its source. Consequently, when placed inside the body, a TAMP powder of appropriate composition can supply therapeutic ions in a controlled manner, providing a microenvironment that is expected to occlude dentin tubules to stop the painful symptoms more effectively than currently available products. More importantly, the new TAMP powders are also expected to stimulate tissue regeneration by the cells for a lasting cure. In contrast, the present products in this market space, available over the counter or by prescription, make no attempt to regenerate damaged tissue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. A simple TAMP powder based on calcium silicate has shown proliferation of bone forming cells in laboratory tests and also regeneration of bone and soft tissue regeneration under in vivo tests in animals. However, a demonstration of its ability to regenerate dental tissue (dentin and pulp) has been lacking. The project attempts to obtain evidence for the therapeutic capabilities of TAMP powder for dental tissue regeneration, and thereafter prepare it for clinical trials. It is also developing new compositions that combine the benefits of different treatments in one product. For example, novel TAMP powders with fluoride, zinc and potassium ions embedded within the molecular structure of silicate glass are being fabricated, to provide a lasting supply of fluoride ions at the site of DH, zinc ions that promote regeneration, and potassium ions that desensitize pain-sensing nerves. Further, tests are being performed to assess in vitro differentiation of dental pulp stem cells, and in vivo formation of pulp-dentin complex on TAMP silicates implanted in a mouse model. With this knowledge compositions are optimized for more adherent and faster developing occlusion layer as well as pulp-dentin tissue regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology translation from research discovery toward commercial reality is a team effort led by a glass scientist who developed the TAMP fabrication technology portfolio under prior NSF supported research, together with an endodontist with expertise in dental tissue regeneration, a cell biologist with expertise in cell response to TAMP materials, and a healthcare industry expert with experience in the early stage commercialization of biomedical products. During its course the project is directly training three graduate students in use-inspired research and practical problem-solving through a cross-disciplinary approach that combines materials engineering, cell biology and dental science. The combination of innovative TAMP technology and its potential societal impact has drawn much general student interest, which will be further expanded through more definitive results of this project.</AbstractNarration>
