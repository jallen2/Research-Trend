    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who need to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Howard University will conduct research to investigate the evolution and origin of reproductive systems in plants. The project will enhance the research capabilities of the PI as well as teaching and learning at Howard University. Undergraduate students will benefit from the collaborations with university and National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) partners and the research experiences and training in plant sciences. The project has the potential to be a model for increasing the number of African Americans in plant sciences and support the nation's efforts in building a robust STEM workforce by engaging students early in their career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the evolution and origin of reproductive systems in plants, using Rumex as a model. Specific objectives are to: 1) determine the occurrence of different reproductive systems within the genus, 2) form a phylogenetic hypothesis of the evolution of these reproductive systems, and 3) revise infrageneric classification based on phylogenetic data. The project will undertake a global, comprehensive study of one large genus, Rumex. Findings from this study will include a well-sampled, robust phylogeny for the genus Rumex. A phylogenetic basis will allow for testing of evolutionary hypotheses and character reconstruction. In addition, a phylogenetic framework will provide a reference to test the monophyly of numerous subgeneric classification systems, and test the support for recognition of segregate genera. The global approach will produce a taxonomic and nomenclatural reference for Rumex. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History (NMNH).</AbstractNarration>
