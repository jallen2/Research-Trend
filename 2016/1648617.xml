    <AbstractNarration>To promote the progress of science, the STEM community needs to identify and develop the next generation of scientists by engaging students in premier scientific conferences. IEEE Cluster conference series, an international event for presenting the research results, problem solutions, and insights on new challenges in high performance computing in general and cluster computing in particular, has been pursuing this mission by seeking to increase student participation in the conference and the cluster computing field. To this end, the student program at the Cluster conference has taken a new form -- it now provides a comprehensive means for students to improve their overall research skills and planning rather than just presenting posters and papers. By attending the student program, students can now obtain unique experiences and interactions with academic and industry researchers in the cluster computing community. By presenting their own work in special sessions, students receive valuable feedback from both fellow students and experienced researchers working in the field of cluster computing. By meeting with the authors of candidate best papers, students are given the opportunity to learn about the latest research results in their area, and to explore interest in new areas of cluster computing. The overall exposure to research through the IEEE Cluster student program promotes foundational understanding of scientific methods, which will serve the students well throughout their careers, and is aligned with NSF's mission of promoting progress of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the travel of up to 20 students from US-based institutions to participate in the student program at IEEE Cluster 2017. The student program at IEEE Cluster 2017 will include multiple sessions scheduled during the lunch breaks and after the end of the regular sessions. The sessions will target research presentation training, research experience and career guidance, industry interaction, and feedback from the best paper candidates. Travel grants will particularly encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. Particular effort will be made to solicit applications for the travel support from female students and students from under-represented communities by reaching out to graduate programs of computer science and engineering departments at universities who are members of the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science (GEM).</AbstractNarration>
