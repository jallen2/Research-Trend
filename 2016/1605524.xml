    <AbstractNarration>The project will convert the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) to chemical and fuel products utilizing electrocatalysis in combination with liquid-phase CO2 media known as Carbon dioxide eXpanded Liquids (CXLs). Capture and valorization of CO2 produced by combustion processes is one of the greatest technological challenges faced by society. The project represents a new approach that concentrates CO2 via CXLs, thereby improving the selectivity and faradaic efficiency of the electocatalytic process leading to product generation. This innovation overcomes the key challenge of processing dilute gaseous CO2, and enables development of a practical process for converting CO2 to value-added products. The project will broadly train graduate and undergraduate students in electrochemistry, materials science, and reaction engineering, and will share the importance of managing emissions of greenhouse gases with elementary school children through summer science camp experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will develop the first proof-of-concept demonstration of electrochemical cells that interface the traditional three-electrode configuration of physical electrochemistry with reactors designed to allow generation of CXLs from solvents pressurized with CO2. Fundamental research on these new conditions will reveal how CXLs influence the rates and selectivities of CO2 reduction, important considerations because CO2 serves as both the reactant and a co-solvent. This approach is expected to overcome the major challenges that hinder electrochemical CO2 conversion: CO2 starvation and parasitic proton reduction (i.e., generation of hydrogen gas). More broadly, the research has potential to transform the field by expanding the range of catalytic materials and electrolytes that can be deployed in CXL media. By paving the way for effective CO2 utilization both as co-solvent and reactant, the CXL-based technology will contribute to the reduction of global warming and the adverse effects of climate change, while easing industrial dependence on fossil fuels. Educational aspects will include the recruitment of underrepresented groups through existing and new partnerships with Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCU). Results from this research will be used to develop case studies for current graduate and undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
