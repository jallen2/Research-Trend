    <AbstractNarration>This "NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Program (S-STEM)" project at Prairie View A&amp;M University (PVAMU), an HBCU, will serve the financial, academic, and career needs of talented low income students pursuing bachelor degrees in engineering, computer science, or technology. The project will directly support 30 students with one cohort of 15 students beginning in year 1 and a second cohort of 15 students beginning in year 2. Scholarships will help ease the financial burdens that many minority students face, and targeted support structures will help ensure student success. A multi-pronged strategy consisting of cohort building, academic support, professional development, mentoring, and individual advisory teams for students will be used improve student learning and increase retention and graduation rates. Congruent with NSF S-STEM program goals, the project will add to the University's and national efforts to increase the number of minority students graduating with STEM degrees thus supporting a more diverse and competent United States workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental goal of the project is to increase the number of underrepresented minority students who graduate with undergraduate degrees in STEM fields and to enhance the preparedness of these students for diverse STEM workforce career paths and graduate education. A research study examining student motivation, self-efficacy, and STEM identity development will be an integral component of the project. The research will utilize an interpretive narrative design and will involve qualitative studies focusing on the activities and experiences of program participants. Findings will provide insights into interventions that are successful in helping minority students navigate the path to engineering and other STEM careers and flourish in those careers. An evaluation plan using a mixed quantitative and qualitative methods approach will measure the effectiveness of the program and its impact on student performance and graduation and retention efforts. Tangible data and results will be generated from the project that support recruitment, retention, and workforce diversification and broadening participation efforts for this student demographic. Key outcomes of the project will be broadly disseminated through a variety of venues.</AbstractNarration>
