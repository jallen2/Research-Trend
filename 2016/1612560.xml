    <AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion. Academic and professional preparations are essential for building a diverse, dynamic, and innovative STEM workforce in the United States. The challenge of recruiting and retaining students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in STEM careers continues to confront the academic community. Oklahoma State University, lead institution of the Oklahoma LSAMP (OK-LSAMP), is uniquely situated to overcome this challenge due to its centralized location within the state and the prominent presence of Native American tribal nations across Oklahoma, as well as the increase of the Hispanic population, not only in Oklahoma but nationwide. The OK-LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) initiative will ensure that a new cadre of STEM professionals from diverse backgrounds is fully prepared for successful careers, in the nation's workforce, including the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OK-LSAMP-BD will implement: (i) enhanced recruitment strategies, including partnerships with HBCUs and Tribal Colleges, as well as the extensive use of available social media, newsletters, community and national outreach; (ii) mentoring and networking programs across STEM departments; and (iii) courses, workshops, and seminars supporting academic and professional development of the BD Fellows. In addition, a BD Advisory Board of diverse OSU faculty will be responsible for providing input on programmatic activities. Board members will have the opportunity to serve as mentors, presenters at monthly BD meetings, or discussants about common research related topics and key issues in graduate degree attainment.</AbstractNarration>
