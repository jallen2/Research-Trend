    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the structure and chemical makeup of the human brain has remained an enduring intellectual challenge for more than a century. More recently, the nation has devoted considerable resources, tools, and efforts to advancing knowledge of the brain, as exemplified by the White House BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies). While a number of projects have been undertaken to explore specific directions, from fundamental science to a greater understanding of human health, the role of chemistry in meeting this grand challenge is underexplored. This workshop brings together leading stakeholders in the chemical and measurement sciences with those in the neurosciences. The goal is to examine and articulate a path forward for creating new chemistry tools, representing varied experiences and disciplines. Given the central role of the brain as a key topic in modern society, science, and research, the subject of this workshop presents a rich opportunity for achieving broad impact by bringing together a multidisciplinary group of scientists. Together they are providing unique perspectives and creating a research blueprint for the role of chemistry in advancing neuroscience over the coming decade. The results of the workshop are disseminated widely through web publication of both technical and lay reports. A workshop summary and other outcomes are disseminated via symposia organized at analytical chemistry and neuroscience meetings so as to make both communities aware of the workshop results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advancing the understanding of the brain has become a significant challenge using a considerable fraction of the nation's research efforts, as exemplified by the multi-institutional efforts of the BRAIN Initiative. From fundamental science to a greater understanding of human health, the charge has been led by the biological sciences. With unprecedented knowledge and measurement tools, now is the time to chart a strategic path forward in terms of the roles that the chemistry community can play in helping to meet this grand challenge. This workshop generates a plan to enable new understanding of brain organization, activity, and function across the metazoan. The output is a targeted set of goals, outlining opportunities and novel directions for neuroscience within the chemical sciences. Furthermore, it identifies areas of focus and the investments required to address the chemical and measurement challenges over the coming decade. As an example, the full parts list of the brain is still unknown, much less how, when, and where these parts work together. Obtaining this information represents a major analytical frontier. The workshop is identifying such challenges and proposing strategies that are at the heart of advances in chemical measurements.</AbstractNarration>
