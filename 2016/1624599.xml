    <AbstractNarration>This project advances the utility, performance, and sustainability of the wood composite products used to build American homes and consumer products. The subject matter, composite materials derived from wood, is often overlooked because for the average person wood composites are as commonplace as trees themselves. However for the scientist, wood is an incredibly complex biomaterial for which contemporary scientific methods are now revealing insights that lead to better performance for the homeowner, improved efficiency for the industry, and greater sustainability for society. At Oregon State University, Department of Wood Science &amp; Engineering, we believe a sustainable society must include timber products and the future requires a marriage between this ancient material and the most sophisticated scientific and technological methods. The IUCRC for Wood-Based Composites is a team effort among three critical partners: industry, federal government, and academia. The federal government joins the partners into a mutually beneficial collaboration that leverages resources and skills. The industry defines the ever-changing technological challenges, and guides the required research. Academia conducts the research with students that employ cutting edge methods within a practical context. At Oregon State University, we provide expertise for design of wood-based composites, manufacturing efficiency, and evaluation of product performance. Along with our partner, Virginia Tech, we provide industry-directed, pre-competitive research, and a pathway for students to become future leaders in sustainable U.S. manufacturing, innovation, and management positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science and technology of wood composites continually evolves as the industry adapts to changing economic cycles, legislative pressures, and raw material supplies. Consequently the goal is to advance knowledge in adhesives, adhesion, wood/adhesive interactions, and wood chemistry as these topics influence wood rheology, heat and mass transfer, and fracture mechanics while processing wood, manufacturing composites, and evaluating product performance. A parallel goal is to identify fundamental phenomena, and reduce them to definable quantities that may be described numerically for purposes of modeling, simulation, and performance prediction. At Oregon State University, we focus on the materials science of wood in the context of the design, manufacture and performance of wood-based composites. We offer expertise in various microscopy techniques (electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, micro X-ray computed tomography), composite manufacture, accelerated weathering, and numerical modeling to study adhesive bonding, as well as micro- and macro-scale product performance.</AbstractNarration>
