    <AbstractNarration>1604471 PI: Tenhaeff&lt;br/&gt;Title: Solid Polymer Thin Film Electrolytes to Enable 3D Lithium Ion Batteries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The miniaturization of microelectronic devices and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has enabled the development of multi-billion dollar industries that commercialized remarkable technologies, including distributed sensors, implantable biomedical devices, wearable electronics, and "the internet of things". Three-dimensional lithium ion batteries (3D batteries) are envisioned as incredibly flexible energy storage devices to power the next generation of ubiquitous microelectronic devices and MEMS. The fabrication of 3D batteries requires breakthroughs in the preparation of ultrathin, solid-state electrolytes. This project focuses on the understanding and controlling polymer thin film synthesis via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) to enable precise fabrication of electrolyte materials for 3D batteries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key scientific objective of the proposed project is to understand how the chemical, physical, and electrochemical properties of ultrathin polymer electrolytes must be synthetically controlled via iCVD to achieve stable, reversible electrochemical cycling in solid-state 3D lithium ion batteries. These ultrathin polymer electrolytes will be subsequently integrated into two-dimensional thin film batteries in order to further understand materials requirements imposed by the energy storage electrodes and thin film processing. The ultimate objective is to fabricate complete, full 3D battery cells and study the influence of 3D architectures on electrochemical performance and correlated effects. Optimization of materials and cell designs will be performed to maximize 3D battery performance. New insights into fundamental structure-property-function relations emerging from the proposed study may have significant potential to advance the fabrication of 3D batteries as well as a wide range of other devices. The PI plans to train graduate students, engage undergraduate students in research, and develop a new iCVD module for the undergraduate Reaction Engineering and Reactor Design course. A proposed outreach effort will focus on engaging underrepresented minority students from the Rochester City School District.</AbstractNarration>
