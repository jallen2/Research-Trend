    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed research is to greatly improve our ability to understand and predict&lt;br/&gt;space weather hazards to (1) electric power grids; and (2) electromagnetic wave propagation in&lt;br/&gt;the Earth-ionosphere waveguide up to ~20 kHz. The methodology of the proposed work is to&lt;br/&gt;advance and apply detailed, high-resolution Maxwell's equations models of the Earth-ionosphere&lt;br/&gt;waveguide developed by the project over the past decade. The project's three-dimensional (3-D) models&lt;br/&gt;uniquely include such details as the Earth?s complete topography, oceans, lithosphere&lt;br/&gt;composition, geomagnetic field, and ionospheric plasma. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research study is unique as existing analytical formulations or computational&lt;br/&gt;approaches applied to the investigated topics above do not solve the complete Maxwell's&lt;br/&gt;equations while also accounting for all of the 3-D geometrical details and time variability as&lt;br/&gt;permitted by the project's models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 2008 National Academies report indicates that extreme space&lt;br/&gt;weather events, "though rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future." However, a re-occurrence&lt;br/&gt;of an 1859-magnitude CME-driven geomagnetic storm could disrupt today's human&lt;br/&gt;society to a much greater degree than in 1859 due to the proliferation of vital but vulnerable&lt;br/&gt;electro-technologies. The first goal of the proposed modeling is to help individual power grid&lt;br/&gt;stations understand their specific vulnerability to space weather. The second goal of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed modeling is to help improve our understanding of electromagnetic propagation in the&lt;br/&gt;Earth-ionosphere waveguide under disturbed conditions. Applications that may benefit from this&lt;br/&gt;work include: remote sensing of the lower ionosphere, hypothesized electromagnetic earthquake&lt;br/&gt;precursors, propagation from lightning, geolocation, communications, and even global&lt;br/&gt;temperature change.</AbstractNarration>
