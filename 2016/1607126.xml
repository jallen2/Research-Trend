    <AbstractNarration>Particle physics is the study of Nature at its most fundamental level. Great strides have been made in recent decades, elucidating the key structure of matter and the forces that govern most of the familiar world. Yet more remains unknown and unexplained, and the modern theory of matter and forces, despite its remarkable successes, is thought to be but an approximation to some broader, deeper theory as yet undiscovered. The dark matter that holds the universe together is unexplained; the masses of fundamental particles are unexplained; even the existence of matter itself is unexplained. This project will both use and extend the capabilities of the large "Compact Muon Solenoid" (CMS) particle detector, which operates at the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN Laboratory in Switzerland, to seek evidence of a larger, more encompassing understanding of the universe and its contents, and in so doing, further the progress of fundamental science. Much of the research work is done by students, both graduate students and undergraduates, and the education and technical training they receive in this process ensures they can make robust contributions to society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing and new data produced by the CMS experiment will be studied for possible indications of dark matter production, new heavy bosons, and supersymmetry, as well as for refined measurements of known particles, particularly the top quark, and measurements of as-yet-unobserved processes such as the production of a Higgs boson in conjunction with two top quarks. To extend CMS capabilities, research and development for upgrades to the silicon pixel tracking devices and the trigger will be conducted. Detector upgrades are needed to exploit the full potential of the next accelerator upgrade, known as the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. Detectors and electronics, together with supporting software and firmware, will be prototyped and studied to establish both the design and construction techniques for the upgrade and to solve the myriad technical challenges that are anticipated.</AbstractNarration>
