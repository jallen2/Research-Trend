    <AbstractNarration>There is a growing movement known as the Internet of Things which involve creating a massive network of interconnected smart devices. This includes everything from self-driving cars to refrigerators that can communicate directly with one?s smartphone. This will enable the automation of many different types of jobs, improving the efficiency in practically every of industry. Wearable tech and automated kiosks are examples of early adopters of this type of technology. However, before this concept can take full effect, sensor technology needs to be optimized and become more affordable. Devices use sensors to interact with the world around them, much like how a person uses their five senses to interact with the environment. In many cases, in order to automate a certain task, the computer or automation device needs to be equipped with different types of sensors. The sensors need to be small enough to be inconspicuous, yet should require little power to operate. Ideally they would be powered without any external power source. Currently, the materials and processing steps are too many and pose a barrier for widespread adoption. This project aims to significantly reduce the cost of sensor manufacturing when it includes items such as solar cells, light emitting devices, or photodetectors. Immediate adopters of the technology would be sensor manufacturing companies. Benefits of this technology include new types of smart devices which could improve business to business and machine to machine informational networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its core, the proposed technology is a method of integrating optoelectronic devices with conventional silicon CMOS chips using nanostructures. The process developed by this team involves depositing a polycrystalline film on top of an existing logic chip, and growing the optically active device directly on top. This both makes the sensor thinner and eliminates costly wire-bonding steps. Through the customer discovery portion of the project the team hopes to achieve two things: to identify its customer base and commercialization method, and to identify a viable product offering. The customer discovery process will help the team determine which market will be easiest to enter at its current stage. The team members plan on interviewing both major and minor players in both fields. Another goal for this project is to identify the type of optoelectronic device the team should prototype.</AbstractNarration>
