    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to Brigham Young University to purchase a PacBio Sequel Single-Molecule, Real-time (SMRT) Sequencer-the latest in single-molecule sequencing-to benefit faculty, undergraduate, and graduate student research and education at BYU and BYU-Hawaii, and to implement an outreach program designed to educate underrepresented minorities in science through BYU's deep connection into Polynesian cultures. BYU has one of the most vibrant undergraduate research programs in the world, involving students directly in research early in their education. BYU's undergraduate research program also includes concerted efforts to involve students from underrepresented minorities. Additionally, the BYU program has arranged an exciting collaboration with Pacific Heritage Academy in Salt Lake City to perform sequencing studies on species endemic to their native Hawaii. Having a PacBio Sequel System will make BYU a major SMRT sequencing and educational hub for faculty, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in the intermountain west region of the United States&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With new technologies such as the PacBio Sequel System, it is now possible to accomplish what was previously unfeasible. This new technology dramatically improves or enables researchers to: (1) construct more complete genomes, (2) identify large genetic mutations, and (3) resolve unknown aspects of gene expression, amongst many other exciting applications. Researchers across the intermountain west will have easy access to this breakthrough technology to advance genomic understanding from numerous non-model organisms, and to develop needed computational algorithms.</AbstractNarration>
