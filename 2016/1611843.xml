    <AbstractNarration>The biology and chemistry faculty of New Jersey City University will institute a new laboratory curriculum exploring the concept of "course clusters". These are logical, cross-disciplinary groupings of advanced undergraduate courses that span both biology and chemistry. Students within a cluster will work collaboratively to pursue a single common project using their respective laboratory components, regardless of which course they are enrolled in. This will model a cross-functional, authentic research experience involving multiple disciplines to solve a real-world problem, as is done in an industrial setting. Students will interact with each other in a collaborative environment and develop the skills needed for the STEM workforce. Due to the diverse nature of students at New Jersey City University, the project will increase the number and diversity of students pursuing STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a unique methodology to improve and broaden the scope of the biology and chemistry laboratory curriculum. The course clusters will form an integrated approach to addressing real-world research topics in an undergraduate setting. This approach mirrors the paradigm utilized by research-driven organizations to solve problems, so students will develop both the technical skills and the soft skills required to be workforce-ready upon graduation. Working with a project evaluator, the investigators will generate new evidence regarding how course-clustering increases student understanding of fundamental scientific principles, and how it influences non-cognitive student outcomes. The expected outcomes include improved self-efficacy, retention and graduation rates, satisfaction with the curriculum for both students and faculty, and placement in industrial positions and graduate schools. Program success will be assessed using validated survey tools and compared to historical data.</AbstractNarration>
