    <AbstractNarration>The most defining feature of conflict between groups is also the most challenging to address: the suffering and perpetration of violence. Intergroup violence inflicts collective trauma for both victims and perpetrators, albeit in different ways. A growing field of research identifies such past experiences of trauma as an obstacle to conflict resolution. The collective memory of past trauma that implicates another group can facilitate and escalate conflict with that group long after those events. Understanding such issues may help society develop more peaceful interactions between groups in conflict within a society as well as between nations. Investigators in the U.S. along with investigators in Israel test a comprehensive theoretical approach that links collective trauma and future intergroup violence. One prediction is that both victims and perpetuators can perceive their group's collective trauma in similar ways: as either a threat, creating demands which outstrip one's ability to handle it; or as a challenge, strongly demanding but which can be overcome and result in positive outcomes. Cardiovascular research suggests that challenge responses involve healthier physiological states and more adaptive behavior than do threat responses. In the case of collective trauma, the stress response may have tremendous societal impact as well--by causing defense motivations that result in conflict escalation for all involved. In their project the investigators test the hypothesis that the determining factor in perceiving trauma as threat versus challenge is in-group glorification, or people's deference to their own group and tendency to view it as superior to other groups. By testing these hypotheses, this research can generate knowledge that could improve societal outcomes related to large-scale conflict. In addition, the project may inform efforts to develop evidence-based interventions that deal with collective trauma and the violence that stems from it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight studies address four primary objectives. One aim is to understand how collective trauma perceptions can differ in ways that escalate or deescalate conflict. Among perpetrators, those who glorify their group should see their group's collective trauma of perpetrating violence as a threat to the group's image, whereas those who do not glorify their group should see it as a challenge. Among victims, those who glorify their group should see their group's collective trauma of suffering violence as a threat to the group's existence, whereas others should see it as a challenge and potential for growth. The second aim is exploring how historical representations of trauma affect motivation and intention to act. Cognitive representations of past trauma in terms of threat should make people defensive and take measures that ultimately facilitate future violence. Representing past trauma in terms of challenge should reduce defensive behavior and ultimately prevent future violence. The third aim is testing whether individuals with different historical representations of trauma have cardiovascular responses that reflect threat versus challenge stress responses. The fourth aim is determining whether experimental manipulations can shift threat representations into becoming challenge representations. To test these aims, the investigators use multiple methods, including self-report measures and impedance cardiography. Research participants are from multiple countries that have experienced collective trauma. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international component of this research was supported by co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>
