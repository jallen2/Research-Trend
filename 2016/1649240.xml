    <AbstractNarration>This project will address broadening participation challenges concerning underrepresented minority students seeking STEM degrees at institutions of higher education in Southern California. Data show that Latino students in particular are well-represented at local two-year colleges (TYC) but less well-represented among STEM bachelor's degree recipients. In order to promote success for TYC students with an interest in STEM, the project will build upon and expand the model for strengthening transfer pathways from TYC to four year STEM degree programs developed through the current program Strengthening Transfer Education and Matriculation in STEM at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). The pilot will focus on replicating the most effective components of the CSUF model at California Polytechnic State University Pomona (CPP). The pilot project will target STEM students at Citrus College, a two-year college (TYC) in Glendora, CA that feeds both CSUF and CPP. If the pilot is successful, it could be expanded to additional Southern California campuses of the CSU system and regional TYCs whose students transfer to these campuses. Once the most effective elements of the model are identified, the model could be adopted by all twenty-three campuses in the CSU system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project targets students who have already expressed interest in STEM careers, seeking to improve the rates at which they persist in higher education, transfer to four-year institutions, and eventually enter the STEM workforce. The project builds upon a proven model, seeking to examine the conditions under which this model can be replicated at institutions with different cultures and constraints, to develop better understanding of the elements of the model most essential for success, and to establish partnerships and create a pilot of the model at another institution. This project will increase the reach of an intervention model with a proven track record and documented positive outcomes. These interventions include an undergraduate research experience for the TYC students, peer mentoring at both the TYC and the four-year institution, a transfer support program at both the TYC and the four-year institution, and required advising and co-curricular activities.</AbstractNarration>
