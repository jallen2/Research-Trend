    <AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to engage in a philosophical conceptual analysis of the wave function in quantum theories. The investigator proposes to develop a realistic interpretation in which the wave function is understood as providing a straightforward, objective description of the world. Erwin Schrodinger initially proposed such an interpretation in the early days of quantum mechanics, but it was rejected soon thereafter. Physicists and philosophers of physics have been divided since then on whether such an interpretation is possible. Some argue that although quantum mechanics generates predictions that are consistent with observed phenomena, it is wrongheaded to interpret it as providing a straightforward, objective description of the inhabited world. Others argue that it is not so much that quantum mechanics is not the right kind of theory to provide an objective description, but that quantum mechanics implies such bizarre things; it is impossible to truly grasp and understand it. Still others have attempted to develop intelligible interpretations; however, none of them have been widely embraced by the physics community. No doubt, scientists are very skilled at using quantum mechanics and other quantum theories, but providing an interpretation that facilitates understanding is something else entirely. The investigator will address two obstacles to providing a realistic interpretation of the wave function. Her doing so will serve to promote understanding of what is often considered incomprehensible. It would capture the imagination of the public, sparking further interest and engagement with science. The project will involve the full participation of the investigator, a woman, in the STEM field of physics, thereby contributing to a diverse STEM workforce and providing a role model in a discipline in which women are under-represented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interpretation to be developed in this project, called wave function realism, was taken up again in the 1990s by the philosopher of physics David Albert. It is now becoming more widely evaluated as it becomes better understood. It has the potential to provide an intelligible, even visualizable account of quantum reality. However, there are two glaring problems with it. First, wave function realism has thus far been developed only in the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, opening it up to objections that it may not be viable as an interpretation of relativistic quantum field theories. The second problem is that many find it difficult to see how the picture of fundamental reality offered by this interpretation is capable of capturing the existence of ordinary material objects in the way they seem to exist to human observers. This project will respond to both of these concerns by developing an extension of wave function realism apt for interpreting quantum field theories, and by using conceptual frameworks developed in contemporary metaphysics and philosophy of physics to provide a novel and persuasive account of the relationship between the quantum wave function and observable macroscopic objects. Satisfying these goals will constitute a substantial step in the development of wave function realism and could help bring physicists that much closer to determining whether wave function realism is the correct approach to understanding quantum theories.</AbstractNarration>
