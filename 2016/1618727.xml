    <AbstractNarration>Existing wireless networks rely on closed and inflexible architectures that often limit and delay the adoption of new wireless networking technologies. The notion of software defined networking (SDN) has therefore been recently introduced to simplify network control and to make it easier to introduce and deploy new applications and services. However, to date, existing SDN architectures are far from fulfilling the requirements of next-generation wireless networks. This project proposes a radically different approach to SDN for next-generation wireless cellular networks. At the core, it will try to develop a principled theory and practice of software-defined wireless networking for next generation cellular networks based on cross-layer optimization theory. The project is expected to bridge the gap between SDN and distributed network optimization/control; lead to simplified control plane that does not rely on any centralized control entity; finally, considerably ease the burden of network engineers that will be able to control and manage the network operations without in-depth understanding of distributed optimization concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the core building principles of a Wireless Cellular Operating System (WiCOS). WiCOS will provide the network designer with a set of abstractions hiding the low-level details of the network operations as well as details of their distributed implementation, thus providing the network designer with a centralized view abstracting the network functionalities at a high level. Based on this abstract representation, WiCOS will take centralized control programs written on a high-level view of the network and automatically generate distributed cross-layer control programs based on optimization theory that are executed at the network edge by each individual network element on an abstract, common representation of the radio hardware. The goals will be accomplished by executing four research tasks: WiCOS architecture design; automated network control problem decomposition; programmable protocol stack (PPS) design; and prototyping and demonstration. The project will provide demonstrations of the proposed WiCOS framework by concentrating on three scenarios, i.e., coordinated networks, semi-coordinated networks and uncoordinated networks, and develop detailed demonstrations for each scenario.</AbstractNarration>
