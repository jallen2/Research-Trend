    <AbstractNarration>The acquisition of an AC susceptibility measurement system at the University of North Florida (UNF) is expected to benefit the entire region, through research and educational collaborations with primarily undergraduate institutions, research universities, community colleges, and local high schools. This acquisition enhances existing infrastructure, including four major research instruments acquired through NSF support, and enables the team to explore new research ventures. The team's research projects span many STEM disciplines, including chemistry (inorganic/materials chemistry and chemical education), condensed matter physics, and the general area of materials science and engineering. The pedagogical impact of this instrument is also extensive because of its incorporation in a) both the chemistry and physics undergraduate curricula (i.e. in advanced labs and in various undergraduate research projects), b) outreach activities both for the general public and for high school students, and c) teachers' education events on the UNF campus. This NSF-supported acquisition of an AC susceptibility measurement system constitutes proof of the leading role of UNF as a research and education hub in Northeast Florida. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurement of AC susceptibility is critical in the field of molecular magnetism, as it probes single-molecule and single-chain magnetism, spin-glass behavior, as well as provides insight in the relaxation mechanism of molecular magnetic systems. At UNF, the presence of a SQUID magnetometer has allowed DC magnetic susceptibility measurements, and with the addition of the AC capabilities a complete characterization suite will become readily available. For solid-state materials AC measurements provide information about spin-glass transitions, which is important information for understanding/tweaking the materials' properties. Pressure-induced changes in the materials' properties are probed with magnetometry under pressure, with applications in macroscopic post-synthetic properties manipulation in materials. As such, the team and its collaborators use AC susceptibility in interdisciplinary investigations of a) molecular magnets (single-molecule, single-chain, and organic radical-based magnets), b) polynuclear transition metal and lanthanide/actinide clusters, c) magnetic and correlated materials, d) high temperature superconductors, and e) environmentally friendly materials for water remediation. Enhancement of these interdisciplinary efforts is expected from the AC capabilities of the SQUID, as well as from the acquisition of different pressure cells for magnetometry at pressures up to 20 GPa. Incorporation of these techniques in the chemistry and physics curricula and through undergraduate research is expected to enrich the experiential learning opportunities offered to UNF undergraduates and expose them to modern materials research. This facility is projected to benefit a number of research groups in the field of molecular magnetism, through research and educational collaborations with at least one primarily undergraduate institution and four research universities in the US, Canada, and Cyprus. Furthermore, the pressure capabilities make the UNF team a leader in high-pressure science in the state and the nation, dovetailing Raman spectroscopy and single-crystal x-ray diffraction under extreme pressures already available at UNF. Additionally, incorporation of SQUID magnetometry in teachers' education events and field trips to UNF is poised to expose local high school teachers and students to cutting edge research and strengthen UNF's bonds to the community. Acquisition of this measurement system constitutes the cornerstone for institutional growth for STEM at UNF by enriching its research and education portfolio and exemplifying its leadership role in the region.</AbstractNarration>
