    <AbstractNarration>The I-Corps team presents a portable electrochemical detection device that can rapidly detect narcotics. Law enforcement agencies and medical treatment facilities use low-cost reagent tests to rapidly detect suspected narcotics in the field. However, these tests lack molecular specificity and are prone to false positives. Additionally, the reagent tests can only detect a limited class of narcotics and are not adequate for the routine detection of designer and prescription drugs. Therefore, the motivation behind the portable electrochemical detection device was to create an inexpensive chemical sensor for law enforcement agencies to reproducibly and accurately detect multiple classes of drugs. Electrochemical techniques have been used for decades in laboratories to detect chemicals and biological agents. The conventional and portable instrumentation used for electrochemical detection is expensive, cumbersome and require special skills. The portable electrochemical detection device presented by this I-Corps team addresses the above challenges by using inexpensive sensors in a compact and portable container that is easy to use. This device is expected to impact many fields including quality control monitoring of agriculture produce and fine chemical products and intermediates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The electrochemical device presented here utilizes a paper-based electrode with carefully engineered channels to allow separation of the suspected drug from the matrix. The drug migrates along laminar flow in the channels based on their physical properties until it reaches the detection area of the electrode. The detection area has three conductive-ink/paste-based electrodes that are used for the amperometric measurement of the drug. The I-Corp team intends to perform a product-market analysis for the commercialization potential of the portable electrochemical detection device. Direct conversations with prospective customers will allow for greater understanding of each industrial sector?s pain points for routine chemical analysis outside of the laboratory. Participation will also help the I-Corp team clarify the direction the technology can take going forward such as product development issues to meet identified specific market needs.</AbstractNarration>
