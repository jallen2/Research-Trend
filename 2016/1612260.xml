    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Jose Pablo Dundore-Arias is "The potential effects of plant root exudates on phenotypic characteristics of pathogen-inhibitory microbes." The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Minnesota, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Linda Kinkel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow's research promises a deeper understanding of the interactions between plants and associated soil microbes to increase our ability to limit plant diseases and improve plant health. In particular, there is a need to understand how plants promote beneficial soil microbes that inhibit plant pathogens. A long-standing view holds that plants regulate microbial community assemblages in the rhizosphere, i.e., the area of soil that is influenced by plant root secretions and soil micro-organisms. However, how plants select for, or enrich, specific microbial populations and the corresponding functional traits that enhance plant fitness are poorly understood areas. The fellowship research investigates the potential direct (chemical signaling) and indirect (nutrient-mediated) effects of plant root exudates on the phenotypic characteristics of microbes that inhibit plant pathogens, and the likely implications for plant-microbe ecological interactions and coevolutionary dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellowship provides training in plant and soil microbiology (particularly the use of molecular biochemical tools), genomic sequencing, omics and data mining. The Fellow serves as a role model to other individuals from under-represented groups by engaging in inclusive-active teaching and mentoring, and by communicating science to diverse audiences. The Fellow is targeting teaching and outreach experiences that enhance diversity in STEM fields, by exposing youth from underrepresented groups in biology to plant and microbial sciences via hands-on active-learning workshops, and inclusive and active-mentoring and recruitment.</AbstractNarration>
