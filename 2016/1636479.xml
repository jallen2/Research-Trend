    <AbstractNarration>This Innovation Corps Project focuses on a technology to reduce the impacts of age-related macular degeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Degradation of the photoreceptor cells of the retina is a symptom of various underlying conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). As the American population ages, AMD is expected to reduce the mobility and quality of life for large population of citizens. These diseases impact nearly 15 million Americans and there are few options to slow vision loss and no direct treatments. The proposed technology, the Molecular Artificial Retina (MAR), is a potential treatment for these conditions and offers great hope to people who have lost one of the most important senses for mobility and independence. The technology acts to make cells in the retina more sensitive to less light. Current treatment is limited to nutrition and behavioral changes to slow progression. The anticipated mode of delivery is an injectable; that is, injected into the photoreceptor-degenerate eye to embed in the membrane of surviving retinal neurons, imparting light sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the NSF I-Corps program, this I-Corps team will identify and establish relationships with potential partners across the medical field. The team's goal is to reach the final stage of commercialization, involving manufacturing, clinician/patient marketing, and distribution. The team anticipates generating revenues from three distinct customer segments: 1) from patients who purchase the proposed treatment out-of-pocket; 2) from doctors (in particular ophthalmologists) who use the proposed treatment and seek reimbursement from private medical insurance; and 3) from doctors who seek reimbursement from Medicare.</AbstractNarration>
