    <AbstractNarration>This I-Corps Teams project will help evaluate the commercial feasibility of improving knowledge work with Mined Semantic Analysis (MSA) software. A recent report on Artificial Intelligence, estimated a $2 trillion impact on knowledge work from machine automation/augmentation. As a solution that offers highly usable access to relevant domain knowledge, thereby enabling this economic shift, MSA potentially addresses millions of users. Applications include 1) Innovation management (technical document search) 2) Biomedical research (literature search) and 3) Business management (market/competitive research. MSA's concept based approach improves user interface visual prioritization, rapid comprehension and facile navigation to refine search. The software enables practical application of knowledge from billions of hours of human effort, thereby reducing the gap between novice and expert users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to validate product market fit of MSA software through customer exploration and MVP prototype development. Building on work done over the past several months, the goal of the interviews is to identify specific market problems that the technology is capable of solving in a demonstrably better way. The I-Corps team will test high potential areas such as: Intellectual property research and analytics, Legal discovery, Investment/Consulting, Enterprise search, Knowledge management, Biomedical literature and Healthcare information search. The team's other project goal is to prototype core functionality to align with key customer performance measures. This will include quick experiments to gauge modes of user interaction and experience, visualization, and some preliminary performance testing.</AbstractNarration>
