    <AbstractNarration>1604129&lt;br/&gt;O'Connor, Kim C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harnessing the regenerative capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has the potential to improve the quality of human life by repairing tissue damaged by disease, trauma and aging. A major challenge to realizing the therapeutic potential of these adult stem cells is their rapid depletion upon implantation at the site of tissue injury. MSCs exhibit significant cell-to-cell variation in their capacity to survive upon implantation, but the molecular basis for this heterogeneity is poorly understood. The objective of this project is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in MSC survival. This project helps to fulfill NSF's mission to advance the progress of science by generating fundamental knowledge about MSC survival at the molecular level. This knowledge has the potential to advance the stem cell field by developing novel methods to improve MSC survival. Greater MSC survival will overcome a critical barrier to achieve more effective MSC therapies. This study is broadly relevant to other types of stem cells inasmuch as all stem cells are inherently heterogeneous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a critical need to improve the survival of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) upon implantation. Rapid depletion of the majority of implanted MSCs impedes their ability to regenerate tissue upon engraftment. The PI has detected considerable cell-to-cell variation in MSC survival. The objective of this proposal is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in MSC survival. The central hypothesis is that MSCs are an ensemble of distinct cell subsets with different capacity to survive due to differential expression of key signaling molecules. This project is innovative in exploiting cellular heterogeneity to obtain unique insight into MSC survival on a molecular level. Aim 1 will evaluate a novel cell-surface marker of MSC survival in vivo, using a xenoimplantation assay to quantify survival kinetics. Aim 2 will employ bioinformatics to identify the first genome-wide gene signature of MSC survival, which will culminate in a binary classification model to predict MSC survival. This research is anticipated to develop novel molecular-based strategies to increase survival. Improving MSC survival is expected to have a positive impact on the therapeutic efficacy of engrafted MSCs. In addition, complementary educational activities will contribute to the training of a diverse STEM workforce, including students underrepresented in STEM fields. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students through a unique bioengineering curriculum and collaborative research, a hands-on laboratory experience with stem cells for middle school students, and other outreach activities. Project results will be broadly disseminated to students, scholars and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of CBET is co-funded by the Mathematical Biology Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
