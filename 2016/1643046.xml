    <AbstractNarration>This project entails the organization and execution of a conference on the issue of women in astronomy. As its name implies, this is the fourth in a series of conferences over a period of two decades. While the number of women astronomers has increased over that period, women are still underrepresented in the science. This conference will address these issues, and build on the success of past meetings. It will also set the framework for continuing meetings of this topic in a more regular way. The American Astronomical Society will organize these future meetings. The current meeting is expected to take place after the American Astronomical Society meeting in July 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key component of this conference is support for participants who would not normally be able to attend such a meeting: students and early-career professionals. These are the target demographic to attend such a meeting, so their inclusion is vital. The support provided for the workshop will ensure that those most in need will be able to attend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of the conference proceedings will ensure that best practices provided by conference presenters will be shared to a broader audience. Goals for follow-on meetings will be formalized, and this workshop will form the basis for future activities designed to ensure a more equal environment for students and practitioners of astronomy.</AbstractNarration>
