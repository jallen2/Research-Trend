    <AbstractNarration>This project will support a workshop to bring together prominent researchers, practitioners, and funders of Computer Science (CS) Education to define the initial agenda for the research and evaluation to accompany the implementation of computer science in every school in New York City (CSNYC). With a 10-year commitment to provide computer science to every student in every school in NYC, New York is at the forefront of a national movement to increase participation in CS education at the K-12 level. Throughout the workshop, CSNYC representatives will be documenting conversations, encouraging groups to describe priorities, and looking for opportunities to not only assess the work in NYC, but also to inform the larger national K-12 CS movement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop's outcomes focus on evaluation of the expansion of CS Education in NYC and the research that will accompany the CS Education implementation. Using results from this workshop CSNYC will build consensus around key education issues such as teacher training, student outcomes, and curricular implementations. With regards to education research, CSNYC is: identifying and prioritizing topics for research; constructing a roadmap for longitudinal outcomes and necessary data collections; and defining ways in which CSNYC can support the research community in pursuing the research agenda over the course of the expansion of CS Education in NYC. Also, the outcomes of this workshop will help inform initiatives to expand computer science across the country.</AbstractNarration>
