    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) seeks to enhance the quality and experience of underrepresented undergraduate students in the psychology department with the goal of increasing the number of students prepared for research careers. The project takes the novel approach of integrating the psychology curriculum with natural science and infusing it with cultural neuroscience, an emerging interdisciplinary field. The activities and strategies are evidence-based. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the objectives to: establish an honors curriculum within the department; enhance the curricular offerings within the psychology program at WSSU by improving the biological/cognitive foundation area; and modernize and upgrade the instructional and research equipment used by students and faculty. The project is designed to keep students engaged in scientific discovery, promote interactions between students and faculty, and expose students to current and emerging technology. Demonstrating and evaluating a pathway for psychology majors to the field of cognitive science and STEM research preparation could serve as a model to other programs.</AbstractNarration>
