    <AbstractNarration>This award, funded jointly the Biological Sciences Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Engineering Division of Chemical, Biological, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division, will bring together leading scientists and bioengineers from the US and India to develop an optimize cellular systems for the productions of industrially relevant chemicals and products using approaches derived from theoretical principles of biology and engineering. One of the anticipated outcomes will be the development of parallel strategic partnerships for research collaborations and student and postdoctoral exchange opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held March 18-20, 2016 at the India Institute of Technology in Mumbai, India. Approximately 30 senior researchers with expertise in the fields of systems and synthetic biology from the US and India will be in attendance in addition to researchers from select Asian countries. The outcomes of this workshop is to develop strategic collaborative and educational opportunities in addition to creating an infrastructure that will be necessary to realize the overarching goals of this workshop.</AbstractNarration>
