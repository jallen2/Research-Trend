    <AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This award will extend and enhance the resource center (titled the Community for Advancing Discovery Research in Education, or CADRE) for the DRK-12 program. The project builds on the unique experience and expertise of investigators at Educational Development Center (EDC) that evolved over eight years in the development and implementation of CADRE. The multi-faceted approach of CADRE 2017 strengthens the network's virtual presence in order to (a) generate and disseminate knowledge and products that support research, policy, and practice around key issues in STEM education; (b) foster interaction and collaboration across projects to maximize the individual and collective potential of DRK-12 awards; (c) offer targeted professional development activities and resources that support early career researchers and developers; and (d) provide focused outreach and dissemination efforts to the DRK-12 community, other networks, and broader stakeholder audiences. The evaluation supports continuous improvement of the network's design and seeks to identify components that have promise for adaptation in future endeavors and by other networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a variety of online curated resources and interactive events, the project will advance topics of relevance and importance to the DRK-12 community, the National Science Foundation, and society; support interaction and collaboration among DRK-12 awardees; and facilitate DRK-12 awardee engagement with policy and practice communities. Informed by their expressed interests and needs, this award expands upon previous work to support the professional growth of early career researchers and developers, with a focus on broadening participation of individuals underrepresented in STEM. The network will support knowledge generation, synthesis, and dissemination with a lens on DRK-12 resources, materials, and tools within and external to the research and development community. The network will also contribute to the knowledge base on the design and implementation of networks intending to support knowledge management and collaboration. The DRK-12 portfolio includes an estimated 750 projects that are driven by the field yet respond to parameters established by the National Science Foundation. Understanding the scope of the portfolio, in relation to trends in research, policy, and practice, is important because collectively, the awards produce resources, models, and technologies that can influence the field. Convening the awardees through multiple virtual venues, and promoting collaboration and interaction among the projects, maximizes the collective potential of the projects. Supporting the development of early career researchers and developers, the project's impact extends into the building of the next generation of scholars. With an emphasis on communication and dissemination of the DRK-12 project findings and products in STEM research and development, the network will contribute to a more evidence-based understanding of STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
