    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presently, the majority of polymers are derived from petroleum feedstocks. The development of sustainable, alternative resources for polymers is an open societal challenge. Epoxy resins are an important commercial class of polymer used in a variety of applications such as structural applications, advanced adhesives, aerospace and automotive components, and wind turbine blades. Epoxy resins are derived predominantly from petrochemicals. Additionally, these polymers cannot be recycled after the useful lifetime of the material. Plastic waste which is not recycled resides in landfills, and sometimes in unintentional locations such as waterways. This project will develop new epoxy resins with a reduced environmental impact through implementation of sustainable sources and enhancing the biodegradability of the materials. Two plant-based resources will be examined: vegetable oils and phenolic acids (found in many fruit and vegetable byproducts). Chemical routes will be developed for preparation of these materials, and their physical performance will be investigated. This project will also cultivate knowledge in students, educators and the general public on the impact of polymers on the environment, through the following activities: expansion of the Materials Day at UH program for local K-12 students, development of modules for the Houston Energy Day and Houston Earth Day celebrations, and participation of graduate and undergraduate students in research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop new epoxy resins which contain sustainable, biodegradable, and non-toxic components, yet maintain the advantageous properties of conventional, petroleum-sourced materials. The research plan is structured around three specific aims. In the first aim, synthetic strategies will be established for epoxy resins containing biobased components. Plant-sourced phenolic acids will be employed to impart desirable mechanical behavior to the epoxy resins (due to the presence of aromatic rings) and soybean oil will be employed to impart biodegradability to the epoxy resins (due to the presence of ester linkages). In the second aim, a detailed understanding of structure-property-function relationships in sustainable epoxy resins will be developed. The functionality of the starting components is expected to have a great impact on the structural parameters of the epoxy network and ultimate macroscopic mechanical properties. The design of multicomponent epoxy resins will be leveraged to develop microphase separated thermoset blends with advantageous properties. In the third aim, hydrolytic degradation and biodegradation of epoxy resins containing soybean oil will be investigated. A key premise of the proposed work is that epoxy resins derived from soybean oil will maintain their properties during the useful lifetime of the products they are utilized in, yet can undergo biodegradation in a compost environment. The expected outcomes from this study are synthetic pathways to epoxy resins from non-traditional sources, characterization of the thermal and mechanical behavior of the newly derived epoxy resins, morphological investigation of microphase separated multicomponent epoxy resins, and hydrolytic and biodegradation mechanisms of epoxy resins which contain ester linkages.</AbstractNarration>
