    <AbstractNarration>Non Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a broad survey of materials research (MR) conducted by the National Academies to identify key strategic materials research areas important to the United States. MR seeks to understand how the elements of ordinary materials combine in large numbers to form our everyday objects. The breadth of such research is enormous, encompassing metals, glasses, crystals, wood, and plastics, as well as new nanomaterials. Progress requires the interplay of many components of today's research community - advances in fundamental theory, the continued development of new research tools, computational capabilities and both large and small facilities. The results of that progress have been impressive - most technological advances that characterize modern society have been highly dependent upon advances in materials' capabilities. The United States is now just one of many leaders on the international scene in this field, as many countries have begun investing significantly in this area with the expectation that such efforts will help fuel their national economic development. This study assesses the progress in MR over the past decade and identifies promising new directions in MR for the period 2020-2030. The study also discusses the impacts that MR has had and is expected to have on emerging technologies, national needs, and science, broadly. Finally, the study uses case studies of selected fields that have had or are anticipated to have near-term growth, to evaluate recent investment trends in MR in the United States relative to similar research taking place abroad and recommends steps for helping to secure U.S. leadership and for enhancing international collaboration or coordination in appropriate subfields of MR. There are also committee members who work in closely related fields or in fields&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a 24-month study by the National Academies on the current status and future directions of materials research (MR) in the United States. The study is supported by experienced members of the National Academies' professional staff and conducted by an ad-hoc committee of approximately 20-23 members, most of whom have expertise in the fields that broadly make up MR. There are also committee members who work in closely related fields or in fields that rely upon MR, members from industries that rely upon advances in MR, as well as members from international communities that engage in similar research. In conducting the study, the committee will hold five full committee meetings with invited presentations from the MR community, and will engage in extensive community interaction and data gathering, including pursuing feedback from across the country through efforts such as town halls. After first assessing the progress and achievements in MR over the past decade, the report will identify the principal changes in the research and development landscape for MR over the past decade, both in the United States and internationally, and how those changes have impacted the MR community. It will then identify areas that offer promising investment opportunities and new directions for the period 2020-2030. The report will also use a limited number of case studies to evaluate recent trends in investments in materials research in the United States relative to similar research that is taking place internationally. Based on those trends, the report will recommend steps the United States might take to either secure leadership or to enhance collaboration and coordination of such research support for identified subfields of materials research. The conclusions and recommendations of the report will be disseminated to sponsoring agencies, the public, the research and technical communities that conduct MR, and state and local governments, as appropriate. Free electronic versions of the report will be available via the National Academies Press website.</AbstractNarration>
