    <AbstractNarration>Pepperwood is a leader in advancing science-based conservation throughout the Northern California region and beyond (see www.pepperwoodpreserve.org). The purpose of this project is to build on Pepperwood's experience using its 3120-acre research reserve to advance long-term climate research and environmental education for all ages. Pepperwood will use NSF funds provided by this award to develop a five-year strategic plan to increase its impact in terms of publishing scientific results, engaging diverse students, and forging conservation applications with land and water management partners. The Pepperwood team will seek input from the scientific community, business leaders, and technology experts. The results will be integrated into a comprehensive planning document that addresses how to achieve targeted science and education outcomes in partnership with the California Academy of Sciences, the Santa Rosa Junior College, University of California, federal and state agencies, and others. This project will strengthen Pepperwood's role in improving the health and prosperity of the region and the nation as a whole through science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pepperwood will develop a five-year strategic plan for its center of operations, the Dwight Center for Conservation Science, and its 3120-acre research reserve located in California's Coast Ranges. The goal is to advance the station's role as an emerging leader in real-time climate change research and applications for the region. Proposed planning activities include 1) consulting with scientific advisors to define a century-scale vision for making a scientific impact, 2) locating models and selecting best practices for excellence in field station management and operations, 3) seeking expert advice on data management to incorporate resilient hardware, software and communications networks to store and disseminate research results and long-term monitoring data, 4) consulting business experts on how to leverage revenue generation strategies specific to our non-profit context, and 5) synthesizing these planning elements into a five-year comprehensive strategic plan in concert with research, education, community, and government stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>
