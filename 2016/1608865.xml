    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;Future electronics will require novel materials and material interfaces. This project combines material growth with characterization to construct interface structures with atomic-scale precision. Such materials and interfaces provide new and often unexpected functionalities which can be utilized in future electronic devices. The broad goal of this work is to develop the science and technology arising at interfaces of this class of novel materials. The research team intends to advance the fundamental design principles, which can in turn inspire the creation of new electronic and magnetic states for technological applications. Furthermore, a significant product of this endeavor is to integrate material growth, characterization and design into a research and educational program for the training of the future science and technology workforce that meets new challenges in this technology-driven society. Both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in material fabrication and characterization efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project lies in the novel proximity effects and related exciting structure-property relationship of novel ferromagnet-superconductor junctions. By taking advantage of the project's in-situ growth and characterization capability, this research team intends to uncover the structure-property relationship of the novel interfaces of transition metal oxides. Specifically, by exploiting expertise in creating atomically sharp interfaces between half-metallic manganites or ordinary ferromagnetic oxide films and unconventional superconductors, the team aims to resolve the outstanding issue of realizing long-range spin-polarized supercurrent, as well as determining the correlation between ferromagnetic layer structure and the coherent length of spin-polarized supercurrent by varying ferromagnetic layer thickness. Furthermore, the ability to achieve in-situ growth and characterization with atomic precision allows addressing several fundamental issues in metal-superconductor junctions, including atomic-level controlled tuning of barrier transparency on Andreev reflection, and conceptual validation of triplet Josephson junctions.</AbstractNarration>
