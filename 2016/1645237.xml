    <AbstractNarration>This project examines the usefulness of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCID) as a method for identifying journal article authors, and as a basis for detecting emerging scientific topics studied by these authors. Authors of scientific works may use non-standard ways of reporting their names and affiliations in journal articles and other publications, change affiliations over their careers, or have names that are similar to those of other authors. Such variations can make it difficult to correctly match authors with their publications and institutional affiliations. Against an assortment of government or publisher registration methods and machine learning approaches to deal with these problems, ORCID stands out for its potential to extend across methods and nations with its open source approach. Improved capabilities for identifying authors are vital in studying scientific mobility, networks, the contribution of authors to the emergence of new scientific topics, and other subjects in the Science of Science and Innovation Policy domain. More needs to be understood about the strengths and weaknesses in ORCID coverage by country, field, and other areas for it to be useful in Science of Science and Innovation Policy studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses two bibliometric methods to examine ORCID usage over time and by author characteristics. First, the project uses comparative sampling by disciplinary area, and considers ORCID coverage within country, organization, and citation distribution categories in these disciplinary areas. Second, the project investigates the potential of ORCID in identifying emerging science-driven technologies by employing it in the development of an emergence indicator based on a semi-automated numerical scoring system. The emergence indicator is designed to take topical terms with recent, sharp increases in publication and/or patent activity and examine them in the context of identified scholars to potentially highlight concentrations of research and development activity on emergent fields of science and technology. The resulting intelligence is intended to be useful in informing government, commercial, and academic analyses of leading-edge players and other contributors to rising science and technology domains.</AbstractNarration>
