    <AbstractNarration>Developing a titanium implant surface that can be fully integrated with the surrounding bone while inhibiting the development of infections by microorganisms will improve orthopedic implant performance, improve patient outcomes, reduce patient morbidity and decrease health care costs. This team has engineered a bio-inspired interface built upon chimeric peptides that bind to titanium. Similar to facial recognition, the peptide recognizes the atomic face only of titanium. Another peptide with a desired biological function for antimicrobial, or bone formation or cell anchoring is joined with the surface-binding peptide function to make a chimeric peptide. The proposed product, a chimeric peptide both anchors and delivers biological signals to the patient that will reduce infections, reduce costs, and reduce risk while improving patient outcomes. Titanium alloys are frequently used material for joint replacement, restoration of craniofacial and axial skeletal birth defects and bone loss to combat injuries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the I-Corps curriculum kick-off, the team will interview thought leaders at the Center for Disease Control and surgeons at Emory University who use titanium implants. In subsequent interviews, the team will travel to sites offering a high-density of "information-rich strangers" who can help shape the commercialization interests of the proposed company, Integrated Interfaces. These plans include travelling and interviewing knowledgeable individuals at The Annual Orthopaedic Manufacturing and Technology Exposition and Conference (OMTEC), The California Dental Association (CDA) Convention, The American Dental Association (ADA) Convention, coupled by physical proximity with a visit to The Orthopedic Surgery Residency Program at the University of California Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, Davis, CA. The team will also consult with and retain Dr. Francis Richmond of the USC Regulatory Sciences Program to help the team with the FDA regulatory compliance. Following completion of I-Corps, the team plans to research several business pathway critical issues, including the in vivo stability of the interface, the in vivo duration of Wnt signaling to stem cells, the quantity and quality of bone formed in vivo, and the immunogenicity of the chimeric peptides.</AbstractNarration>
