    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participants at the workshop "Algebraic Cycles and Moduli" to take place June 2-8, 2016, at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada. The funding will support three principal speakers, 4 regular faculty and between 9 to 14 junior participants. The workshop activities will include three to four talks each day by leading international experts, interspersed with unscheduled time to allow for discussion and collaboration. The topic of the conference is at the forefront of current research in algebraic geometry. It involves a wide range of complex techniques from geometry, analysis, and topology and has important applications in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific purpose of the workshop is to survey the recent developments in the field of algebraic cycles and moduli, with a focus on the following topics: (1) Mumford-Tate groups and domains, (2) Torelli-type theorems and hyperkähler manifolds, (3) Conformal block bundles over moduli spaces of curves, (4) Normal functions, (5) Applications of the Beilinson regulator to Mahler measure and Feynman integrals. The workshop will bring together some of the leading experts in these fields, as well as a number of young researchers, who will further propel developments in these directions. More details on the conference can be found at its website: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/Cycles16/index_e.php</AbstractNarration>
