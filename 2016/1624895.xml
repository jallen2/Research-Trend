    <AbstractNarration>Discovering, testing, and developing chemical proxies (relic materials) in marine sediments that reveal how strongly or weakly oxidizing near-surface environmental conditions were in the Earth's geological past are immensely important for understanding interactions between ocean chemistry, biological evolution and extinctions, and climate. To date scientists do not have a proxy for low but non-zero oxygen conditions -- the sort of conditions that are likely to have dominated in biologically important periods of Earth history. In this project, researchers will study the relationship between bottom water oxygen concentration and the isotopes of the trace metal vanadium (V) in a range of oxygen conditions in the modern ocean. Based on pilot data, theoretical calculations and dissolved seawater V concentrations they believe that stable V isotope ratios of core top sediments will correlate systematically over a range of bottom water oxygen conditions. By analyzing these materials, the research team expects to establish the relationship between V isotopes and bottom water oxygen concentrations. Given the importance of chemical proxies to quantify past climate change, the results of this study will be of great importance to the modern and paleoceanographic community, as well as for modelers to better understand a broad range of oxygen variability in Earth history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although recent investigations have provided a wealth of information about the redox conditions of the ancient oceans, there is a significant gap in understanding low oxygen conditions throughout Earth history. Therefore, it is important to develop new paleoredox proxies that can provide additional and complementary knowledge about ocean redox conditions during these important periods of Earth history. In this study, scientists will analyze bulk sediments and their organic and ferromanganese mineral fractions to investigate the V isotopic variability within the various sedimentary components. (These samples comprise organic rich to ferromanganese rich sediments due to a range in bottom water oxygen concentrations.) Reconstructing marine low oxygen conditions using vanadium isotopes would fill a void in the paleoredox proxy toolbox. Developing, calibrating, and fingerprinting the V isotopic variability in modern sediments is required to be able to apply vanadium isotopes as an accurate paleoredox proxy.</AbstractNarration>
