    <AbstractNarration>This RCN-UBE project will investigate the function of unknown genes in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's or Brewer's yeast). The genome of this yeast was sequenced 20 years ago, yet nearly 10% of the genes have no assigned function; these genes are called orphan genes. Determining the function of the complete set of genes in this simple model organism will meaningfully contribute to the understanding of how cells function. The goal of the Yeast Orphan Gene Project is to organize a consortium of undergraduate student researchers and faculty to coordinate resources and design experimental strategies to assign functions to orphan genes in yeast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on analysis of available bioinformatics data sets, students will design and execute experiments for defining gene function. The network will facilitate collaboration between students at different institutions so that students can share strategies and technique solutions while developing experience in on-line collaborations. Scientifically, the project will contribute to a more detailed understanding of the biology of yeast and the structure of the yeast genome. Ultimately, the yeast orphan gene project aims to use the process of determining orphan gene function as a tool to teach undergraduate students key concepts in bioinformatics, genomics, molecular biology, and genetics and impart valuable experience in scientific collaboration and leadership. The network will provide tools for faculty to expand research experience for undergraduates and incorporate research experiences into undergraduate courses. It will also be a mechanism to distribute a tested model of an authentic course-based research experience to a diverse set of institutions by providing workshop and assessment support. Through sharing of resources, the network will develop a model for online course modules to be shared among institutions. The networking activities will expand the expertise of faculty, as well as provide undergraduates tools and resources for collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).</AbstractNarration>
