    <AbstractNarration>Vibrations of macroscopic mechanical oscillators such as a guitar string, a tuning fork, or a drum membrane can be well described with classical physics. This is no longer true, however, if the mechanical oscillators are cooled to sufficiently low temperature such that thermal mechanical motion becomes negligible. In this limit the mechanical oscillators can behave like quantum mechanical systems that contain discrete amounts, or quanta, of vibrational energy. Recent experimental and theoretical research has paved the way to use these quantum behaviors for quantum information processing and to make better sensors. Cooling mechanical oscillators to the required ultra-low temperatures, however, is difficult. The primary goal of this project is to explore experimental approaches that can maintain or preserve the desired quantum processes or properties even in the presence of significant thermal noise (i.e., at elevated temperature). The project exploits special types of interactions that return the mechanical oscillator to its original state after the completion of the relevant quantum operations. These quantum operations can function at elevated temperature without the complexity and technical challenge of cooling the mechanical oscillator to its quantum ground state. The experimental project also provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in areas of both scientific and technological importance. This training prepares the students for careers in academia, industry, or government. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The experimental research will be carried out in a multimode optomechanical system that couples acoustic whispering gallery modes (WGMs) to optical WGMs in an on-chip silica microsphere via triply resonant Brillouin scattering. This system takes full advantage of optical WGMs that feature ultrahigh finesse and acoustic WGMs that have no clamping loss. This research will use a class of optomechanical Hamiltonian that returns the mechanical oscillator to its initial state after the desired coherent operations, thus disentangling the optical and mechanical systems. These operations resemble the Sorensen-Molmer mechanism for entanglement of trapped ions in a thermal environment. Optomechanical pi-pulses which can induce state swapping between two relevant optical modes, but leave the mechanical system unchanged, will be used for the implementation of mechanically-mediated optical state transfer. Detuned sideband coupling, such as that which extends the Sorensen-Molmer entanglement scheme for trapped ions to the bosonic optomechanical system, will be used for mechanically-mediated optical entanglement. These thermally-robust optomechanical operations can play an important role in developing optomechanical quantum interfaces that can function in an easily accessible thermal environment.</AbstractNarration>
