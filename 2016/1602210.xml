    <AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion. BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to "integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities." For the U.S. to remain competitive globally, it must provide exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. California State University, Los Angeles, one of the 23 California State University campuses included in The California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP), will implement a comprehensive BD Program, which will result in the production of well-trained, highly skilled STEM professionals from underrepresented groups. Therefore, the project will contribute significantly to increasing the diversity and representation in academia and the STEM workforce, thereby increasing the nation's competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;California State University, Los Angeles, will provide a Master's level "bridge" to doctoral-level study for a cohort of 12 graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs. The Master's-level experience is designed to increase participant persistence and competencies in STEM and their advancement to STEM doctoral programs following completion of the Master's degree. In addition to receiving substantial financial support to enable the BD Fellows to focus full time on course work and research, the Fellows have the opportunity to participate in an integrated set of activities. These activities include: (1) monthly and quarterly meetings with the BD Project Director to monitor student progress and provide comprehensive advisement; (2) a workshop series focused on information/tools needed for adjustment to and success in graduate school; (3) writing support; (4) weekly professional seminars; (5) community building activities; (6) "connecting" Fellows to doctoral programs through collaborations with faculty and programs at Ph.D. institutions; and (7) assistance with applications to Ph.D. programs, financial aid and fellowship programs.</AbstractNarration>
