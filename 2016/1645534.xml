    <AbstractNarration>CBET- 1645534 &lt;br/&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Buie, Cullen R. &lt;br/&gt;Title: 2016 Dielectrophoresis Meeting at MIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide travel funds to partially support approximately 30 graduate and post doctoral students and junior faculty to attend the 2016 Dielectrophoresis at MIT, in Cambridge, MA from July 13-15, 2016. This meeting is designed to provide an intimate setting for engineers and scientists with expertise in dielectrophoresis and non-linear electrokinetics can discuss research frontiers. Dielectrophoresis is a well-known particle manipulation technique that has been able to capture, sort, concentrate, and characterize a variety of particles and biological entities as small as a few nanometers. The recent, rapid expansion of DEP has demonstrated that this technique is a viable method for micro-total analytical systems, especially for biological and health care microsystems. The conference is organized into ten sessions. This meeting includes a plenary session with a diverse group of eminent researchers that represents the most exciting advances in non-linear electrokinetics and dielectrophoresis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from the National Science Foundation would be used for student and postdoc conference expenses and junior faculty, enabling more young US engineers and scientists to participate in Dielectrophoresis 2016. The expected outcomes include:&lt;br/&gt;1. Enable greater participation by junior faculty and thus facilitating networking opportunities and establish international collaborations with veteran researchers.&lt;br/&gt;2. Disseminate public knowledge on dielectrophoresis (and related topics) with students writing and posting session and conference summaries on dielectrophoresis.org and live-Tweet Dielectrophoresis 2016.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the development of human resources, the support provided will allow presentation of the latest research results from the most innovative academic laboratories around the country.</AbstractNarration>
