    <AbstractNarration>The Logical Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS) symposium of 2016 will be held in Florida under auspice of Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, on January 4-7. The LFCS General Chair is Anil Nerode (Cornell University), the Program Committee Chair is Sergei Artemov (Graduate Center of the City University of New York), and the Organizing Committee Chair is Robert Lubarsky (Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton). The LFCS series represents the body of work in those areas of fundamental logic related to computer science. The conference is intended to encourage the interchange and interuse of ideas emanating from a wide variety of fields and applications. LFCS conferences appear to be of significant and growing importance for the logic and foundations community in the United States since computer and information sciences provide a cluster of areas in which the core logical methods are applicable in the most immediate and powerful way. Such a conference is pivotal for building a cadre of future logical foundations of computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its origin in 1989, each LFCS meeting has resulted in a Springer volume of proceedings published prior to the conference and, as has been the norm, a post-conference volume of Annals of Pure and Applied Logic - a flagship journal in mathematical logic. The US community in logic and foundations benefits greatly from such a conference. LFCS conferences attract a good number of graduate students for whom this conference is a milestone event. Logic and foundations life in Florida area needs support. Another major beneficiary of LFCS 2016 is the logic community in the City University of New York, one of the leading institutions with a high number of underrepresented groups.
