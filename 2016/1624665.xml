    <AbstractNarration>This project will prepare a 5-year strategic plan for the Northern Kentucky University (NKU) Research and Education Field Station (REFS). This station is located adjacent to the St. Anne Woods and Wetlands (SAWW), 155 acres of conservation easement natural areas on and near the Ohio River. REFS is located in the Outer Bluegrass Ecoregion, with open- and closed-canopy forested wetlands, upland grassland, and wooded natural areas containing substantial old growth forest, primarily dominated by beech. Although current and past ecological research at SAWW has included some national data collection programs, the breadth and depth of studies have been limited by the lack of laboratory facilities at the site. The acquisition and recent refurbishment of a building by NKU and associated land as its first field station opens the door to new research initiatives and associated education and outreach opportunities. This project is significant in that it will provide a plan of action for both enhancing and building university research and education programs while initiating and developing P-12 and community outreach programs. The field station provides a space for activities that were previously not possible, including indoor laboratory and field processing procedures, meetings, research and education workspace, storage, and restrooms. Therefore this project is important because it will promote the progress of science in a three-fold manner: namely, it will provide a framework for the new REFS to 1) develop and enrich new and existing field research programs at SAWW to contribute to long-term projects and network with national databases such as our on-going Ecological Research as Education Network (NSF-EREN) studies on litter decomposition and permanent forest plots and active membership in the Kentucky Organization of Field Stations (KOFS), 2) expand ecological and transdisciplinary educational opportunities for undergraduates, and 3) increase engagement with our community partners (business, government, education, nonprofit organizations, and public-at-large) to expand learning and research opportunities, enhance nature awareness, and increase environmental literacy to create a better informed public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The St. Anne Woods and Wetlands (SAWW) contain 155 acres of conservation easement natural areas on and near the Ohio River. It is located in the Outer Bluegrass Ecoregion, with open- and closed-canopy forested wetlands, upland grassland, and wooded natural areas containing substantial old growth forest, primarily dominated by beech. Research at SAWW began over 100 years ago by E. Lucy Braun and most recently has focused on field biology (amphibian and reptile diversity, plant diversity, bird nesting biology), biogeochemical processes, monitoring of the impacts of introduced and invasive species, and the restoration of damaged systems. Through these projects, scientists at Northern Kentucky University (NKU) have also trained undergraduates in field research. Our intent through this project to develop a 5-year field station strategic plan to create a systematic organization of research activities that can be networked with other sites on local, regional, and/or national bases, particularly for long-term data sets. The newly acquired NKU Research and Education Field Station (REFS), which is located adjacent to SAWW and only a few minutes from the NKU campus, will centralize these research efforts and allow for processing and analyses of samples, receive monitoring instrumentation output, and complement field studies. The planning process will facilitate the establishment of a budget-conscious field station usage plan and supply direction for the incorporation of new technologies in monitoring studies and communication informatics. Simultaneously, it will provide incentives for broader research use of this facility by NKU faculty and others. These activities will begin with our current participation in the Ecological Research as Education Network (NSF-EREN) and the Kentucky Organization of Field Stations (KOFS). The proximity of the field station to the NKU campus will expand opportunities for ecological undergraduate instruction while providing unique transdisciplinary teaching opportunities over a range of other disciplines. REFS will expand our partnerships with businesses, educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and the public-at-large to catalyze regional growth and vitality. To do so, the facility will enhance community outreach activities for P-12 schools to improve college readiness, host summer camps, and facilitate teacher continuing education. The plan will also incorporate the use of the field station and SAWW by the NKU Center for Environmental Restoration, an instructional-based environmental consulting center, to train undergraduates in improved techniques of land management and restoration.
