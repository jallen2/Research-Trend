    <AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion. BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to "integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities." For the U.S. to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. With a longstanding commitment to enhancing diversity through inclusion of all individuals, Colorado State University (CSU), lead institution of the Colorado LSAMP (CO-AMP), proposes to extend educational opportunities for 12 underrepresented graduate students as Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Fellows for two years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CO-AMP BD at Colorado State will focus on 1) increasing the number of underrepresented students who successfully complete STEM doctoral programs and 2) continuing to implement institutional change for all underrepresented graduate students at CSU. Through a well-developed series of professional development opportunities, coupled with ongoing individual mentoring and networking, BD Fellows will be well prepared to compete as cutting-edge scientists, contributing to social, economic, and academic change and outcomes, where they will serve as role models for the matriculated students underrepresented in STEM areas. In addition, the developmental components of CSU's BD will be extended to all graduate programs within the university, positively impacting the culture at CSU. Ultimately, it will result in not only an increase in STEM doctoral recipients from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, but also the honing of evidence-based practices for the recruitment, selection, and mentoring of underrepresented graduate students in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
