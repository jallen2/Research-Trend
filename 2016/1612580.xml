    <AbstractNarration>Title: IIS: Workshop on Ontology Learning for Behavioral Knowledge Embeddedness&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kai Larsen &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Ontology Learning for Behavioral Knowledge Embeddedness is designed to bring together experts in natural language technologies, computer and behavioral science to develop semantic ontology using two methods: 1) an initial data extraction of relationships between theories and constructs using natural language technologies; and 2) bringing together a multidisciplinary team to clarify the conceptualizations. Such an ontology can be used to clarify the conceptualizations and vocabulary that underlie knowledge and allow the field to grow on a shared vocabulary. The workshop will yield a transdisciplinary knowledge base that will enable researchers to better search, integrate, and understand past behavioral research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current research in behavior relies on a plethora of theories and constructs. Past research has suggested that there is significant overlap in these terms and that analysis of extant behavioral theories may provide a much-needed ontology of behavioral knowledge-embeddedness and -integration, itself the necessary requirement to clarify the structure of knowledge within the large set of behavioral theories in existence. Without such an ontology, clarifying the conceptualizations and vocabulary that underlie knowledge is not possible. Beyond developing an ontology, a transdisciplinary knowledge base will enable researchers to better utilize past research. The major goals of this proposed workshop are to 1) evaluate the current state of disparate ontological foundations for behavioral theory efforts, 2) facilitate the development of shared understanding of ontology development and learning from experts in the fields of natural language processing, visualization, and computational ontologies, and 3) advance the rigor of theory-integrative work towards ontology-worthy efforts.</AbstractNarration>
