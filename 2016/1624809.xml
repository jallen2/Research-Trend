    <AbstractNarration>As software is used increasingly and ubiquitously in our everyday lives, as its complexity and functionality grow faster and greater, as the consequences of some operational failures become overwhelmingly serious, as both the time and budget for producing high-quality reliable and secure software are continuously reduced, industry and academia need to work together as a team to perform cooperative research so that the gap between state-of-the-art research and state-of-practice technologies used in the field can be reduced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this planning grant is to prepare the Advanced Research Center for Software Testing and Quality Assurance (STQA) in the Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) to become one of the major university sites of S2ERC - a well-established NSF I/UCRC center on Security and Software Engineering. With the addition to S2ERC of researchers and industry affiliates from the proposed site at UTD, a more comprehensive platform can be established to provide excellent opportunities for the academic community to become more aware of subject areas critical to the industry, as practitioners bring their needs to the table. This platform will also help achieve an additional objective of this grant to make STQA a leading research facility on software testing and quality assurance in the North Texas area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will focus on developing advanced cutting-edge technologies, with user-friendly tool support, for technology transfer. We will assist practitioners, no matter what their previous level of experience with software testing and quality assurance, to be quickly brought up to speed on necessary background knowledge and gain the ability to apply a cost-effective set of procedures tailored to their specific projects. With such effort, it is more likely that software can achieve high quality more effectively at reduced cost.</AbstractNarration>
