    <AbstractNarration>The Shanks Workshop on Geometric Analysis will take place in Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, from March 11-12, 2016. The workshop intends to bring together some leading researches in the area of geometric analysis, a field of research motivated by questions in both pure mathematics and the applied sciences. Geometric analysis is an area that requires tools from different mathematical fields, hence the importance of bringing together researchers with different backgrounds and similar research interests. One of the difficulties faced by researchers in the field is that many problems require a wide variety of geometric and analytic techniques. This often prevents researches working on similar problems from communicating with each other. This workshop will help overcoming such barriers, assuring that the vast amount of techniques available in the field are shared among its members, and giving incentives to researches to pursue future collaborations. It will also be an opportunity for graduate students to interact with leading researchers and be exposed to cutting-edge developments in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on problems that require a genuine interplay between methods from modern Riemannian geometry, partial differential equations, and, to a lesser extent, algebraic geometry and topology. It will involve topics such as recent developments in connection with the Yamabe problem and the Yamabe invariant of manifolds, extensions of classical results to manifolds with boundary, mathematical general relativity, recent developments in Kahler geometry, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more details, see the webpage: https://my.vanderbilt.edu/shanksgeomanalysis/</AbstractNarration>
