    <AbstractNarration>The future management of water resources in the Western United States poses significant challenges from human-derived change, along with tremendous opportunities to improve the efficiency of water allocation for the very diverse needs of humans and ecology. This workshop will bring together scientific and engineering leaders from academia to define the major issues and to develop a plan to guide research, technology and infrastructure capacity needs for the future. The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Tahoe Summit which is attended by local, regional and national policy makers focused on the needs for water sustainability in the Western United States and the importance of science to guide sustainability development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A diverse mix of early career and senior faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will participate in the meeting. Established investigators will be brought together with new and under-represented researchers, as well as policy makers responsible for water management in the Western US, providing excellent opportunities for both scientific mentoring exchange and translation of scientific knowledge to practice. The young scientists in particular will benefit significantly from the networking and synthesis activities of the symposium.</AbstractNarration>
