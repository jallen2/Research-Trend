    <AbstractNarration>PI: Johnson, Blake &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1650601 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organs for transplantation, such as kidneys, are in short supply. Good measures that predict the health status of organs targeted for transplantation are not available. The current approach is not objective. This project will use current state of the art methods to make devices that will be attached to live kidneys in a special apparatus for obtaining important measurements using sensors that will be fabricated as part of the project. The goal is that such measurements will take the guess work out of the health assessment of the organ transplantation procedure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed project is to fabricate a conforming and flexible sensor that will be adaptive to ex vivo organ surfaces (the porcine kidney in the experiments) for obtaining electrical impedance data, and measure biomarkers in perfused fluids using a microfluidic arrangement. The project will use advanced fabrication approach of 3D structured light scanning and extrusion-based additive manufacturing methodology for fabricating conformal (form-fitting) microfluidic organ biosensors. This sensor-based identification of biomarkers and impedance signatures in superficial tissue matrix is expected to correlate with organ health. The project will provide an educational opportunity by creating a two-week workshop which will train students in biomedical device manufacturing. Educational benefits will be assessed through a faculty-judged BIO-Maker fair.</AbstractNarration>
