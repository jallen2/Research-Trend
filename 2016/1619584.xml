    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the plasma and magnetic field conditions in the micro-scale regions where magnetic energy is converted to plasma kinetic energy during magnetic reconnection. Magnetic reconnection is, in effect, the breaking and reconnecting of magnetic field lines, which is accompanied by an explosive release of energy. This explosive energy release is an important component of space weather disturbances in Earth's vicinity. Satellite observations and plasma simulations will be combined to study the energy conversion process. The science objectives of this proposal are closely aligned with the priorities of the NSF-DOE Plasma Physics Partnership. As part of this program, NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE) will collaborate in supporting the investigation. The project will provide research training for a postdoctoral student, contributing to the future scientific workforce. The results of this research into a key energy conversion process in plasmas (magnetic reconnection) will be of interest to scientific disciplines outside of Geospace, including the astrophysics and laboratory fusion communities. In the longer term, new knowledge about the triggers of explosive energy release during space storms will improve space weather prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important element of the proposed investigation is the synthesis of satellite observations of the space environment and cutting-edge plasma simulations. The space data will be obtained from a recently launched configuration of 4 satellites that form the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. MMS is capable of measuring the state of the electrons at two orders of magnitude higher cadence than any previous space missions. This is vital in order to resolve plasma structures in these very spatially limited regions as the satellites fly through. The simulations will be done using a state-of-the-art 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) model optimized to run efficiently on supercomputers. Significant advances in knowledge are expected about: (1) plasma energization in various types of naturally occurring 3D magnetic and electric field configurations and (2) electric and magnetic field structures and their self-consistent plasma flow patterns in reconnection regions at the magnetopause and in the magnetotail.</AbstractNarration>
