    <AbstractNarration>Many complex stochastic planning domains such as logistics,&lt;br/&gt;emergency response, resilient power grids, and robotics require the&lt;br/&gt;ability to make high-quality decisions under tight time&lt;br/&gt;constraints. This project addresses the need for high-quality, but&lt;br/&gt;computationally efficient, decision making via new theory and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for speedup learning, which will enable planners to&lt;br/&gt;learn to speedup their performance based on prior planning&lt;br/&gt;experience. This speedup-learning approach is loosely inspired by&lt;br/&gt;the fact that humans routinely learn to speedup their reasoning&lt;br/&gt;processes with experience, without sacrificing decision quality.&lt;br/&gt;Similarly, through speedup learning, an inefficient planner that&lt;br/&gt;produces high-quality decisions will be transformed into a much&lt;br/&gt;faster planner with little loss in decision quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves advancing speedup learning for online planning&lt;br/&gt;under uncertainty on four fronts. First, the speedup-learning&lt;br/&gt;problem is formalized by introducing the canonical problem of&lt;br/&gt;Primitive Speedup Learning (PSL) and studying how PSL can be used&lt;br/&gt;to solve various speedup objectives. Second, a novel online&lt;br/&gt;planning framework, which subsumes many existing frameworks and&lt;br/&gt;enables many potential speedup opportunities, is being designed and&lt;br/&gt;developed. Third, the project is producing new speedup learning&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for the new framework, which learn various types of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and that can exploit deep neural network (DNN)&lt;br/&gt;techniques. Finally, the research is producing extensive empirical&lt;br/&gt;evaluations including applications to the important problems of&lt;br/&gt;power grid control, municipal emergency response, and benchmark&lt;br/&gt;planning domains. The project has the potential for significant broader impact on&lt;br/&gt;applications where time-sensitive decisions must be made within&lt;br/&gt;stochastic environments. It will directly contribute to advances in&lt;br/&gt;two applications in particular: remedial action control in&lt;br/&gt;electrical grids to minimize cascading power outages, and planning&lt;br/&gt;for municipal emergencies such as fire and rescue operations in&lt;br/&gt;cities. The project will also serve to advance graduate education&lt;br/&gt;through research assistantships and undergraduate education through&lt;br/&gt;summer and academic term research experiences for undergraduates. A&lt;br/&gt;special topics graduate course will be taught on the area of&lt;br/&gt;planning and learning at Oregon State University and all course&lt;br/&gt;materials will be open access.</AbstractNarration>
