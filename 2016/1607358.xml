    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical description:&lt;br/&gt;Conventional color camera uses small color filters, such as red, green and blue color filters, to measure color information at different pixels. In order to image the polarization state of light, a polarization camera can use small polarization filters with dimension equal to the size of the pixel. Our research involves the development of new optical filters that can operate at different color and polarization states. The optical filters have dimension of a few microns and are put directly on top of an image sensor to create a polarization camera. The polarization camera will allow us to accurately image polarization states and enable novel imaging applications in optical sciences and engineering. The project supports multidisciplinary research and education in materials sciences, chemistry and optical sciences to both undergraduates and graduates students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of this proposal are (1) development of the design, material and fabrication process of achromatic micropolarizer and microretarder using liquid crystal polymer and dichroic dyes for the visible and near infrared spectrum, (2) construction of polarization sensitive focal plane array using the optical filters and (3) applications of the focal plane array to material characterization and classification. The proposed research will enable the realization of linear, circular and elliptical polarization filters that have high spatial resolution, broad bandwidth, low loss and high extinction ratio. This type of arbitrary patternable filter currently does not exist and our work will advance the fundamental design know-hows and fabrication of polarization optical filters and the construction, calibration and testing of a novel class of polarization sensitive focal plane array. By understanding the fundamental properties and processing of thin film polarization filters, our efforts will lead to advancement of novel and next generation high performance optical device and component. Educational outreach will be performed to encourage and recruit local science talents for advanced research and educational purposes. The results of this program will be communicated through undergraduate and graduate curriculum and make available through websites, public colloquiums, journal articles, class materials and patent disclosures. The collaboration with local industry will accelerate the commercialization of this technology. The outcome of our research will broadly impact several of the NSF programs such as chemistry (CHEM), materials (DMR), along with engineering directorate such as the division of electrical, communications and cyber systems (ECCS). Specifically, within the scope of ECCS, the areas of opto-electronic, micro/nano photonics, display technology, and photonic devices and integration will be well represented and served.</AbstractNarration>
