    <AbstractNarration>The extraordinary successes achieved in the last years by bioinformatics, structural biology,&lt;br/&gt;and functional studies of proteins have produced an unprecedented amount of data that holds&lt;br/&gt;promise to shed light on the workings of these molecular machines. Paradoxically these successes&lt;br/&gt;highlighted the fact that sequence, structure and function are linked together in a more subtle&lt;br/&gt;and complex way than previously thought. Specifically, protein families with recognizable&lt;br/&gt;sequence homology and strictly conserved architecture can show a huge functional heterogeneity,&lt;br/&gt;as in the case of voltage-gated-like ion channels (VGLCs). The project's goal is to define a coherent theoretical framework to analyse both&lt;br/&gt;ensembles of structures and sequences and apply it to the study of ion channel communications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes to use the Blue Waters system to address this problem using a combination of accurate free-energy&lt;br/&gt;MD calculations and statistical inference analysis of both trajectories and large multiple&lt;br/&gt;sequence alignment. The microscopic determinants of mechanical coupling will be identified&lt;br/&gt;with the set of residue-residue interactions that are conserved along evolution and are responsible&lt;br/&gt;for a specific, functionally oriented structural dynamics. The study will focus on two specific&lt;br/&gt;ion channels families gated by different stimuli: transient receptor potential channels and&lt;br/&gt;voltage gated cation channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, if successful, will bridge the gap in our understanding of molecular processes and neuronal responses, with the potential of significantly advancing large-scale initiatives like the BRAIN in the US and the HUMAN BRAIN in EU. Additionally, the project provides opportunity to involve graduate and undergraduate students in a research&lt;br/&gt;activity lying at the interface between the fields of data analytics and bio-molecular physical&lt;br/&gt;chemistry. Given the increased relevance of Big Data approaches to drug discovery and the&lt;br/&gt;emergence of precision medicine, the skillset and expertise acquired are expected to match&lt;br/&gt;the future needs of industry and academia. Furthermore, student recruitment in the project will take advantage of two&lt;br/&gt;initiatives. The first is a Professional Masters in Bioinformatics, where the PI is involved in&lt;br/&gt;all organizational aspects, from the steering committee to the design of Structural Bioinformatics&lt;br/&gt;classes. The second is the MARC U-STAR program designed to mentor underrepresented groups&lt;br/&gt;in research, providing financial assistance to prepare students for competitive graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>
