    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Franco Basile and his group at the University of Wyoming are working to develop new means of determining the composition and distribution of proteins in biological samples, employing the powerful analytical tools of mass spectrometry (MS). Specifically, the Basile group is developing new means of using MS to form an image of the location of specific (bio)chemicals on biological samples, including animal or plant tissue. These tools can be used widely in investigations of fundamental biology, biomedical research, renewable energy (biofuels) and bio-inspired materials, all areas that benefit society. Students involved receive broad, interdisciplinary training, preparing them for careers in a range of disciplines in industry and academia. The project is also fostering collaborative research within the University of Wyoming, and involving faculty and students from neighboring institutions (including community colleges) and others in the broader MS-imaging scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Basile team is developing a rapid (seconds) and solvent-free method to thermally digest and decompose proteins in biological samples. This represents a significant improvement over current methodologies, which require time-consuming (4h to overnight) digestion of proteins with expensive and difficult-to-use enzymes in solution. The non-enzymatic and solvent-free approach for on-tissue protein digestion is not only ~500 times faster than traditional enzymatic digestion, but also provides more control over the area of the tissue that is analyzed. The new method utilizes well-characterized thermal protein decomposition reactions that were discovered and developed in the Basile laboratory over the last 10 years. Potential applications span a wide range of disciplines, broadening the training received by participating students.</AbstractNarration>
