    <AbstractNarration>Drugs often have unique side effects due to non-selective interactions and poor targeting of the drug molecule. This research involves the synthesis of a drug molecule that can easily be bound to small, traceable nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can have a variety of characteristics and for these experiments fluorescent and magnetic nanoparticles will be used. These nanoparticles are unique in that they can be tracked in-vivo following delivery and better guided toward their target. The drug of interest is a peptide derived from scorpion venom that can alter electrical signaling within the brain in a way believed to contribute to regulating metabolism. Research to synthesize this drug, the peptide Margatoxin (MgTx), will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Glenn King, an expert in venom-derived molecules, at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. The traceable drug molecules will be studies for in-vivo effects on a potential therapeutic target for disorders such as obesity and diabetes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venom-derived drug molecules are inherently difficult to produce due to highly conserved disulfide bonds frequently found within their structure. With the expertise of Dr. King, the researcher will produce venom-derived peptide using a yeast expression system. This peptide can alter electrical signaling in the brain through modulation of action potential firing frequency. Interestingly, the primary metabolic molecules insulin and glucose can modulate electrical signaling in the brain in a similar manner. To better track and deliver this peptide-inhibitor to the brain, the peptide will be synthesized with a tag such that it can easily be bound to fluorescent and magnetic nanoparticles. Peptide-inhibitor bound nanoparticles will allow for improved targeting and tracking following delivery, and in turn, will provide a means to elucidate the relationship between this peptide?s target, obesity and other associated disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>
