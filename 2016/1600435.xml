    <AbstractNarration>Part I: Salish Kootenai College (SKC), in collaboration with the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center at Blackfeet Community College (BCC NSFC) and Hopa Mountain, a Bozeman, Montana based nonprofit organization, are developing a GP - EXTRA project entitled Native Pathways/Native Science Fellows (NPNSF) that supports Native American and Latino undergraduate students? diverse pathways to geosciences careers by providing fellowships with science organizations, including nonprofits and other tribal colleges and active cohort groups to increase their engagement in higher education and geosciences careers. By creating three cohort groups of six Fellows linked to two tribal colleges and universities, this initiative will be able to compare and contrast the pathways of these Fellows at each site to determine the most effective strategies to (1) increase the number of Indigenous (Native American and Latino) students who are engaged in community-based geosciences research, field experiences and careers; (2) develop work and training programs for Indigenous tribal college and university students interested in the geosciences; (3) build a network of community-based science professionals who are committed to the success of Native American and Latino students and provide ongoing support for personal, academic and professional success; and (4) prepare these students to transfer to undergraduate or graduate school. These goals align with the GEO Education and Diversity Strategic Framework goals of developing a diverse, competitive, and engaged geosciences workforce. Specific objectives of the NPNSF initiative are to match 18 promising tribal college and university students annually with hands-on field work and professional research experiences to build skills and pathways to academic and professional careers in the geosciences. These students will also be mentored by geosciences professionals and a supportive cohort network throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II: Native Pathways/Native Science Fellows (NPNSF) will enable Native American and Latino undergraduate students to access tribal college and university academic tracks that lead to graduation, fellowships with organizations that offer real world work experiences in the geosciences, and support of local cohorts of students that are on similar paths. These fellowships will integrate informal geosciences education with fieldwork. This initiative will enable project partners to design and study innovative learning opportunities as Native American and Latino college students access fellowships with organizations that offer early career work experiences in the geosciences. These fellowships will integrate informal geosciences education with fieldwork and research. Fellowships with local organizations, college visits, and professional conferences will expose college students to future careers. Tribal college and university fellowships with community-based science organizations will offer Native American and Latino students? skills and networks needed for successful careers in the geosciences. The student and professional networks that will be deepened through this program will both promote the inclusion of Native Americans and Latinos in science-based nonprofit organizations and professional networks while building knowledge of effective strategies for increasing the number and diversity of geosciences students entering the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
