    <AbstractNarration>This grant will enable students to attend the Verification Mentoring Workshop (VMW 2016) which will be co-located with the International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV), in Toronto (Canada), July 17-23, 2016. CAV is one of the premier conferences in computer science, dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for hardware and software systems. The purpose of Verification Mentoring Workshop is to provide mentoring and career advice to early-stage graduate students, to attract them to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided verification. Funded students will benefit greatly from the opportunity to engage in the critical technical, professional, and social exchanges that both conferences foster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer-aided verification covers a broad range of applications, from ensuring the correctness and safety of computer systems, to improving design and development productivity. The funded students will attend CAV, a top conference where they will learn about current research problems and interact with leaders in the field, and the VMW workshop which will focus on mentoring and career advice specific to early-stage graduate students who aim to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided verification.</AbstractNarration>
