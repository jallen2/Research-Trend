    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for two years for the Midwest Dynamical Systems Conference. The 2016 version of this conference will be held at Indiana University/Purdue University-Indianapolis from October 21-23, 2016. The site and date of the 2017 conference has not been made; it will be decided upon by the conference's Scientific Advisory board in 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the subfield of dynamical systems. A number of important topics will be covered, including but not restricted to parabolic dynamics, symbolic dynamics, rigidity phenomena and the like. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/mwds/</AbstractNarration>
