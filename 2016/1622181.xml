    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a novel and fully sustainable/renewable anti-corrosion epoxy primer formulation that meets or exceeds the corrosion protection that is provided by the toxic chromate-based systems. In addition, it is projected this primer will replace other epoxy primers that rely on additional valuable metal assets, for example zinc. The pioneering approach developed in this project utilizes US resources/scientific knowledge and it employs a new class of all-organic anti-corrosion pigments bringing in a fresh and very effective scientific method. These pigments will be manufactured in the US with no reliance on foreign metal supplies or labor; the chemical processing methods developed in this SBIR effort are US patent pending and are both environmentally and economically outstanding in performance. This SBIR project is a case where US based innovation and science combine to create US jobs in manufacturing and bring to light a transformational technology in the anti-corrosion epoxy primer business. Stopping corrosion keeps US commercial and defense assets in service, keeps productive people working, and keeps our country safe and prosperous. Mitigating corrosion is truly one of the important technological challenges ahead in the 21st century as natural resources and energy become limited and more costly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings to fruition first a detailed new and disruptive chemical synthesis technology for an economically and environmentally sound production of specific all-organic anti-corrosive pigments. The project utilizes these all-organic anti-corrosive pigments to advance and create a new class of Low volatile-organic-compound (VOC) anti-corrosion epoxy primers based on the art and science of solvent selection and blending. This combination of innovations is positioned to provide the first non-chromate and all-organic anti-corrosion epoxy primer that can replace with ease the present toxic and costly chromate-based primers. Current synthetic technologies cannot afford a cost-effective route to the additives and this program addresses that concern and will prepare several examples at the 100 g to 1 Kg scale to fully demonstrate the technology and provide parametric data for the design of larger chemical reactors and processes. This Phase I project will also create a new series of high-solids epoxy coatings that meet the Low-VOC emission value, dry time, corrosion protection, and adhesion requirements as laid out in appropriate military standards; primers developed in the project will be tested to meet these stringent requirements. These data will provide the critical performance and test data necessary to validate the coating formulations for certification and acceptance in both the commercial and defense marketplaces.</AbstractNarration>
