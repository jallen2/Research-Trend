    <AbstractNarration>The semiconductor industry is perennially one of America's top exporters. Worldwide semiconductor &lt;br/&gt;sales for 2014 reached $335.8 billion, and the number of U.S. jobs in this sector was estimated to be &lt;br/&gt;around 250,000 in 2013. More broadly, the U.S. tech industry, which depends on semiconductor &lt;br/&gt;innovation to spur new products and applications, is itself estimated to represent no less than 5.7% of the &lt;br/&gt;entire U.S. private sector workforce (at nearly 6.5 million jobs), and with a tech industry payroll of $654 &lt;br/&gt;billion in 2014, it accounted for over 11% of all U.S. private sector payroll. Yet despite its success, the &lt;br/&gt;industry must continue to innovate if the U.S. is to retain global leadership in this highly competitive area. &lt;br/&gt;The complexity of modern microelectronic products necessitates the use of computer tools to formulate &lt;br/&gt;and verify product designs prior to manufacturing. When a product doesn't operate as intended or suffers &lt;br/&gt;early failures, this can often be attributed to inadequacy of the models used during the design process. In &lt;br/&gt;fact, the shortcomings of existing approaches for system component modeling have become a serious &lt;br/&gt;impediment to continued innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) proposes to create &lt;br/&gt;machine-learning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation with the objective of &lt;br/&gt;enabling fast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. Success will make it much easier &lt;br/&gt;and cheaper to optimize a system design, allowing the industry to produce lower-power and lower-cost &lt;br/&gt;electronic systems without sacrificing functionality. The eventual result will be significant growth in &lt;br/&gt;capabilities that will drive innovation throughout the electronics industry, leading to new devices and &lt;br/&gt;applications, continued entrepreneurial leadership, and economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While achieving those goals, CAEML will also focus on diversifying the undergraduate engineering &lt;br/&gt;student body and improving the undergraduate experience. Students from groups traditionally &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in engineering will be targeted for recruitment as undergraduate research assistants. &lt;br/&gt;Member companies will provide internships and mentors for participating students, and the diverse &lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate student researchers in CAEML will receive hands-on multidisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;education. CAEML will also participate in all three site universities' existing avenues for student and &lt;br/&gt;faculty engagement with local youth. In particular, university-based summer camps are a tried and tested &lt;br/&gt;method of making high-school students familiar with and comfortable on our campuses. The HOT DAYS &lt;br/&gt;@ Georgia Tech (https://www.ece.gatech.edu/outreach/hot-days) camp is a week-long summer program &lt;br/&gt;designed to introduce high-school students to electrical and computer engineering concepts through &lt;br/&gt;various half-day modules including building a computer, working with robots, using music synthesis &lt;br/&gt;technology, building simple digital logic circuits and constructing a speaker from common household &lt;br/&gt;items. Additional modules covering CAEML research areas will be developed and incorporated into the &lt;br/&gt;camp's schedule. CAEML undergraduate and graduate students can serve as counselors or instructors &lt;br/&gt;for camps. Georgia Tech's Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing &lt;br/&gt;(CEISMC) hosts a variety of camps and programs for K-12 teachers, as well as students. CAEML faculty &lt;br/&gt;at Georgia Tech will participate in that effort as well as the NSF-funded Summer Teacher Experience in &lt;br/&gt;Packaging, Utilizing Physics (STEP-UP) Program (https://www.ece.gatech.edu/outreach/step-up-&lt;br/&gt;program), which is an eight-week research experience for metro Atlanta high-school physics teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) will create machine-&lt;br/&gt;learning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation, with the objective of enabling &lt;br/&gt;fast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. The electronics industry's continued ability &lt;br/&gt;to innovate requires the creation of optimization methodologies that result in low-power integrated &lt;br/&gt;systems that meet performance specifications, despite being composed of components whose &lt;br/&gt;characteristics exhibit variability and that operate in different physical or signal domains. Today, &lt;br/&gt;shortcomings in accuracy and comprehensiveness of component-level behavioral models impede the &lt;br/&gt;advancement of computer-aided electronic system design optimization. The model accuracy also impacts &lt;br/&gt;system verification. Ultimately, the proper functionality of an electronic system is verified through testing &lt;br/&gt;of a representative sample. However, modern electronic systems are so complex that it is unthinkable to &lt;br/&gt;bring one to the manufacturing stage without first verifying its operation using simulation. Today, &lt;br/&gt;simulation generally does not ensure that an integrated circuit or electronic system will pass qualification &lt;br/&gt;testing the first time, and failures are often attributed to insufficiency of the simulation models. With an &lt;br/&gt;improved modeling capability, one could achieve better design efficiency, and also perform design &lt;br/&gt;optimization. For system simulation, behavioral models of the components' terminal responses are &lt;br/&gt;desired for both computational tractability and protection of intellectual property. Despite many years of &lt;br/&gt;significant effort by the electronic design automation community, there is not a general, systematic &lt;br/&gt;method to generate accurate and comprehensive behavioral models, in part because of the nonlinear, &lt;br/&gt;complex, and multi-port nature of the components being modeled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAEML will pioneer the use of machine-learning methods to extract behavioral models of electronic &lt;br/&gt;components and subsystems from simulation waveforms and/or measurement data. The Center will make &lt;br/&gt;2 primary contributions to the field of machine learning: it will demonstrate the application of machine &lt;br/&gt;learning to electronics modeling, and develop the entire machine-learning pipeline. Historically, machine-&lt;br/&gt;learning theorists have focused on the model learning and evaluation tasks, but CAEML will focus on &lt;br/&gt;end-to-end performance of the pipeline, including data acquisition, selection and filtering, as well as cost &lt;br/&gt;function specification. CAEML will develop a methodology to use prior knowledge, i.e., physical &lt;br/&gt;constraints and the domain knowledge provided by designers, to speed up the learning process. Novel &lt;br/&gt;methods of incorporating component variability, including that due to semiconductor process variations, &lt;br/&gt;will be developed. The intended end-users are electronic design automation (EDA) tool developers, IC &lt;br/&gt;design houses, and system design and manufacturing companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAEML consists of 3 sites: Illinois, Georgia Tech, and NC State. The scope of research at each site &lt;br/&gt;encompasses both algorithm development and the application of the derived models to a variety of IC &lt;br/&gt;and system design tasks. Investigators at all 3 university sites have unique skills and expertise while &lt;br/&gt;sharing interests in electronic design automation, IC design, system-level signal integrity, and power &lt;br/&gt;distribution. To leverage the cross-campus expertise, many of the Center's proposed projects involve &lt;br/&gt;investigators from more than one site. The Georgia Tech investigators have special expertise in &lt;br/&gt;advanced IC packaging, power integrity, multi-physics simulation, computational electromagnetics, neural &lt;br/&gt;networks, optimization and system integration. All three sites have strong research records in the fields of &lt;br/&gt;signal integrity analysis and electronic design automation. Excellent computational resources are &lt;br/&gt;available at Georgia Tech for the proposed work including extensive measurement and fabrication &lt;br/&gt;facilities.</AbstractNarration>
