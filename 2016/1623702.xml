    <AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds&lt;br/&gt;efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies&lt;br/&gt;and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich&lt;br/&gt;environments. Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the&lt;br/&gt;viability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and&lt;br/&gt;building new kinds of learning technologies and studying their&lt;br/&gt;possibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them&lt;br/&gt;effectively. Most online courseware helps teach facts and concepts,&lt;br/&gt;while a different type of online learning software called intelligent&lt;br/&gt;tutoring systems can effectively teach skills in a way that is&lt;br/&gt;tailored to each learner. Unfortunately, these two tools are rarely&lt;br/&gt;integrated because of the expense and specialized expertise required&lt;br/&gt;to create intelligent tutors. This project will close this gap by&lt;br/&gt;building and testing a new scalable technology that will allow&lt;br/&gt;teachers without years of specialized training to author adaptive&lt;br/&gt;online courses that combine the best of both these approaches. This&lt;br/&gt;scalable cyberlearning platform will provide students with effective&lt;br/&gt;online instruction, provide learning engineers with an efficient&lt;br/&gt;authoring environment to build adaptive online courses, and provide&lt;br/&gt;researchers with a sharable corpus of big learning data that they can&lt;br/&gt;use to develop and refine theories of how students learn in adaptive&lt;br/&gt;online-course learning environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will build a web-browser-based authoring environment that&lt;br/&gt;supports the creation cognitive tutors and their seamless integration&lt;br/&gt;into online courses and will measure how well the resulting adaptive&lt;br/&gt;online courses promote facets of student learning such as synergetic&lt;br/&gt;competency and engagement. The central hypotheses are: (1) that the&lt;br/&gt;SimStudent technology -- a machine-learning agent that learns&lt;br/&gt;cognitive skills from demonstration -- can be a practical authoring&lt;br/&gt;tool for cognitive tutors that can be easily embedded into online&lt;br/&gt;courses; (2) that this technology can represent a tight connection&lt;br/&gt;between learners' procedural competency and conceptual competency by&lt;br/&gt;combining knowledge-tracing (a standard method used by existing&lt;br/&gt;cognitive tutors) and text-mining (data-mining latent skills from&lt;br/&gt;traditional online course instructions) into an innovative&lt;br/&gt;student-modeling technique; and (3) that adaptive online courses&lt;br/&gt;created with this technique can produce robust student learning by&lt;br/&gt;promoting connections between their procedural and conceptual&lt;br/&gt;understanding (synergetic competency). As part of the overall research&lt;br/&gt;program, the project will: (a) develop a genetic application&lt;br/&gt;programming interface (API) for an existing web-based authoring&lt;br/&gt;technology to build cognitive tutors for online course integration;&lt;br/&gt;(b) develop an adaptive instructional technology as a generic control&lt;br/&gt;mechanism for adaptive online courses; (c) build new adaptive online&lt;br/&gt;courses on Open edX and also convert an existing OLI course into an&lt;br/&gt;adaptive online course; (d) conduct in-vivo studies using the adaptive&lt;br/&gt;online courses to test their effectiveness; (e) test the efficacy of&lt;br/&gt;the proposed adaptive online courses in supporting students to achieve&lt;br/&gt;the aforementioned synergetic competency. Successful completion of the&lt;br/&gt;project will yield the following expected outcomes: (i) a scalable&lt;br/&gt;online course architecture with efficient authoring tools for building&lt;br/&gt;cognitive tutors and integrating them into online courses in order to&lt;br/&gt;make those courses adaptive; (ii) a practical technique to identify&lt;br/&gt;relationships between procedural competency and conceptual competency;&lt;br/&gt;and (iii) an expanded theory of how students learn with the adaptive&lt;br/&gt;online course, and in particular of how students achieve robust&lt;br/&gt;learning with synergetic competency.</AbstractNarration>
