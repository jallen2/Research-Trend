    <AbstractNarration>PI: Tsutsui, Hideaki&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: 1606181 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to develop a paper-based molecular sensing platform. The primary advantages are its low cost and ease of use. The proposed work is expected to broadly expand the capability and applications of paper-based sensors for a variety of fields, such as medical, agricultural, and environmental testing and diagnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paper-based microfluidic devices have recently emerged as promising sensing platforms for serving the diagnostic needs in many sectors of society. Advantages of paper-based microfluidic sensors include fast detection, ease of fabrication and use, minimal instrument requirements, lightweight, portability, and low cost. However, its widespread use beyond research laboratories has been hampered because of a lack of highly sensitive detection methods that can be easily implemented on a paper substrate. The overall goal of this project is to develop a label-free, highly sensitive, chemiresistive nanosensor platform. This goal will be achieved through a series of research tasks: 1) development of an ultrasensitive carbon nanotube chemiresistive biosensor on paper; 2) development of an effective fluid handling technology; and 3) integration and demonstration of label-free, multiplexed detection of cardiac biomarkers as model antigens. Intellectual merits include a highly sensitive sensing element made of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes and technological innovations of microfluidic transport, which collectively enable the proposed nanosensor. Broader impact of the research program is expansion of the capability and applications of the paper-based microfluidic-facilitated biosensors. In particular, the proposed label-free chemiresistive biosensor array is expected to be highly sensitive, facile, and economical. It is also expected to be readily applicable to the multiplexed detection of analytes in a variety of complex fluid matrices such as food, water, plants, and body fluids. In conjunction with research activities, this project will develop and integrate several outreach and educational activities, including new curricula development on paper-based microfluidic biosensors, research training of both undergraduate and graduate students, particularly underrepresented minorities and women, and outreach efforts to engage K-12 teachers and students of the Inland Empire region of California.</AbstractNarration>
