    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to support the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) Symposium on "Integrated Computational Structure-Material Modeling of Deformation and Failure under Extreme Conditions," to be held in Baltimore, MD on June 10-22, 2016. The symposium will focus on different material classes and cover a range of spatial and temporal scales needed for physics-based modeling of deformation and failure under extreme operational parameters. The symposium will bring together top researchers from academia, government laboratories and industry. A number of junior faculty members and young researchers from academia and government laboratories will be invited to participate in the IUTAM symposium. Funding through this proposal would increase the number of junior faculty and researchers participants to prepare the next generation of scientific leaders in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High demands on future systems are challenging the operational limits of materials like metals, ceramics and composites. The design of enhanced systems to meet performance and reliability challenges requires advanced methods of analysis and simulation to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure-material behavior. Distinguished speakers from academia, industry and government laboratories have been invited to address the state of the art in the thematic areas of the symposium and to make approximately 35 presentations. There will be three panel discussion sessions focused on the prediction of material behavior during fatigue, impact and blast loading, and radiation and high temperature environments. Additionally, a poster session is planned to showcase research progress by junior researchers.</AbstractNarration>
