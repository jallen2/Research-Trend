    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the University of Pennsylvania provides support for workshop on Assessing Performance and Developing an Accountability System for Broadening Participation. This workshop will convene a group of Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering (CEOSE) members and experts from federal agencies, institutions of higher education, foundations, and nonprofit and for profit organizations for one and a half days of discussion, brainstorming, analysis, and planning on building an accountability system to measure the success of efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. It will be held at the NSF Headquarters, Arlington, VA in October 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will synthesize what agencies, foundations, and organizations currently do to measure the success of efforts they support for broadening participation and share new methods to better measure/assess broadening participation efforts. The project aims to respond to the recommendation made within CEOSE's 2015-2016 Biennial Report to Congress on developing appropriate performance measures for broadening participation by developing and disseminating an evidence-based accountability system to advance broadening participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The resources and outcomes of this project will enhance the work of Federal agencies in holding individual grantees and institutions (particularly institutions of higher education) accountable for investments made related to broadening participation and for realizing broadening participation goals. Ultimately, the results of this workshop will be beneficial to the STEM community. These beneficial results are those that include the identification and discussion of challenges and barriers to and practices for increasing the workforce population of women, underrepresented group, and people with disabilities in STEM fields. In addition, the resources of the workshop will also be helpful to multiple communities, including the field of evaluation.</AbstractNarration>
