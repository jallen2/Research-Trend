    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it may potentially impact the lives of millions of women worldwide who are tested for the presence of endometrial cancer. In the US, women who with abnormal vaginal bleeding (regardless of age, shape, race, economic standing, history or ethnicity) are considered to have endometrial cancer, until proven otherwise. Unfortunately, unlike the use of pap tests for the detection of cervical cancer, no tests or exams currently exist for screening endometrial cancer. Simple and accurate screening and biopsy tools are important for the early detection of endometrial cancer because of: i) clinical requirements to rule out cancer first and foremost, ii) improved survival rates with early detection, and iii) high pain, cost, and time associated with current diagnostic measures. This team's process may enable women to get access to non-invasive, accurate diagnoses of endometrial cancer not otherwise available. Accurate, real time and early diagnosis of endometrial cancer will benefit and estimated one out of nineteen women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on the first steps in translating a miniaturized tool for discerning healthy vs. malignant tissue at the point of care. Despite the critical need, no method currently exists for the real time, clinical diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Current methods require a succession of inconclusive, invasive, and time-consuming tests, thus failing to meet the needs of the user. To fill this gap, this projects aims to develop a product for screening endometrial cancer during the first visit to a clinic. Two imaging modalities are integrated, including photoacoustic imaging (known to provide a clear map of vasculature, and ultrasound) for deep tissue penetration, identifying tissue density. This combination will enable the detection of tissue not otherwise able to be reached without expensive and invasive procedures requiring contrast agents. This new method of device manipulation will allow for complete 3D imaging of an organ, in conjunction with tissue sample collection.</AbstractNarration>
