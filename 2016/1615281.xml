    <AbstractNarration>Tidal disruption events (TDEs), which occur when a star is destroyed by the gravitational&lt;br/&gt;field of a supermassive black hole, are unique probes into the properties of otherwise-quiescent&lt;br/&gt;supermassive black holes (SMBHs). About 30 of them have been observed so far and this number&lt;br/&gt;is steadily increasing, aided with surveys and new instruments coming online. Despite this&lt;br/&gt;wealth of observational knowledge, our understanding of the TDE physics, which will ultimately&lt;br/&gt;allow us to interpret those observations, remains rudimentary at best. In particular, we still&lt;br/&gt;do not understand what causes the debris to lose its energy and angular momentum, fall into&lt;br/&gt;the black hole and radiate. This project will make use of the fact that, at their core,&lt;br/&gt;TDEs are ultimately well-described by the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD)&lt;br/&gt;equations of motion. By carrying out direct GRMHD simulations of TDEs, the project hopes to obtain a first-principles&lt;br/&gt;understanding of TDE physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed simulations will provide answers to several long-standing&lt;br/&gt;questions in the TDE community: How does the debris circularize, dissipate energy, and accrete&lt;br/&gt;onto the SMBH? What fraction of stellar gas forms the disk, what fraction is ejected as an&lt;br/&gt;outflow, and how do these fractions depend on the black hole mass, spin, and the inclination&lt;br/&gt;of the stellar orbit? Do eccentric accretion disks form and how does angular momentum transport&lt;br/&gt;work in such disks? If such an eccentric disk is tilted, as is naturally expected in TDEs,&lt;br/&gt;does it undergo general relativistic precession? Do such disks produce relativistic jets and&lt;br/&gt;how? Understanding these issues will allow the community to make meaningful, quantitative&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of TDE observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though the project is focused on TDEs, it elucidates the basic&lt;br/&gt;physics of tilted accretion disks and their jets that is applicable to a range of sources&lt;br/&gt;including quasars, black hole binaries, and ultra-luminous X-ray sources. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the proposed simulations will study, from first principles&lt;br/&gt;and for the first time, the development of magnetorotational instability in eccentric tilted&lt;br/&gt;accretion disks and the long-term evolution and GR precession of such disks under continuous&lt;br/&gt;feeding by the debris stream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, stars shredded by black holes and producing relativistic jets offer some&lt;br/&gt;of the most fascinating manifestations of general relativity. The project will disseminate the&lt;br/&gt;results obtained as part of this proposal in public talks, summer schools, radio station and&lt;br/&gt;newspaper interviews, and press releases. Finally, the project will involve undergraduate students in data&lt;br/&gt;analysis and visualization, and they will gain experience in working with Big Data, black&lt;br/&gt;hole accretion and jet physics, presenting their results at conferences, and publishing their&lt;br/&gt;work in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
