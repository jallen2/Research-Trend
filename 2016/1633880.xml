    <AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research will develop a spatially explicit environmental history of Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma ulmi), a fungal infection that destroyed millions of elm trees in the United States, and analyze the various management techniques that have been historically implemented against the spread of the disease. The research will provide new insights into the causality and spatio-temporal relationships of Dutch elm disease spread as well as the broader dispersal of forest pests and diseases throughout America's countryside and urban environments. The findings will be particularly relevant for a better understanding of the biogeography of invasive species and invasions as well as the impacts of human interactions with forests and urban environments. The research has significant broader implications for forest managers and public policy with regard to adopting proactive and effective mechanisms for the control of other current and future tree diseases and pests. The doctoral student will work with government agencies and nongovernmental organizations at the local, state, and national levels to disseminate the findings. The research can inform efforts to save flora and to prevent significant economic impacts. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the introduction of Dutch elm disease in the United States, elm trees (Ulmus americana) were planted ubiquitously in cities across the country. The popularity of elm trees, however, was severely impacted by Dutch elm disease which was introduced in the United States during the early 1930s. Over the next four decades the disease spread until elms were effectively removed from urban environments. The doctoral student whose dissertation research will be supported by this award will focus on three core questions: (1) After its introduction to the United States, what were the spatio-temporal extents of Dutch elm disease spread? (2) What were the primary management methods used in an attempt to control Dutch elm disease, how did they change over time, where were they implemented, and why did they vary in success and failure? (3) How did Dutch elm disease affect urban landscapes in the United States? The researchers will combine archival data and mapping software in a Historic Geographic Information Systems to visualize, map and analyze the spread of Dutch elm disease particularly in relation to the policies used to control it at both a national scale and at the local scale via a case study of Syracuse, NY. The doctoral student will also perform a qualitative analysis on archival records to frame the removal of elm trees as part of a historical narrative and a changing urban landscape.</AbstractNarration>
