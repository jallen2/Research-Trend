    <AbstractNarration>This project's main idea is to assess the commercial potential of a variety of innovative shape-transforming structures. These shape-transforming objects go through changes in shape, such as shrinking and expanding, which would make the shape better at performing its function. Shape-changing structures may add value to existing products and may enable new ones. As an example, a shape-transforming car bumper may be better in car crashes. These bumpers would increase the durability of car, because damage would be immediately fixable by the driver, giving lower or no replacement costs. In the event of a small accident, using a shape-changing bumper could avoid having to replace the whole bumper. This would make the automotive industry more efficient due to fewer junked cars and parts. Furthermore, the lower cost, time, and effort of fixing a car would increase customer satisfaction. Another possibility may be shape-transforming architectural design of homes. In particular, changeable roof heights can be designed to adapt to seasonal changes. In the summer, roofs could expand to increase airflow; whereas, a lower ceiling would maximize heat efficiency during the winter. This project will help better understand how to adapt the proposed technologies to specific customer's needs and expectations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve at least 100 interviews with potential customers and partners. This I-Corps team will identify potential customers for the shape-morphing structures and learn in detail their specific needs and wants, so as to have an accurate understanding of the value proposition that the team can provide its customers. This activity will improve the team's understanding of delivery channels and how to cultivate customer relationships. The team will also learn how to approach potential customers, and to develop custom products that meet their specific needs. The I-Corps training will help the team ground their new technology in real-world challenges and opportunities. Because this team has both long and short term objectives, the team will follow a barbell approach in which they target 50% of resources and interviews towards the development of a single short-term product that seems to be low risk and could have immediate viability. Simultaneously, the team would invest 50% of its resources on interviews and customer discovery related to a diverse array of longer term, riskier and perhaps more profitable applications.</AbstractNarration>
