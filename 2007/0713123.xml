    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project, called Moirae, is to investigate the benefits and challenges of integrating history into a near-real-time monitoring system and to build a new continuous query engine that supports this integration. To achieve this goal, the project takes the following steps: (1) develop new query models for integrated queries over live and historical data; (2) develop new algorithms that effectively match new events with similar past observations; (3) develop a new continuous query engine that effectively supports the new query model (the engine includes a partitioned stream data store, a scheduler for fair and incremental historical query execution, new operators for merging historical data with data streams, and mechanisms for user-feedback); and (4) evaluate the practicality and performance of the system on data traces from real application domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project funds support the training of PhD students. However, the project includes a large system development component that serves to train both graduate and undergraduate students in research and systems building. The result of this project will provide a new type of continuous processing engine that will better support monitoring applications in domains ranging from computer system monitoring, to network monitoring, and sensor-based environment monitoring. Such large-scale monitoring applications are critical for enterprises that operate at large scales. These enterprises need to carefully monitor their infrastructures to effectively handle and diagnose failures and deliver high-quality services to their customers. The software and technical papers resulting from this project will be disseminated through the project website(http://data.cs.washington.edu/moirae/moirae.shtml).</AbstractNarration>
