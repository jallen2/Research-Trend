    <AbstractNarration>Pavlovi'c plans to gain better understanding of fluid and nonlinear wave and dispersive equations&lt;br/&gt;via analyzing dispersive equations using harmonic analysis techniques that turned out to be useful&lt;br/&gt;in the context of fluid equations and vice verse. The first group of proposed problems focuses on&lt;br/&gt;the Navier-Stokes equations that describe fundamental properties of viscous fluids. One approach&lt;br/&gt;in studying existence of solutions to the Navier-Stokes is to obtain solutions to the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;integral equation. Existence of these solutions in 3D has been proved only locally in time and&lt;br/&gt;globally for small initial data. Hence it is important to understand behavior of these solutions in&lt;br/&gt;"critical spaces" that preserve scaling invariance. With her collaborators the PI will investigate the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of solutions to the Navier-stokes equations in critical spaces. Questions of interest include&lt;br/&gt;stability of self-similar solutions in critical spaces (which is motivated by the analogy with solitons&lt;br/&gt;in the context of dispersive equations) and a long standing open problem related to well-posedness&lt;br/&gt;of the Navier-Stokes equations in the largest critical space. The second group of proposed problems&lt;br/&gt;concentrates on nonlinear dispersive equations. Many of the important structural properties&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. conserved or monotone quantities) of the nonlinear Schrodinger equations (NLS) are at low&lt;br/&gt;regularities, and to exploit these features one needs to establish existence theory at low regularities.&lt;br/&gt;Pavlovi'c proposes to continue her work on establishing global well-posedness for certain class of&lt;br/&gt;NLS equations corresponding to low regularity data. The PI will employ and further investigate&lt;br/&gt;tools that were useful in recent advances in the field, such as interaction Morawetz estimates.&lt;br/&gt;The third group of problems is related to super-critical nonlinear wave and NLS equations. Here&lt;br/&gt;super-critical refers to equations with conserved quantities at lower regularities than the scaling&lt;br/&gt;invariant norm (the 3D Navier-Stokes is an example). Motivated by her earlier work with Katz&lt;br/&gt;on partial regularity of the Navier-Stokes equations, Pavlovi'c proposes to use microlocalization&lt;br/&gt;techniques in order to obtain a partial regularity result for super-critical NLS and wave equations.&lt;br/&gt;Suggested problems involve important mathematical questions such as existence and regularity&lt;br/&gt;of solutions to nonlinear PDEs that describe motion of fluid or various wave phenomena. For&lt;br/&gt;instance, the theory of the Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions is far from being complete.&lt;br/&gt;The outstanding open problems, whose better understanding would have impact in the fields from&lt;br/&gt;oceanography to cosmology, are global existence, uniqueness and regularity of smooth solutions to&lt;br/&gt;the Navier-Stokes in 3D. On the other hand, the NLS and their combinations with the Kortewegde-&lt;br/&gt;Vries and wave equations have been proposed as models for many basic wave phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;Such a physical relevance of the equations motivates mathematical explorations. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;activity seeks to find an interdisciplinary approach to questions arising from fluid and dispersive&lt;br/&gt;PDEs. In particular, the PI plans to analyze dispersive equations using sophisticated techniques&lt;br/&gt;of harmonic analysis that turned out to be useful in the context of fluid equations and vice verse.</AbstractNarration>
