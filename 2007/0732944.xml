    <AbstractNarration>Earth Systems Science (40). The Polaris Project is engaging students and early career scientists in a multifaceted effort that includes: a field course and research experience for undergraduate students in the Siberian Arctic; several new arctic-focused undergraduate courses taught by project Co-PIs at their respective colleges across the United States and in Russia; the opportunity for Co-PIs to initiate research programs in the Siberian Arctic; and a wide range of outreach activities. The unifying scientific theme for the project is the transport and transformations of carbon and nutrients as they move with water from terrestrial uplands to the Arctic Ocean. Given the rapid changes underway in the Arctic, the broader impact of this project is found in the availability of project related materials; its training of future leaders in arctic research and education as well as its education of the public through student and faculty visits to K-12 classrooms; student generated and maintained blogs on their research and experiences; and inclusion in the GoNorth curriculum (www.polarhusky.com) which is used in thousands of K-12 schools worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
