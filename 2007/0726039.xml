    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-0726039&lt;br/&gt;C. Martin, Texas Tech University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to ask for funds to support a workshop entitled"Nonlinear Control Theory and Emerging Application". The workshop will be held on April 20 and 21 in Lubbock, Texas. The meetings of the workshop will be held on the campus of Texas Tech University and the participants will be housed in a local hotel. The organization will be under the direction of Clyde Martin, Bijoy Ghosh and Lawrence Schovanec. We anticipate no more than 20 speakers and around 40 participants. The topics of the conference will reflect the broad interdisciplinary work of Professor Dayawansa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will cover many of the modern areas of control theory and some very important emerging areas of application. The workshop will address issues ranging from stabilization of low dimensional nonlinear control systems, optimal control, geometric control, robust control to emerging applications such as the control of human motion, the analysis of circadian rhythm, the modeling of the output of optical devices used in chemistry and the control of large numbers of small mirrors modeled as low dimensional interconnected nonlinear systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop such as this is a necessary part of the education of young aspiring control theorists. Graduate students and undergraduates will be exposed to some of the major people in the field and will see a spectrum of problems of current interest in both theory and application. Another aspect of the conference is that there will be speakers that are not form mathematics, engineering or control theory. This cross disciplinary aspect of the conference will be a valuable education for almost everyone at the workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One goal of the workshop is to bring together some of the leading figures of the control theory community to discuss the question of what are the important problems in nonlinear control theory and its applications. We expect that this workshop will excite the imagination of the control community. Another major goal is the interdisciplinary effort. The workshop will show that control theory can be applied in diverse areas of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is designed to showcase the diverse applications that are possible using modern nonlinear control, the goal of the workshop is to encourage world class control theorists to collaborate in interdisciplinary studies. Another goal is to show that there are real advantages in other areas of science where control theory can be effectively applied.</AbstractNarration>
