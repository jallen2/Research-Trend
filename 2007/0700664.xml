    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for investigating the technical and economic viability of sensor embedded products geared towards cut down the product repair/service costs, ratchet up the recovery of end-of-life products, and curtail the product disposal rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plans to achieve the following objectives: (1) develop effective sensor-data processing methods for monitoring the condition of important computer components such as hard drive, motherboard, and power supply units; (2) perform experiments to collect test data; and use statistical methods to characterize remaining life estimates, failure predictions, and false alarms; (3) build a discrete simulation model to represent repair/service and EOL processing operations; validate the simulation models and their results through experimental data inputs from industrial partners; (4) perform cost-benefit analysis; evaluate benefits to companies and consumers; and assess the improvements product recovery and reuse because of sensor-embedded products. The project focuses primarily on desktop computers as test beds to demonstrate the proposed approach; however the outcomes of the research are equally applicable to a wide variety of electronic consumer products such as printers, copiers, home/office networking devices, automotive electronics, and medical electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contributions offer valuable benefits to both consumers and companies. To consumers it brings comfort by (1) guarding against surprise and catastrophic product failures; (2) reducing repair/service costs; and (3) eliminating periodic preventive maintenance visits. To companies it provides a means to (1) gain better understanding of customer needs and patterns of product usage; (2) identify the frequent/common product failure modes; and (3) minimize end-of-life product processing costs. Ultimately, the outcomes of the project will help environment by extending the period of product usage and reducing the amount of end-of-life products being diverted to the dump yards.</AbstractNarration>
