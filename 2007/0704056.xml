    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This renewal project provides an opportunity for deaf and hard of hearing students&lt;br/&gt;to participate in classroom and laboratory research work in the field of polymers. A&lt;br/&gt;small group of college-age students will perform an internship at Tufts University for six&lt;br/&gt;weeks during the summer. The classroom and laboratory components address the&lt;br/&gt;materials chemistry and physics of polymers and polymer-based nanocomposites,&lt;br/&gt;crystallization and melting of polymers, the interaction of X-rays and light with&lt;br/&gt;polymers, mechanical properties of polymers, and the connection between thermal&lt;br/&gt;processing, structure, and ultimate properties of polymers. To prepare the students for&lt;br/&gt;participation in the scientific community, a strong component of pre-professional training&lt;br/&gt;is incorporated, including discussion of ethical issues in the performance of research and&lt;br/&gt;in scholarship. The goals of the laboratory research component are to: expose the&lt;br/&gt;students to the laboratory environment; introduce them to the concepts of formulating and&lt;br/&gt;testing hypotheses; assist students to conduct systematic studies while controlling&lt;br/&gt;variables; illustrate the use of modern analytical equipment; and demonstrate the&lt;br/&gt;connection between processing variables, structure, and properties.&lt;br/&gt;The students will make and characterize polymer-based nanocomposite films&lt;br/&gt;comprising a semicrystalline polymer matrix and an additive, which will be either&lt;br/&gt;organically modified silicates (clay) or glass nanospheres. This research will contribute&lt;br/&gt;to a fundamental understanding of the effects of nanoparticles on the structure and&lt;br/&gt;properties of semicrystalline polymers. In this renewal, we will emphasize mechanical&lt;br/&gt;property measurements, using newly available instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The program is aimed at a disadvantaged minority population, of deaf and hard of&lt;br/&gt;hearing college age students. The unique attributes of this program are its emphasis on:&lt;br/&gt;1. Teamwork; 2. Performance of a start-to-finish research project; 3. Materials sciencebased&lt;br/&gt;approach; and 4. Diversity. Students of all disability levels are candidates for this&lt;br/&gt;program, including those students who neither hear nor voice. The broader impact will&lt;br/&gt;be to bring deaf and hard of hearing students into the larger scientific community as&lt;br/&gt;professionals, by providing positive scientific experiences at a formative time in their&lt;br/&gt;educational lives. The long-range goal of the proposed program is to increase&lt;br/&gt;participation of deaf and hard of hearing students in science and engineering, and provide&lt;br/&gt;enrichment and mentoring for these students.</AbstractNarration>
