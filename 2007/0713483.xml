    <AbstractNarration>Proposal 0713483&lt;br/&gt;"RI: Learning Structure to Structure Mappings"&lt;br/&gt;PI: Thorsten Joachims&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This goal of this proposal is to extend ongoing work on learning with &lt;br/&gt;structured output spaces in the support-vector-machine (SVM) &lt;br/&gt;framework. Such structured output spaces arise in problems where the &lt;br/&gt;prediction is not a univariate response (e.g., yes/no), but a &lt;br/&gt;structured object (e.g., a sequence, tree, or alignment). While &lt;br/&gt;recent work has uncovered how to discriminatively learn prediction &lt;br/&gt;rules for simple structures with limited interdependencies, research &lt;br/&gt;is needed to extend these methods to the complex structures needed &lt;br/&gt;for many applications (e.g., machine translation). This project aims &lt;br/&gt;to extend the structural SVM framework to such complex structures. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, it focuses on the required gains in computational &lt;br/&gt;efficiency, broader classes of loss functions, and the use of &lt;br/&gt;unlabeled data to improve statistical efficiency. As done in the &lt;br/&gt;past, the project plans to make available software implementations of &lt;br/&gt;the methods developed in the project. These will be made sufficiently &lt;br/&gt;robust and efficient so as to be suitable for real-world applications &lt;br/&gt;outside the machine learning research community as well as for &lt;br/&gt;classroom teaching. The project will apply its results to two &lt;br/&gt;high-impact areas like protein structure prediction or machine &lt;br/&gt;translation.</AbstractNarration>
