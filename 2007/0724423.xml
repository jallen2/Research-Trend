    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project aims to further develop a microfluidic device for the detection of nucleic acids for a variety of studies where genetic analysis and identification of target sequences are required. The instrument proposed is designed to be compact and capable of reading a disposable cartridge on which sample preparation, amplification, and multiplex detection, with a modest-sized microarray, are performed. The proposed instrument is enabled by direct imaging of a PhotoGenerated Reagent (PGR) microarray, with an image sensor positioned near the face of the microarray. It is also enabled by the use of up-converting phosphors as the label, which are in turn excited by infrared radiation that passes through the silicon microarray. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of and inexpensive, fully integrated and automated microfluidic device for use in genetic analysis would give individuals in academic, commercial and defense settings access to affordable microarray analysis. The availability of such a versatile platform would allow the development of arrays for any nucleic acid target, as well as easy multiplexing. With such a platform, production of custom arrays and off-the-shelf ones will be achieved with great facility. Moreover, the integrated platform will reduce the cost and effort associated with microarray analysis.</AbstractNarration>
