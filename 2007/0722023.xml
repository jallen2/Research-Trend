    <AbstractNarration>The performance of civil infrastructures plays an important role in maintaining the&lt;br/&gt;quality of life of the U.S. citizens as well as in the nation's defense systems. The project attacks several&lt;br/&gt;critical issues involved in the new generation of smart civil infrastructure system with built-in sensor&lt;br/&gt;network. Performance assessment of civil infrastructure is usually a long-term task (i.e. several years) the&lt;br/&gt;power supply for the sensor network becomes a problem, especially for the embedded sensors in&lt;br/&gt;structures. The first focus is to provide a reliable energy harvesting method for the sensors and a power&lt;br/&gt;management plan for the sensor network. For long-term performance assessment, processing the large&lt;br/&gt;amount of data obtained from the sensor network is a difficult and important task, the second focus is how&lt;br/&gt;to configure the sensor network and assemble the measured data in a more meaningful way in order to use&lt;br/&gt;the available information to predict future structural performance. To this end, this project is to develop&lt;br/&gt;an integrated Power Aware Sensor-Simulation Network system for long-term performance&lt;br/&gt;assessment of concrete infrastructures. The system consists of three subsystems&lt;br/&gt;including an energy harvesting and power management system for the sensors, a combined sensor-based&lt;br/&gt;numerical simulation system, and a massively parallel computing system for the numerical calculations.&lt;br/&gt;Built-in sensors have found their applications not only in civil, and aerospace structures, but&lt;br/&gt;also in mechanical engineering and medical devices such as artificial hearts. Therefore, the&lt;br/&gt;research will have a great impact in many areas of science and technologies.</AbstractNarration>
