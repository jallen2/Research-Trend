    <AbstractNarration>Cognitive radio networks enable the sharing of the wireless spectrum with licensed users, but impose challenges due to the fluctuating nature of the spectrum as well as the diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To address these challenges, a spectrum-aware COGnitive radio NETwork (COGNET) based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In COGNET, five major research directions are investigated: (1) First, a frequency agile, wideband analog/RF front-end technology is developed, which is robust to non-linearity (RF/analog IC design). (2) To detect the presence of licensed users, a fast detection scheme is developed by exploiting the spatial diversity inherent to multi-user networks (spectrum sensing), (3) To select the best channel, novel decision methods are proposed that consider channel information, licensed user activities, and application requirements (spectrum decision). (4) A dual-mode spectrum sharing framework is proposed, which enables access to existing networks as well as coordination between cognitive radio users (spectrum sharing). (5) A spectrum mobility management framework is proposed to achieve efficient operations as cognitive users switch between the channels when a licensed user is detected (spectrum mobility). Based on these research topics, a testbed is developed to demonstrate the protocols developed on cognitive radio transceivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although COGNET was originally proposed for both infrastructure and ad hoc networks, due to the budget cut, research topics on ad hoc networks ("cooperative spectrum sensing for COGNET ad-hoc access" and "spectrum-adaptive route recovery for COGNET ad hoc access") will not be investigated.</AbstractNarration>
