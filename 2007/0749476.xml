    <AbstractNarration>This proposed research is to enable 15 of the nation's top experts in earthquake hazard mitigation and natural disaster reduction to be part of the United States delegation to the 2nd International Conference on Urban Disaster Reduction which will be held in Taipei, Taiwan on November 27-29, 2007. They will present papers detailing state of the art US research and practice in earthquake engineering and multi hazard disaster mitigation. The conference is being organized by the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) in Taiwan, the Institute of Social Safety Sciences (ISSS) in Japan, and the EERI from the United States. Total attendance by Americans should be about 30 individuals. This award will support the travel of 15 of the American researchers. The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) is paying the expenses of the remaining delegates. The conference includes three plenary sessions: 1) the Impact of Climate Changes and Corresponding countermeasures, 2) The Global Impact of Catastrophic Events on International Society, and 3) International Collaboration for Disaster Reduction. In addition, eight working groups will focus upon 1) Policy Analysis for Urban Disaster Reduction, 2) Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment, 3) Application of Early Warning systems by Practices, Implementation or Policy, 4) Advanced Technology for Disaster Reduction, 5) Communication Innovation and Information Integration, 6) Socio-economic Dimensions of Urban Disaster Management, 7) Relief, Recovery, Relocation and Reconstruction after Catastrophic Events, and 8) Lessons Learned and New Directions for Disaster Management. The intellectual merit of the 2ICUDR is reflected in the opportunity the conference provides for cross fertilization between a uniquely broad range of disciplines involved in urban disaster reduction. The world's leading researchers and practitioners in emergency management, architecture and urban design, structural and geotechnical engineering, public administration, sociology and social psychology, and the decision sciences will come together. For the first time, they will meet with the world's leaders in issues associated with global warming. Researchers from these two major disciplines, which have potentially so much to gain from each other, do not typically meet or carry out research together. As in previous international conferences dealing with urban hazard reduction, one anticipates that the 2ICUDR will stimulate collaborative research between climate and hazard researchers who have much to share in addressing challenges of risk reduction, policy analysis, risk perception and communication, and the mitigation of social and economic impacts, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will have substantial broader impact. It is anticipated that the 2ICUDR will influence future programs of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR). The conference will provide examples of successful disaster mitigation policies and programs to those who attend the conference from both highly industrial as well as developing countries. Papers and working group records will be issued as proceedings and made available throughout the world. It is anticipated that the proceedings will be highly valued by those involved in reducing disaster losses from natural, technical, climatological, and human caused hazards affecting the most vulnerable populations in the US as well as those in countries throughout Asia.</AbstractNarration>
