    <AbstractNarration>Toward understanding the relation between volcanic eruptions, &lt;br/&gt;seismicity, and infrasound&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at the University of New Hampshire and Lehigh University are &lt;br/&gt;focused on understanding the relation between volcanic eruptions and the &lt;br/&gt;energy which is radiated into both the seismic and acoustic wavefields. &lt;br/&gt;Through support from the National Science Foundation, they will be &lt;br/&gt;investigating the temporal relation between explosive degassing and the &lt;br/&gt;generation of elastic waves in order to gain greater insight into &lt;br/&gt;volcano conduit source processes prior to and during explosive &lt;br/&gt;fragmentation of magma. They will also be quantifying the elastic &lt;br/&gt;energy release and comparing it with observed eruption intensities &lt;br/&gt;(quantified through high-speed video), which will be used to develop &lt;br/&gt;empirical and theoretical models for energy transfer during eruptions. &lt;br/&gt;This topic has import implications for using elastic waves to remotely &lt;br/&gt;asess the intensity of eruptions especially during periods of inclement &lt;br/&gt;weather when visible or satellite observations are not possible. A &lt;br/&gt;better understanding of the mechanisms and trends of volcanic activity &lt;br/&gt;will ultimately increase our ability to predict the timing and nature of &lt;br/&gt;destructive events&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish these goals, the grantees will analyze existing &lt;br/&gt;seismo-acoustic datasets from seven diverse erupting volcanoes, which &lt;br/&gt;exhibit intermittent and low-level explosive volcanic activity. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, two volcanoes located in Guatemala (Fuego and Santiaguito) &lt;br/&gt;are to serve as field sites for an integrated seismo-acoustic-video &lt;br/&gt;experiment to be conducted in the winter of 2006. These two volcanoes &lt;br/&gt;have been selected because of the extraordinary visibility of their &lt;br/&gt;active vents afforded from vantage points atop nearby neighboring &lt;br/&gt;summits. High-speed, high-resolution, satellite-time synced video will &lt;br/&gt;be acquired in concert with seismic and acoustic monitoring. New video &lt;br/&gt;image processing techniques will be developed to analyze and quantify &lt;br/&gt;eruptive manifestations. The intellectual merit of this project &lt;br/&gt;includes improved understanding of the enigmatic seismicity that is &lt;br/&gt;radiated during volcanic eruptions. Other broader impacts include &lt;br/&gt;research opportunities for a graduate student at the University of New &lt;br/&gt;Hampshire and expanded collaboration and outreach with volcano &lt;br/&gt;observatories in other countries.</AbstractNarration>
