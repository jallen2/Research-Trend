    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0722234&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CPATH CB: Connecting Computing Educators Within and Outside the Traditional Boundaries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Lillian Cassel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this one-year activity will be workshops to bring together those in the computing education community, across the subdomains of that group, and others who are integrating the fruits of computational thinking into a wide variety of disciplines. It is common to find curricula in the arts (music, graphical design), business (accounting, economics), sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), and social sciences with computational courses in their curriculum. In the one year of this project, the workshops will focus on identifying the scope of the similarities and differences among these communities and in identifying ways in which the computing community can best serve the entirety of the expanded community. The project will begin the integration of the computing ontology into the organization of curricular materials and the use of social software to deliver essential information. A centralized website will provide RSS feeds with news about computing education, blog entries about computing education, links to resources, and other community oriented information (e.g., conference calendars). Workshop participants will include faculty from all of the computing disciplines, industry representatives, students, and faculty from disciplines we do not usually think of as computing intensive.</AbstractNarration>
