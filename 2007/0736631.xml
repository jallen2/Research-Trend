    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project is using the curricular design approach of Understanding by Design (UbD) to determine if UbD improves learning of human anatomy and physiology. The UbD approach is synthesized from current learning theory in cognitive psychology and uses a three step, backwards design process. Guidelines established for devising curricula using UbD's backwards design process are being followed to design units for the skeletal and muscular systems. Three local faculty and a science education researcher are serving as peer reviewers of each unit and the action research design plans. The action research studies evaluate student engagement, effects on learning, and administration of a curriculum using UbD. The study triangulates across three types of data (observing, interviewing, and examining documents and other sources) collected at multiple time points, and the study population consists of students enrolled in two anatomy and physiology lecture sections. One of the long-term goals of this project is to develop a network of local, regional, and national human anatomy and physiology educators working in a continuous improvement cycle to ascertain if UbD is effective in improving learning of human anatomy and physiology.</AbstractNarration>
