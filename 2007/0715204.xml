    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The potential role of well-defined polymeric materials in a range of advanced&lt;br/&gt;technologies is becoming increasing apparent. From microelectronics, sensors, drug&lt;br/&gt;delivery systems, catalysts, agents for chemical warfare detection and destruction, smart&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, to biodegradable tissue replacements, polymeric materials are the critical&lt;br/&gt;components or enabling technologies for the successful implementation of these&lt;br/&gt;applications. This symposium will focus upon recent developments in the catalysts to&lt;br/&gt;produce well-defined polymers, assembly of polymers into nanostructured materials,&lt;br/&gt;electronically-functional polymers, polymers for holographic storage and fuel cell&lt;br/&gt;devices, fundamental investigations of the interfaces between organic polymers and&lt;br/&gt;inorganic substrates, and a significant amount of discussion on the topics of biomaterials&lt;br/&gt;and polymers for biomedical applications. Improved understanding of these complex systems&lt;br/&gt;and their advancement toward new technologies are expected to be the outcomes from such&lt;br/&gt;discussions and exchanges of knowledge in these critical areas by world experts, as can&lt;br/&gt;occur uniquely in the framework of the Gordon Research Conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The ability to gather experts within the framework of the Gordon Research Conferences&lt;br/&gt;provides unique opportunities to exchange data and ideas that will accelerate the&lt;br/&gt;translation of polymer materials developments across laboratories and from research&lt;br/&gt;advances to technological applications. Moreover, the agenda for this conference has been&lt;br/&gt;designed to assemble a significant number of speakers and discussion leaders who are new&lt;br/&gt;to this conference to bring new perspectives. Young scientists, postdoctoral associates&lt;br/&gt;and students will be encouraged to attend.</AbstractNarration>
