    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research to be conducted as part of this Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) award will investigate the influence of copolymer additives on the phase boundary and phase separation kinetics of polymer blends. The copolymer additives used will vary in composition and topology focused on diblock, multiblock, and star copolymers. This research will expand the understanding regarding the effects these additives have on bulk blend systems, and contribute to the relatively few existing studies of polymer blend compatibilization in thin films. As the effects of additives on polymer blends increases, new knowledge can be applied to industrial systems, ultimately leading to improved processing and performance of polymer blend materials. The research will take place in a predominantly undergraduate institution, providing research experiences for at least nine undergraduate students. The proposed research builds on previous results, which have demonstrated that copolymer additives can be used to affect equilibrium and kinetic properties of blends. The topology and monomer composition of the copolymers used in this study will enhance and complement previous work, as well as make strong crossover connections to industrial interests. The model system is a blend of polybutadiene and polystyrene homopolymers, and the additives will be copolymers of butadiene and styrene. Studies will be done using light and neutron scattering for polymer blend systems in the bulk while atomic force microscopy will be used to investigate polymer blend compatibilization in thin films. Monte Carlo computer simulation, and the use of synthetic techniques (e.g., living free radical and metathesis as well as anionic) will be used to enhance the research. Outreach activities will also be included that provide opportunities for underrepresented students and for interfacing with community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High performance plastics are integral to many aspects of our society from cell phone cases, environmentally friendly roofing materials, to critical components in automobiles. The research to be conducted as part of this NSF Research in Undergraduate Institutions award will help increase our fundamental knowledge of how to make these kinds of materials with tailored properties and may eventually lead to an increased ability to manufacture new plastics with specific properties. Undergraduate students will be the primary participants in this research giving them vital experience and facilitating their movement into post-baccalaureate education as well as in the scientific work force. This award will also be beneficial to the educational efforts of the host institution. Outreach activities are also included that bring underrepresented high school students from a local Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program to our labs for a polymer materials workshop. Additionally, the principal investigator will work with faculty from local community colleges to bring presentations on nanotechnology and materials science to their students.</AbstractNarration>
