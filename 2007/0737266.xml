    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12). The project is building on the project-based learning literature and modern equipment to revise a biochemistry laboratory to meet the demands of today's biochemist. The revised integrated project-based laboratory approach is centered on a single protein (cytochrome c) from two different sources (bovine heart and baker's yeast). The first 8 weeks of the lab are being used to teach students biochemical methods and the control of variables by having them isolate and characterize cytochrome c. The last 6 weeks are providing a research-like experience by using student-designed projects that include developing testable hypotheses. The evaluation plan with its focus on student learning is providing data on the effectiveness of project-based and inquiry-based laboratories. The dissemination plan includes student poster sessions, student presentations at national meetings, and faculty professional development workshops. The broader impact of this project lies in (1) its contribution to problem-based learning and inquiry-based laboratories in biochemistry; (2) the promotion of student learning in basic and advanced biotechnological instrumentation for underrepresented students; (3) workshops for faculty professional development, and (4) a contribution to the departmental instrumentation infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
