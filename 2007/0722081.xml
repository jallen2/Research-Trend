    <AbstractNarration>The Internet has evolved greatly from its original incarnation. For instance, the vast majority of current Internet usage is data retrieval and service access, whereas the architecture was designed around host-to-host applications such as telnet and ftp. Moreover, the original Internet was a purely transparent carrier of packets, but now the various network stakeholders use middleboxes to improve security and accelerate applications. To adapt to these changes, this project will design, develop and deploy a design called the Data- Oriented Network Architecture (DONA). DONA replaces DNS names with flat, self-certifying names, and replaces DNS name resolution with a name-based anycast primitive that lives above the IP layer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: DONA improves data retrieval and service access by providing stronger and more architecturally coherent support for name persistence, content availability, and data authentication. It can also be extended to provide support for caching and RSS-like updates.</AbstractNarration>
