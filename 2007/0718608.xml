    <AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of the Lopes lab is to understand the mechanisms whereby basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors regulate gene expression. The bHLH family is ubiquitous among eukaryotes and regulates a diverse set of processes including development, differentiation, and cell proliferation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an ideal model system to examine how bHLH proteins regulate gene expression on a genomic scale. S. cerevisiae only has 9 bHLH proteins, which have been well studied with respect to regulation of single biological pathways typically in response to single environmental cues. Recent studies in the Lopes lab, quantifying expression of bHLH candidate genes under a diverse set of growth conditions, provide compelling evidence for an elaborate network of cross-regulation via several mechanisms. These results are underscored by the fact that they identify regulatory events that are not suggested by yeast genomic databases. This project tests the hypothesis that bHLH proteins regulate target genes via multiple mechanisms. Dr. Lopes will determine the role of auto- and cross-regulation of bHLH proteins on target gene expression. He will also determine the effect of different growth conditions on bHLH localization and dimerization. This research project addresses two important eukaryotic regulatory paradigms, combinatorial control and coordination of gene expression. &lt;br/&gt;This project directly addresses a fundamental question in biology: how are genes turned-on and turned-off? Dr. Lopes is committed to mentoring and this project will be employed to train both graduate and undergraduate students in primary research. The ubiquitous nature of bHLH proteins ensures that the findings will appeal to a broad research community and Dr. Lopes has a strong record of disseminating research findings in peer-reviewed journals. Dr. Lopes will also create an innovative graduate level course focused entirely on writing and reviewing scientific manuscripts and grant proposals.</AbstractNarration>
