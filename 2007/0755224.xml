    <AbstractNarration>The REU Site Program BIEN "Biosystems Internships for ENgineers" will &lt;br/&gt;provide summer research opportunities in the Department of Electrical &lt;br/&gt;and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Maryland, College &lt;br/&gt;Park (UMCP) for 10 undergraduate students per year in the applications &lt;br/&gt;of electrical engineering (EE) to biosystems. Many breakthroughs in &lt;br/&gt;modern medicine and science have been built on EE foundations, notably &lt;br/&gt;in the technical areas of medical devices, nanotechnology and information &lt;br/&gt;technology. The BIEN program builds upon a solid track record of research &lt;br/&gt;innovation at the interface between electrical engineering and biology. &lt;br/&gt;Examples of research topics reflect the breadth and depth of biosystems &lt;br/&gt;applications in electrical engineering, ranging from nanotechnology and &lt;br/&gt;microelectronic devices to autonomous control, information security, &lt;br/&gt;system modeling, speech recognition, and neuromorphic signal processing. &lt;br/&gt;Targeted students will be talented undergraduates who have completed &lt;br/&gt;their sophomore year in electrical engineering and related programs. &lt;br/&gt;Significant emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from under &lt;br/&gt;represented groups and students from schools lacking similar research &lt;br/&gt;opportunities. BIEN students will spend ten weeks in the summer on &lt;br/&gt;campus involved in research in small teams consisting of undergraduates, &lt;br/&gt;graduate students and faculty advisors. A program of seminars, workshops, &lt;br/&gt;and field trips will complement and reinforce the learning experience.</AbstractNarration>
