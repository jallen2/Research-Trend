    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at demonstrating a novel radio-frequency tuner/reconfigurable matching network (T/RN) capable of handling high-power RF/microwave signals. Electronically T/RNs find many applications in the design and development of communications circuits and systems. While the performance of current T/RNs employing RF MEMS switches or varactors is impressive, this has been mostly demonstrated at relatively low-power signal levels (e.g., sub-Watt) due to the onset of self-actuation in the switches or varactors when operating at high power levels. There is a need, therefore, for RF MEMS-based tuners/reconfigurable matching networks that can maintain the high levels of performance enabled by this technology even when handling high-power signals. The proposed research has three primary objectives: 1) to design a novel high-power RF MEMS-based T/RN; 2) to demonstrate its low-cost manufacturability; and 3) to demonstrate its high-power performance. The research will address key technical challenges related to T/RN architecture to maximize its life and power-handling capability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful outcome of this research will enable new capabilities in high-end systems, such as aerospace and defense systems, wireless infrastructure, and instrumentation. Its potential commercial value lies in the tens of millions of dollars. The scientific impact of the research will be prolific. The research at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) will be integrated into two undergraduate courses, "MEEN 461: Heat Transfer" and "MEEN 404: Engineering Laboratory," and the new introductory-graduate/senior-undergraduate level course "ME489: Introduction to MEMS, Microfluidics and Nanotechnology." Furthermore, the proposed research program and product development efforts will foster multi-physics computational modeling, materials characterization and investigation of thermal transport mechanisms in thin films.</AbstractNarration>
