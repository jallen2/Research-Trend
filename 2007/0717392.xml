    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12). This project is broadly testing, assessing, publishing, and disseminating process oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) activities that have been developed for undergraduate biochemistry. The materials have been developed and reformulated over nine years of use in lecture-free biochemistry courses and are now being tested in biology, biochemistry, and chemistry departments at a variety of institutional types including four year colleges, medium sized public universities, and research universities and by faculty who are engaged in a variety of active-learning pedagogies. Supporting materials are also being developed and include an instructor's manual and digital animations. A comprehensive evaluation plan is ensuring the effectiveness of these curricular materials. The project is also developing workshops on these materials for biochemistry faculty from institutions across the country. The broader impact of this project is found in the development of broadly tested biochemistry materials that support inquiry based learning and can be used in undergraduate biochemistry, chemistry, and biology courses as well as in the faculty workshops that promote the use of the biochemistry curricular materials.</AbstractNarration>
