    <AbstractNarration>The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) will organize a Student Research Workshop (SRW) during the main ACL conference on June 25-27, 2007 in Prague, Czech Republic. The workshop will consist of full paper presentations followed by a discussion panel led by senior researchers as well as poster presentations. All selected work must have only student authors, and the workshop itself will be run by students. The Student Research Workshop provides a unique opportunity for students to receive feedback on their research from experts in the field and to make contacts with senior researchers as well as students from other universities. The SRW contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse workforce in natural language engineering, provides a supportive environment for professional growth and interactions between young researchers and well-respected experts, and encourages a spirit of collaborative research.</AbstractNarration>
