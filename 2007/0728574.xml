    <AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships for 24 students with financial need who transfer to Hope College from a community college to major in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geological and environmental sciences, mathematics, or physics. Scholarships of $10,000 per year are being offered to eight transferring students each year over three years. The scholarships are renewable for a second year for students who meet eligibility requirements. Each scholar is given the opportunity to participate in a summer research project at Hope College in the summer before they begin studies at Hope. They are then supported in their study at Hope by intensive faculty advising, timely and appropriate academic assistance, peer mentoring, career counseling and education, internship and research opportunities, and a program for building community among S-STEM scholars. By targeting community college students who usually do not consider attending a private liberal arts college like Hope, this project is increasing economic and racial diversity in the STEM majors.</AbstractNarration>
