    <AbstractNarration>Two different hypotheses for the relationship between the Congo and &lt;br/&gt;Kalahari cratons, during the Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinent cycles, &lt;br/&gt;will be evaluated. Co-funding for this work has been provided by the &lt;br/&gt;Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congo and Kalahari presently reside within Africa and are juxtaposed &lt;br/&gt;across the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Damara-Lufilian-Zambezi orogenic system.&lt;br/&gt;The primary controversy surrounding the assembly of these two cratons &lt;br/&gt;in the supercontinent cycle centers on the extent to which Congo and &lt;br/&gt;Kalahari remained associated geographically throughout the cycle, &lt;br/&gt;i.e., were the two cratons directly adjacent to one another in &lt;br/&gt;Rodinia, and, did they remain so until amalgamated in Gondwana, or &lt;br/&gt;was one (or both) not in Rodinia at all and were not joined until &lt;br/&gt;Gondwana formed? The metamorphosed sedimentary detritus within the &lt;br/&gt;Damara orogenic zone records the separation of these blocks from &lt;br/&gt;Rodinia and accretion within Gondwana. The U/Pb age and Hf-isotopic &lt;br/&gt;compositions of detrial zircons from the metasedimenatry rocks, along &lt;br/&gt;with whole-rock Nd isotopes, will be measured to define the origin of the &lt;br/&gt;continental detritus in the suture zone. The significance of the &lt;br/&gt;alternative hypotheses relates to the configuration of Rodinia, the &lt;br/&gt;amalgamation of Gondwana (E-W or N-S final suturing), and the degree &lt;br/&gt;to which Rodinia was fragmented during break-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accretion and dispersal of supercontinents remains one of the &lt;br/&gt;most significant problems in understanding global dynamics and motions &lt;br/&gt;of continents through time and the convection of rock in the mantle. &lt;br/&gt;The growth and break-up of two supercontinents in late Precambrian &lt;br/&gt;time ? Rodinia and Gondwana ? are particularly significant for &lt;br/&gt;understanding the supercontinent cycle, because they overlap the &lt;br/&gt;development and dispersal of complex life forms in the shallow oceans &lt;br/&gt;along their margins. The hypotheses being tested in this project &lt;br/&gt;have implications for the dispersal and source of sediment in the &lt;br/&gt;shallow seas, the initiation and proliferation of early life in those seas,&lt;br/&gt;the evolving paleoclimatic system of the planet, and the time that the&lt;br/&gt;younger supercontinent cycle of Pangea initiated.</AbstractNarration>
