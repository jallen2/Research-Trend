    <AbstractNarration>This ATE planning project is reforming technology program competencies to meet current industry workforce needs, is creating a multi-disciplinary technology program that allows students to graduate with a broader skill set relevant to industry needs, and is expanding enrollment, engagement, and retention of new and incumbent workers in the technology programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on strengthening and institutionalizing permanent connections with local employers, thereby allowing the institution to meet the emerging educational needs of industry. In conjunction with the Industry Advisory Committee, the project is conducting an industry skills and knowledge needs assessment and cross-walking the assessment results with course competencies. Needed skill sets are being incorporated into course outcomes, and curriculum reform is being undertaken using a project-based learning approach. The institution is streamlining a myriad of technology degree programs into one multi-disciplinary technology degree. They are collaborating with the SC ATE Center for Excellence and National Resource Center for Engineering Technology Education at Florence-Darlington Technical College. SC ATE provides professional development and assistance with curriculum reform.</AbstractNarration>
