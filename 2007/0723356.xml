    <AbstractNarration>The broad, long-term objective of this project is to understand neuronal mechanisms by which animals process sensory information and accordingly generate adaptive behaviors. An electrical behavior of electric fishes provides an excellent model system in which neural mechanisms can be analyzed in great detail. The current focus of the laboratory is to elucidate neural mechanisms that deal with temporal information in electric fishes. Temporal processing is often involved in sensory and communicatory abilities of animals and humans, and is one of the most important aspects of information processing by the brain. This project will deal with neuronal computation of temporal information in two time scales, milliseconds to seconds and microseconds. The temporal pattern of sensory signals on the order on milliseconds to seconds are important in auditory communication signals such as human languages and birdsongs. Temporal signals on the order of microseconds are important for sound localization capabilities. Physiological and anatomical properties of neuronal circuits for temporal processing in electric fishes have been described by the primary investigator. The primary investigator is currently identyfying the specific neurons that receive timed input signals and examining their temporal patterns. The project aims to identify neurotransmitters used by the synapses at these temporal pattern detector neurons. Electrophysiological recording will be made from these neurons while various neurotransmitter specific blockers will be applied locally. After the candidates for the neurotransmitters are identified pharmacologically, immunohistochemistry will be performed to localize where these activities occur within component neurons of the temporal circuit. The results will contribute to the future study of the system in which the ultimate cellular (membrane and channel) properties of temporal processing will be discovered. The project will also involve integration of the research into undergraduate/graduate education.</AbstractNarration>
