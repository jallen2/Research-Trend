    <AbstractNarration>A completely new focus in robotics research is proposed. The purpose is to enable automatic dispensing and mixing of highly viscous bio-samples which has important applications in life sciences including drug screening, protein crystallization, and protein expression. Since the volume to deal with is extremely small at the micro- or nano-liter scale, and viscosity causes the samples to stick to everything, robotic handling of such bio-samples is extremely challenging. Three novel methods are proposed to solve the problems. The first method is an innovative micro-capsule with micro-channel for mixing viscous bio-samples using centrifugation such that no contact is needed. The second method is soft-hard compliance of robotic motion for delivering bio-samples into tiny micro-capsules, for which a micro force-sensing device based on piezo-resistance and visco-elasticity is to be invented. The third method is a programmable robotic spinning device which generates adequate centrifugal forces in real-time for mixing bio-samples. The three new methods will lay a foundation for high-throughput dispensing and mixing of bio-samples using robust intelligence in robotics. In addition, the project will bring a broader impact to life sciences, education, and economy.</AbstractNarration>
