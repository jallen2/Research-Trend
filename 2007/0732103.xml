    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participants' travel and subsistence costs to attend the 2007 Chemical Engineering Summer School - Education for the 21st Century to be held on the campus of the Washington State University from July 27 through August 3, 2007. Its aim is to develop primarily new faculty through the dissemination of innovative and effective teaching methods. In addition, the participants will discuss a number of promising research areas in which concepts, principles, problems, and laboratory experiments can be incorporated into course work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School also brings new faculty together with mid-career and senior colleagues to discuss educational methods and delivery mechanisms and to provide tested educational materials to new faculty for use in a variety of courses. Twenty-one different workshops are planned in many areas that receive NSF support, such as Systems Biology, Molecular Simulation, Process and Product Design, Computational Fluid Dynamics and Quantum Chemistry, Sustainability Engineering, Pre-College Education, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School aims to support the attendance at least of one new faculty member from each school in the U.S. that awards chemical engineering B.S. degree, with the number totaling approximately 100. The resulting research and educational materials will be widely distributed via CD-ROM and the Internet to the chemical engineering community and beyond.</AbstractNarration>
