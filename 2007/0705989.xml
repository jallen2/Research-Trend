    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education at the interface of condensed matter physics and atomic physics. The PI will address fundamental issues in four major areas in quantum gases: (i) strongly interacting Fermi gases, (ii) quantum gases in optical lattices, (iii) quantum gases with large angular momentum, and (iv) quantum spin dynamics large spin Bose gases. These projects are directly related to current experiments. At the same time, they explore new directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects on Fermi gases will address the major differences between the recent experimental findings between the MIT group and the Rice group, in particular the presence of a partially spin polarized phase in the MIT experiment and the violation of local density approximation in the Rice experiment. The PI aims to study the effect of lattice potentials on the BEC-BCS crossover. The projects on lattice quantum gases will help understand the necessary step to reach quantum degeneracy in optical lattices, and establish an accurate temperature scale. The PI will also begin a program to semi-behavior of Fermions in optical lattices, which simulate most of the non-superfluid phenomena in solid state physics.&lt;br/&gt;Planned projects on large spin quantum gas will help to uncover the signature of quantum spin dynamics, and is an important step towards controlling the quantum state of the system. The study of fast rotating quantum gases will help to realize quantum Hall states in ultra-cold fermions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also provides opportunities for advanced education and contributes to the highly skilled scientific workforce of the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education at the interface of condensed matter physics and atomic physics. The PI will study new quantum mechanical states of matter exhibited by atoms cooled to very low temperature and trapped, for example by laser light. Some states of matter of ultracold atom systems are analogous to electronic states of matter that occur in complex materials and in electrons in a high magnetic field that are confined to two dimensions in semiconducting materials. The synergy among the studies of these two disparate systems may lead to more rapid advance on challenging fundamental scientific problems. While ultracold atoms and electronic systems are each interesting in their own right, understanding these systems in each case has the potential to lead to future computing and device technologies. &lt;br/&gt;This project also provides opportunities for advanced education and contributes to the highly skilled scientific workforce of the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>
