    <AbstractNarration>This research project is devoted to investigating various facets of interplay&lt;br/&gt;between geometry, number theory and combinatorics. The first part concerns &lt;br/&gt;the theory of geometric graphs and is motivated by the following question &lt;br/&gt;that remains open for several decades: "Does every planar drawing of a graph &lt;br/&gt;on n vertices and 1000n edges with straight line segments contain four &lt;br/&gt;pairwise crossing edges?" The PI plans to establish the existence of this &lt;br/&gt;and other crossing patterns in drawings of graphs with sufficiently many &lt;br/&gt;edges. Problems of finding good lower bounds on the minimal number of &lt;br/&gt;crossings over all drawings of a fixed graph, as well as the existing &lt;br/&gt;connections with algorithmic questions in computational geometry, will also &lt;br/&gt;be studied. A related investigator's goal is to apply Szemeredi's regularity &lt;br/&gt;lemma in combination with certain tools from real algebraic geometry and &lt;br/&gt;topology to prove the existence of large, complete or empty, bipartite &lt;br/&gt;subgraphs in the intersection graphs of segments, curves, or, in general, &lt;br/&gt;semi-algebraic sets. Another proposed direction of research is Euclidean &lt;br/&gt;Ramsey theory. Questions of the type: "Does any sufficiently large set of &lt;br/&gt;points in the plane, no three on a line, contain six points forming a convex &lt;br/&gt;hexagon with no other point inside?", or "Can one color points of the plane &lt;br/&gt;with six colors so that no two points, unit distance apart, receive the same &lt;br/&gt;color?", are questions posed many years ago by Erdos and other &lt;br/&gt;pioneers of the field, and despite all the efforts are still open. The author &lt;br/&gt;devises and plans to exploit novel perspectives on these problems, while &lt;br/&gt;introducing certain machinery from matroid and polytope theory, and &lt;br/&gt;commutative algebra. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of this proposal is to further explore the beauty of Ramsey &lt;br/&gt;theory and combinatorial geometry, especially natural and intuitive questions&lt;br/&gt;that can be easily described in lay terms, but difficult to solve. Fascinating&lt;br/&gt;problems of Erdos-type continue to be a fertile ground for interactions of &lt;br/&gt;various areas of mathematics and provide a theoretical foundation for &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial optimization, VLSI design, robotics, pattern recognition, &lt;br/&gt;tomography and computer graphics. Furthermore, an important aspect of this &lt;br/&gt;proposal is its educational component. Working with an undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;student, the investigator initiates a new discipline of Ramsey theory on &lt;br/&gt;integers, where one is interested in the existence of rainbow arithmetic &lt;br/&gt;structures. Questions considered are of the form: "Does every 3-coloring &lt;br/&gt;of integers from 1 to 3n, with exactly n red, n blue and n green integers, &lt;br/&gt;contain a rainbow 3-term arithmetic progression?" The proposed problems are &lt;br/&gt;rainbow analogues of classical van der Waerden-type results in Ramsey theory, &lt;br/&gt;and are well suited for undergraduate research projects. Finally, the PI and &lt;br/&gt;his mentee discover and inspect a striking dependency of the degree of &lt;br/&gt;regularity of certain linear equations on the axioms of set theory.</AbstractNarration>
