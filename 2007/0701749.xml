    <AbstractNarration>Information in Optical Speckle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Webb, Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate the information in optical speckle arising from propagation of coherent light through scattering media. The approach is, in the case of modest scatter, to measure the polarization-dependent scattered light from samples, and then relate this to a model for the scatter. Speckle correlations in space and frequency will be used to investigate the communication capacity through scattering media. The near field of scattering samples will&lt;br/&gt;be measured, allowing localization phenomena to be studied. Random gain media will be fabricated and tested using a suitable and available laser pump, and the spatial speckle and spectral characteristics will be measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many physical problems have scatter and, with suitable coherence, speckle forms. The proposed work will lead to enhanced tissue imaging and environmental sensing, to improved communication in cluttered (scattering) environments, and to a better understanding of random lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optical imaging of tissue can provide a safe and inexpensive means to improve diagnosis and health monitoring. Sensing and communicating through a scattering environment can be limited by this scatter, and improvements in capacity will have broad impact on scientific studies and personal wireless communication. Display technology can be improved through use of light source with suitable coherence properties and media with appropriate scatter, as will be studied. Two graduate students and one undergraduate will work on the project.</AbstractNarration>
