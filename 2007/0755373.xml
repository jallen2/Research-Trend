    <AbstractNarration>This project establishes an REU Site offering undergraduate students to participate &lt;br/&gt;in research activities associated with the Bio-Grid initiatives conducted at the &lt;br/&gt;University of Connecticut. The initiatives aim at advancing the application of modern &lt;br/&gt;computing infrastructure and information technology to research and practice in various &lt;br/&gt;life-science disciplines. Specific research activities include several inter-disciplinary &lt;br/&gt;projects led by researchers at the University of Connecticut. This REU Site supports ten &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students for an eight-week summer research program in each project year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student participants have a sufficient background in computing or biological science and &lt;br/&gt;are interested in both. A series of training seminars by the project staff is designed to &lt;br/&gt;equip students with preliminary background knowledge. The seminars introduce to students &lt;br/&gt;concepts about modern grid computing infrastructure and related information technology, &lt;br/&gt;as well as some ongoing life-science research projects that rely on or benefit from such &lt;br/&gt;infrastructures. A major component of the program is for students to work with the project &lt;br/&gt;staff on one research project. Students have the opportunity to participate in the Annual &lt;br/&gt;International Bio-Grid Workshop. This further broadens their vision by allowing them to &lt;br/&gt;witness similar research projects conducted worldwide. Intellectual merits of the proposed &lt;br/&gt;activity are associated with the Bio-Grid initiatives in the investigation of computing &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, algorithmic techniques, middleware support and resource management strategies, &lt;br/&gt;that are generally applicable to research and practice in life sciences. Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;resulting from the proposed activity therefore lie in the preparation of software engineers &lt;br/&gt;to formalize and solve problems emerging from life sciences, as well as life-science &lt;br/&gt;researchers and professionals to gain a strong background in information processing techniques.</AbstractNarration>
