    <AbstractNarration>Carl Tripp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to request travel funds from NSF to enable graduate students to attend the Nanoelectronic Devices for Defense and Security (NANO-DDS) Conference 2007 to be held on June 18-21, 2007 in Crystal City, Arlington, VA.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The NANO-DDS conference plans to bridge the intellectual gap between the frontier and application portions of the nanoelectronics deices spectrum for the purpose of accelerating nanotechnology payoffs that have relevance to national Defense and Security in the future. This is a biannual conference. The payoffs are expected to be in the core defense and security related areas such as sensing, data processing, computation and communications. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The scientific and technological information and the resulting Nanoscience Technology Roadmap will be widely disseminated throughout academia/universities, government and industrial institutions and the public at large (including the entire international community. It will produce a unique set of guidelines for future research and educational activities. The funds are expected to be used exclusively to support graduate student attendance and this will broaden the impact of the meeting to the education experiences and education of future scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
