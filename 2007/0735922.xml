    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-0735922&lt;br/&gt;Leo Kempel, Michigan State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to support student travel to the annual scholarly conference for antenna measurement professionals. The Antenna Measurements Techniques Association conference gathers together the leading international engineers and scientists engaged in electromagnetic measurements. At this meeting, professionals from around the world present their findings and educate others in the general area of electromagnetic measurements. The annual meeting, archival web-site, and quarterly peer-reviewed contribution to the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine are primary sources for electromagnetic measurement techniques. Participation by students at such events not only adds vitality to the meeting, it is an excellent learning experience for the students since they can meet leading researchers in their field, network with potential employers, and gain critical feedback from peers. In addition, the gathering of students from diverse backgrounds at such meetings, to compare notes and successes, is valuable in the development of early career professionals. Students supported by this travel grant will be reimbursed by Michigan State University subject to the availability of funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project it to enhance student participation at the conference with a special emphasis on encouraging attendance by women and under-represented minority undergraduate and graduate students. In addition to colleges in the vicinity of St. Louis (site of the 2007 meeting), invitations for student papers will be sent to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-serving Institutions. The lack of sufficient highly-trained microwave measurement professionals may prove to be an impediment to greater wireless information innovations. Increasing student participation at such topical meetings is critical activity in ensuring the availability of well-trained professionals as well as serving to enhance the scholarly activity of the organization through collaborative experiences.</AbstractNarration>
