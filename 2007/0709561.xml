    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0709561&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigators: Krzysztof P. Wojciechowski, Slawomir Klimek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to organize a conference on applications of Dirac&lt;br/&gt;operators in geometry, topology and quantum field theory at the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Mathematical Sciences of the Indiana University -&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University at Indianapolis from Friday to Saturday, March&lt;br/&gt;2-3, 2007. The main purpose of the conference is to create an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to present and discuss some of the most recent and&lt;br/&gt;important results in the aforementioned area of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tentative list of speakers includes&lt;br/&gt;1. W. Muller (Bonn University) who will talk about the relation&lt;br/&gt;between the spectral analysis of Dirac operators and the Selberg&lt;br/&gt;Program.&lt;br/&gt;2. A. Carey (ANU Canberra) is expected to talk about his recent&lt;br/&gt;work on spectral flow and the spectral shift function.&lt;br/&gt;3. J. Dodziuk (CUNY New York) will talk about Laplacians on&lt;br/&gt;graphs.&lt;br/&gt;4. M. Braverman (NEU) will talk about generalized analytic&lt;br/&gt;torsion and eta-invariant.&lt;br/&gt;5. S. Stolz (Notre Dame) will talk about applications of Dirac&lt;br/&gt;operators in algebraic topology.&lt;br/&gt;6. L. Nicolaescu (Notre Dame) will talk about his research on&lt;br/&gt;singularities.&lt;br/&gt;7. P. Kirk (IU at Bloomington) will talk about applications of&lt;br/&gt;eta invariant and spectral flow to the study of the topology of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;We have also scheduled several talks by graduate students who are&lt;br/&gt;about to complete their PhD theses on related topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting has a long and outstanding tradition dating back to&lt;br/&gt;1994. It is well-advertised within the Indiana math community. It&lt;br/&gt;is recognized as an event having a unique atmosphere with a&lt;br/&gt;mixture of presentations of new results and a lot of interaction&lt;br/&gt;between older and younger generations of mathematicians. The list&lt;br/&gt;of speakers includes many famous mathematicians whose work is&lt;br/&gt;related to Dirac operators. Previous meetings have resulted in&lt;br/&gt;several important collaborations by the participants published in&lt;br/&gt;journals of the highest quality . This year we are going to make&lt;br/&gt;an extra effort in order to bring the Conference to the attention&lt;br/&gt;of the math community on a national level and we are going&lt;br/&gt;actively pursue graduate students with research interest related&lt;br/&gt;to the Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information, see the conference Web site,&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.iupui.edu/dirac2007.</AbstractNarration>
