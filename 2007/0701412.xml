    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide travel support for graduate students and junior faculty to attend the Conference on Applications of Analysis to Mathematical Biology (AAMB), to be held in May of 2007 at Duke University. The central theme of the conference is the application of analysis, broadly construed, to the mathematical modeling of biology systems. The principal goal of AAMB is to advance the field of mathematical biology on various fronts, in part, via the gathering of a number of highly-respected mathematical biologists and applied mathematicians, who have agreed to present keynote lectures. The lecture topics represent a number of exciting and important fields in mathematical biology, including mathematical cardiology, renal physiology, neurobiology, developmental biology, periodic and dynamical diseases, cancer, and calcium dynamics. By providing travel support, AAMB will facilitate the exposure of graduate and undergraduate students to state-of-the-art current research in mathematical biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As noted by M. C. Reed in an article published in the Notices of the AMS: "Although there is a long history of the applications of mathematics to biology, only recently has mathematical biology become an accepted branch of applied mathematics." To advance the field of mathematical biology, the conference will bring together pioneers in both applied mathematics and biology. Also, recognizing that a commitment to nurturing young scientists is essential to the continued growth and success of a field, AAMB will attract junior participants (graduate students and junior faculty) by providing travel support, by offering free food, by making sure that keynote lectures are accessible, and, last but not the least, by including in the list of keynote lecturers role models for women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
