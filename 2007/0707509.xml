    <AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0239600&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Etnyre, University of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Knot Theory and Dynamics in Contact Geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is to study the relation between topology&lt;br/&gt;and contact geometry in all (odd) dimensions and to apply contact&lt;br/&gt;geometric techniques to questions in hydrodynamics. Many of the&lt;br/&gt;connections between topology and contact geometry are mediated by&lt;br/&gt;Legendrian knots (these are knots that are tangent to a contact&lt;br/&gt;structure), thus the first main theme of the proposed research is&lt;br/&gt;Legendrian knots. As part of this proposal the general structure&lt;br/&gt;of Legendrian knots will be studied. The expected outcome will be&lt;br/&gt;various classification results for certainLegendrian knots and contact&lt;br/&gt;structures; and, moreover, a betterunderstanding of Legendrian surgery&lt;br/&gt;(an important surgery construction of contact structures). Legendrian &lt;br/&gt;knots in higher dimensions will also be studied using contact homology.&lt;br/&gt;There is very little known about contactstructures, or Legendrian knots,&lt;br/&gt;in dimensions above three. By investigating Legendrian knots in these &lt;br/&gt;dimensions the nature of contactstructures should be illuminated, just&lt;br/&gt;as the corresponding study revealed much about three dimensional contact&lt;br/&gt;structures. The final part of the proposed research centers on the &lt;br/&gt;connection between contact structures and hydrodynamics discovered a few&lt;br/&gt;years ago by the Principal Investigator and R. Ghrist. Here work with&lt;br/&gt;Ghrist will continue with the aim of understanding when, and what type of, &lt;br/&gt;closed flow lines occur in fluid flows. We shall also study hydrodynamic&lt;br/&gt;instability from the contact topological perspective. This naturally leads&lt;br/&gt;into the study of energy minimization for fluid flows and relations between&lt;br/&gt;contact and Riemannian geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact structures are very natural objects, born over two centuries &lt;br/&gt;ago,in the study of geometric optics and partial differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;Through the centuries contactstructures have touched on many diverse areas&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics and physics,including classical mechanics and thermodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;In everyday life oneencounters contact geometry when ice skating, parallel &lt;br/&gt;parking a car,using a refrigerator, or simply watching the beautiful play &lt;br/&gt;of light ina glass of water. Many great mathematicians have devoted a lot of &lt;br/&gt;their work to this subject but only in the last decade or two has it moved&lt;br/&gt;into the foreground of mathematics. This renaissance is due to the recent&lt;br/&gt;remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and&lt;br/&gt;beautiful theory with many applications. The most remarkable feature of&lt;br/&gt;all this recent work is the intimate connections between contact&lt;br/&gt;structures and topology in dimension three. Thus by studying this abstract&lt;br/&gt;notion of a contact structure one can learn many subtle things about the&lt;br/&gt;universe in which we live. For example, the study of contact geometry&lt;br/&gt;has recently lead to some unexpected advances in our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the flow of idealized fluids. The Principal Investigator will explore&lt;br/&gt;connections between contact structures and topology in all (odd)&lt;br/&gt;dimensions, continue his study of idealized fluid flows (hydrodynamics)&lt;br/&gt;via contact geometry and analyze intriguing new conjectures concerning&lt;br/&gt;string theory and contact geometry. The Principal Investigator will&lt;br/&gt;also engage in several educational endeavors, including the support and&lt;br/&gt;encouragement of graduates students and the creation of introductory&lt;br/&gt;and survey materials to bring the rapidly developing field of contact&lt;br/&gt;geometry to a wider audience.</AbstractNarration>
