    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will support the development of a nondestructive inspection and evaluation sensor system, capable of measuring state of strain of advanced materials and structures as well as detecting and locating damages in these materials and structures. The proposed sensors consist of an array of stress sensitive Bragg gratings fabricated in a rosette configuration, which are capable of measuring state of strain, stress, and detecting damage presence and location in advanced structures. In Phase I, the sensor's capability to measure state of strain with large dynamic range, high accuracy and high sensitivity will be demonstrated. In addition, an ultrasonic method we will be used to demonstrate the sensor' capability to detect stress waves indicating the presence and location of damages in a metal structure. The grating rosette sensor, light source, and data acquisition will be controlled by an automated system, capable of determining the state of strain as well as the severity and locations of damages present in the advanced materials and structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This novel NDE sensor system will offer significant cost saving for both the aviation and&lt;br/&gt;civil engineering industries by providing a cost-effective solution for damage evaluation and structural failure analysis in aerospace and civil advanced structures. Advances in the ultrasonic wave sensor technology will permit researchers to utilize this technology to better understand degradation mechanism leading to material failure in large and complex structures. The low-cost, high sensitivity sensor technology will improve public safety as a result of cost-effective structural and material condition evaluation and diagnostics.</AbstractNarration>
