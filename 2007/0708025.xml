    <AbstractNarration>0708025&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRI-IAD: Acquisition of a Trusted Hardware Infrastructure for Secure Data Management&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radu Sion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will acquire secure tamper-proof hardware required in the design and implementation of trusted, efficient, and scalable data management. Specifically, the infrastructure will consist of a trusted computing and storage cluster to support three ongoing research projects that address such security assurances in networked file-systems (NSF CyberTrust NS3), relational data outsourcing (Secure Query Interface SQi), and regulatory ? compliant storage (SecureWORM). The cluster will be composed of a set of servers, associated compatible trusted co-processors, a storage sub-system, and a set of On-Disk Encryption hard drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hardware is an essential requirement in the target projects. For example, in the NS3 project, in recent results the researchers have shown that data access pattern privacy cannot be achieved efficiently in the absence of server-side trusted hardware support, mainly due to provable prohibitive lower bounds on required server-side work. In the SecureWORM project, the researchers have also shown that existing WORM systems are vulnerable to simple attackers due to the lack of strong tamper-resistance. In the Secure Query Interface (SQi) framework, trusted server-hosted hardware closely cooperates with the server relational query processor to provide clients with execution assurances and query privacy.</AbstractNarration>
