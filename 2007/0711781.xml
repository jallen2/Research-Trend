    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project will demonstrate the utility of infrared planar array technology to study water pollutants such as industrial contaminants and biological impurities. It is proposed to design and build a compact, high-sensitivity, double beam infrared instrument based on focal plane array detection, which meets or exceeds performance standards of commercially available devices and is able to operate in ambient environments to provide measurements of dilute concentrations of organic and biological contaminants. Infrared spectroscopy has the molecular specificity to provide both qualitative identification of contaminants and quantitative measurement of concentrations. However, existing IR instruments based on Fourier transform techniques are limited in their ability to make these measurements rapidly under ambient conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will apply this innovative technology to enable real time effluent detection from a manufacturing site such as that found at chemical company sites to realize tangible savings from being able to pro-actively identify and measure the presence of pollutants. This reconfigurable and potentially portable instrument will assist scientists (academic, industrial and government) who work in analytical labs and require high speed measurements and/or those involved in environmental monitoring where sensing speed is important.</AbstractNarration>
