    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 August 2007&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0715541&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Bermuda Biological Sta. For Research&lt;br/&gt;PI: N. Bates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal as submitted requested four Shipboard Scientific Support items for the R/V Oceanic Explorer. One of the four items is requested to improve the safety of the vessel for all users. One item was proposed to improve the CTD winch capability and provide an improved back-up winch for over-the-side sampling. Another was to provide a large diameter over boarding metered sheave and the final item was requested to improve communications to/from the vessel. All requests had an element of safety in them. Safety items benefit all users of the ship. The Oceanus Explorer will receive the requested major safety equipment through a group purchase being done by Harbor Branch Inst. of Ocean. The over boarding sheave will be provided through a group purchase by Univ. of Delaware. BBSR supports several educational and public outreach events during the year through use of ship operations, providing an open-house for the local community and student training outreach from K through 12. During the BBSR Marine Science Day over 2000 visitors tour the marine center and the ship. Although the Oceanic Explorer is not an inspected ship it does several cruises in international waters and needs to meet the standards emergency standards required for entry in foreign waters.</AbstractNarration>
