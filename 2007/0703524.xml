    <AbstractNarration>This project relates combinatorial, algebraic, and topological aspects of&lt;br/&gt;affine Lie algebras and loop groups, and consists of three connected&lt;br/&gt;investigations. The first part explores the factorization phenomenon, a&lt;br/&gt;direct and unexpected link between the representations of&lt;br/&gt;finite-dimensional Lie groups and infinite-dimensional loop groups. The&lt;br/&gt;second part seeks to relate two important combinatorial tools, the&lt;br/&gt;Littelmann and Kyoto path models, to the geometric topology of loop groups&lt;br/&gt;as studied by Bott and Mirkovic-Vilonen. The aim is to give a natural&lt;br/&gt;geometric framework for these tools, which are originally defined in purely&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial terms, in order to better understand their combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;structure. The third part seeks to compute explicit bases for the&lt;br/&gt;(co)homology and K-theory of loop groups, so-called affine Schubert and&lt;br/&gt;Grothendieck polynomials, applying the geometric approach of Bott-Samelson&lt;br/&gt;to extend and simplify the recent work of combinatorists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loop groups are symmetry groups of infinite-dimensional objects, but are&lt;br/&gt;closely analogous to symmetries of finite-dimensional objects such as&lt;br/&gt;spheres. Loop group symmetry, at the boundary between tame (finite) and&lt;br/&gt;wild (intractable) problems, is crucial in many areas, such as the&lt;br/&gt;Langlands program in number theory, conformal field theory in particle&lt;br/&gt;physics, soliton theory in integrable systems, and solvable lattice models&lt;br/&gt;in statistical physics. Precise combinatorial analysis of loop-group&lt;br/&gt;representations makes possible explicit formulas and solutions in all these&lt;br/&gt;areas. Furthermore, the resulting combinatorics of periodic permutations&lt;br/&gt;and Young tableaux has applications to problems of computer science such as&lt;br/&gt;sorting algorithms and network design in cases which are infinite, but&lt;br/&gt;periodic.</AbstractNarration>
