    <AbstractNarration>Rolling element bearings providing support and rotational freedom are critical mechanical components in virtually every type of equipment. The proposed research aims at conducting basic research into passive wireless integrated sensing mechanism and a new nanostructured ceramic temperature sensing material in order to develop a novel bearing health-monitoring system and associated electronics for bearing harsh environment applications. Multilayer integration of the capacitive sensing material and wireless data telemetry scheme will advance the unique proposed sensor technology for bearing temperature monitoring up to 450 ºC. The technology to be developed in this research project will extend the knowledge base of passive wireless temperature sensing technologies in harsh environments and advance embedded prognostics health monitoring technologies. Instead of off-the-shelf electronic components, the sensor will be completely fabricated by LTCC high temperature ceramic material system, and the outcome of this project will offer many extraordinary features like compact size, battery-free power supply, wireless data communication, high temperature sensing, harsh environment resistance, very low cost and disposable, and easy integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of the proposed low-cost temperature sensing technology will enable the use of embedded prognostics health monitoring and physics-based damage model technologies in a broader range of applications such as commercial products, automobile and biomedical industries, aerospace and military to prevent catastrophic failure. An associated improvement in preventive maintenance will lead to lower operational cost, extend equipment life and reduce mechanical system life-cycle costs. This project will benefit the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM) by reinforcing existing sensor research and educational programs in the areas of wireless sensor and integrated sensing technology, provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and enhance competitive research capability at UPRM, including the underrepresented groups in an important area of sensor technology. This is an EPSCoR award.</AbstractNarration>
