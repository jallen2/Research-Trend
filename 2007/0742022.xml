    <AbstractNarration>Interoperation between systems which use extensive formalized knowledge&lt;br/&gt;is hampered by the wide variety of formalisms currently in use in such&lt;br/&gt;systems. Attempts to create World-wide Web standards have already&lt;br/&gt;yielded a collection of such formalisms, not all mutually compatible. &lt;br/&gt;This situation results in part from a methodology which views deductive&lt;br/&gt;efficiency of inference engines, rather than semantic clarity, as the&lt;br/&gt;primary design criterion for new formalisms. Recent work (reviving an &lt;br/&gt;older idea) has focussed instead on the design of a single, &lt;br/&gt;highly expressive, logic into which a wide number of existing &lt;br/&gt;formalisms can be straightforwardly mapped, essentially treating &lt;br/&gt;them as subsets or simple ontologies (theories) within the &lt;br/&gt;single common formalism. The resulting logic, &lt;br/&gt;called the Interoperation Knowledge Language (IKL), &lt;br/&gt;can express many representational strategies and the relationships&lt;br/&gt;between them in a single formalism, in principle overcoming this &lt;br/&gt;interoperation problem in many common cases. To realize this potential &lt;br/&gt;in practice requires an inference engine to process IKL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although IKL is more expressive than first-order logic and so is&lt;br/&gt;not decidable, many of the formalisms translated into it have very &lt;br/&gt;tractable inference behavior. This project implements a new design &lt;br/&gt;of a reasoner which is theoretically complete for IKL, while also having&lt;br/&gt;the ability to recognize many of the known tractable subcases and &lt;br/&gt;use efficient inference strategies on inputs which fit into these &lt;br/&gt;known cases. The behavior of the engine is directed by scripts&lt;br/&gt;which control its search behavior in a highly flexible multi-directional &lt;br/&gt;search space combining hyper-resolution, rule-saturation and &lt;br/&gt;tableaux reasoning. The engine is designed as an experimental &lt;br/&gt;workbench rather than a production engine, with a focus on inventing&lt;br/&gt;useful techniques for controlling its behavior, running large&lt;br/&gt;experiment suites semi-automatically, and gathering information &lt;br/&gt;relevant to the search process. We plan to make use of this engine&lt;br/&gt;in a series of projects devoted to learning new inference strategies &lt;br/&gt;from empirical ontological data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The code created by this project will be publicly available &lt;br/&gt;under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details of the project can be found on the project web page at &lt;br/&gt;http://homam.ihmc.us/silkie/Home.html</AbstractNarration>
