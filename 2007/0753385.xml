    <AbstractNarration>This project proposes to demonstrate a new real-time interactive and collaborative cyberinfrastructure for teaching and training hands-on nanotechnology. The approach is based on the recent advances in Internet and robotics technologies to enable new and innovative methods of teaching and training for university students and professionals involved with nanotechnology. The goal of this proposed project is to demonstrate how our newly developed cyberinfrastructure will enable people at different geographic locations to work or learn together and be able to control a remote nanomanufacturing system or scientific instruments based on haptic feedback such as force refection in addition to video and audio feedback. As a result, safe, reliable and efficient Internet-based collaboration and learning environment can be achieved. The major components of this proposed project include (1) applying Internet-based robotics technology and collaborative learning methods to tie new technologies and new scientific instruments with the place-bound and economically-bound students at all levels; (2) applying Internet-based supermedia (video, audio, haptic, temperature and other sensory feedback) technology to tie students with intangible environments, such as remote nano environments, to support interactive collaboration and learning; (3) conducting a quantitative evaluation and analysis of the effectiveness and efficiency of the supermedia enabled interactive and collaborative environment for teaching and training hands-on nanotechnology; (4) finally creating the foundation of technology that can be adopted on a large scale to many other institutions that serve a wide range of students. The results of this project will have impact not only in the engineering fields, but also broad areas of science and the society by (1) significantly enhancing the accessibility of real-time interactive and collaborative technologies; (2) providing a new dimension to the application of Internet technology, which enables the Internet to become an action superhighway instead of only an information superhighway; (3) facilitating students and professionals with new means to learn and understand nanotechnology, nanomanufacturing, robotics and information technology, especially those from under represented groups as well as middle school/high school students; (4) providing the technological based for cost a cost effective way to create a diverse and international aware future work force.</AbstractNarration>
