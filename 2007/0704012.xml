    <AbstractNarration>The investigators seek support to continue analysis of a project that has merged information from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) with the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY). The LSAY is a longitudinal study that concentrates on the high school experience for learning mathematics and science of a national sample of students from public high schools. This proposal would concentrate on the learning of science by analyzing the content of textbooks used by the students during their high school years. These textbooks have been identified and coded according to a framework that permits correlation of exposure to curriculum with other factors in the student's educational experiences. The purpose of this project is to identify and model the primary factors associated with U.S. student achievement in science.</AbstractNarration>
