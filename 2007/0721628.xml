    <AbstractNarration>SDCI NMI Improvement: OPeNDAP and NetCDF Integration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of OPeNDAP's network technology and Unidata's netCDF scientific data access software enables the construction of data archives that provide wide-reaching benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many computer applications used in advanced scientific analysis read and write data using the netCDF software package, developed by Unidata. This software package offers a number of advantages to both the developers of those applications and to the application's users. However, one thing the netCDF package lacks is a way to read from data over the Internet. OPeNDAP has developed such a capability and is working with Unidata to integrate that capability into the netCDF software. Using this new capability, applications which use netCDF can open remote files, learn about the information they contain and read data from them all without local copies of those files. Instead, the files are served like a web site where users access only those parts they need. Researchers and government laboratories can build data archives which users then access with a wide variety of existing analysis applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are significant. Separately, both OPeNDAP and netCDF are already widely used data infrastructure for research and education. Such infrastructure can have profound and lasting impacts on how communities use scientific data. These technologies have already advanced understanding as exemplified by their use in numerous research projects, workshops, and published papers. Combining OPeNDAP and netCDF will have a number of positive effects. Facilitating data access to large data archives helps to remove barriers and level the playing field among researchers at large institutions and individual researchers or students at small colleges or universities. Efforts at regularizing and standardizing access to data from multiple sources and disciplines encourage collaborations and new cross-disciplinary insights. Platform-independent software benefits small institutions that cannot afford special-purpose computing equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By facilitating the ease with which large or small data archives can be established and accessed remotely, this project helps to bring us closer to a time when scientific data are as easy as text to find and access.</AbstractNarration>
