    <AbstractNarration>The proliferation of embedded video cameras in mobile wireless devices has created a tremendous challenge for the design of underlying wireless communication infrastructure to support high-performance and secure video data delivery. While current mobile devices and networks are still considered resource-scarce components, many video-based wireless applications require not only real-time security features but also stringent network Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees such as minimum bandwidth for the routing path and bounded end-to-end latency for on-time delivery. Hence, allocating limited resource intelligently becomes a critical issue for secure real-time video communication on wireless embedded systems. To achieve the goal, this project seeks to develop the following: (1) a multilevel secure MPEG-4 streaming mechanism that adaptively encrypts and decrypts digital video data at different security levels according to streaming requirements and the surrounding network environment, (2) multi-path secure routing/streaming technique that balances streaming performance and security goals on mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), (3) cross-layer design for secure video streaming that exhibits a compact, yet flexible, secure streaming system structure for pervasive wireless embedded video systems. Through experimental, application-oriented research, this project aims to provide methods for secure real-time video communication among mobile devices on MANETs. This work will provide important technology for disaster recovery, vehicle networks, and military applications, and it will provide highly relevant research and educational opportunities for students.</AbstractNarration>
