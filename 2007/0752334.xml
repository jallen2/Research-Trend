    <AbstractNarration>It has recently been discovered that a population of Lemur catta lives almost exclusively within the hedges of the introduced cactus species, Opuntia ficus indica. This finding is significant as the habitat of this region, xerophytic Didiereaceae-Euphorbiaceae forest, represents over 90% of this species' potential range. Moreover, the use of cacti as a primary ecotone for a primate species has never before been documented.&lt;br/&gt;Through a 16 month study in Androy, Madagascar, this population of L. catta will be investigated via four primary research questions: (a) How does the behavioral ecology of the cactus adapted L. catta compare with gallery forest L. catta? (b) Are there any indications that these cactus dwellers suffer in health, nutrition, and reproduction? (c) How important is Opuntia as a dietary resource for these individuals? (d) Given that the Androy population of L. catta inhabit hedges that border crop fields, what is the daily interaction between these lemurs and the local villagers? Behavioral observations, health assessments, nutritional analyses, and ethnographic surveys will be used to address these questions. The intellectual merit will begin with a completely new perspective of L. catta ecology, behavior, and adaptability. Additionally, the documentation of this population as cactus dwellers will necessitate reexamination of the theory on the evolutionary origins of behavioral flexibility in Primates. Interactions of the lemurs with the local human inhabitants will be examined and conservation measures will be explored. Last, the long-standing ecological premise that invasive species are harmful to native wildlife populations will have to be reevaluated in the context of human-modified landscapes under chronic drought conditions. This project will have a profound impact on a community that has previously had little to no exposure to the science of primate ecology and conservation biology. Data from this project will be shared through collaborations with anthropologists and biologists in Madagascar and abroad, and through collaborations with institutions that are renowned for their conservation efforts in Madagascar.</AbstractNarration>
