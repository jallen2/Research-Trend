    <AbstractNarration>This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) research project aims to develop novel insect resistance genes that meet the growing market need for the control of agricultural pests with environmentally neutral compounds. Biotechnology has revolutionized agricultural pest management by offering a safer and more effective method of insect control. The current product on the market has greatly reduced the application of harsh chemical pesticides and fostered demand for more such products. For this technology to be sustainable, however, new compounds must be discovered to manage the development of resistant insects and expand it's use in agriculture. Our previous research discovered fungal protein extracts that contain orally toxic insecticidal compounds, and our university research partner has a patent pending on the application of these proteins as an insecticide. MycoGenomix has an exclusive license to commercialize this product. The proposed research uses protein fraction tools coupled with insect feeding bioassays to identify candidate toxin proteins. DNA probes will be constructed from partial peptide sequences and used to screen a cDNA-based protein expression library to identify the specific gene sequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this identification of novel insect resistance genes and the development of these products for agricultural use will be to provide for an improved, environmentally friendly means of agricultural pest management with significant commercial value.</AbstractNarration>
