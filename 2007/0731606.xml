    <AbstractNarration>This project will help fund participation of junior scientists and early career faculty in the 10th International Workshop on Modeling of Mantle Convection and Lithospheric Dynamics. This 5-day workshop will be held September 2-6, 2007 in Carry-le-Rouet, just west of Marseille. The topics of discussion include (1) current understanding of mantle convection and lithospheric dynamics and (2) the state-of-the-art modeling approaches in research. Geodynamical research addresses fundamental questions concerning the evolution of Earth and other terrestrial planets and is central in our understanding of plate tectonics and the geologic evolution of Earth's landscape. While research is often specialized, it is important that geoscientists from all sub-disciplines meet regularly to share and explain results, to discuss scientific hypotheses, and to plan new research strategies. The graduate students and post-docs from US based universities will listen to lectures from some of the world experts in the fields, get hands-on technical training in the application of cutting-edge modeling techniques, and they get the opportunity to present their research using posters that will be on display throughout the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
