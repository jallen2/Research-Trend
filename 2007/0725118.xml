    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0725118&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Studies of Electronic Relaxation and Coherent Control in Functionalized Semiconductors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Batista, Victor S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: Yale University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is the continued development of methods to describe&lt;br/&gt;quantum dynamics in extended semiconductor nanostructures, and the application of&lt;br/&gt;these methods to explore ultrafast quantum dynamical phenomena associated with&lt;br/&gt;photoinduced electronic excitations in TiO2 and ZnO nanostructures. The project&lt;br/&gt;includes the characterization of photoinduced electron-hole pair relaxation pathways in&lt;br/&gt;functionalized semiconductor surfaces; the investigation of photoexcitation methods for&lt;br/&gt;laser manipulation of electronic relaxation; and the integration of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;with an outreach educational program for minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The approach is based on rigorous computational approaches&lt;br/&gt;combining ab initio DFT molecular dynamics and quantum dynamics simulations of&lt;br/&gt;electronic relaxation in fully atomistic models of functionalized TiO2 and ZnO surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: The resulting theoretical developments will impact studies of quantum&lt;br/&gt;dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures in a wide range of applications in molecular&lt;br/&gt;electronics, photooptic devices, imaging and memory units as well as in photocatalysis,&lt;br/&gt;electrochemistry and artificial photosynthesis based on semiconductor materials with&lt;br/&gt;common photoinduced electronic excitations. The proposed outreach educational&lt;br/&gt;program naturally broadens the participation of underrepresentative minorities in the&lt;br/&gt;physical sciences, benefits the educational infrastructure at Yale by creating a&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary frontier research opportunity for students from various academic&lt;br/&gt;departments, and creates a cyber-platform interface for the rapid exchange and&lt;br/&gt;distribution of research findings, software developments and pedagogical materials.</AbstractNarration>
