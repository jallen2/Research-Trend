    <AbstractNarration>A new instrument based on Laser-Induced Phosphorescence (LIP) will be developed for the direct, high sensitivity detection of gas-phase glyoxal. The work will include optimization of the technique, calibration, investigation of possible interferences, field testing, and analysis of field data. Field tests will be performed at Blodgett Forest in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, California, during the Biosphere Effects on Aerosols and Photochemistry Experiment (BEARPEX) campaign in 2007. Chemical processes controlling the fate of biogenic emissions interacting with a processed urban plume, including secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, will be investigated during BEARPEX. An improved understanding of organic oxidation chemistry and SOA formation could lead to improvements in predicting future changes in air quality and climate.&lt;br/&gt; This project will also provide education and training for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the use of field and laboratory instrumentation and data interpretation. The PI is also involved in integrating this research into the course material for chemistry and chemical instrumentation classes.</AbstractNarration>
