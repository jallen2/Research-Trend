    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0704193 &lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: John W. Lott&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Institut Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris will host a&lt;br/&gt;trimester-long program on Ricci Flow and Ricci Curvature over&lt;br/&gt;April-July, 2008. As part of this French activity in a&lt;br/&gt;rapidly-developing area of geometric analysis, an International&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Ricci Flow is scheduled for June 30-July 4, 2008 as&lt;br/&gt;a conclusion to the trimester. Topics of the trimester and&lt;br/&gt;conference are expected to include Ricci flow in the&lt;br/&gt;geometrization of three-manifolds, Kaehler-Einstein metrics and&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler-Ricci flow, metrics of constant scalar curvature, Ricci&lt;br/&gt;flow in dimensions four and higher, analytic aspects of geometric&lt;br/&gt;flows, Einstein metrics and recent developments in geometric&lt;br/&gt;relativity, synthetic Ricci curvature, and Ricci limit spaces.&lt;br/&gt;This landscape was transformed by Perelman's work on Ricci flow&lt;br/&gt;in three-manifolds and all of these areas have enjoyed recent&lt;br/&gt;advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for expenses of US-based&lt;br/&gt;participants in the Paris conference, particularly graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and junior researchers. The subject of the workshop is&lt;br/&gt;the Ricci flow and its extensions. This differential equation&lt;br/&gt;and technique in geometry became celebrated with its application&lt;br/&gt;by Perelman and Hamilton to the Poincare Conjecture on the&lt;br/&gt;topological uniqueness of the three-dimensional sphere, one of&lt;br/&gt;the great challenge problems of mathematics. The technique&lt;br/&gt;considers a single space with a large number of metrics (ways to&lt;br/&gt;measure distance in the space) by using the Ricci curvature at&lt;br/&gt;each metric to determine a direction for evolving the metric that&lt;br/&gt;is likely to make the metric more symmetric -- loosely speaking,&lt;br/&gt;we try to change in the direction of ever rounder metrics.&lt;br/&gt;Although it is often difficult to control all the details&lt;br/&gt;necessary to make such an argument succeed, geometers have found&lt;br/&gt;that this idea identifies optimal metrics in a variety of&lt;br/&gt;important situations.
