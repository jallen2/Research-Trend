    <AbstractNarration>This project will study two fundamentally new routes to synthetically useful organopalladium intermediates via Pd migration and aryne addition chemistry. Specifically, this project will (1) establish the optimal reaction conditions and the scope of these unique reactions, (2) determine the mechanistic details of these processes, and (3) examine applications in complex organic synthesis. The ultimate goal is to be able to predict when, where, and under what reaction conditions these Pd migrations are likely to take place and what reactions can be employed to effectively trap the resulting intermediates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Richard C. Larock, of the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University. Professor Richard C. Larock's research efforts revolve around the discovery, development, and exploitation of novel reactions effected by palladium compounds. Such palladium compounds offer promise for efficient approaches for the synthesis of complex organic molecules as well as the preparation of molecules that are virtually inaccessible in the absence of palladium participation.</AbstractNarration>
