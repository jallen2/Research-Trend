    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will determine the best configuration of MEMS resonators for use as unique identifiers in RFID tags. MEMS resonators have high Q, high natural resonant frequencies which vary in frequency from resonator to resonator. This natural variation can be used to uniquely identify a resonator, and makes cloning a specific signal extremely difficult, in essence becoming a fingerprint. This approach to RFID security overcomes the drawbacks of encryption which include more complex and expensive tags and the need to manage encryption keys. MEMS resonators for RFID tags will be unique, secure, cost effective, CMOS compatible, fast to read, with low power requirements and low overhead. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have a broad impact on improving the security of identifying people and goods. For example, the RFID tags used in the implementation of US passports were recently cloned which puts into question the security of those tags. Since MEMS resonators cannot be cloned, they can provide significant security assurance to economically validate a given passport. Similar uses can be found in access cards to secure sites. MEMS resonators can also be used to economically authenticate pharmaceuticals since counterfeit drugs are increasingly prevalent and have caused deaths.</AbstractNarration>
