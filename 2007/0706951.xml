    <AbstractNarration>Gonzalez&lt;br/&gt;0706951&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops a computational method for&lt;br/&gt;estimating local, sequence-dependent curvature parameters for DNA&lt;br/&gt;from hydrodynamic data on short, relatively stiff fragments. The&lt;br/&gt;method consists of minimizing a least-squares functional which&lt;br/&gt;quantifies the difference between theoretical and experimental&lt;br/&gt;sedimentation speeds for a given collection of fragments, and its&lt;br/&gt;numerical implementation requires the repeated solution of an&lt;br/&gt;exterior Stokes-type problem around various slender,&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional domains. The research effort is centered on&lt;br/&gt;three areas: (1) the study of the theoretical sedimentation speed&lt;br/&gt;of a stiff polymer in a Stokes-type fluid with thermal&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations in different asymptotic limits, (2) the design and&lt;br/&gt;analysis of fast, provably convergent boundary element methods&lt;br/&gt;for computing the theoretical sedimentation speed based on the&lt;br/&gt;novel idea of a kernel-adapted Nystrom method, and (3) the design&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of fast, reliable methods for minimizing a&lt;br/&gt;least-squares sedimentation functional over a space of&lt;br/&gt;sequence-dependent curvature parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequence-dependent curvature and flexibility of DNA is&lt;br/&gt;critical for its packaging into the cell, recognition by other&lt;br/&gt;molecules, and conformational changes during biochemically&lt;br/&gt;important processes. However, few experimental methods are&lt;br/&gt;available for probing these properties at the basepair level. &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to exploit the stiffness of DNA&lt;br/&gt;at short length scales and develop a method for estimating local,&lt;br/&gt;sequence-dependent curvature parameters from hydrodynamic data on&lt;br/&gt;short fragments. The method is based on the observation that&lt;br/&gt;small, relatively stiff fragments of different shape typically&lt;br/&gt;travel at different speeds when forced through a viscous fluid or&lt;br/&gt;through a dilute gel. The investigator seeks to develop a&lt;br/&gt;sufficiently refined mathematical relation between shape and&lt;br/&gt;speed and further use this relation to develop a computational&lt;br/&gt;method to estimate shape parameters from measurements of speed. &lt;br/&gt;Results from this research lead to new tools for quantifying the&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic sequence-dependent curvature of DNA, which in turn may&lt;br/&gt;lead to an enhanced understanding of important genomic regions&lt;br/&gt;and of how DNA interacts with other molecules.</AbstractNarration>
