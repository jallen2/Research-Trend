    <AbstractNarration>CBET 0707204&lt;br/&gt;Workshop on Interfacial Chemistry and Indoor Air Quality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glenn Morrison&lt;br/&gt;University of Missouri-Rolla&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds to support the participation of scientists and engineers in a workshop on the role of interfacial processes in affecting human exposure to indoor air pollutants. The workshop will be held at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California in July 2007, and it will include leading researchers in the field of indoor air quality, as well as early career faculty and graduate students. Indoor air is increasingly recognized as an important pollutant exposure route for humans. Reactions on surfaces (interfacial processes) are thought to have major influences on the formation and transformations of various pollutant compounds, but many uncertainties exist on this topic. This workshop will (i) evaluate the current state of knowledge concerning indoor air quality and the role of interfacial chemical in affecting human exposures to reactants and products in indoor air; (ii) evaluate key gaps in knowledge on this topic; and (iii) develop a focused plan of action for research to fill these knowledge gaps. A written report of the workshop's results will be published in an appropriate peer-evaluated journal.</AbstractNarration>
