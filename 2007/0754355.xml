    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site program entitled "SURFing the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory" is a partnership between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Science Foundation to provide summer undergraduate research fellowships (SURF) in all aspects of electrical engineering and related measurement science. The SURF program provides opportunities for undergraduates, our nation's next generation of scientists and engineers, to engage in world-class metrology-related research at NIST. The students will work one-on-one with world-recognized scientists and engineers on projects that combine the quest for fundamental knowledge with direct applications to problems of national importance. The program will allow students to work on clearly defined projects, participate in seminars, participate in student colloquiums, and provide the undergraduates with networking opportunities that will prepare them for careers in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruiting efforts will be targeted to women, minorities and persons with disabilities. The program will motivate students to pursue graduate programs in preparation for careers in research and development (R&amp;D). A core goal of the program is to show students that careers in R&amp;D can be challenging, but also exciting, flexible and rewarding.</AbstractNarration>
