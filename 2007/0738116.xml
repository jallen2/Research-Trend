    <AbstractNarration>This study analyzes the relationship between scientists who work in university settings (academics) and scientists who work in non-university settings (applied scientists in government and industry). Although there is some degree of overlap between these two groups, it is assumed in this study that these are two, more or less, distinct groups with different motivations for creating and applying scientific innovations. The general hypothesis is that structural characteristics of placement within a whole scientific network, attributes of the personal collaboration network comprised of authors with whom one publishes, and attributes of the work environment determine the level of collaboration between academic and non academic scientists. This study applies techniques from cognitive anthropology and social network research to the community of science. It is expected to result in new discoveries about how academic and applied sciences interact, and how these methods may be applied to other areas of the science of science. &lt;br/&gt;The relationship between academic and non-academic scientists in the U.S. is determined utilizing three different methods. First is a web-based survey utilizing the Web of Science, focusing on authors whose current affiliation is a non-academic institution. Second, a sample of academic scientists is selected from the JCR Science Edition of the Web of Science. Personal network compositional and structural variables are calculated from the authors with whom they have co-authored, paying special attention to the representation of co-authors in non-academic settings. These are used as covariates to explain the variability in their H-index, a measure of scientific productivity in academe. The third task involves a case study of the social network relations between an academic community at universities in Florida (hydrology, soil and water science) and the Florida Water Management Districts. This study builds on the most current research in the area of scientometrics that has shown through citation analysis and the study of patent filings the differential involvement of academic and non-academic scientists. It also builds on the researchers' ongoing project, where authors on the Web of Science are surveyed about their attitudes concerning author order and publishing. &lt;br/&gt;This research has potential application to global research funding for science. Implicit within many grant solicitations is the expectation that scientific discovery and innovation lead to application and ultimately societal benefit. Few studies have systematically examined the interaction between the academic science community and applied science, particularly in the U.S. This study includes the cultural motivations within these communities to provide a better understanding of how the structure functions. By understanding the structure of the nexus between academic and applied science, granting agencies may be better able to structure funding to maximize the probability of scientific innovation resulting in application.</AbstractNarration>
