    <AbstractNarration>The aim of this conference is to bring together a group of outstanding mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;loosely connected to combinatorics, understood in the widest sense. The meeting will give&lt;br/&gt;a chance to mathematicians from the Mid-South to benefit not only from the lectures but&lt;br/&gt;also from personal contacts with the speakers.&lt;br/&gt;The main speaker at the conference is one of the most distinguished mathematicians today,&lt;br/&gt;Peter Lax of the Courant Institute in New York, the recipient of the National Medal of&lt;br/&gt;Science in 1986, the Wolf Prize in 1987, and the Abel Prize in 2005. Very accurately,&lt;br/&gt;he has been described as the most versatile mathematician today. He started in pure&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, but his greatest contributions have been to to the theory and application&lt;br/&gt;of partial differential equations and to the computation of their solutions. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;he constructed explicit solutions of nonlinear hyperbolic systems and identified classes of&lt;br/&gt;especially well-behaved systems. Lax is also a wonderful expositor, the author of several&lt;br/&gt;successful books, and a very approachable man.&lt;br/&gt;There will be several other exciting speakers at the meeting; they have been chosen because&lt;br/&gt;they are not only excellent mathematicians, but also wonderful expositors and very approachable&lt;br/&gt;people. They include Vitaly Bergelson of Ohio State University, who has made&lt;br/&gt;major contributions to ergodic theory, especially to recurrence theory stemming from the&lt;br/&gt;work of Furstenberg inspired by Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progressions; Yuval&lt;br/&gt;Peres from Microsoft Research and UC Berkeley, one of the most notable people working&lt;br/&gt;on combinatorial aspects of probability theory; Sasha Kostochka from the University of&lt;br/&gt;Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a very powerful mathematician who is carrying the torch&lt;br/&gt;for extremal combinatorics; Ralph Faudree from the University of Memphis, one of the&lt;br/&gt;most frequent collaborators of Paul Erdos, an expert on Ramsey-type problems; Stephanie&lt;br/&gt;Gerke of ETH in Zurich, who has done beautiful work on the interface of pure mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and computer science; Tom Trotter of Georgia Tech, one of the founders of the modern&lt;br/&gt;theory of partially ordered sets; Boris Pittel from Ohio State University, one of the best&lt;br/&gt;people working on probabilistic combinatorics; and Mark Walters from the University of&lt;br/&gt;Cambridge, England, who has proved much about random bootstrap percolation and random&lt;br/&gt;geometric graphs. Andr'as Gy'arf'as from Budapest will give a special 'public' lecture&lt;br/&gt;aimed at a very wide audience, including some of the best high school students from the&lt;br/&gt;area.&lt;br/&gt;Unlike the East Coast or the Bay Area on the West Coast, the Mid-South cannot boast of&lt;br/&gt;many high-level mathematical conferences; the Contemporary Combinatorics 2007 meeting&lt;br/&gt;in Memphis goes some way towards redressing the balance. The formula whereby personal&lt;br/&gt;contacts between the lecturers and the other participants is greatly encouraged was found&lt;br/&gt;to be very successful a year ago, and this what we hope to do at the 2007 meeting as&lt;br/&gt;well. There is no doubt that listening to lectures by Peter Lax, Vitaly Bergelson, Yuval&lt;br/&gt;Peres, and others, and, especially, talking to them during the conference will be very&lt;br/&gt;inspiring for young and established mathematicians alike. The NSF grant is absolutely&lt;br/&gt;vital for the success of the meeting; most of it will be used to help graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;senior mathematicians come to Memphis so that they can benefit from the lectures and&lt;br/&gt;the personal contact with the speakers.</AbstractNarration>
