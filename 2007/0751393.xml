    <AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The past two decades have seen a surging interest in the&lt;br/&gt;exploration and exploitation of stimulus-responsive polymers, i.e. macromolecular&lt;br/&gt;materials which, usually reversibly, change at least one of their key properties in response&lt;br/&gt;to an external stimulus such as such as a change in temperature, pH, ionic strength,&lt;br/&gt;solvent, and irradiation with light or electric fields. The possibility to program them with&lt;br/&gt;desired functions clearly distinguishes stimulus-responsive polymers from other&lt;br/&gt;advanced materials with 'traditional' functional characteristics. Demonstrated or targeted&lt;br/&gt;high-level functions such as perception, judgment, movement, and recognition, have&lt;br/&gt;triggered the inaccurate but rather descriptive use of the term 'intelligent materials'. The&lt;br/&gt;combination of fundamental scientific curiosity on the one hand and the broad&lt;br/&gt;technological opportunities that promise to impact virtually all areas of life on the other&lt;br/&gt;define the increasing interest in these materials. The goal of this symposium is to bring&lt;br/&gt;together established experts, scientists at the beginning of their careers, and students from&lt;br/&gt;different disciplines, to share most up-to-date and important research focused on the&lt;br/&gt;design, synthesis, processing and application of stimuli-responsive polymers. Four halfday&lt;br/&gt;oral sessions with about 30 talks will concentrate on (1) Mechanoresponsive&lt;br/&gt;Materials; (2) Responsive Polymers for Bio-Applications; (3) Polymers with Unusual&lt;br/&gt;Sensing Capabilities; and (4) Polymers that Respond to Electromagnetic Radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: All of the funds awarded from NSF will be used to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;symposium attendance by faculty members that are at the beginning of their careers (and&lt;br/&gt;their students) and who might otherwise not be able to attend. Priority will be given to&lt;br/&gt;participants who would like to give oral presentations and from groups that are&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
