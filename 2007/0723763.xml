    <AbstractNarration>This joint project between University at Buffalo (UB) and Hilbert College (HC) is expanding capacity in Information Assurance (IA) and Computer Forensics in the Western New York region via institutional faculty development as well as technical experiences for faculty. The end goal of our effort is to carve out a flexible curriculum pathway to specialize in IA and computer forensics with multiple exit points for the students depending upon their career goals. The universities are offering workshops and intensive seminars to faculty in the neighboring community colleges and universities to learn about recent advances in IA and computer forensics and (b) technical experience for faculty at UB and HC so that the IA faculty can then develop full-fledged computer forensics courses and teach them to students with hands-on experience. The project has two unique aspects. First, it draws upon the expertise from The Cyber Security Education Consortium (CSEC) at Oklahoma and involves the members of the Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory (RCFL) of Western NY in this learning process. Second, it provides multiple exit points for students at the associate degree level, BS/BA level and MS/MBA level at three different colleges and universities without the need for relocating students. While the Western NY RCFL does not currently have an Honors Internship program, project leaders anticipate that it will have one in the near future - similar to all other RCFLs with an internship program (preference will be given to local students within community distance). As a multidisciplinary Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE), UB faculty members anticipate IA expansion through various disciplines ranging from computer science and engineering and mathematics to management sciences and legal/ethical studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include: (a) the furtherance of ongoing collaborations with two-year colleges, Erie Community College (ECC, a Minority Institution) and Genesee Community College, (b) a partnership with the Erie County Department of Police Services through the involvement of the Commissioner of Police Services on the Center's advisory board, and (c) active engagement of students from underrepresented groups through the local Minority Management Society and the SUNY Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program as well as the Women in Management and Engineering and Science groups.</AbstractNarration>
