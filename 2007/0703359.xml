    <AbstractNarration>The project is aimed at providing new or refined constraints&lt;br/&gt;on models of evolution and composition of the continental crust,&lt;br/&gt;by simultaneously measuring crustal thickness, Poisson's ratio&lt;br/&gt;which can be uniquely determined by the ratio between P and S-wave&lt;br/&gt;velocities, and crustal P-wave velocities beneath about 200 broadband&lt;br/&gt;seismic stations distributed all over the continents.&lt;br/&gt;About 80,000 source-normalized broadband seismograms will be&lt;br/&gt;visually checked and used for the proposed study. A set of computer&lt;br/&gt;codes that the PIs developed to search for the optimal combination&lt;br/&gt;of the three parameters beneath a station will be used for the study,&lt;br/&gt;and the bootstrap procedure will be used to estimate&lt;br/&gt;the errors of the measurements. The existence of dipping Moho&lt;br/&gt;beneath each of the stations will be examined. Another part of&lt;br/&gt;the project is for the collection of a set of published tectonic&lt;br/&gt;history and petrological data obtained from lower crustal xenoliths&lt;br/&gt;or terrains related to the composition and evolution of the lower crust&lt;br/&gt;inthe vicinity of each of the stations. Those geological data will&lt;br/&gt;be used for the interpretation of the seismological results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected results from the proposed work will be used by&lt;br/&gt;geochemists, mineral physicists, and geodynamicists to address a&lt;br/&gt;broad range of important questions regarding the formation and evolution&lt;br/&gt;of early crust and mantle. Thus this study should have an impact that is&lt;br/&gt;beyond the seismological community.</AbstractNarration>
