    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIS - 0738543&lt;br/&gt;Lagoze, Carl J.&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Advancing the State of eChemistry: Workshop and Pilot Study&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project requests funding for two main efforts over a one-year period. The first is an international eChemistry workshop bringing together innovators in the chemistry and chemical informatics community in order to understand more exactly the nature and parameters of the current state and the requirements for the collection and communication of experimental and scholarly data within the discipline. Computing and network technologies, digital data capture, techniques, and advances in data mining and machine learning algorithms offer the potential for enabling new communication paradigms, as well as new collaborative models for research, and social networks for knowledge building. The physics and astronomy communities are noted for having exploited and benefited from deployment of new information technologies. Based on the outcome of the workshop, a whitepaper will be created to lay the basis for future research activities to investigate notions such as virtual laboratories, data-centric publishing, and semantically-based data integration in chemistry. The second effort is a pilot study of chemistry subcommunities using ethnographic and quantitative methods.</AbstractNarration>
