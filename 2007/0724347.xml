    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Amanda Stronza, along with graduate students Joseph E. Mbaaiwa, Fernanda de Vasconcellos Pegas, and Carter A. Hunt, will undertake comparative research on the local effects of ecotourism in four rural communities in Peru, Botswana, Brazil, and Nicaragua. The researchers will address social science debates about the influence of local and international markets on human-environment interactions. They also will produce empirically grounded analyses that use the findings of descriptive case studies to build generalizing theory and evaluate the utility of ecotourism as a market-based tool for conservation and development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research builds on a ten-year study of an indigenous-owned ecotourism lodge in the Peruvian Amazon. In that case, ecotourism has had contradictory effects. It has fortified local institutions for managing common pool resources, but it has also led to expanded exploitation of natural resources and new conflicts over profits. The researchers hypothesize that community management of ecotourism is especially important for building local institutions for conservation and development. The four focal communities in this study were chosen because they all experience direct costs and benefits from ecotourism, but differ in their levels of control over decision-making and ownership of ecotourism operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will conduct six months of ethnographic field research in each site. They will carry out interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observation to assess community participation in ecotourism and its effects the economy, resource use and conservation, and overall perceptions of well being. They also will conduct surveys of stratified samples of community residents. The data from all four cases will be combined to conduct systematic comparisons. Causal conditions for predicting conservation outcomes from ecotourism will be assessed using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. Comparisons will also be made within and across communities at the level of households and individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is important because it will contribute to anthropological theory about the influence of the market on human-environment interactions. Specifically, it will generate better understanding of conditions under which market incentives interact with local institutions to enable collective action for conservation. From a practical perspective, the research will lead to better policy for ensuring that communities benefit socially, economically, and environmentally from ecotourism. The study is innovative because it will use ethnographic approaches to evaluate social and cultural changes associated with ecotourism (not just economic ones), especially as they relate to conservation ethics and institutions for resource management. The results of the research will allow conservationists, development practitioners, tour operators, and local community leaders to understand more clearly the mechanisms by which ecotourism meets development goals while also protecting the environment. Finally, the research will foster international research collaboration and will contribute to the doctoral training of three graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
