    <AbstractNarration>We currently face worldwide collapse of many commercial and sport fishery stocks. Many exploited fish, as well as hunted wildlife, are suffering from reductions in population size and isolation as a result of habitat destruction and over harvest. In addition, rapid genetic adaptation in response to selective harvest (e.g., preferential harvest of individuals with larger body or horn size) is recognized as an important problem in exploited populations. The investigators will synthesize their work on the genetics and evolution of exploited populations accomplished over the last 30 years in a book, as well as in papers, seminars, and workshops. They also will provide suggestions for future research directions and perspectives for the expanding role of genetics in management of fish and wildlife. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the broad dissemination of understanding of the application of evolution and genetics to an important problem faced by society. It is currently impossible to predict either the susceptibility of fish stocks to collapse or their ability to recover from collapse. Understanding the genetic and evolutionary response of populations to exploitation is crucial in order to predict the effects of management actions and to develop management plans that will allow sustainable exploitation in the long-term.</AbstractNarration>
