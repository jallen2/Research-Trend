    <AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this project is the implementation of retention and recruitment strategies designed to affect the "growing exodus" of students from computer science and mathematics. The Odyssey II program is improving the infrastructure of the computer science and mathematics programs by strengthening the academic skills of students choosing to major in these disciplines. Program scholarships and services are assisting the University in recruiting more academically gifted students as well as equipping the students with skills necessary to complete the more rigorous accredited curricula. Specific elements which are contributing to the program's success include: (1) student participation in learning communities, (2) early identification of students in need of tutoring services, (3) student conference attendance including research presentations, and (4) early identification of future mathematics and computer science majors through the University's dual enrollment program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing an opportunity for underrepresented students in the rural Mississippi Delta, including those displaced by Katrina, a greater opportunity to pursue a college degree and subsequent major in computer science and mathematics. The program is impacting the retention to graduation rate for this target population. The program is creating a deeper bond between MCIS majors through the establishment of learning communities as well as assisting in the formation of deeper alliances between faculty and students.</AbstractNarration>
