    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Iyengar studies the behavioral ecology of arthropods, with an emphasis on sexual selection in insects that communicate through chemistry. Sexual selection, defined as differential reproduction due to competition over access to mates, explains phenomena including courtship displays, size differences between genders, mate choice, and gametocyte competition. The rattlebox moth (Utetheisa ornatrix) is well-suited as a model for this study because females mate preferentially based on a male-courtship pheromone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Iyengar will use chemical and molecular analyses to address three fundamental issues: (1) the correlation of chemical signals to male reproductive potential; (2) whether paternity is biased towards larger males; and (3) the heritability of mating traits. The proposed projects will further our understanding of the fundamental principles of sexual selection, and will lay the foundation for future experiments that will advance the expanding, interdisciplinary field of chemical ecology. The fundamental knowledge may help us to further understand chemical signaling and reproductive traits in other species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Iyengar's research program will provide numerous opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to participate in hypothesis-driven research that includes: laboratory work involving chemical and molecular techniques, field studies, statistical analyses, oral presentations at conferences, and submission of manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals. As a person of mixed heritage, Dr. Iyengar will serve as a positive role model, encouraging students from underrepresented groups to participate in research and actively pursue a career in the biological sciences.</AbstractNarration>
