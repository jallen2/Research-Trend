    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for student and postdoc participation in the 2007 Gordon Research Conference on Quantum Control of Light and Matter. The conference is being held during the period 12-17 August, 2007, at Salve Regina College, and will involve a broad program that touches upon a number of research activities of potential interest to investigators and students supported through the AMOP program. The field of Coherent Control has grown beyond the initial objectives of the control of unimolecular processes to providing attractive strategies to solving scientific problems as well as paving the way for new applications in a broad range of disciplines. The objective of the conference is to bring together internationally leading scientists as well as young researchers and students active or specially interested in the field of quantum control. The conference shall be a forum to present the newest research results and trends in this rapidly expanding field. The interdisciplinary character of the field will be emphasized.</AbstractNarration>
