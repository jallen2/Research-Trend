    <AbstractNarration>This IT Security workshop will focus on bringing Innovation to market in the IT Security sector. One objective is to provide connections to the academic and small business community that is working in this area. Speakers from the venture industry as well as technology officers from potential strategic partners will convey "lessons learned" and best practices to increase commercialization success. After the workshop is complete, leaders from the community will be more experienced with the NSF SBIR/STTR program and companies will walk away with rich contacts with future business development potential. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF's SBIR/STTR program makes approximately $100mm in grants on an annual basis and maintaining and improving commercialization of these efforts through public-private partnerships is considered a strategic thrust for the effort. Supporting workshops specifically-targeted to areas such as IT security is one way that NSF can as a catalyst to establish more effective public-private partnerships and thus increase the commercialization impact of the program.</AbstractNarration>
