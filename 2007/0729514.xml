    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research is focused on the feasibility analysis, design and prototyping of a non-invasive sensory and control system that detects human brain intentions about the movement of the musculoskeletal system and uses those signals to command and control artificial limbs or robotic systems that assist individuals with disabilities. Such direct brain control systems is expected to have a major impact, especially for young soldiers returning from combat with lost hands and legs, quadriplegic, and people suffering from ALS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will pioneer a new field of research and development, has potential for major economical impact, and could become the basis for new biomedical devices, and start up high tech companies. Integration of a Functional Near Infrared (fNIR) Imaging, a neuro-fuzzy inference engine, and a real-time control system for commanding artificial limbs is an innovative man-machine system that could significantly improve the life quality of the disabled and elderly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this type of research can stimulate interests from middle and high school students and teachers in engineering and technology areas. Plan is made to get a significant sample of 8th through 12th grade students and 3 to 4 teachers on a rotational basis, involved in our proposed research. Special attention will be given to the selection of female and minority high school students. These student and teach involvements will have a profound impact on raising their interest levels for studying engineering.</AbstractNarration>
