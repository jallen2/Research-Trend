    <AbstractNarration>Engineering as inherently cross-disciplinary - as a profession and as an activity that involves identifying and solving complex problems that require managing trade-offs between human, social, cultural, and technical issues. Reports on the future path of engineering education emphasize the importance of preparing engineers to think and work across perspectives, which has been identified as a crucial research area for enhancing diversity and inclusiveness in engineering. Calls for increased cross-disciplinary research and education seek to address concerns regarding the nation's competitive edge in innovation, and critiques on the ability of educational programs to prepare professionals who can address problems that link human, social, and environmental systems. This has catalyzed substantial investments in cross-disciplinary education at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels as well as early training programs in industry. There is surprisingly little empirical research on the nature and development of cross-disciplinary engineering that may guide the success of these investments. This, research provides important points for departure: (1) empirical research on the influence of intentional serendipity, cognitive flexibility, fluid identities, and disciplinary and cross-disciplinary interactions, and (2) a crucial need for advancing the scholarship of cross-disciplinary teaching practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to address these issues by advancing a scholarship of cross-disciplinary teaching and learning and investigating: (1) the nature and development of cross-disciplinary ways of thinking, acting, and being in engineering contexts in relation to disciplinary practice over time, and (2) the ways engineering educators approach cross-disciplinary teaching practice, including the diffusion of teaching practice . This will be realized through an integrated research and education plan that includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Longitudinal studies of individuals with varying disciplinary "grounding" engaged in cross-disciplinary practice; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. An Interdisciplinary Commons to facilitate a scholarship of cross-disciplinary teaching and learning and enable studies on approaches to cross-disciplinary teaching practice and the transfer of practice; and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Piloting research-to-practice transformations to stimulate next generation studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Directorate for Engineering and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.</AbstractNarration>
