    <AbstractNarration>The retirement of the armored T-28 Storm Penetration Aircraft, operated and maintained by the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, left a gap in the ability to penetrate convective storms to study cloud physics, hydrometeors, electrical phenomena, and providing in situ data for ground based remote sensing instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two workshops had identified an A-10 aircraft as being potential replacement for the T-28 as well as a platform that could provide more extensive service to the geosciences community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is an extensive engineering analysis of the A-10?s applicability to meet current and projected science requirements. The results of this study will determine the financial and physical constraints to operate the A-10 as a national facility for the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
