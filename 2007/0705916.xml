    <AbstractNarration>III-COR: Collaborative Research: Graceful Evolution and Historical&lt;br/&gt;Queries in Information Systems-- a Unified Approach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Database schema evolution is a constant in the life-cycle of&lt;br/&gt;Information Systems (IS), and a source of major costs for maintenance,&lt;br/&gt;upgrading, and service down time. The traditional process of&lt;br/&gt;installing a new schema, converting the database, and rewriting&lt;br/&gt;applications is slow and laborious. Instead, this project develops&lt;br/&gt;the novel technology whereby the schema evolution problem is&lt;br/&gt;reduced to coordinating mappings between multiple concurrent&lt;br/&gt;versions of schema, applications, and database. The project's&lt;br/&gt;approach consists of developing: (i) XML-based architectures for&lt;br/&gt;unifying the management of evolving data and metadata, (ii)&lt;br/&gt;methods for capturing evolution via schema mappings, (iii)&lt;br/&gt;efficient mapping techniques for queries and applications. These&lt;br/&gt;advances will enable the development of the MetaManager, a system&lt;br/&gt;that supports: (a) preserving and querying database histories, and&lt;br/&gt;(b) better planning on how-to evolve current schema versions, via&lt;br/&gt;evaluation and testing of ``what-if'' scenarios. Its&lt;br/&gt;functionality and performance are validated using various testbeds,&lt;br/&gt;including the SDSC Storage Request Broker, which hosts scientific&lt;br/&gt;data for research groups ranging from astrophysicists to&lt;br/&gt;biologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This novel and timely approach provides a solution to both the&lt;br/&gt;evolution and preservation of IS. Because of the&lt;br/&gt;key role played by IS, a broad range of scientific, educational,&lt;br/&gt;and economic activities will benefit. Project funds support&lt;br/&gt;training of PhD students while undergraduate research interns are&lt;br/&gt;trained on schema-evolution scenarios using the MetaManager. The&lt;br/&gt;technology is a part of database design courses. Results are&lt;br/&gt;disseminated via publications, reports and demos which are available from:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~tsotras/meta-manager&lt;br/&gt;http://wis.cs.ucla.edu/projects/meta-manager&lt;br/&gt;http://db.ucsd.edu/people/alin/meta-manager</AbstractNarration>
