    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the formation and characterization of hybrid nanostructures linking vertically aligned carbon nanofibers with electrocatalytic metals and molecular materials. Electrocatalytic reactions underlie many emerging technologies such as fuel cells, but are limited in efficiency and by the high cost of many catalysts. This research will explore a new generation of designer interfaces in which nanostructured substrates are coupled to electrocatalytic centers through well-defined molecular groups in order to optimize the electron-transfer properties of the interface and the resulting electrocatalytic efficiency and selectivity. The grant will also provide training opportunities for graduate students in cutting-edge areas of interface science and will provide opportunities for faculty and graduate students to mentor K-12 students conducting independent research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on materials and interfaces crucial to emerging technologies for storage and conversion of energy between electrical and chemical forms, such as fuel cells. Novel types of carbon-based nanoscale materials exhibiting unique properties will be linked to catalysts that can enhance the rates of chemical transformations with significantly reduced use of energy. The proposed work has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and lower the cost of important chemical transformations. Priority will be given to training for graduate students in areas of science and technology crucial to future developments in energy science. Priority will also be given to providing opportunities for K-12 students to conduct research projects at the university in these areas.</AbstractNarration>
