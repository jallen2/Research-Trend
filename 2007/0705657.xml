    <AbstractNarration>This project targets the discovery and characterization of new transition metal oxides with open structures that are capable of acting as the host for guest-host reactions intercalation compounds. These oxides form intriguing structures, including nanoscrolls and nanourchins, that are able to intercalate a range of ions, including lithium and are therefore of interest for use in advance lithium batteries, and as sensors. The redox reactions that occur on intercalation modify not only the physical properties but may allow for the scrolling to occur reversibly and therefore act as nano-mechanical actuators. This project will train students in and use the most cutting-edge characterization techniques, not only at Binghamton where 15M$ of materials characterization is being installed this year, but also at the National Laboratories, including Brookhaven, Argonne and Oak Ridge. The students and postdoc on this project will not only move on to become scientific leaders themselves, but will help train the next generation of students by participating in undergraduate classes at SUNY-Binghamton in Chemistry and Materials Science from Introductory Chemistry through senior level courses in Nanoscience, Solid State Chemistry and Materials Analysis Techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project targets the discovery and characterization of new materials that might find application for example as sensors or as components of advanced energy storage devices, that might power the next generation of electric vehicles. These materials form in different shapes, like urchins, and in different sizes ranging from a few millimeters to the nanosize. In the formation of these materials we mimic nature by using green approaches that lead to completely different materials. These materials are then characterized using National Laboratory Facilities; this not only gives us the best capabilities but also trains students in these advanced techniques thus providing the United States with the next-generation of leading-edge scientists. We also involve these graduate students in the education of undergraduates, ranging from first year Introductory Chemistry through advanced senior-level classes. Doing this we hope to not only attract more students into the sciences and engineering, but also lead to a more scientifically-literate population. The students trained using NSF funding have found positions in industry, national labs and in teaching positions in academia.</AbstractNarration>
