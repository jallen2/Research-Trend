    <AbstractNarration>Following on the heels of two successful regional conferences, this project uses funds to&lt;br/&gt;cover participants' costs to attend two national conferences which focus upon supporting&lt;br/&gt;incipient science education research projects. A primary objective of this project is to provide a&lt;br/&gt;venue in which researchers, especially those considered rising stars in the field, can describe&lt;br/&gt;their lines of inquiry and to then receive guidance and input about refining those ambitions. The&lt;br/&gt;other primary objective is to promote an innovative conference design in which a structured&lt;br/&gt;presentation format serves as an incubator for scholarly work. Underwriting by NSF is crucial&lt;br/&gt;because it will allow wider participation in this project than would otherwise be affordable.&lt;br/&gt;Products of the conference include an electronic proceedings that will be posted to the&lt;br/&gt;conference website (www.sciedxroads.org) as well as a book (under contract) documenting the&lt;br/&gt;scope and successes of the conference. In addition, the promising scholars attending will&lt;br/&gt;generate research papers to be disseminated and published for a wider audience. Ultimately, this&lt;br/&gt;project supports developments within science education research even as it advances a fresh&lt;br/&gt;vision for professional conferences. As a result, more school-based research will be conducted,&lt;br/&gt;more policy-shaping documents will be generated, and more emphasis will be made upon&lt;br/&gt;increasing the quality of science learning opportunities for all students.</AbstractNarration>
