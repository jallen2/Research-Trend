    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is creating a new approach for teaching systems engineering within the electrical engineering (EE) curriculum. The approach makes use of a hardware/software platform and accompanying curricular innovations to bring a more engaged, hands-on, exploratory focus to what is probably the most convention-bound component of a typical undergraduate electrical engineering education. Unlike previous attempts to create a less abstract and more engaging systems engineering curriculum, which focused almost entirely on software tools (e.g., MATLAB), the proposed project is creating a hardware/software platform and using that platform to vertically integrate key systems concepts across the undergraduate curriculum. The platform is letting students explore systems applications using a variety of hardware devices such as signal generators, filters, A/D and D/A converters, sensors, and a microprocessor. The platform contains an interface to a student's MP-3 player and cell phone to bring home the relevance of the systems perspective to modern technology. To allow students to see the signals they are generating and manipulating, the platform includes a suite of visualization software. The project is being evaluated using an assortment of tools including an established signals and systems concept inventory along with the analysis of student products and enrollments numbers. The investigators are disseminating their results by posting their material on a website, by publication and presentation in engineering education venues, and through the investigators connection with the signals and systems concept inventory community. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the material, the focus on Hispanic students, and the outreach effort to high school students.</AbstractNarration>
