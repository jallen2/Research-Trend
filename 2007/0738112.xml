    <AbstractNarration>This study defines, creates and broadly interprets a large international database of inter-organizational collaborative agreements. The database focuses on research and technology partnerships (RTPs), which constitute an important subset of all innovation-based strategic alliances focusing primarily on the generation, exchange, adaptation, and exploitation of technical knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;Building upon network analysis to understand RTPs as an element of the innovation system, the study: (1) sets forth a taxonomy of the potential scope of inter-organizational activities that fall under the rubric of RTPs (e.g., formal/informal, equity/non-equity, subsidized/non-subsidized, national/international, horizontal/non-horizontal) and formulate policy-related questions that can be addressed if data were available; (2) develops a data collection and database formation technique based on input, output, and outcome indicators; (3) creates a U.S.-based database of national and international RTPs that is structured specifically for addressing policy questions related to the role of alliance networks in information flows among organizations and sectors in the economy and across economies; (4) links the database to other available data sources that can be utilized to address networks in information flows; (5) defines and validate from the database science and engineering indicators related to RTPs useful for policy purposes; and (6) advises the NSF on possible survey questions relevant for the collection of information on RTPs. &lt;br/&gt;Building on network methodology, the study relies on popular press information, as well as on financial disclosures and co-patenting activity, to identify RTPs and to construct the database. The analytical techniques that are used to construct the database, and thus to facilitate interpretation of the data, draw from evaluation methodology as related to networks. Of particular importance is the identification of inputs related to the formation of an RTP, innovation-related outputs from the RTP, and the spillover outcomes associated with those outputs. Based on extant models of the innovation process and the role of policy in that process, a set of science and technology indicators is developed from the data, and the relationship of those indicators to the knowledge base of industries and the complexity of their technologies is investigated statistically to validate the policy relevance of the database.&lt;br/&gt;The final products from the study will be widely disseminated through various channels. The most important and long-lasting one will be a specially designed website for the RTP database, including facilities to access a standard menu of indicators and visual aids as well as the possibility for downloading data with specific queries. Another important channel will be the planned international expert workshop where the database will be rolled out, major analytical questions will be debated, and future steps will be discussed. A third channel of dissemination will be through teaching, doctoral and masters dissertations, presentations to academic and policy forums, and publications in economics, business, and policy journals.</AbstractNarration>
