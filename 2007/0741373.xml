    <AbstractNarration>Award Number: CBET-0741373&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Aggarwal, Suresh K. &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Illinois at Chicago&lt;br/&gt;Title: International Workshop on Advances in Combustion Science and Technology &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PUBLIC ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering rapidly increasing energy demand, limited supply of fossil fuels, and increased concern over global warming, scientific and technological advances are needed in system efficiencies, cleaner technologies, and alternative and renewable sources of energy. Because these energy and environmental issues have become global due to the emerging Asian economies, international cooperation is potentially valuable in addressing these issues and identifying constructive steps for scientific advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides travel support for 8-10 US participants at a three-day International Workshop on Advances in Combustion Science and Technology, to be held Dec. 31, 2007-Jan. 2, 2008 at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India. The goal of the workshop is to bring together approximately 100 active researchers from academia, industries and research institutions from across the world to discuss recent advances in combustion science and technology and their applications in the changing global energy and environmental scenario. The timing of the workshop benefits from synergies with the Nineteenth National and Eighth ISHMT-ASME Heat and Mass Transfer Conference, which will be held at Hyderabad, India during 3-5 January 2008. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international forum will be valuable for exchanging ideas and developing roadmaps for a sustainable future. The US participants will benefit the meeting and benefit from it by participating in international, multi-disciplinary collaboration and communication. Lectures from the invited US speakers will be of great value to the combustion community, especially to young researchers. Challenges will also be discussed in the context of necessary developments required in undergraduate and graduate education. The invited lectures and the workshop report will be made available to the combustion community via the web.</AbstractNarration>
