    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports &lt;br/&gt;the work of Professor LuAnn McNulty from Butler University. This research &lt;br/&gt;is focused on the syntheses of dihydropyrans via novel and convergent synthetic methods. Substructures of these compounds are found in many&lt;br/&gt;natural products, some of which have interesting biological activities. &lt;br/&gt;Dr. McNulty and coworkers will use microwave technology to assist in &lt;br/&gt;these syntheses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Broader Impacts of this research is considered &lt;br/&gt;to be outstanding, as all of the students working on the projects are undergraduates. These students will be doing cutting edge research, &lt;br/&gt;and will be encouraged to present their work at conferences. Thus, the training and education of the undergraduate students working on these &lt;br/&gt;projects will provide a valuable contribution to society via at least &lt;br/&gt;two avenues: an increase in more highly trained and skilled scientists; and the discovery of new synthetic methods to prepare compounds that may have useful medicinal properties.</AbstractNarration>
