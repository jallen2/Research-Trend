    <AbstractNarration>The relationship between morphology and feeding behavior forms a classical basis for teaching evolution and ecology. Although specialization of the feeding apparatus (skull, jaws, teeth) often increases ability to utilize a given resource, it may also constrain the range of food items that can be taken. The Canidae (e.g. foxes, coyotes, wolves) are an excellent group within which to study such phenomena, as they exhibit a wide array of predatory and feeding behaviors, from large mammal specialists to small mammal and invertebrate specialists. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a mechanical engineering technique used to approximate and visualize stress in objects of complex geometry, when placed under load. Working with a colleague from mechanical engineering, the researchers will use FEA to address hypotheses relating ecology and hunting behavior in canids to variation in morphology by assessing mechanical performance of skulls of ecologically distinct canids under conditions simulating different biting styles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this work will add to an understanding of how morphology places limits on ecology and behavior. It will also contribute to understanding the mechanical basis for phenotypic diversity within carnivore guilds. As such, it will be of broad interest to ecologists, conservation biologists and paleontologists. Finite element analysis is in its infancy as a tool for exploring vertebrate biomechanics and this study will play an important role in defining and developing the method, while allowing undergraduate students the opportunity to become involved in this exciting new field of study.</AbstractNarration>
