    <AbstractNarration>Cherkaev&lt;br/&gt;0707974&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator determines optimal microstructures and new&lt;br/&gt;bounds for effective conductivity or stiffness of multimaterial&lt;br/&gt;composites. Mathematically, the problem is equivalent to the&lt;br/&gt;relaxation of a multivariable variational problem with a&lt;br/&gt;piece-wise quadratic multiwell Lagrangian. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies new sufficient conditions (bounds) and special minimizing&lt;br/&gt;sequences (microstructures). A new technique called localized&lt;br/&gt;polyconvexification is explored that refines the known&lt;br/&gt;polyconvexification procedure by deriving and accounting for new&lt;br/&gt;pointwise constraints on minimizers. A complementary technique&lt;br/&gt;is considered for determining complicated minimizing&lt;br/&gt;laminate-based sequences. Several examples of optimal conducting&lt;br/&gt;and elastic multimaterial structures are worked out; there could&lt;br/&gt;be used for optimal design of multimaterial structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies how to place several materials of&lt;br/&gt;different conductivity or stiffness in a periodic composite&lt;br/&gt;structure in order to maximize its overall conductivity or&lt;br/&gt;stiffness. In a sense, the problem remains a jigsaw puzzle that&lt;br/&gt;asks to build an optimal mosaic from pieces of different physical&lt;br/&gt;properties. The mosaic can be two- or three-dimensional. Work&lt;br/&gt;on this problem was started in 1963 by the famous paper by Hashin&lt;br/&gt;and Shtrikman. The problem is solved for two mixing materials,&lt;br/&gt;and the suggested novel approach allows to extend the results to&lt;br/&gt;more than two materials. The obtained optimal microstructures&lt;br/&gt;are diverse and unpredictable. The best possible composites from&lt;br/&gt;given components can be used in manufacturing of artificial&lt;br/&gt;materials and structural design. The underlying mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;when developed, should also help to better understand and control&lt;br/&gt;smart materials and phase transitions in solids and similar&lt;br/&gt;phenomena of self-organization in heterogeneous materials.</AbstractNarration>
