    <AbstractNarration>The project centers on materials research of strongly correlated transition metal perovskites with atomically organized local structures. Novel compounds with decreased structural distortions and sub-nanometer layered heterostructures synthesized by design with concomitant properties measurements will provide the basis for understanding the competing roles of interactions which determine stability and physical behavior. This work aims to develop new synthesis tools and new measurement techniques to determine the structural and physical properties of perovskites exhibiting several competing characteristics. Highly accurate data for description of these properties in terms of geometrical parameters and fundamental interactions for pursuit of further theoretical insights will be provided. This project will also provide a unique opportunity for training undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and visitors by involving them in cutting-edge research on a wide area of solid state chemistry and physics of advanced oxides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project centers on materials research of complex oxide compounds by using systematic exploration of the effects of chemical composition, temperature, and oxygen content on structural and physical properties. Novel compounds with decreased structural distortions and atomically ordered local arrangements synthesized by design with concomitant properties measurements will provide a basis for understanding the competing roles of interactions which determine stability and physical behavior. This work will develop new synthesis tools and measurement techniques for materials exhibiting several coexisting characteristics, and provide highly accurate data for development of theoretical insights in terms fundamental interactions. The project's impact derives from the increased understanding it will promote on the organization and control of matter at the atomic scale that will lead to future application of perovskites in all-oxide multifunctional magnetic/dielectric/electronic devices. This project will provide also a unique opportunity for training undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and visitors by involvement in cutting-edge research on a wide area of solid state chemistry and physics of advanced oxides.</AbstractNarration>
