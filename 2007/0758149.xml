    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is for a four day workshop to be held in 2008 at Hampshire College, entitled Advancing Theoretical Physics Research at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions. The workshop fosters theoretical physics research by faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI). Its activities center on scientific exchange, learning more about "how PUI research works," and&lt;br/&gt;connecting with other theorists effectively. Additional sessions will provide tools for faculty to manage key transition points in their careers. The workshop brings junior and senior physicists together for the exchange of ideas. The broader implication is that this workshop will help faculty at PUIs to maintain their research which will involve undergraduate students. Having active research at PUIs improves the training of undergraduates. On the other side improving the possibilities of faculty to be able to maintain an active research program at a PUI will allow for research oriented persons to be more inclined to consider jobs at PUIs. Since PUIs are crucial in the pipeline for training physicists fostering of research at PUIs is very important. Finally, keeping this avenue of employment open for research oriented physicists will help prevent the loss of well trained theorists who otherwise might be lost to science.</AbstractNarration>
