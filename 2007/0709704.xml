    <AbstractNarration>Mercury is a well-recognized pollutant that can pose a threat to the health of both humans and wildlife. Plant foliage acts to collect mercury from the atmosphere and, upon senescence, to soils. Environmental conditions that affect plant growth and function, such as elevated carbon dioxide and ozone, may therefore affect the transport of mercury through the environment. Previous work by the investigators of this project has shown that increased carbon dioxide is associated with greater soil mercury concentrations, but it is uncertain if this is due to increased inputs or decreased losses of mercury from soils. This research will examine effects of elevated carbon dioxide and ozone on mercury cycling in a temperate forest exposed to experimental free-air carbon dioxide/ozone enrichment. This study will determine total mercury (Hg) in plant biomass and soils, Hg inputs from leaf litter, throughfall and stemflow, and Hg mobility in soils. &lt;br/&gt; This study will help us to understand how plants will behave in a future atmosphere, and provide insights into the cycling of an important environmental contaminant. The study site, at University of Michigan's biological station, provides excellent opportunities for educating diverse students from across the nation in this topic. The study will also provide an opportunity for an undergraduate student to complete an independent research study associated with the project.</AbstractNarration>
