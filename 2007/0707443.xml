    <AbstractNarration>Schulze&lt;br/&gt;0707443&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns both the development of fast Kinetic&lt;br/&gt;Monte-Carlo (KMC) algorithms and their application to simulating&lt;br/&gt;nano- and micron-scale crystal growth. Viewed broadly, KMC is&lt;br/&gt;the numerical task of simulating stochastic models. While the&lt;br/&gt;focus of the project is primarily on crystal growth, KMC&lt;br/&gt;simulations arise in many contexts, including micro-magnetics,&lt;br/&gt;ecology, and chemical processes. The algorithms that are&lt;br/&gt;developed are applicable to all such models. In this work,&lt;br/&gt;however, two new algorithms with single event execution times&lt;br/&gt;independent of the system size are used to examine dendritic&lt;br/&gt;growth during solidification. Dendritic growth refers to a&lt;br/&gt;common interfacial instability that occurs during the formation&lt;br/&gt;of solid materials -- snow flakes being a familiar example. &lt;br/&gt;These instabilities have a number of practical implications for&lt;br/&gt;materials processing and are also of fundamental scientific&lt;br/&gt;interest. Dendrites that form in both pure and composite&lt;br/&gt;materials are studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns the development of computer programs that&lt;br/&gt;simulate the behavior of solid materials on length scales that&lt;br/&gt;are so small that individual atoms are resolved. It therefore&lt;br/&gt;has direct impact on the area of nanotechnology, which is rapidly&lt;br/&gt;emerging as an area of national strategic interest. The programs&lt;br/&gt;that arew developed are the most efficient of all known ways for&lt;br/&gt;performing this particular type of simulation. These simulations&lt;br/&gt;simulate the growth and evolution of solid phase materials by&lt;br/&gt;imitating the random motion of individual atoms using millions of&lt;br/&gt;random numbers, which themselves are generated by a separate&lt;br/&gt;computer program. A particular type of solid phase growth from a&lt;br/&gt;liquid material that gives rise to a snow-flake like crystal&lt;br/&gt;structure is a principal area of study, but the computer programs&lt;br/&gt;themselves are designed in a way that also makes them useful in a&lt;br/&gt;much broader class of problems. Students are involved in the&lt;br/&gt;project.</AbstractNarration>
