    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: DMS - 0709232 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Silber, Mary&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Bifurcation theory and delay equations: applications to controlling pattern formation and modeling protein translation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research addresses two applications of bifurcation theory&lt;br/&gt;and delay differential equations: (1) autoadjusting feedback control&lt;br/&gt;of oscillatory patterns, and (2) mathematical modeling of cellular&lt;br/&gt;protein translation. The proposed research on controlling patterns&lt;br/&gt;investigates an autoadjusting feedback control scheme aimed at&lt;br/&gt;stabilizing oscillatory patterned-states. The feedback control method&lt;br/&gt;exploits symmetries of the targeted pattern in such a way that it&lt;br/&gt;becomes noninvasive when control is achieved. Two related case studies&lt;br/&gt;will be pursued: (A) stabilization of traveling plane wave solutions&lt;br/&gt;of the two-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in the&lt;br/&gt;Benjamin-Feir unstable regime, and (B) control of chemical traveling&lt;br/&gt;wave patterns of the photo-sensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction in&lt;br/&gt;the oscillatory regime. The mathematical relationship between these&lt;br/&gt;two case studies will be elucidated by the proposed analysis. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research on mathematical modeling of protein translation is&lt;br/&gt;aimed at deriving, by systematic approximation, a delay equation model of&lt;br/&gt;protein translation that could then be used as a component in simple&lt;br/&gt;models of synthetic gene networks involving more than one protein. The&lt;br/&gt;delay model is obtained from a continuum description of the elongation&lt;br/&gt;process, which ultimately shows up as a delay time in the reduced&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model. The proposed research will extend the model to&lt;br/&gt;incorporate the degradation of mRNA. The fidelity of the delay model&lt;br/&gt;to the mechanistic one, in the case of simple gene switches and&lt;br/&gt;oscillators will then be investigated using bifurcation theory, aided&lt;br/&gt;by a numerical continuation package that was developed for delay&lt;br/&gt;differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will contribute to the training of graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary, applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics research. It will aid the development of feedback control&lt;br/&gt;schemes for eliminating spatio-temporal chaos in chemical&lt;br/&gt;reaction-diffusion systems, as well as other pattern-forming systems.&lt;br/&gt;Delay differential equations frequently arise in the modeling of&lt;br/&gt;biological processes, such as cellular protein translation, the&lt;br/&gt;process whereby ribosomes assemble proteins, one amino acid at a time,&lt;br/&gt;using the information encoded in the messenger RNA (mRNA). The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will contribute to the development of a systematic&lt;br/&gt;mathematical framework for deriving reduced delay models from complex,&lt;br/&gt;biologically-detailed mechanistic models. The proposed projects&lt;br/&gt;represent important applications of delay differential equations and&lt;br/&gt;their analysis using bifurcation theory. The analysis of these&lt;br/&gt;proposed case studies are essential to the development of these&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and computational tools.</AbstractNarration>
