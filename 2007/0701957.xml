    <AbstractNarration>P0701957&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Static and Dynamic Techniques for Classifying, Locating, and Fixing Bugs &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Susan Horwitz and Ben Liblit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Testing and debugging are vital but notoriously difficult parts of the software-development process. Languages like C and C++, with weak type systems, exacerbate the problem by making it easy for programmers to introduce memory- and type-safety bugs. These bugs are hard to identify because the actual error and the symptom often seem to have no logical connection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating innovative new ways to identify, reproduce, and eliminate bugs. Questions addressed include: How to determine whether a program failure is due to a memory/type-safety bug, and in that case how to locate the buggy code (not just the code where the symptom occurs); given a failure that is not due to a memory/type-safety bug, how to reproduce that failure, and how to find the source of the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most creative aspects of the work is the combination of complementary techniques to achieve powerful synergies: dynamic memory type inference is combined with static program slicing to attack memory/type-safety bugs, while program slicing is paired with statistical bug identification to implement new algorithms for finding, reproducing, and repairing other kinds of bugs.</AbstractNarration>
