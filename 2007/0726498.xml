    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a specialty conference entitled "Biogenic Hydrocarbons &amp; the Atmosphere" to be held in the early spring, in Ventura, California. The conference will be convened under the auspices of the Gordon Research Conferences. The focus will be on biogenic hydrocarbons and the atmosphere and will specifically target discussion of emerging findings on hydrocarbon biosynthesis in plants, the ecological role of hydrocarbons, and the range of hydrocarbon impacts on atmospheric processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include advancing our understanding of the influences of biogenic hydrocarbons on atmospheric composition, radiative transfer and climate. In addition, the workshop will bring together established researchers and early career scientists, providing invaluable opportunities for professional interactions in a focused and productive forum. The award will assist with covering the costs of travel and/or conference fees for approximately 16 junior scientists. In support of the Conference theme, several conference sessions will include junior scientists as oral and poster presenters.</AbstractNarration>
