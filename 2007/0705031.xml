    <AbstractNarration>SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute will convene a team of researchers to consider the way in which multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research has played a role in addressing societal challenges posed by extreme natural, technological, and human caused risks. These researchers will draft a White Paper for review by the broader earthquake engineering and hazards communities via the World Wide Web. Following further input gathered through an invitational Workshop, a final White Paper will be produced that includes recommendations designed to ensure that complex, multidisciplinary hazard issues receive attention from researchers with the skills and expertise to enable society to prepare for and recovery from future extreme events in a manner that minimizes disruption and loss.</AbstractNarration>
