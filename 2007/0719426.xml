    <AbstractNarration>Professor Gary Kinsel at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop a novel type of sample target for use in biological matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS). The research explores the use of a pulsed radio frequency (rf) plasma to deposit polymer thin films on the surface of MALDI sample targets. Surface modification aims to enable acquisition of more mass spectral information about components of complex biological mixtures by utilizing the chemical properties of the polymer films to rapidly fractionate the peptides and/or proteins prior to MALDI MS analysis. These novel sample targets are expected to have important applications in disease diagnosis, bacterial fingerprinting, biomarker screening and biomedical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research engages post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students in collaborative, interdisciplinary research. Collaborations involve application of the modified MALDI targets in cyanobacteria proteomics; novel surface-polymer grafting approaches to increase the peptide and/or protein binding capacity of the MALDI sample targets; and application of these multifunctional MALDI targets in breast cancer research.</AbstractNarration>
