    <AbstractNarration>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This conference will provide a cross-disciplinary forum to discuss the application of engineered nanomaterials in imaging, diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutic treatment of human disease. The program has been organized by a distinguished group of materials scientists representing universities, government laboratories, and private organizations. The 20 invited speakers represent a braod sampling of leading scientists in the fields of engineered nanomaterials and nanomedicine; approximately 50 contributed talks will also be included. Topics for discussion will include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Synthesis of novel nanomaterials&lt;br/&gt;. Surface functionalization and targeting strategies&lt;br/&gt;. Nanoscale drug and gene delivery systems&lt;br/&gt;. Medical imaging and contrast agents&lt;br/&gt;. Self-assembled and bio-inspired structures&lt;br/&gt;. In-vivo regenerative applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will include a tutorial intended for the materials scientist interested in collaborating with biologists and medical researchers. It will provide an overview of biotechnology and toxicology for those not familiar with these aspects of biomaterials applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: The relatively broad range of topics listed in the call for papers ensures that the conference will have a cross-disciplinary character so as to encourage broader awareness of the field among participants. The planned tutorial will serve further to broaden understanding of issues peculiar to biomaterials applications among materials scientists. The organizers intend to use the funds provided to encourage attendance by younger scientists and others who might not be able to attend without financial assistance.</AbstractNarration>
