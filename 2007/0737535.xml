    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;In this fast-changing world, it is virtually impossible to prepare engineering students for all of the problems they might encounter in their future careers. Recognizing this, ABET and other agencies have advocated that engineering programs instill in their students a recognition of the need for lifelong learning. Many institutions struggle to include lifelong learning courses and assessments in their programs. This project is developing a seminar course aimed at first-year engineering students that will instill in them a commitment to lifelong learning. Lifelong learning skills such as self-directedness, metacognition, and critical reflection are topics being included in the course. The courses are organized around a portfolio project through which students develop a vision of engineering as a profession and make a conceptual connection between mathematics and science and this vision. Students are exploring theories of learning and education and are reflecting on their own learning. Faculty development workshops to assist faculty in delivering the seminar course are also being accomplished through this project. The seminar course and workshops are being rigorously evaluated resulting in model assessment practices for lifelong learning outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
