    <AbstractNarration>This project is presenting a conference on "Connecting Children's Mathematical Thinking to Community and Family Funds of Knowledge in Elementary Mathematics Methods Courses." It is planned for Tucson, AZ, in May, 2008. It is producing three products: a conceptual framework, a research agenda, and an instructional unit for elementary mathematics methods classes. A total of 35 participants are being invited to attend, and participating faculty members are asked to bring a graduate student. The conference is scheduled for 2.5 days supplemented with significant pre-conference and post-conference activities. There is significant support from the Center for the Mathematics Education of Latino/as at the University of Arizona and from the University of Texas-Austin.</AbstractNarration>
