    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics will host the summer program Mathematics and Computing Research Experiences for Undergraduates at Iowa State University. Participants will spend eight weeks working on research projects as part of active research groups at ISU. The projects are in a variety of mathematical areas, representing the diverse research interests of the ISU Mathematics Department, including dynamical systems, matrix theory, graph theory and combinatorics, and mathematical biology; all projects utilize computational methods. Current and previous projects are described in more detail on the website www.math.iastate.edu/reu/. The REU will conclude with a symposium of student presentations; each team will also prepare a final report. It is expected that the projects will produce publishable research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to carrying out their own research, students will attend two short courses on MATLAB and LaTeX and a weekly REU Seminar, where they will hear lectures on a variety of mathematical topics and presentations related to attending graduate school. Participants will be provided a stipend, accommodation in University student housing, and some travel and meal expenses, and will have the opportunity to participate in social activities for REU students. Each year twelve students will be selected from the national pool of talented undergraduates. Women and minorities are particularly encouraged to apply and this REU will run concurrently with the ISU Program for Women in Science and Engineering summer internship program and the Iowa AGEP/Alliance program, in which students from historically black colleges come to the ISU Mathematics Department.</AbstractNarration>
