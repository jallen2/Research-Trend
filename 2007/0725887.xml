    <AbstractNarration>Objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to design a novel high-power, "high-frequency", energy-efficient fuel-cell inverter that is scalable and modular and supports bulk power generation and/or reactive and harmonic compensations. This radical high-frequency topology is based on a novel hybrid modulation scheme, next-generation SiC power devices, and nanocrystalline transformer core. The mechanism for validation is twofold: scaled experimental design for concept validation and analytical design using empirically-validated SiC device models for performance and reliability predictions at high power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional low-frequency high-power inverter needs extremely bulky, expensive, and huge-footprint-space filters and transformer. The proposed polyphase inverter eliminates the need for dc link filters and line-frequency utility transformer. Further, due to i) the unique hybrid modulation (which reduces switching loss), ii) significantly reduced core loss of the nanocrystalline transformer core, and iii) reduced on-state drop (implying lower conduction loss) and reduced device capacitance and reverse recovery (implying reduced switching loss) of SiC high voltage devices, operation of high power inverter is feasible at high efficiency even at high frequency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed inverter has applications ranging from FutureGen, FACTs, solid-state power station, distributed generation, interconnection of two subgrids operating at different frequencies, electric ship, fuel-cell APU for aerospace, to high power UPS. Results of the research will be integrated into two power courses, which are taught by the PI and taken by several students. The project will support 1 Ph.D. student and will incorporate 6 Sr. Design and undergraduate students (with</AbstractNarration>
