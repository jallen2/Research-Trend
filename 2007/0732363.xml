    <AbstractNarration>The focus on conjugated polymer and hybrid nanomaterials is timely, given the interest in nanoscale science and technology and their electro-optical applications. This symposium, to be held in conjunction with the 234th National American Chemical Society (ACS) meeting in Boston, MA, August 2007, will cover a range of materials topics which are fundamental or technological in nature. The major aims of this conference is to bring together scientists, students, researchers to report on the new debelopments in conjugated polymer materials in particular hybrid materials. These topics include: conjugated polymer synthesis, new hybrid structures and compositions, nanstructures, self-assembly and directed self assembly, structure-property relationships, photo-physical and photo-chemical characterization, thin films, and devices. Primarily, the emphasis will be on discovery of unique and synergistic interactions between the organic conjugated polymer and the inorganic-metal nanoparticle. The conference will also highlight new characterization methods of these materials as well as the design and synthesis of dendrimer, block copolymer, and amphiphilis structures. Some of the new interesting topics that have been reported recently includes: 1) energy transfer mechanism in conjugated polymers grafted to quantum dot nanoparticles, 2) colloidal nanoparticles and conjugated polymers prepared using the layer-by-layer assemblies, 3) in-situ single molecule spectroscopy characterization of conjugated polymers and nanoparticles, 4) nanparticle-dendrimers and their electropolymerization.</AbstractNarration>
