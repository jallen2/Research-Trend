    <AbstractNarration>This small business innovation research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the development&lt;br/&gt;of a novel abrasive-free recyclable copper CMP (AFCMP) recyclable process based on&lt;br/&gt;an unique patented iodine chemistry which leads to the formation of a soft, insoluble&lt;br/&gt;copper iodide layer on the surface of the copper. This layer can be gently removed by the&lt;br/&gt;polishing pad without the need for particles in the slurry (abrasive-free slurry). This&lt;br/&gt;process is in contrast to conventional CMP processes that forms a hard copper oxide layer&lt;br/&gt;(by addition of hydrogen peroxide), which require both etching chemicals and hard&lt;br/&gt;abrasives (alumina/silica) for removal. In contrast, the copper iodide layer possess nearly&lt;br/&gt;an order of magnitude less hardness, thus can be easily removed by the polymer polishing&lt;br/&gt;pad. The insoluble copper-iodide in the effluents can be removed by filtration and the&lt;br/&gt;chemicals can be recycled back for CMP polishing. &lt;br/&gt;This project will attempt successful demonstration of (i) copper polishing using abrasive-free&lt;br/&gt;CMP slurries to meet present technical requirements, (ii) compatibility of AFCMP&lt;br/&gt;slurries to next generation ultra-low k dielectrics materials, (iii) the ability to filter and&lt;br/&gt;obtain consistent performances with the filtrate slurries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid integration of low k interconnects and AFCMP is expected to lead to&lt;br/&gt;substantial profits and energy savings. Environmental friendly manufacturing, and&lt;br/&gt;increase in hi-tech jobs. US will be a leader in copper low k CMP technology; and US&lt;br/&gt;based semiconductor companies will have a local slurry supplier. Ensure US leadership&lt;br/&gt;in nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
