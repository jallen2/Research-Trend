    <AbstractNarration>The subject of this proposal is research in the area of congruences, or&lt;br/&gt;p-adic analysis, related to modular forms. The research area of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal combines and provides links between highly abstract and&lt;br/&gt;fundamental objects such as the Eigencurve recently discovered by Mazur&lt;br/&gt;and Coleman, which describes all the two-dimensional Galois&lt;br/&gt;representations in p-adic families, and various elementary number&lt;br/&gt;theoretic objects such as the partition function recently investigated&lt;br/&gt;using the methods of the p-adic theory of modular forms by Ono and&lt;br/&gt;Ahlgren. Some open problems in this area are fairly new. In particular, in&lt;br/&gt;a recently published book "The Web of Modularity: Arithmetic of the&lt;br/&gt;Coefficients of Modular Forms and q-Series" Ono provides many new insights&lt;br/&gt;and results along with a variety of open problems. There are also&lt;br/&gt;long-standing conjectures, for example, those formulated by Atkin almost&lt;br/&gt;four decades ago pertaining to certain congruences for the Fourier&lt;br/&gt;coefficients of the modular invariant. Sometimes the p-adic setting sheds&lt;br/&gt;a new light on questions which come from the complex-analytic theory of&lt;br/&gt;modular forms (e.g., a question about connections between Borcherds and&lt;br/&gt;Shimura maps). This proposal consists of several distinct projects that&lt;br/&gt;address problems of these kinds. These projects are at present in different &lt;br/&gt;stages of development. In all cases the principal investigator has already &lt;br/&gt;obtained certain results, and there are reasons to expect further progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partly motivated by congruences found by Ramanujan and pioneered in works&lt;br/&gt;of Atkin, Serre, and Swinnerton-Dyer, this area of research has steadily&lt;br/&gt;produced significant results during the last forty years. Many important&lt;br/&gt;achievements in theoretical and applied number theory in the last few decades, &lt;br/&gt;including the celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and elliptic curve &lt;br/&gt;cryptography, are closely related to this area of research. Results from this &lt;br/&gt;kind of number theory find their applications in various areas of mathematics &lt;br/&gt;such as elliptic genera, arithmetic geometry, finite fields, as well as certain &lt;br/&gt;areas of contemporary physics such as mirror symmetry, conformal invariance &lt;br/&gt;and string theory. Sometimes the applications and connections are discovered &lt;br/&gt;years after a result is obtained. Therefore, although no results of this scope or &lt;br/&gt;specific connections to other fields are claimed in this proposal, contributions to&lt;br/&gt;this area of research may well have future applications.</AbstractNarration>
