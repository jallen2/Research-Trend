    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore ballistic spin and valley transport in clean, two-dimensional (2D) carrier systems in modulation-doped semiconductors. The approach is to fabricate and study a number of devices that can demonstrate the injection, filtering, and detection of spin and/or valley currents. The devices will be based on two different carrier systems: (1) GaAs holes which possess a strong and tunable spin-orbit interaction, and (2) AlAs electrons which, thanks to their large effective g-factor, can be spin-polarized with a modest magnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt; The project will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the ballistic and phase coherent transport in semiconductor structures. Such knowledge is essential for advancements in the emerging fields of spintronics and quantum computing. It can also lead to the development of unforeseen device concepts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The impact of the project will be seen in the scientific community and beyond. Results of the research will be communicated through publications and conference presentations to the specialized as well as general science and engineering communities. Progress in this area will benefit society in the long term as it may lead to novel electronic devices and information processing systems. Importantly, the project incorporates a high quality and comprehensive educational component and will result in the training of students, including those from underrepresented groups in critical, state-of-the art areas of science and technology. Outreach will include participation in various K-12 teacher training programs in electricity and magnetism, general areas that are linked to the topic of this proposal.</AbstractNarration>
