    <AbstractNarration>The edge of the internet continues to grow rapidly over the wireless medium. Sustaining this growth rate &lt;br/&gt;is not trivial. The vagaries of the wireless channel, in conjunction with the distributed nature of large scale &lt;br/&gt;networks, raises diverse challenges in capacity, scalability, reliability, and security. Every new opportunity &lt;br/&gt;has to be maximally exploited to cope with the escalating end-user demands. Emerging antenna capabilities &lt;br/&gt;offer one such opportunity. Crucial advances have been made in antenna systems, as well as in the wireless &lt;br/&gt;protocol design community. Early evidence shows that significant end to end performance benefits can be &lt;br/&gt;extracted by effectively integrating antenna-awareness into the network protocol stack. However, such inte- &lt;br/&gt;gration is not trivial, and entails a rich set of research challenges. This project, named Spotlight, is oriented &lt;br/&gt;to achieve this goal, through theory, protocols, and a prototype demonstration. Instead of attempting all- &lt;br/&gt;encompassing solutions, the project categorically targets wireless mesh network architectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spotlight takes an active step towards integrating independent innovations from diverse research disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, it brings the two communities of antenna systems and wireless networking closer to each other. &lt;br/&gt;Research results is being disseminated through technical publications, seminars, and tutorials. Moreover, the &lt;br/&gt;project is committed to tightly integrate research and educational plans. Techniques from Electrical Engi- &lt;br/&gt;neering is being unified with algorithms from Computer Science, and presented in new courses for graduates &lt;br/&gt;as well as undergraduates. Hands on experiences are integral components of these courses, enabling stu- &lt;br/&gt;dents to appreciate the translation of theory to real life systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Romit Roy Choudhury&lt;br/&gt;ECE, Duke University</AbstractNarration>
