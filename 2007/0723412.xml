    <AbstractNarration>The investigators plan to use a mixed-methods design to test the hypothesis that key approaches to high school reform grease the mathematics and science pipelines for all students in reforming high schools. This study is intended to contribute significantly to the current research, policy, and practices focused on graduating high school students who are prepared for the demands of post-secondary education and the global economy. This study is intended to provide understanding of pipeline progression in reforming high schools and the strategies successful schools employ to ensure timely pipeline progress for all students, particularly those historically underrepresented and underserved in mathematics and science and post-secondary education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research would examine the effects on pipeline progression in math and science of several different high school reform efforts in North Carolina. The reforms include partnership schools, high school models, and schools that are undertaking their own conversion efforts. This project uses a statewide administrative data set, along with surveys about school practices and some site visits to help untangle school factors that help some schools keep students in the pipeline. The dependent variable is ""in the pipeline and showing mastery"" as demonstrated by end of course exams. The investigators are measuring whether schools that are successful in getting students through a course called Algebra provide rigorous courses or not.</AbstractNarration>
