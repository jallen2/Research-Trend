    <AbstractNarration>0709025&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRI:MISER: A High-performance, Power-aware Cluster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kirk Cameron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insatiable performance demands of many critical computational science applications cannot be satisfied unless the power and energy requirements of emergent machines are reduced. High-performance, power-aware computing (HPPAC) has emerged as a promising approach to this problem. In HPPAC, power consumption is controlled by software to improve energy efficiency while meeting the performance needs of the application. The lack of power-aware cluster infrastructure of significant scale limits the type of power-aware computer science research conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This infrastructure effort is building the MISER (Management Infra-Structure for Energy Reduction) cluster, a power-aware cluster to enable and evaluate energy reduction techniques for scientific applications at scale. This proposed infrastructure will consist of at least 64 rack mounted servers, for a total of at least 256 processor cores. At a minimum each node will have several power-aware processors and power-aware disks. The operating system will be open-source Linux for system software development. Systems will be connected with a high-end interconnect. The project will also extend the existing power measurement and control infrastructure (PowerPack) to the new cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve research projects, which span twelve faculty members across four departments, will be supported by the proposed power-aware MISER cluster. The participants have a history of mentoring women and minorities through the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program (MAOP) where summer student interns participate in the project with a faculty mentor. Furthermore, the techniques will improve the energy efficiency of large scale systems, reduce waste and positively impact the environment.</AbstractNarration>
