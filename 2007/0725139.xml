    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Liam Pingree of the University of Washington (UW) as a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 academic years. Dr. Pingree's research is targeted at the development of new atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques focused on understanding organic solar cell efficiencies and lifetimes. Pingree will examine electronic properties at the nanometer scale using AFM to monitor fluctuations in mobility, charge decay rates, and variations in monochromatic efficiency. This will enable detailed studies of the relationship between the physical structure of the materials and their electronic properties. An improved understanding of these relationships could lead to significant improvements in organic solar cells. The service component of this project focuses on the education of the public on alternative energy sources. Pingree will design and carry out an educational campaign on the Seattle metro bus system in conjunction with the UW School of Art's Visual Communications and Design Program and the UW Department of Technical Communications. This campaign will focus on on-transit education while directing people to a website that provides information on more detailed topics and other educational resources at the University of Washington. The goals of the campaign are to reach individuals missed by traditional outreach programs and to improve the scientific literacy of the Seattle public. If successful, these programs could be implemented in other metro areas within the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program seeks new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.</AbstractNarration>
