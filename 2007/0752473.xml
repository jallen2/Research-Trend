    <AbstractNarration>The oxidation of Fe(II) by oxygen leads to the formation of a large family of reactive oxygen species, including the superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical. In the coastal ocean, the formation of these strong oxidants is usually considered a function of the interaction of solar radiation with common dissolved constituents of seawater. Two investigators from the University of South Carolina hypothesize the flux and cycling of Fe(II) within the mixing zone of subterranean estuaries is another important factor governing the formation and export of strong oxidants in coastal marine systems. To test their hypothesis, the scientists would determine the yield and formation rate of superxoide, hydrogen peroxide, the hydroxyl radical, and carbonate radical during the mixing of Fe(II) rich groundwater with oxygen rich seawater using the following: (1) multifactorial experimental designs to determine how those production capacities change in the laboratory as a function of a varying system of Fe(II), pH, salinity, natural organic matter, phosphate, and total carbonate ion; and (2) test the experimental outcome by characterizing the oxidant formation capacity of groundwater collected from several well described submarine estuary systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Set up a "Citizen's School for Coastal Water" to educate about 50 members of the public and teachers on water related issues in the State of South Carolina during a during a three day meeting. Two graduate and two undergraduate students would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>
