    <AbstractNarration>On-line learning promises education for the masses, that is quality educational opportunities available to all people, but especially those who are in the greatest need, although this dream is yet to be made a reality. The long term goal of the proposed work is to replicate the impact of local, on-campus programs targeting increased college preparedness and college success of minority and low income students, such as the well known Treisman Berkeley Professional Development Program, in a freely available, on-line learning environment. Making what would normally be a staff intensive program available ubiquitously at a dramatically reduced expense would be an enormous payoff. The proposed solution is to develop a technological augmentation to available human support in a lightly staffed environment. This proposed project brings together a team with expertise in both technological development and careful experimentation both in the lab and in the classroom, a track record for large scale deployment of educational materials, a solid foundation in significant results from prior work which builds on research in the areas of computer supported collaborative learning and tutorial dialogue systems. The broader impact of this project lies in the promise of accessibility to high quality educational resources for everyone.</AbstractNarration>
