    <AbstractNarration>Ying&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0731226&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this GOALI proposal is to develop a theoretical and algorithmic framework for parallel MRI imaging and to develop and enhance academic-industry collaboration in research and training of graduate students. Both theoretical and algorithmic developments and improvements are proposed which will be complemented with experimental work. The PIs propose a multifaceted approach to addresses both the excitation and reconstruction problems in an integrated and systematic way through theoretical and algorithmic developments. They propose to increase the spatial selectivity and reduce RF power deposition through the design of optimal RF pulses for parallel excitation; maximize the speed of image reconstruction by providing an optimal solution to the inverse problem; and validate the new methods with real MRI experiments on phantoms and human subjects. This project can provide fundamental results essential in the filed of MR imaging that will also have direct applicability in clinical and research cases that require fast and highly sensitive imaging. Because General Electric is a partner in the proposed research, the PIs have the necessary equipment and resources available to pursue the objectives of the proposed research plan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project can have a broad and significant impact in the fields of biomedical imaging, engineering, and medicine, and in healthcare delivery, as it will improve the fundamentals of MRI technology with immediate applications in cardiac imaging, functional brain imaging, and cancer imaging. Also, four graduate students will be involved in the research activities and they will be exposed to cutting edge imaging facilities at GE. The PIs also plan to recruit undergraduate students into the proposed research. They also plan to organize a workshop on parallel imaging to disseminate the research results.</AbstractNarration>
