    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) degree program to produce skilled graduates for the public and private sectors with these increasingly important skills. The project is working to 1) develop the M&amp;S program's criteria, qualifications, educational requirements, certification, and training standards; 2) introduce a new M&amp;S curriculum in their department; 3) develop educational modules in areas such as discrete event simulation and continuous system simulation; 4) propose a plan to implement an undergraduate M&amp;S program in the Department of Electrical Engineering; 5) develop the evaluation criteria for accreditation of the M&amp;S programs for the Engineering Accreditation Board; 6) implement an externally reviewed evaluation plan; and 7) build consensus for broader acceptability of the developed program and suggested curriculum. Evaluation efforts, with significant input from an outside evaluator and a broad-based advisory board, are ensuring that the qualification and education requirements meet industry's needs and accreditation criteria and that the instructional materials are effective. They are posting their material on a website and publishing and presenting it through the standard engineering education and modeling and simulation venues. Broader impacts include the dissemination of their materials and the development of a curriculum that meets an emerging need in industry.</AbstractNarration>
