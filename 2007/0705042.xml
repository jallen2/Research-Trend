    <AbstractNarration>This project will contribute to progress in magnetic device technology by developing a fundamental scientific understanding of an electrochemical process for the synthesis of hard magnetic Co-rich Co-Pt alloy films, micro- and nanostructures. The research work will concentrate on growth phenomena at the substrate/electrolyte interface, the formation of microstructure, and the correlation between microstructure and magnetic properties in these materials. Particular attention will be devoted to the possibility that enhanced ad-atom dynamics at electrolyte interfaces might enable the synthesis of partly ordered structures at relatively low temperatures; the attendant implications on the possibility to grow oriented L10 equiatomic alloys (Co-Pt or Fe-Pt) by electrochemical methods will be explored. Magnetic properties of films and nanostructures will be investigated in detail, in view of possible applications of these materials in magnetic recording or as magnetic components in micro-electromechanical systems. Processing issues as they relate to these applications will be addressed. The intellectual merit of this work is in the development of a comprehensive scientific understanding of growth phenomena determining the microstructure and magnetic properties of Co-Pt electroplated alloys. Chemical, electrochemical and solid state phenomena leading to film growth will be addressed, and the resulting insight will be applied to improve the process at hand as well as to promote a better scientific understanding of electrochemical crystallization phenomena in general. In parallel, a detailed investigation of microstructure and magnetic properties will provide fundamental insight on the origin of the magnetic properties in Co-Pt films and structure, and on their behavior across different length scales. NON-TECHNICAL: Critical advancements in magnetic device technology will be made possible by the availability of simple and reliable processes for the micro-fabrication of hard magnetic materials. Successful development of a reliable process for the synthesis and micro-fabrication of hard magnetic materials would trigger critical advances in magnetic devices. Technology transfer will be facilitated through graduate internships and through the formation of students with experience and skills in electrochemical processing. Undergraduate internships in PI's laboratories, graduate internship in high-tech companies, and laboratory experiences in undergraduate courses, focused on electrochemical synthesis, will provide a series of activities to spread and promote knowledge and interest in electrochemistry and electrochemical processing, as well as generate expertise in the subject. The understanding of growth phenomena of the Co-Pt alloy system will provide the basis and stimulate the development of a scientific understanding of electrochemical growth processes in general. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in courses and in internships will develop an appreciation for the power and reach of electrochemical processes and phenomena, and will acquire uncommon but often required skills, useful in the high-tech job market.</AbstractNarration>
