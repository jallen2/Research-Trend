    <AbstractNarration>AST-0708154/0708087&lt;br/&gt;Kravtsov/Gnedin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding galaxy formation is one of the most important and challenging problems in modern cosmology. In particular, star formation is perhaps the worst understood and least developed ingredients of modern cosmological simulations. This collaborative project, led by Dr Kravtsov, aims to reduce greatly the uncertainty in the physics of galaxy formation by developing new, observationally motivated models for the formation of stars and star clusters. Recent advances in numerical algorithms and computing power mean that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations can now resolve the actual sites of star formation in the interstellar medium, making it possible to track the formation and destruction of giant molecular clouds self-consistently. The planned suite of ultra high-resolution N-body and gas dynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations will incorporate an unprecedented wealth of physical processes, including the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust and its self-shielding from ambient ultraviolet radiation, and self-consistent three-dimensional continuum radiative transfer. On smaller unresolved scales, the simulations will incorporate star formation recipes based on reliable empirical correlations. The planned research will study the molecular content of high-redshift galaxies, develop star formation prescriptions consistent with the observational correlations, and study star formation in different galactic environments. It will address the formation and evolution of massive star clusters, for which abundant observational data exist, and investigate the dependence of cluster formation efficiency on properties of the host galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is unique in its ability to bridge the large scales of galaxy formation and the small scales of star formation, thus developing links between those two research communities. By involving students, the work provides professional training of young computational cosmologists in cutting-edge simulation techniques. The results provide support for current and forthcoming space- and ground-based observing programs. The research results are tightly integrated into academic teaching, and public education and outreach activities. Three-dimensional visualizations of the simulations will be available for planetarium shows and public lectures, and also web-accessible.</AbstractNarration>
