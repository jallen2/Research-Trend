    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This study examines the impact of the European Court of Justice- the best case of&lt;br/&gt;powerful supranational justice- on the health services of Western Europe- the best cases&lt;br/&gt;of welfare states, politically salient and deeply wedded to their domestic order. Since&lt;br/&gt;1998, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the top court of the European Union (EU) and&lt;br/&gt;"the most effective supranational body in the history of the world" (Stone Sweet&lt;br/&gt;2005:108), has begun to incorporate health and social security into the liberalizing EU&lt;br/&gt;single market. Existing studies have focused on explaining this case of European&lt;br/&gt;integration and on doing preliminary maps of power and responsibility in EU health care&lt;br/&gt;policy. This project goes beyond those studies and takes this development as a case of the&lt;br/&gt;impact of supranational justice on policy and implementation. It asks (1) what variance is&lt;br/&gt;there in the concrete policy responses of EU member states to the decisions of the ECJ on&lt;br/&gt;cross-border mobility of patients and labor regulation? And 2) what explains the variation&lt;br/&gt;in EU member state responses to the developing EU law?&lt;br/&gt;Answering the first question requires research to identify what "compliance"&lt;br/&gt;means to governments in different states and how much of it there has been. This&lt;br/&gt;involves governments' interpretation not just of EU law but of the likely actions of the&lt;br/&gt;domestic courts that interpret and apply most EU law. For the second question, there are&lt;br/&gt;two clear hypotheses derived from the literature on the impact of judicial decisions on&lt;br/&gt;society. One is a political hypothesis, that the success of judicial decisions is a function of&lt;br/&gt;the existing "support structure"- that decisions, without interest groups who will support&lt;br/&gt;and take advantage of implementation, will have very limited impact. The other is&lt;br/&gt;institutional, drawn from the literature on "Europeanization". It identifies the problem as&lt;br/&gt;a goodness-of-fit problem; states will comply faster and better with decisions that require&lt;br/&gt;less change to existing institutions.&lt;br/&gt;The study will be conducted with legal elite-level interviews and legal&lt;br/&gt;documentary analysis in Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The countries&lt;br/&gt;have been selected because they represent a range of relevant variables- legal systems,&lt;br/&gt;health systems, bureaucracies, and historic relations with EU law and policy. This plays&lt;br/&gt;to the strengths of qualitative case studies in a situation with many hypotheses and few&lt;br/&gt;reliable indicators. Policymakers' perceptions of their legal powers and constraints are&lt;br/&gt;crucial, and best accessed through interviews and research in the relevant law.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal lies in its approach to the issue of&lt;br/&gt;judicialization in the EU and beyond. For the EU, it contributes to the analysis both of the&lt;br/&gt;rising power of the ECJ and of its actual impact- an impact that includes both extended&lt;br/&gt;EU powers over the welfare state, and the potential legitimation or delegitimation of the&lt;br/&gt;European project. More broadly, it should contribute to the small literature on the&lt;br/&gt;important relationship between courts and bureaucracies, identifying the effects of courts&lt;br/&gt;on implementers. The broader impact will come in two ways. First, European Union&lt;br/&gt;law and the welfare state is an important topic with ample potential to engage in&lt;br/&gt;contemporary European debates. Second, the project incorporates student research from&lt;br/&gt;the undergraduate to doctoral level, exposing students to sociolegal research and&lt;br/&gt;European politics.</AbstractNarration>
