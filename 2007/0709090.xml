    <AbstractNarration>Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Teams (NIRT)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GATED TRANSPORT THROUGH CARBON NANOTUBE MEMBRANES &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our interdisciplinary team will use a combination of experimental and simulation tools to conduct a study that would greatly improve our understanding of the nature and control of molecular transport through carbon nanotubes. Our project will explore the following two broad topics:&lt;br/&gt;. Fundamentals of molecular interactions with CNTs and the effects of spatial confinement on the molecular structure, dynamics and transport.&lt;br/&gt;. Active regulation and control of molecular selectivity and transport through carbon nanotubes using highly specific DNA-based molecular gating.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will broaden and enhance the fundamental science of nanofluidics. We will not only investigate the effect of confinement that has implications for understanding ionic and water transport in living cells, but also lay the foundation for the development of membrane-based transformational technologies. The newly discovered phenomenon of fast transport through carbon nanotubes will be exploited to enable improvements in the performance of membranes for desalination, gas separation as well as other applications such as protective gear and drug delivery.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt; Beyond the training of graduate and undergraduate students on nano-bio-fluidics and the strengthening the course curricula at the partner institutions, we will design and implement co-taught graduate level courses. We will also place special emphasis on the recruitment of minority and underrepresented students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main research and educational theme of this work is: Active Nanostructures.</AbstractNarration>
