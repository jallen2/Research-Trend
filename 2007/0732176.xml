    <AbstractNarration>The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL) will develop and implement a comprehensive data management strategy for Phase III of the Western Arctic Shelf Basin Interactions (SBI) Project in cooperation with the SBI Project Office (SBI-PO), the investigators who will provide datasets and information, as well as other collaborating projects. An integrated data management activity will ensure that a complete database is provided with easy access by all project investigators and the science community in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SBI Project continues to focus on the understanding of physical and biogeochemical modifications of the ecosystem overlying North Pacific, Chukchi, and Beaufort Sea shelf and slope. This follows a very successful field campaign over the past 5 years. The project was designed as a multidisciplinary, multi-year project with many investigators and varied instrumentation to address the aforementioned objectives. Activities in SBI Phase III will focus on the integration and synthesis of Phase II measurements using models and additional data. A key objective will be to scale-up SBI observations to regional and Pan-arctic coverage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SBI data management support from EOL will help assure that data are accurate, accessible, well documented and disseminated in a timely fashion. The approach will be responsive to the needs of the investigators, but also make it clear that the participants understand what is expected of them in providing data to the archive as the synthesis and modeling phase begins. Such a collaborative effort will assure the integrity and completeness of this rich dataset. EOL will work with the investigators to gather research datasets and documentation for submission to the SBI interim archive.</AbstractNarration>
