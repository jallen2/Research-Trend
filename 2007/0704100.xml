    <AbstractNarration>CBET-0704100 King This project will provide support for the development of assistive technology for individuals with disabilities. Assistive devices will be developed by engineering students at Vanderbilt University. Design projects will be drawn from both the unique needs of specific individuals as well as from needs that span populations of individuals. End-users of the technology as well as professional engineers with expertise in assistive technology development will be involved with each project. Projects will be offered to engineering students in various academic settings, including: 1) a freshman-level Introduction to Rehabilitation Engineering course, 2) independent study, 3) summer internships and 4) a capstone senior design course. Projects will be solicited, coordinated and overseen by MAX mobility LLC, a local rehabilitation engineering research and development company and by Vanderbilt University via the PI. MAX mobility has collaborated with Vanderbilt University for several years, supporting education, research and product development activities. Some of the current projects under development or in the queue include: a transfer-friendly wheelchair, a dynamic anti-thrust seat, toileting aids for a child with severe upper limb deformities, an instrument for measuring handrim biomechanics, a caster heading control system, an adaptive wakeboarding system, an accessible baby crib and an improved hockey sled. Students will be drawn from a variety of engineering disciplines, including: biomedical, mechanical, electrical and computer. Efforts will also be made to include non-engineering students on project teams.</AbstractNarration>
