    <AbstractNarration>Stremler&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0607606&lt;br/&gt;Boyland&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0604570&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broad objectives of this work are to develop the theory&lt;br/&gt;of topological chaos and to advance the application of this&lt;br/&gt;theory to fluid stirring. The main focus is on fluid systems for&lt;br/&gt;which a unique top-level periodic orbit of pseudo-Anosov type has&lt;br/&gt;been "built in." This work is accomplished using an integrated&lt;br/&gt;program of theoretical, numerical, and experimental research. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the investigators (1) advance the rigorous&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory underlying topological chaos; (2) use the&lt;br/&gt;theory to develop an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;of mixing in several canonical fluid flows of practical interest;&lt;br/&gt;and (3) leverage these developments to advance current laminar&lt;br/&gt;mixing technology. The mathematical/theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;numerical/experimental components of this project are mutually&lt;br/&gt;supporting. The theory provides ideas and a basic framework for&lt;br/&gt;the design and analysis of fluid mixing, while the fluid&lt;br/&gt;applications provide evidence for or against the posed&lt;br/&gt;conjectures and suggest ideas for additional development of the&lt;br/&gt;theory. The intellectual merit of this work includes its&lt;br/&gt;extensions of the Thurston-Nielsen theory, its contributions to&lt;br/&gt;the fundamental understanding of fluid stirring and the role of&lt;br/&gt;topological methods in global predictions of chaos, and its&lt;br/&gt;detailed analysis of fluid systems of interest for practical&lt;br/&gt;mixing enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Laminar fluid flow systems are at the center of numerous&lt;br/&gt;major advances in medical, biological, chemical, and material&lt;br/&gt;processing applications that are important for improving human&lt;br/&gt;health, advancing scientific discovery, and maintaining national&lt;br/&gt;security. Fluid mixing is known to play a significant role in&lt;br/&gt;these applications, and mixing enhancement is most often achieved&lt;br/&gt;through efficient stirring. Further advances in laminar mixing&lt;br/&gt;enhancement are limited in part by the tools used to model,&lt;br/&gt;analyze, and predict efficient stirring in laminar flows. A&lt;br/&gt;topological method based on a deep mathematical theory due to&lt;br/&gt;Thurston and Nielsen has recently been applied to fluid stirring&lt;br/&gt;enhancement by the investigators and others with quite dramatic&lt;br/&gt;results. The mathematical theory, when properly applied,&lt;br/&gt;provides a means to "design for chaos" predictively. The broader&lt;br/&gt;impacts of this work include promoting teaching and learning at&lt;br/&gt;the undergraduate and graduate levels, seeking to broaden the&lt;br/&gt;participation of underrepresented groups in research, enhancing&lt;br/&gt;interaction between the engineering and mathematics communities,&lt;br/&gt;and benefiting society by developing the techniques for mixing&lt;br/&gt;enhancement in laminar flow.</AbstractNarration>
