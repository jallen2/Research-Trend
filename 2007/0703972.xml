    <AbstractNarration>The Computing Research Association is funded to hold an informational meeting for the NeTS research community to provide information about the NeTS-FIND programmatic area. FIND is a relatively new programmatic area within NeTS and this meeting provides an opportunity for members of the NeTS community who plan to submit to the FIND programmatic area to discuss new research directions and ideas about designing new architectures for the Future Internet as well as to ask questions about the program and discuss whether their ideas fit programmatic area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FIND initiative promises to have a long term impact on networking innovation and the NeTS vision. This meeting is important to advancing this promise by involving stakeholders early--before they submit proposals so that their work can be responsive to the solicitation. In addition NeTS program officers have the opportunity to gain input from a significant portion of the community concerning the FIND area. The webcast of the meeting will be available at www.cra.org.</AbstractNarration>
