    <AbstractNarration>Efficient Algorithms for Problems in the Next Generation of Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cliff Stein&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computers, computer systems and the computational infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;provided by the Internet are now essential for many aspects of modern&lt;br/&gt;life. It is well-known and well-documented that, even as computing&lt;br/&gt;power and network bandwidth increase at a rapid rate, the demands that&lt;br/&gt;users and applications place on these resource increase at roughly the&lt;br/&gt;same pace. Thus, no matter how much progress we make on the hardware&lt;br/&gt;and network ends, we will always need efficient algorithms to manage&lt;br/&gt;these resources. This research focuses on several algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;problems in computer systems and networks; arising both from existing&lt;br/&gt;technologies and at technologies that are evolving, or have been&lt;br/&gt;proposed. By improve the efficiency with which we manage our devices&lt;br/&gt;and infrastructure, there will be tremendous savings, both in time and&lt;br/&gt;economically. In addition, the investigator integrates theory and&lt;br/&gt;systems and encourages more collaboration between these areas, with&lt;br/&gt;obvious benefits. This work has an impact on the decisions that are&lt;br/&gt;being made presently about the next generation of the Internet, of&lt;br/&gt;routing, and of scheduling in operating systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the investigator studies four concrete problem areas:&lt;br/&gt;scheduling in operating systems -- finding schedules that are low overhead and use resources fairly; &lt;br/&gt; scheduling in the next generation of routers -- designing algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that allow packets with different levels of service to be routed&lt;br/&gt;efficiently; network coding -- designing algorithms to manage this&lt;br/&gt;exciting new routing technology, and power management -- designing&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that schedule jobs to provide good response time and to use&lt;br/&gt;power efficiently. While the details of these various areas differ,&lt;br/&gt;the overall goals are to design simple, low overhead algorithms, use&lt;br/&gt;algorithms with rigorously proved bounds and analysis, design new&lt;br/&gt;theory and transfer existing theory closer to the systems. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator also designs educational materials suitable for teaching&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to a wider audience.</AbstractNarration>
