    <AbstractNarration>This project funded by Science and Society, Biology, and the Science of Science and Innovation Policy Programs provides partial support for the 2008 Gordon Research Conference on Science and Technology Policy in Big Sky, Montana. The focus of this year's conference is "Governing Emerging Technologies." The cases addressed at the conference include nanotechnologies, synthetic biology and genetic modification, and the intersection of cogno-and neuron-technologies. Four main themes are addressed in presentations and poster sessions: 1) anticipation of the kinds of transformations these technologies may create; 2) engagement with various publics over the values that underpin work on these technologies; 3) integration of social science and humanist inquiry with scientific and technical work in these areas; and 4) implementation of a variety of governance mechanisms that cover the wide spectrum between completely laissez faire and highly interventionist approaches. An international focus is integrated into these themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference is set up to allow for much interaction among participants between formal sessions, emphasizing research communication, professionalization, and networking. It also encourages the presentation of works-in-progress to facilitate collegial interaction and advice early in the research process. Junior scholars, post-docs, and graduate students are encouraged to attend and NSF is providing significant support for this purpose.</AbstractNarration>
