    <AbstractNarration>A minimum of twenty-six students majoring in one of the geosciences will receive&lt;br/&gt;two-year scholarships of up to $10,000 annually. The amount of a student's scholarship will depend upon the Cost of Attendance and the unmet need. Eligible disciplines are atmospheric sciences, geography, geology, geophysics, and oceanography. The scholarships will be divided approximately equally among freshmen, transferring juniors and graduate students. Awards will be made to the freshmen cohort in 2008; to the juniors in 2010. Graduate student awards will be made in both years. It is anticipated that most undergraduate awards will be less than $10,000 annually because the scholars are also eligible for several State sponsored scholarship programs. Overall, it is expected that in excess of fifty-two years of scholarship support will be awarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An emphasis of the project will be on increasing the ethnic diversity in the geosciences to more nearly reflect the overall institutional diversity. Membership in learning communities and the availability of a broad range of activities and support services for the scholars will be featured.</AbstractNarration>
