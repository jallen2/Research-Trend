    <AbstractNarration>Kriegsmann&lt;br/&gt;0708065&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator models and analyzes two classes of physical&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in ceramic processing by microwave and ohmic&lt;br/&gt;heating. These problems give rise to challenging nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;initial boundary value problems, the mathematical statements of&lt;br/&gt;which involve one or more nonlinear parabolic equations,&lt;br/&gt;governing the diffusion of heat and the diffusion of a chemical&lt;br/&gt;concentration, the time harmonic version of Maxwell's equations,&lt;br/&gt;and in the case of ohmic heating, a nonlinear potential problem. &lt;br/&gt;These equations are coupled together in a nonlinear fashion and,&lt;br/&gt;in addition, nonlinear heat balances are required in certain&lt;br/&gt;applications where surface temperatures produce significant&lt;br/&gt;thermal radiation. The investigator develops and uses asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;methods, dictated by certain physical limits, to mathematically&lt;br/&gt;model these physical problems. These models are analyzed, using&lt;br/&gt;both analytical and numerical methods, to obtain accurate&lt;br/&gt;descriptions of the processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The rapid heating of ceramics by microwave and other forms&lt;br/&gt;of electrical energy is the basis of several emerging industrial&lt;br/&gt;processes such as sintering, fiber coating, joining, and chemical&lt;br/&gt;vapor infiltration. These processes may be capable of efficiently&lt;br/&gt;producing high quality materials for use in high temperature&lt;br/&gt;applications, such as heat exchangers, combustion liners, pump&lt;br/&gt;seals, and rocket nozzles. The development and exploitation of&lt;br/&gt;these promising technologies remain hindered by the basic physics&lt;br/&gt;of the process. The first problem is the occurrence of&lt;br/&gt;nonuniform heating, which causes the deleterious effect of&lt;br/&gt;nonuniform material properties. The second, in the case of&lt;br/&gt;microwave heating, is the catastrophic phenomenon of thermal&lt;br/&gt;runaway, in which a slight change of power causes the temperature&lt;br/&gt;to increase rapidly to the melting point of the ceramic. It is&lt;br/&gt;the understanding, control, and use of these phenomena and the&lt;br/&gt;development of accurate and efficient mathematical tools to&lt;br/&gt;quantify them that is addressed by the investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;students.</AbstractNarration>
