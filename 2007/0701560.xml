    <AbstractNarration>NSF Proposal 0701560&lt;br/&gt;M. Bakir &amp; J. Meindl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop the interconnect networks needed to enable a three-dimensional integrated gigascale system-on-a-chip. The approach is to perform experimental research and derive physical models to define the limits and opportunities of fully compatible electrical, optical, and fluidic (or trimodal) input/output and trimodal through-wafer interconnects. The overarching strategy of the research is to extend and utilize silicon wafer-level batch fabrication technology, the key to the success of silicon technology, to the development of the trimodal interconnect networks. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to transcend current silicon ancillary technologies and thinking through high-risk and high-payoff research in the area of interconnect technologies for power delivery, high input/output bandwidth, and heat removal and to enable the most compact and highest performance three-dimensional gigascale system. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact resulting from this highly-interdisciplinary research will be the enabling of the semiconductor industry to greatly exceed the heat removal, input/output bandwidth, and power delivery metrics for high performance chips at the 14 nm node (year 2020) as projected by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. The input/output interconnect technologies will be based on simple and affordable fabrication processes thereby making them accessible to a much wider range of researchers and small companies around the world. As a node within the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network program, we plan to bring and expose high-school students and minorities to results from this research as we have done in the past to encourage them to pursue science and engineering</AbstractNarration>
