    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarships for 16 -18 academically gifted, low-income students to more fully participate in an enrichment program called Project SUPER (Science for Undergraduates: A Program for Excellence in Research) at Douglass Residential College, the women's college at Rutgers University. Project SUPER provides orientation, mentors, career development services, as well as research internships and job shadowing programs throughout the students' undergraduate career. The Douglass Project at Rutgers University was cited as a model program by the National Research Council, and NSF recognized the program with the 1999 White House Prescience Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. There is strong involvement of faculty with the students in this project. The program serves a large percentage of underrepresented minority women with financial need. Approximately 30 % of the financially needy Project SUPER students are African American; 30% are Asian (largely from India and Pakistan), and 13% are Hispanic. The scholarships will help low-income students who have not had enough free time available to participate in research experiences as part of their Project Super experience by reducing their need for outside employment. In summary, Project SUPER* is providing mentors and successful role models; leadership opportunities through research; and an academic and social support system to help low-income women feel comfortable with intellectual exploration in the STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
