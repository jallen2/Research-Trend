    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is improving the quality of science education provided to undergraduate transfer students enrolled in the majors' biology series. Guided-inquiry, problem-based learning activities and interactive computer simulations with reflective writing exercises are being implemented during lecture. Appropriate case studies including multimedia cases from the Case It! Website are presented to students working in small groups. Students are engaged in meaningful "active learning" during lecture as opposed to the passive learning of listening to lecture and taking notes. Mathematical problems with biological applications are built into lecture and lab. Several computer simulations from SimBioticTM Software are used, and STELLA modeling software allows integration of wet labs, quantitative analysis and computer modeling. More sophisticated molecular biology labs are being added to the curriculum. New case studies and new STELLA modules are being designed, written and integrated into the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected student outcomes include. 1) demonstration of scientific literacy, including implementation of experimental design, 2) improved attitudes toward learning science, 3) increased retention of biological concepts, 4) increased ability to apply mathematics to address biological issues, 5) greater comprehension and skills with regard to molecular biology techniques, 6) awareness of the connections between biology and mathematics, 7) confidence with mathematics, modeling and computer use, and 8) awareness of the personal and professional usefulness of mathematics and modeling. The expected outcomes are being assessed over a three year period through quarterly formative evaluations and a summative evaluation performed by an external evaluator.</AbstractNarration>
