    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to plan and hold a two-day workshop&lt;br/&gt;involving representatives from academia, industry, and government to&lt;br/&gt;discuss the feasibility of developing a center-based partnership&lt;br/&gt;between industry and academia in the area of human language technology&lt;br/&gt;(HLT). Although currently this research area does not have such a&lt;br/&gt;center, given the success story of Linguistics Data Consortium and the&lt;br/&gt;fact that there are many potential industrial partners, the time is&lt;br/&gt;ripe to build a better understanding of how to create a center that is&lt;br/&gt;not only mutually beneficial, but supports work that simply could not&lt;br/&gt;be done by either partner alone. Such collaboration would be&lt;br/&gt;important for stimulating research excellence at the university while&lt;br/&gt;enhancing the quality of the intellectual property of US HLT&lt;br/&gt;companies. The participants are meeting to develop a strategic plan&lt;br/&gt;for building a mutually beneficial research center. Generally center&lt;br/&gt;vehicles at NSF require strong commitments from industry. This&lt;br/&gt;workshop will focus on evaluating the feasibility of building&lt;br/&gt;partnerships for two of these programs: Industry/University&lt;br/&gt;Cooperative Research Centers and Engineering Research Centers:&lt;br/&gt;Partnerships in Transforming Research, Education and Technology. The&lt;br/&gt;intellectual merit of the proposed activity is specific to the&lt;br/&gt;planning of the workshop. The broader impacts of such a center would&lt;br/&gt;be to stimulate HLT research at the university, while enhancing the&lt;br/&gt;intellectual property of industrial affiliates.</AbstractNarration>
