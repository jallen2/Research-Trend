    <AbstractNarration>We are planning two workshops in the area of Ergodic theory and Related Fields. For these two workshops we anticipate the major talks and lectures or mini courses to be given on the recent breakthroughs on the pointwise convergence of ergodic averages along subsequences of integers for L1 functions. To the exception of mini courses to be given on basic ergodic themes we are trying to bring together young (graduate students, Post Doc, Assistant professors) and senior researchers during the four days of these workshops. We expect discussions between mathematicians from interconnected research areas, such as Harmonic Analysis, Ergodic theory, Probability theory and Number theory, to help further the recent progress made on these questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians from Africa and under-represented groups are being looked for and invited to attend or to speak. By the help of past workshops collaboration has been established between UNC-Chapel Hill and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in GHANA. As part of this collaboration two graduate students and the Head of KNUST mathematics Department will participate in the 2008 and 2009 workshops. The broad spectrum given by the geographical location of the invited participants (USA, France, Germany, Russia, Israel, Canada, and Africa) adds visibility to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It also helps disseminate the results presented or discussed at these workshops. Finally we expect the proceedings of these workshops to be published by Contemporary Mathematics as was the case with past workshops.</AbstractNarration>
