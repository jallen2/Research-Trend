    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research program is to further our understanding of the implications of chain architecture and nanoscale particle additives on the ordering mechanism and equilibrium microstructure formation as well as the stabilization of grain boundary structures in block copolymer/nanoparticle blends. In a first part, the program will focus on the structure formation in quiescent organized block copolymer-nanoparticle blends after long-time annealing in order to establish the effect of the copolymer chain architecture on the equilibrium composite microstructure as well as to elucidate the morphology of grain boundary structures in the presence of nano-additives. In a second part, a combined optical and electron microscopy study will focus on the nucleation and growth of the domain microstructure and in particular on the implications of particle aggregation in grain boundary regions on the growth kinetics of individual copolymer grains. A complementary collaborative project will elucidate the implications of grain boundary formation 'post-organization' of the hybrid block copolymer microstructure, by engineering of model grain boundary structures from oriented block copolymer/nanoparticle composite materials and subsequent time-resolved analysis of the response of the particle distribution to the perturbation of the equilibrium morphology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of nanostructured multiphase materials is considered as one of the pillars for realizing breakthrough technological progress. In its 'R&amp;D Roadmap for Nanomaterials' a partnership of several leading chemical companies ascertains that the development of multiphase nanomaterials that capitalize on the synergism between their constituents will play key role in future technology-enabling processes. The proposed research program will advance our understanding of the structure formation in block copolymer/nanoparticle blends that will be beneficial to the development of future high performance polymer composite materials and the economically relevant field of block copolymer-based thermoplastic elastomers. The program will provide training for one graduate and several undergraduate researchers in the critical area of polymer and nanoscale materials that has been identified by the National Academies of Science and Engineering as being of key strategic relevance for securing the future innovativeness and economic strength of the US. Collaboration with the BAYER MaterialScience research center will promote the identification and exploitation of commercially relevant results and contribute to a stimulating work-environment for students.</AbstractNarration>
