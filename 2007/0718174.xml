    <AbstractNarration>SES - 0718174&lt;br/&gt;Dana Haynie&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exposure to violence (ETV) is a serious public health concern that compromises the well-being of adolescents by affecting their behavioral and psychological well-being. The proposed research is designed to advance knowledge and understanding about the developmental impact of exposure to violence in adolescence on young adult outcomes including criminal behavior, substance use, mental health outcomes, educational achievement, employment prospects, and victimization experiences. A unique focus of this study is a focus on exposure to violence that occurs in multiple contexts to determine which type(s) of exposure are most detrimental to developmental outcomes. In particular, exposure to violence is conceptualized as including both direct exposure (i.e., experiencing physical victimization) and indirect exposure (i.e., witnessing others' victimization). Three types of direct ETV are examined: street victimization, intimate partner victimization, and family victimization. Four types of indirect exposure are examined: street victimization, peer victimization, exposure to family/friend suicide, and school victimization. In addition, this research is designed to identify the mechanisms through which exposure to violence influence these domains of development. Particular attention is given to the role of precocious transitions including dropping out of school, teenage pregnancy or childbirth, and marriage, as well as adolescent role exits including suicidal behavior, running-away from home, and/or juvenile/criminal justice contact. Finally, the project will identify factors that may allow some youth to fare better or worse than others in response to violence by examining whether and how demographic factors, social resources, and prior behavior moderate the effect of exposure to violence on young adult outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these research aims, we use the rich longitudinal data collected in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolesent Health that consists of a nationally representative sample of school-aged adolescents in the U.S. that were intereviewed at three points in time: when they are aged 11-19 (Wave 1), aged 12-20 (Wave 2), and aged 18-26 in 2002 (Wave 3). A variety of statistical methods are employed to address the following research questions: 1) Does ETV in adolescence affect young adult outcomes? What are the specific young adult outcomes that are affected by ETV during adolescence? 2) Does adolescents' experiences of precocious transitions in adolescence (e.g., dropping out of school, teenage pregnancy or childbirth, marriage) or role exits (e.g., suicidal behavior, running-away from home, juvenile or criminal justice institutionalization) from adolescence mediate the effect of ETV in adolescence on young adult outcomes? 3) What types of violence exposure have long-term implications for adolescent development (i.e., direct exposure vs. indirect exposure)? Does the relationship context in which violence exposure occurs (e.g., peer, romantic-partner, family, school) matter? Does the effect of ETV have additive or mulplicative effects? and 4) Are the effects of ETV moderated by structural location (e.g., gender, race, social class)? Are the effects of ETV moderated by parental practices (e.g., parental social capital, involvement, relationship quality, availability)? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing answers to these research questions, this project has potential for generating broad impact as it holds promise for developing and modifying criminological theories, for enhancing our understanding of the developmental impact of exposure to violence in adolescence, and for understanding stratification processes that shape developmental outcomes (e.g., highlight how disadvantaged youth are more likely to experience exposure to violence, precocious transitions, and poor developmental outcomes in young adulthood). In addition, the research will be able to inform policymakers on the key points in the life course where intervention may be targeted to reduce detrimental outcomes associated with exposure to violence, as well as highlight the types of exposure to violence that are most detrimental to youth and young adult well being.</AbstractNarration>
