    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Evgeny V. Dikarev, Chemistry Department, SUNY at Albany, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the development of a general approach for the preparation of heterometallic compounds incorporating bismuth and transition metals. A synthetic method based on low-temperature solid-state reactions of coordinatively unsaturated reactants that yield easily separated volatile products will be explored. Specific targets are mixed-metal carboxylates and beta-diketonates. Heterometallic paddlewheel carboxylates will be developed for application as catalysts. Heterometallic Bi-Pd(Pt) carboxylates will be explored as precursors for the preparation of activated palladium and platinum catalysts to be tested in model reactions. Heterometallic beta-diketonates and oxo-diketonates will be assembled as potential single-source precursors for the synthesis of advanced bimetallic oxide and oxofluoride materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both transition metals and the non-metal, bismuth, are known to catalyze a number of commercially important processes. This project aims at preparing compounds that incorporate both a transition metal and bismuth. These will be evaluated as catalysts that may combine the properties of both the transition metal and bismuth in a synergistic fashion. Additionally, the project offer a versatile interdisciplinary and international training for postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
