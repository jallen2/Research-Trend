    <AbstractNarration>Query Evaluation and View Materialization in Probabilistic Data&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dan Suciu (U. Washington)&lt;br/&gt;Award: IIS-0713576&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Databases and data management tools have a deterministic semantics: a data item &lt;br/&gt;either is in the data set or is not. But when data comes from multiple sources,&lt;br/&gt;or is extracted automatically, it often contains a variety of imprecisions that&lt;br/&gt;are difficult to model using the standard deterministic semantics: the same &lt;br/&gt;data item may have different representations in different sources &lt;br/&gt;and matching algorithms are imprecise; schemas differ across sources and &lt;br/&gt;schema matching tools are imprecise or incomplete or both; data at different &lt;br/&gt;sources may hold contradictory information; finally, some data, such as sensor &lt;br/&gt;data, is inherently probabilistic and hence imprecise. This project represents &lt;br/&gt;all sources of imprecision in a single uniform way, as data with a probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;semantics, and extends today''s data management tools to manage efficiently &lt;br/&gt;data with probabilistic semantics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re-designing databases to handle probabilistic data is a daunting task.&lt;br/&gt;This project studies two problems that lie at the core of probabilistic &lt;br/&gt;data management: the complexity of the query evaluation problem on &lt;br/&gt;probabilistic databases, and the view materialization problem &lt;br/&gt;(deciding whether a view can be materialized and whether it can be &lt;br/&gt;used in other query plans). The results of this research will consists &lt;br/&gt;of a range of fundamental techniques to be used in a general purpose &lt;br/&gt;probabilistic query processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits. The project makes new contributions that lie &lt;br/&gt;at the intersection of several disparate fields: logic, probability theory, &lt;br/&gt;knowledge representation, and traditional query processing and optimization. &lt;br/&gt;The project enhances the understanding of the query evaluation problem on &lt;br/&gt;probabilistic data, develops new algorithms for efficiently evaluating &lt;br/&gt;such queries and for materializing views, while leveraging existing database &lt;br/&gt;technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. Searching large information spaces (the Web; large collections&lt;br/&gt;of scientific databases; Homeland Security data) is one the new and most &lt;br/&gt;challenging frontiers in Computer Science. The innovation that is needed &lt;br/&gt;to support complex searches that scale to large and heterogeneous &lt;br/&gt;information spaces, has to come from the data management research community. &lt;br/&gt;This project makes contributions to broaden our ability to search large &lt;br/&gt;information spaces. If successful, the project will be one of the pieces&lt;br/&gt;that will help data management technology undergo a new paradigm shift, &lt;br/&gt;from supporting complex queries with deterministic semantics,&lt;br/&gt;to supporting complex explorations with probabilistic semantics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project URL:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/suciu/project-probD</AbstractNarration>
