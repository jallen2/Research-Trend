    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design and develop a very broadband and high sensitivity probe via the use of multi-thickness mode single crystal ferroelectrics; having superior electromechanical coupling coefficient. The unique design of the proposed array probe will produce the required two-octave bandwidth for operating at the subharmonic, first harmonic and second harmonic frequencies. In this project, the first harmonic transmit/receive frequency will be 4.0 MHz with corresponding subharmonic and second harmonic echoes at 2.0 MHz and 8.0 MHz, respectively. This project will develop a single crystal linear array with multi-resonance frequencies. A 16-element array will be fabricated, utilizing the "dice and fill" method that is ideally suited for the frequency regime common to medical imaging (1-10 MHz). Feasibility will be demonstrated with measurement of the temporal and spectral scattered echo returns from a fluid with microbubble-based ultrasound contrast agent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential if successful, will be a significant advancement of numerous clinical applications, such as the enhanced detection of myocardial perfusion, perfusion abnormalities of kidney parenchyma, and liver tumors. The long-term goal is to develop a single probe amenable for several diagnostic studies: adult and pediatric abdominal, breast, peripheral vascular, small parts, musculoskeletal, and cardiac (sub-sternum).</AbstractNarration>
