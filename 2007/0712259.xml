    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project focuses on development of an electronic mobility aid for the blind to prevent collision with overhanging obstacles that are not detected by standard methods such as the cane. Surprisingly, there is a conspicuous gap in the catalog of mobility aids addressing this problem. There is currently no device available that meets all the following criteria: (a)&lt;br/&gt;low cost, (b) hands-free operation, (c) small size, and (d) low cognitive demands. Uniquely, this product will incorporate algorithms to minimize cognitive demands on the visually impaired user, as well as fulfill the other criteria. Design tasks include custom circuitry for a wide-angle ultrasound emitter and receiver, low-power considerations for extended battery life, mechanical design of the circuit board and housing, and firmware for the embedded controller. Laboratory tests will determine battery life during continuous use as well as reliability in detecting thin, semi-rigid obstacles such as tree branches. An expert consultant will evaluate the ease of use for blind users and the suitability of alert sounds and controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The risk of injury from overhanging obstacles has been variously recognized, and this problem applies to all legally blind persons, of which there are more than one million in the U.S. In addition, many individuals otherwise afflicted with visual impairments (such as those with visual field restrictions) are similarly at risk, since head-height objects may be outside their field of view when focusing on the ground ahead. The proposed device is uniquely designed so that its use will require next to no effort and attention, allowing hands-free use without need for training to provide immediate benefit to blind persons of all skill levels and ages. Prototype parts cost is about twenty-five dollars, suggesting that the ultimate end product will be very affordable in comparison to existing electronic travel aids, which is of great importance for a user base whose income is often significantly reduced due to their disability. By developing an easy-to-use, affordable&lt;br/&gt;product that addresses a largely unmet need, the project will significantly improve the safety and quality of life for individuals with visual disabilities in a wide range of circumstances, such as work, school, and home, and during other daily activities.</AbstractNarration>
