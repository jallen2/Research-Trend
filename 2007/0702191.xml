    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop GaN-based biologically modified field effect transistors for detection of biomolecules with improved sensitivity, specificity, fast response, and stability. The approaches are: (1) to functionalize AlGaN surface through a self-assembled monolayer with receptors to stochastically sense the binding of target biomolecules in aqueous analytes; (2) to fabricate and characterize AlGaN/GaN heterojunction field effect transistors with optimized surface chemistry for biosensing; and (3) to develop AlGaN/GaN biosensors for model protein detection as a testbed using selected biomolecule receptors for specific binding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research includes: (1) providing fundamental understanding of impact of surface property modulation by biomolecules on two dimensional carrier concentration at the AlGaN/GaN interface; (2) providing functionalization processes of III-nitride semiconductor surfaces for attachment of receptor molecules; and (3) providing optimized designs of AlGaN/GaN heterojunction field effect transistor biosensors that are sensitive to specific biochemical interactions stably in aqueous solutions across a range of pH and salt concentrations. The proposed research will facilitate the biosensing technology that is not possible on current Si-based device technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This proposed technology will have great potentials in wide variety of applications ranging from diagnostics, system biology, to national security. Female and underrepresented minority graduate and undergraduate students will be recruited for participation of this interdisciplinary research. The outreach activities include demonstrations and lectures at local K-12 classrooms, and offering lab tours, demos, hands-on lab courses, summer internships to high school students through a "Nanobiotechnology Summer Camp".</AbstractNarration>
