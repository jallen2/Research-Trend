    <AbstractNarration>With the support of this CAREER Award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program at the National Science Foundation, Professor Bogdan Olenyuk, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona, will carry out fundamental studies aimed at the development of unique, highly specific small molecule-based regulators of gene expression capable of exploiting gene-specific and tissue-specific differences in transcriptional machinery composition. The main hypothesis behind the proposed research is that the process of transcription could be effectively controlled via a disruption of key transcription factor-coactivator interactions. Prof. Olenyuk's integrated research and education program focuses on design, synthesis and study of biological properties of the new class of small molecules which serve as potent and specific inhibitors of a contact between cysteine-histidine rich domains of the coactivator proteins and transactivation domains of transcription factors. The mechanistic details of such transcriptional inhibition will be explored at the molecular level by using tools and methods of chemical genetics. The proposed projects will yield broader impacts by creating a foundation for development of the unique genomic tools for such emerging fields as genetic medicine, nanomedicine and tissue engineering. The broad, multidisciplinary research platform will foster the development of necessary research skills and scientific knowledge for students at all levels at the fast evolving interface of chemistry and biomedical fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Olenyuk will establish an innovative approach to introduce topics in chemical biology to students from diverse backgrounds in the Tucson Public School System. Working in partnership with the University of Arizona Multicultural Affairs and Student Success (MASS) group, an educational workshop in instrumentation and methodology for the Faculty Resource Network will be launched, with the goal to improve the quality of teaching and learning at its member and affiliate institutions. As a participant in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, Professor Olenyuk will provide a collaborative research training environment to female and underrepresented minority undergraduates with the goal of fostering their aspirations to pursue scientific careers. The combined challenges of chemical and biological problems implemented as part of the education component of this CAREER program will provide an excellent educational opportunity for trainees working at the interface of chemistry and biology.</AbstractNarration>
