    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) Distributed computing has expanded in two important ways: at the level of the Internet, as web services are providing a collaborative work environment, and at the processor level, as multi-core chips are becoming the standard rather than the exception. These modes supplement the cluster of workstations interconnected by a local area network. It is now a challenge in computer science education to provide instruction at all three levels of distributed computing. This project introduces this instruction in the lower-division curriculum by developing flexible and adaptable educational materials that can be used in existing courses by instructors who themselves may not be experts in distributed computing. This project develops three modules each lasting three weeks. The multi-core module may be included at the end of CS1 or start of CS2; the cluster module may be included in CS2 or data structures; and the web services module may be included in data structures or an internet programming course. Each topic is introduced in a one-hour lecture, expanded in two or three screen-casts (about 15 minutes each) viewable outside of class after the lecture, and a one-hour lab activity. Slide presentations for instructors are developed, as are online tutorials to teach language- or tool-dependent details outside of class, educational simulations, laboratory assignments, online self-testing materials for students, testing materials for instructors, sample projects, and links to online sites that provide access to parallel computing equipment.</AbstractNarration>
