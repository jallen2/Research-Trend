    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: CBET - 0707686&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kathryn Parent &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Green Chemistry Institute (American Chemical Society)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference: Student Scholarships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding from NSF will provide scholarships for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students to participate in the 11th Annual Green Chemistry &amp; Engineering Conference, June 25-28, 2007, at the Capital Hilton in Washington, DC. The theme of the meeting is "From Small Steps to Giant Leaps Breakthrough Innovations for Sustainability". The program will include cutting-edge research in green chemistry and green engineering, and cross-cutting themes in education, making the business case, and industrial applications. Centered on the theme of breakthrough innovation, the conference will feature green chemistry and green engineering research in the following areas:&lt;br/&gt;. Energy&lt;br/&gt;. Materials&lt;br/&gt;. Systems&lt;br/&gt;. Building the Community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Topics involving fundamental scientific and engineering advances related to green chemistry will be presented by faculty and student participants. Students will have the opportunity to engage in topics not commonly encountered in traditional chemistry courses and conferences. Technical talks will be given in such areas as catalysis, process design, bio-based materials, renewable feedstocks, sustainable energy systems, alternative solvents, innovations in the pharmaceutical industry, water purification technologies, toxicology, nanotechnology, alternative synthesis, and design of safer chemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Green chemistry and engineering are important tools in preventing pollution at the source and providing solutions to global sustainability challenges. This highly interdisciplinary meeting will be an excellent opportunity for students to present their research, learn the latest developments in green chemistry and green chemical engineering, and expose themselves to the broader economic, social and political context in which these developments occur. Educating the innovators of tomorrow is a crucial part of the conference mission. Students will have an excellent opportunity to learn about the newest research developments in their areas, dialog with other academic, industrial, and governmental researchers, advance their participation in professional societies, and expand their network of professional contacts. Interaction and collaboration will generate new knowledge that will help to define our sustainable future.</AbstractNarration>
