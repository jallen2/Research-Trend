    <AbstractNarration>Datasets originating from many different real-world domains can be &lt;br/&gt;represented in the form of interaction networks in a concise and meaningful fashion. &lt;br/&gt;Examples abound, ranging from gene expression networks to social networks, &lt;br/&gt;and from the World Wide Web to protein-protein interaction networks. &lt;br/&gt;The study of these complex interaction networks, which are often evolving, &lt;br/&gt;can provide insight into their structure, properties and behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identifying the portions of the network that are changing, &lt;br/&gt;characterizing the type of change and extracting relevant patterns &lt;br/&gt;that can help predict future events and behavior are all critical &lt;br/&gt;challenges that need to be met in this context. &lt;br/&gt;To this end the PI plans to explore and design an event-driven &lt;br/&gt;methodology to study the evolutionary behavior of such interaction &lt;br/&gt;networks from the perspective of node-level and community-level &lt;br/&gt;viewpoints. Incorporating semantic information and leveraging &lt;br/&gt;graph grammars in a structured manner will also be explored in this context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main scientific outcome of this research will include the &lt;br/&gt;ability to extract, analyze and understand key patterns and features &lt;br/&gt;of such dynamic interaction networks in the context of end &lt;br/&gt;applications drawn from clinical and social settings. &lt;br/&gt;The broader outcomes of this work will be to train capable &lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of network &lt;br/&gt;analysis and data mining. Women and minorities will be especially &lt;br/&gt;encouraged to participate and existing interactions with &lt;br/&gt;a local HBCU will be strengthened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Page: http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~srini/SGER/information</AbstractNarration>
