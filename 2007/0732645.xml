    <AbstractNarration>0732645&lt;br/&gt;Ganapathiraman Ramanath &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S.-India Advanced Studies Institute for Nanoscale Science and Engineering will take place in Chennai, India from January 13-19, 2008. The organizers are Professors G. Ramanath, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York and S. Ramasamy, University of Madras, Chennai, India. Ramanath is a materials scientist and engineer at the Rensselaer Nanotechnology Center; Ramasamy is a physicist and Coordinator for the newly established Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in Chennai. The Nanoscale Advanced Studies Institute will bring together world-class senior researchers from the U.S. and India to deliver state-of-the-art lectures covering scientific, techno-logical, educational and societal aspects of nanoscience and engineering. The participants from the U.S. number about 25 and include advanced graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, early-career faculty and industry researchers. The &lt;br/&gt;Institute is organized to generate highly interactive exchanges on fundamental topics and cutting-edge developments across a broad set of nanoscience and engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity is intended to stimulate student interest in nanoscale science and engineering, strengthen the connections between the science and engineering communities in both countries, and enhance S&amp;T collaboration in areas of mutual interest as set-forth in the United States-India Science &amp; Technology Agreement of 2005. Funding for this Advanced Studies Institute is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Directorate for Engineering at the National Science Foundation and by the Government of India's Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the NSF-DST Joint Program.</AbstractNarration>
