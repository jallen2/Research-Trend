    <AbstractNarration>The Global School for Advanced Studies (GSAS) seeks to foster innovation in critical global needs areas such as renewable energy and environmental protection, and to develop US scientists and engineers with global leadership capabilities. The first GSAS includes three annual sessions on the theme of Advanced Solar Cell Research or Solar Photovoltaics. The sessions technical content focuses on the next generation of advanced solar cells, with a strong emphasis on the role of materials for improving efficiency and reducing cost The GSAS curriculum consists of two related components: ten-day GSAS Sessions and corresponding three-month to one-year Global Research Team (GRT) Fellowships. GSAS sessions include: a research planning challenge to be performed by several competing global teams of young researchers at the advanced graduate student/postdoctoral associate level (GSAS Scholars); mentoring by senior world-class experts (GSAS Fellows); advanced lectures and panels; cultural activities and facility tours; and presentation of team research plans for critical . The best research plan from each session is awarded a GRT Fellowship at a participating partner institution in Western Europe or Asia. The work is carried out in cooperation with an international executive committee and local organizing committees for each session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed GSAS addresses two key outcomes: innovative collaborative research and a cadre of young US scientists and engineers with experience in global team building and collaborative&lt;br/&gt;research planning early in their careers. The participants develop cultural sensitivity and an awareness of global research practices and infrastructures as they build lasting working relationships with their international peers and learn first-hand how cultural values can affect team dynamics. They also develop a broad "systems approach" to research and development that will help them invent competitive products for global markets. GSAS increases US leadership capacity in the short term by targeting advanced students about to enter the workforce, and in the long term by equipping these young people with the skills and relationships needed to lead global partnerships. The GSAS is a replicable, expandable model for addressing pressing research questions in other areas of global concern.</AbstractNarration>
