    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) is to develop the acquisition of a high-energy and high-resolution X-ray tomography system for the nondestructive microstructural evaluation of crack propagation and failure of engineering materials at the University of Michigan, Dearborn (UM-D). The requested system will form a fundamental infrastructure to support ongoing multidisciplinary manufacturing-related research activities, including accurate measurement of crack initiation and propagation, quality inspection or damage assessment of engineering structures, failure mechanisms related to crack growth, continuum damage mechanisms related to micro and mesoscale damage evolution, fatigue damage, and formability of engineering materials used in the automotive industry. The main objectives of these studies are to develop a nondestructive methodology capable of accurately determining the micro-structural damage evolution and/or failure mechanisms of engineering materials, to provide a critical linkage between micro/meso and macroscale damage mechanisms, and to develop innovative algorithms for damage assessment of engineering structures through the proposed measurement system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the ongoing research activities will lead to: 1) a potential breakthrough in understanding the damage evolution through failure process of engineering materials by measuring and analyzing spatial micro/mesoscale crack growth in complete and continuous loading processes without the need to unload and dissect material specimens; 2) possible coalesce of micro/mesoscale crack growth patterns and damage mechanics; and 3) an accurate way for the damage assessment and residual life prediction of engineering structures under service conditions through spatial fracture crack signatures. The proposed nondestructive measurement system will substantially strengthen the research infrastructure at UM-D and will also significantly improve the education quality at UM-D through undergraduate student design projects and research training. The community outreaching will inspire high-school students' interest in science and engineering, and broaden the participation of underrepresented black minority and female students in Dearborn and Detroit communities.</AbstractNarration>
