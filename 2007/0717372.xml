    <AbstractNarration>This study will generate an evolutionary tree for the flowering plant family Geraniaceae using multiple genes, which will enable the development of the first classification for the family based on evolutionary history. The Geraniaceae provides a model system for investigating chloroplast genome evolution, which will greatly enhance the understanding of molecular evolutionary phenomena at both the sequence and whole genome levels. The Geraniaceae comprises five genera and 800 species that are distributed broadly in temperate and tropical regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and several genera are widely cultivated as ornamentals, including the popular garden geranium. The normally conserved arrangement of genes in chloroplast DNA is highly rearranged in the Geraniaceae, and rates of DNA sequence change show considerable variation among genes and species. The first goal of this project is to construct a family-wide evolutionary tree using sequences of four chloroplast and two nuclear genes and chloroplast genome rearrangements for 110 species of Geraniaceae from all major groups within each of the five genera and from four related families. Acquisition of plant material for this investigation will involve two collecting trips to the Mediterranean and South Africa that will involve several scientists from these regions. The second goal involves sequencing entire chloroplast genomes for four species of Geraniaceae to add to the nine genomes sequenced or in progress in Dr. Jansen's lab. These data will be used to estimate relationships within the Geraniaceae, which will provide a framework for examining various evolutionary phenomena associated with their highly rearranged chloroplast genomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will also make important scientific contributions beyond the systematics and evolution of the Geraniaceae. The work will provide important new insights into mechanisms of chloroplast genome change in plants, especially since most previous studies have focused on genomes with few if any rearrangements. The results will have important implications for related fields, such as genetics and molecular biology of chloroplast genomes. Undergraduate and graduate students will be supported and trained in a wide diversity of fields, including flowering plant systematics, genomics, molecular biology, and computational biology.</AbstractNarration>
