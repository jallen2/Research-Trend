    <AbstractNarration>0730963 Probing and Manipulating Heat Transfer in Nanofluids and Nanoemulsion Fluids&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been enormous interest in using nanofluids and nanoemulsion fluids to meet new challenges in various technologies because of the observed superior thermal properties. However, the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer in these fluids are currently not well understood. There exists a great need for research to investigate the underlying physical phenomena of energy transport in these fluids. The proposed research aims to explore the fundamental relation between the macroscopic thermal properties and the microscopic structure and dynamics of nanofluids and nanoemulsions. Model nanofluid systems with controlled microstructure and dynamics will be developed. These model systems, combined with a multi-pronged experimental characterization, will be used to resolve the existing controversy in understanding the energy transport process in nanofluids and nanoemulsion fluids. A thorough understanding of physical phenomena of thermal transport in nanofluids and nanoemulsion fluids allows for the development and optimization of critically important fluids with significantly enhanced thermophysical properties.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research also seeks to integrate research and education by involving students as research partners, and by participating in outreach activities for local high school educators and students. Apart from the education and training opportunities for the students directly supported in this project, underrepresented undergraduate students will be involved in this research through the NIST Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program (www.surf.nist.gov). Additionally, hands-on demonstrations of nanofluids and nanoemulsion fluids will be given to students in an undergraduate course (ENME332). The proposed research will also utilize the outreach program ESTEEM (www.eng.umd.edu/k12/k12_summer-programs.html) to motivate high school students with hands-on experiments and real life examples, to become scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
