    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Rubenstein, Michael&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0753794 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: American Institute of Mathematics &lt;br/&gt;Title: Canadian Number Theory Association X Meeting &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Canadian Number Theory Association (CNTA) was founded in 1987 at the &lt;br/&gt;International Number Theory Conference at Laval University. The purpose &lt;br/&gt;of the CNTA is to enhance and promote learning and research in Number Theory. &lt;br/&gt;To advance these goals, the CNTA organizes major international conferences, &lt;br/&gt;with the aim of exposing students and researchers to the latest developments &lt;br/&gt;in number theory. The previous meetings have been held in Banff (1988), &lt;br/&gt;Vancouver (1989), Kingston (1991), Halifax (1994), Ottawa (1996), Winnipeg (1999), Montreal (2002), Toronto (2004), and Vancouver (2006). The tenth meeting of the CNTA is scheduled to take place on the dates July 13-18, 2008 at the University of Waterloo. The direct impact of NSF funding will be the training of a significant number of junior US researchers (junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students), who will gain the opportunity to participate in the workshop. Almost half of those who attended CNTA IX (Vancouver 2006) were American (95 people); the rest were from Canada (57), Europe (32), Asia (13), Africa (3), Australia (3), and Latin America (2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will contain 12 plenary lectures, including a talk given by the &lt;br/&gt;winner of the 2008 Ribenboim Prize (an award for distinguished research in number theory), and a lecture open to the general public. The conference will also include more than one hundred lectures in several special sessions, covering areas in algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, computational number theory, and diophantine analysis. These topics form the core of number theory, a vast subject with origins in classic greek mathematics and having important applications in a wide range of areas including cryptography, graph theory, coding theory, combinatorics, and logic, to name just a few.</AbstractNarration>
