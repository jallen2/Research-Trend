    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0749648&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nicholas Weaver &lt;br/&gt;Institution: International Computer Science Institute, University of California Berkeley &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: SGER: Architecting Effective Computer Security Grand Challenge Competitions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal summary: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Grand Challenge Competition (GCC), such as the DARPA robot grand challenge or the Ansari X Prize can energize the community, even those not currently funded, to produce research results that can have a transformative impact. It has been suggested that NSF create a GCC in the area of computer security. Working with NSF and other agencies, the PI identifies some of the difficulties attendant to such a competition on computer security, including the need to ensure the interest of the community, to develop a fair and credible rule set for judging entries, to ensure that any competition both presents an effective public face and will produce useful results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on these insights, the PI is developing rules for an initial and scaled-down competition to be held in conjunction with a few universities or at a workshop or conference. If successful, the full GCC would be designed and offered on a large scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key issue is the competition example. The PI is designing the competition based on a self-defending network, wherein the competitors would be given a reference system which their automated tools (the defense) must attempt to discover and remove vulnerabilities without human intervention.</AbstractNarration>
