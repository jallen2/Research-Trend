    <AbstractNarration>0754448&lt;br/&gt;Priestley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a fourteen month research fellowship by Dr. Rodney D. Priestley to work with Dr. Ludwik Leibler at Ecole Superieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielles in Paris, France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A supramolecular polymer is a class of polymer, in which the monomer units are assembled together by directional reversible non-covalent interactions. In the absence of the non-covalent interactions, the material behaves as a liquid. The strength of the non-covalent interactions determines key polymer parameters such as the molecular weight. The molecular recognition units that coerce the assembly are sensitive to external stimuli such as temperature, polarity, and light. Owing to this effect, supramolecular polymers are being designed as responsive ?smart? materials and self-healing materials. The systems offer many advantages over traditional (monomer units held together by covalent bonds) polymer such as ease of molding and recycling. However, supramolecular polymers have not replaced traditional polymers due to cumbersome synthetic processing methods to prepare the material and their low creep resistance. The objectives of this project are to explore new methods to produce supramolecular polymers and ways to enhance the creep resistance of the materials. The researchers are developing continuous, industrially appealing methods based on reactive extrusion to create supramolecular systems and incorporating nanofiller (e.g. nanoparticles) into the matrix to enhance creep resistance. Rheological properties of the systems are being investigated as well as the potential for the materials to be used as adhesives and responsive systems.</AbstractNarration>
