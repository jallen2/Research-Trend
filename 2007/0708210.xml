    <AbstractNarration>AST-0708210&lt;br/&gt;Churchill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a detailed study of the dynamic gaseous regions surrounding galaxies, in order to examine the combined role of intergalactic medium evolution and feedback from galaxies. Extended gaseous halos are the chemically enriched, multi-ionization phase, astrophysical laboratories harboring the physics of galaxy evolution, but existing simulations have known shortcomings, and there is a shortage of high quality data. Two complementary projects will (1) provide unprecedented detailed observational constraints on the extent, distribution, kinematics, and chemical and ionization conditions, of galactic halo gas, and (2) undertake an analysis of high-resolution simulations, both to interpret these data and to place constraints on various galaxy feedback recipes. The work will accumulate and analyze the highest quality quasar spectra and galaxy data from space and ground archives, as well as obtain additional critical data. Analysis of the simulations will create synthetic quasar absorption line spectroscopy to analyze in the same fashion as the observational data. Analysis of mock quasar spectra through cosmological simulation is a highly promising way to interpret the underlying temperature, density, and ionization structure of the halo/cosmic web interface, and the influence of galaxies on chemical enrichment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes an innovative state-wide networked science course designed to encourage under-represented students from the state of New Mexico to pursue technical careers. The class will motivate students to cross cultural barriers and encourage cultural diversity in the growing space flight industry.</AbstractNarration>
