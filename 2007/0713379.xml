    <AbstractNarration>In many problems arising in biology, social sciences and various other &lt;br/&gt;fields, it is often necessary to analyze populations of entities &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., molecules or individuals) interconnected by a network. This proposal &lt;br/&gt;intends to develop new statistical formalisms and computational methodologies&lt;br/&gt;for modeling and inference the semantic underpinnings of&lt;br/&gt;network entities, and investigate how these aspects influence &lt;br/&gt;the network topology and its temporal evolution during biological and &lt;br/&gt;sociological processes. It will also study a number of yet unexplored &lt;br/&gt;topics such as discriminative learning of network structures,&lt;br/&gt;recovering temporally evolving network sequences, and related theoretical &lt;br/&gt;issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is envisaged to help address big-picture problems &lt;br/&gt;such as: 1) Hidden Identity/Function Induction, e.g., what role(s)&lt;br/&gt;do individuals play when they interact with different peers under different&lt;br/&gt;conditions? 2) Structural/Organizational Forecast, e.g., whether and how &lt;br/&gt;changes of molecular functions lead to alterations of biological pathways? &lt;br/&gt;3) System Robustness, e.g., how a network adjusts to &lt;br/&gt;perturbations caused by exogenous intrusions? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research straddles statistical learning, social/biological sciences&lt;br/&gt;and data mining. The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in both &lt;br/&gt;the algorithmic and theoretical novelties of the methodological developments, &lt;br/&gt;and the analysis of specific social and biological networks and various other &lt;br/&gt;applications enabled by the proposed methods. The main novelties include: &lt;br/&gt;(1) new Bayesian formalisms for latent space modeling of node &lt;br/&gt;functions and network linkages, which capture the functional/behavioral &lt;br/&gt;context of network entities; (2) novel temporal extensions of exponential &lt;br/&gt;random graph model for network evolution, and inference/learning algorithms; &lt;br/&gt;(3) algorithms for reverse-engineering temporally rewiring networks from &lt;br/&gt;longitudinal node attribute data; and (4) novel discriminative learning &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for learning very-large networks from partial samples of the &lt;br/&gt;network and relevant learning theory. These methods will be applied to&lt;br/&gt;the ENRON email network to explore the behavioral patterns under various &lt;br/&gt;business operation conditions, and to analyze a longitudinal molecular &lt;br/&gt;abundance profile measured from breast cancer cells to infer (alterations of) &lt;br/&gt;networks under carcinogenic or tumor-suppressing environments. The results &lt;br/&gt;are expected to advance the principles and technologies for network analysis, &lt;br/&gt;and enable a wide-range of applications of broader interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is also expected to have broad educational and &lt;br/&gt;societal impact. As an interdisciplinary research effort, this project will &lt;br/&gt;provide rich opportunities for multi-disciplinary educational and research &lt;br/&gt;training, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. A thorough understanding &lt;br/&gt;of social network structures in human populations can have significant impact &lt;br/&gt;on important issues such as policy making or technology adoption. Knowledge of &lt;br/&gt;cellular networks and its changes in response to exogenous interventions can &lt;br/&gt;help reasoning disease causes and designing therapeutic schemes. Our methodological&lt;br/&gt;and software deliverables can potentially facilitate such studies, improve the&lt;br/&gt;cost-effectiveness of network data collection, and foster future development&lt;br/&gt;in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details of this project can be found at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/projects/network.htm</AbstractNarration>
