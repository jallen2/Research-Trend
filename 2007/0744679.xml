    <AbstractNarration>PI/PD Name: Andrew D. Robertson&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0744679&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Keystone Symposia Meetings on ?Plant Hormones and Signaling? &lt;br/&gt;and ?Plant Innate Immunity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a pair of concurrent Keystone Symposia meetings on Plant Hormones and Signaling and Plant Innate Immunity. These meetings will cover research bridging plant hormone signaling and plant disease research. With regard to the former, decades of molecular and physiological studies have demonstrated that plants rely on a diverse set of small molecule hormones to regulate every aspect of their biology. And in the case of disease, plants?like animals?activate defense, called innate immunity, upon perception of conserved microbial molecules. Plant hormonal signaling and plant innate immunity are intimately linked areas in terms of biology and yet few meetings provide venues for interdisciplinary discussion across these fields. Few plant scientists have a good grasp of both hormonal signaling and innate immunity; each field will benefit from exposure to methods and intellectual approaches used in the other. Moreover, significant cross-fertilization is anticipated by bringing the experience and intellect from one field to bear on the other. These meetings will enhance infrastructure by fostering networking and initiation of collaborations. There will be educational benefits: acquaint trainees and investigators new to field with the state-of-the-art; critical scientific feedback; and career development for trainees and new investigators, including opportunities both to see successful scientists presenting cutting-edge science and to network with prospective mentors and others who might contribute to their scientific and professional development. The two programs for these joint meetings were designed by well-recognized leaders in these fields, and the speakers are top-notch scientists who will present unpublished results. All of this ensures significant advancement of knowledge and understanding within and across these fields. Keystone Symposia provides an internationally recognized platform as well as resources to ensure the success of these paired meetings.</AbstractNarration>
