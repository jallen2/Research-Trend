    <AbstractNarration>SES - 0721126 &lt;br/&gt;Advanced Training Institutes: DRMS Research via the WWW&lt;br/&gt;Birnbaum, Michael H. &lt;br/&gt;California State University at Fullerton&lt;br/&gt;This project will train scientists on how to use the World Wide Web (WWW) to conduct research in management, decision making, and economics. The Internet allows for rapid collection of large samples of research data with minimal costs associated with printing, mailing, testing, lab space, lab assistants, and data processing. One can also use the WWW to recruit participants from diverse demographic groups or to recruit people who have special characteristics that may be rare in the population. The methods facilitate a faster pace of scientific research and improved communication among scientists. The provision of advanced training is important because many scientists received their education before these modern computer techniques were developed; this grant will provide for advanced instruction in techniques that will help scientists to be more productive.&lt;br/&gt;A board of six experts in this field will plan and present instruction at institutes with about 15 participants on three different occasions, approximately one year apart. The board will also plan some shorter sessions, to be held as one-day workshops to follow scientific meetings. These will have just two instructors and will be targeted to specific needs. We anticipate that trainees will not only be able to improve their own productivity but that many of our trainees will share these techniques with their students and colleagues. In addition, Web experiments help publicize scientific research to the general public, who are able to participate in research and communicate directly with scientists.</AbstractNarration>
