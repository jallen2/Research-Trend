    <AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Project Title: Knowledge Compilation with Fast Response &lt;br/&gt;PIs: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the development, maintenance, and &lt;br/&gt;utilization of index structures -- reduced implicate tries &lt;br/&gt;(ri-tries) -- that answer logical queries of large databases. &lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of this project are further development of ri-tries, &lt;br/&gt;identification and classification of databases for which these tries &lt;br/&gt;will be effective, and development of computer systems that implement &lt;br/&gt;ri-tries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reduced implicate trie is a data structure for storing a propositional &lt;br/&gt;database on a computer. Fast responses to queries are enabled by &lt;br/&gt;making it easy to determine consequences -- queries with yes answers -- &lt;br/&gt;of the database. Technically, once a database has been compiled into &lt;br/&gt;an ri-trie, the response time to any query is guaranteed to be linear &lt;br/&gt;in the size of the query, regardless of the size of the compiled &lt;br/&gt;database. This response time represents a trade-off between &lt;br/&gt;performance and space, since ri-tries may be large. A central focus &lt;br/&gt;of this project will be determining what types of databases lend themselves &lt;br/&gt;to ri-tries. This will be accomplished through experimentation and &lt;br/&gt;through theoretical developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prototype system that compiles logical formulas into ri-tries and &lt;br/&gt;a query processing module will be developed. Initially, the system &lt;br/&gt;will be designed for databases in conjunctive normal form; in the &lt;br/&gt;longer term, any formula from propositional logic will be acceptable &lt;br/&gt;input. The query processor will be designed to accept clauses as input, &lt;br/&gt;since a clause is the typical form for a query. Students at the University &lt;br/&gt;of New Haven and at SUNY at Albany will be active participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RUI component of this project will be extensive participation &lt;br/&gt;by undergraduates at the University of New Haven. Students will be &lt;br/&gt;introduced to the basic ideas of automated deduction and knowledge &lt;br/&gt;compilation and will work on the prototype system. The goal is to &lt;br/&gt;inspire students by engaging them in real research that contributes &lt;br/&gt;to real publications. The PI is committed to attracting talented &lt;br/&gt;young men and women into mathematics and computer science and to &lt;br/&gt;preparing them for graduate school. The University at Albany has a &lt;br/&gt;strong graduate program in computer science, and the PI at Albany &lt;br/&gt;is committed to preparing students for careers in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Web Page: http://www.cs.albany.edu/~nvm/ritries/ &lt;br/&gt;Erik Rosenthal's Web Page: http://www.newhaven.edu/show.asp?durki=1623 &lt;br/&gt;Neil Murray's Web Page: http://www.cs.albany.edu/~nvm/</AbstractNarration>
