    <AbstractNarration>This RUI award to Professor Dasan M. Thamattoor of the Chemistry Department at Colby College in Waterville, ME has as its goal the production of arc generated carbon atoms and the study of their reactions. Interesting divalent carbon intermediates (carbenes) will be generated by reactions with a variety of organic chemical substrates. More specifically, these organic substrates include alkenes, alkynes, azulene, acid chlorides, 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds and molecules with highly strained single carbon-carbon bonds. The chemistry of these intermediates and the pathways by which they are formed and consumed will be investigated experimentally and by modern computational techniques. The proposed work, which integrates elements of synthetic, mechanistic, and computational organic chemistry, is designed to provide undergraduates with a wholesome research experience, and enable them to make original contributions to scientific knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the most important broader impacts of this research, as mentioned above, is the mentoring of undergraduate researchers and training them as future scientists in a predominantly undergraduate institution. A number of ideas for melding research and education, based on approaches that have already met with success, will be implemented. This is exemplified, for instance, by the incorporation of research-like projects and new pedagogical experiments in the introductory organic chemistry laboratory course. The proposal also seeks to continue Prof. Thamattoor's highly successful program that provides research opportunities to high school students over the summer months. Women, minorities, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds will also be recruited to participate in summer research activities. In addition, there will be new initiative that forges partnerships with elementary school teachers to specifically strengthen the science curriculum in the K-3 level. Finally, it is expected that a number of important fundamental chemical reaction pathways will be elucidated.</AbstractNarration>
