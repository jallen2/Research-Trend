    <AbstractNarration>OISE-0736756 (Tomizuka, Masayoshi; University of California at Berkeley)&lt;br/&gt;U.S.-Japan Workshop on Advanced Integrated Sensor Technologies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a U.S.-Japan workshop on the topic of Advanced Integrated Sensor Technologies in Tokyo, Japan in summer 2007. The workshop, co-organized by Dr. Yozo Fujino of the University of Tokyo, will focus on sensors for a safe and secure society and better quality of life. The workshop aims to identify critical and strategic research and educational issues of mutual interest to researchers in the U.S. and Japan and to identify joint research projects and potential research teams for collaborative research activities. The workshop will include 13 senior researchers and 7 graduate students from the U.S., and a comparable number on the Japanese side. Collaborative research activities emerging from the workshop are expected to develop advanced sensors and sensing systems, innovative utilization of sensor systems for early detection of threats to disturb the safety and security of public and private spaces, including vehicles and buildings; reduction of disaster risk through the utilization of smart devices and systems; innovative assistive devices to help patients during rehabilitation; and effective prognostic and diagnostic evaluation of engineering systems including civil infrastructure. These activities form part of a program of U.S.-Japan collaborations taking place under the bilateral Framework Initiative for Science &amp; Technology for a Safe and Secure Society (FIS3).</AbstractNarration>
