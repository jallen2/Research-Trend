    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Zhou, the principal investigator, proposes to develop computational &lt;br/&gt;theory and methods for finding multiple unstable solutions to PDE &lt;br/&gt;(eigen) systems. Multiple unstable solutions, lowly or highly, singly or &lt;br/&gt;multiply excited, to many nonlinear systems have been observed with very &lt;br/&gt;different instabilities, maneuverabilities and configurations. Hence they &lt;br/&gt;imply a variety of applications. When multi-bodies (particles, molecules, &lt;br/&gt;species, etc.) are involved in a system, they may interact with each other &lt;br/&gt;in many different ways, such as strongly coupled vs. weakly coupled, &lt;br/&gt;cooperative vs. non-cooperative, definite vs. strongly indefinite, &lt;br/&gt;variational vs. non-variational, etc. Thus mathematically systems can be &lt;br/&gt;classified into many different types. Based on the results obtained from the &lt;br/&gt;previous NSF funded project and several successful preliminary &lt;br/&gt;investigations, the PI proposes a new game theory methodology that treats &lt;br/&gt;each body in a system as a player. According to the interactions among all &lt;br/&gt;bodies, two-level local optimization methods will be developed to solve &lt;br/&gt;proposed problems and mathematical justification of those methods will be &lt;br/&gt;established. Several important model problems in Bose-Einstein condensates, &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear optics, biology and non-Darcian/Newtonian fluids/materials are &lt;br/&gt;proposed to solve for testing the new theory and methods. The instability &lt;br/&gt;index of unstable solutions is important information for application and &lt;br/&gt;thus will be analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unstable solutions appear only in a short time period, but may have much &lt;br/&gt;higher performance index. They used to be considered too hard to catch by &lt;br/&gt;traditional technologies or numerical algorithms and thus too difficult to &lt;br/&gt;apply. Thanks to new technologies (synchrotronic, laser), scientists are now &lt;br/&gt;able to induce or reach various unstable solutions and search for NEW &lt;br/&gt;applications, in particular, in system design and control of EMERGENCY &lt;br/&gt;machineries for MISSION CRITICAL SITUATIONS. So far, understanding of such &lt;br/&gt;solutions is still quite limited and analytic solutions are too difficult to &lt;br/&gt;obtain. Thus, development of efficient and reliable numerical methods to &lt;br/&gt;solve such problems for multiple solutions in an order becomes very &lt;br/&gt;important to both research and applications. However, there is no theory in &lt;br/&gt;literature to devise such a method. The outcome of this project will (1) &lt;br/&gt;greatly enhance understanding of unstable solutions by mathematical &lt;br/&gt;characterizations and lay a solid foundation for future study, (2) provide &lt;br/&gt;efficient and reliable algorithms to compute multiple solutions so that &lt;br/&gt;people can compare and then select the best one, and (3) promote new &lt;br/&gt;applications with new solution configurations.</AbstractNarration>
