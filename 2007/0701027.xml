    <AbstractNarration>The research proposed lies in the area of ergodic theory and has &lt;br/&gt;several potential applications in combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt; In ergodic theory, the investigator plans to carry out an&lt;br/&gt;in depth analysis of the limiting behavior of multiple ergodic&lt;br/&gt;averages along various integer sequences, including polynomial &lt;br/&gt;sequences, sequences related to the prime numbers, Hardy&lt;br/&gt;sequences, and random non-lacunary sequences. The tools to be used&lt;br/&gt;include recent advances in the theory of characteristic factors&lt;br/&gt;and the theory of nilpotent Lie groups. The combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;implications are related to problems of finding (and in some cases&lt;br/&gt;``counting'') certain configurations that occur within every subset of&lt;br/&gt;the integers with positive density, thus obtaining several far&lt;br/&gt;reaching extensions of Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;progressions. Furthermore, it is plausible that the same&lt;br/&gt;configurations occur within the set of primes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project studies the long term behavior of physical and &lt;br/&gt;mathematical systems, evolving over time, whose dynamics is too&lt;br/&gt;complicated to be followed in microscopic detail. Ergodic theory&lt;br/&gt;introduces mathematical tools for understanding the asymptotic and&lt;br/&gt;average behavior of such systems. These tools have also come to &lt;br/&gt;play an important role in studying complicated number theoretic&lt;br/&gt;and combinatorial structures and the proposed project seeks to&lt;br/&gt;bring new light on these areas of research.</AbstractNarration>
