    <AbstractNarration>This award is aimed to aid US students to attend the ACM/IEEE 35th Annual International Symposium&lt;br/&gt;on Computer Architecture which will be held in Beijing, China, in June 2008. &lt;br/&gt;The ACM/IEEE Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is the flagship conference in&lt;br/&gt;computer architecture and its conference proceedings are viewed as the most prestigious publication venue in the&lt;br/&gt;computer architecture community. The symposia started in 1973 and it has been sponsored by the two most&lt;br/&gt;important academic organizations in computer architecture, the Special Interest Group on Computer Architecture&lt;br/&gt;(SIGARCH) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Technical Committee on Computer&lt;br/&gt;Architecture (TCCA) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The majority of historically&lt;br/&gt;high-impact publications on computer architecture have been published in this conference.&lt;br/&gt;It is a significant event that the 35th Annual Symposium of ISCA will be held in Beijing, China, in June 2008.&lt;br/&gt;This will be the first ISCA meeting held in China since the symposia started in 1973. &lt;br/&gt;This award will assist deserving students to attend and present their work at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
