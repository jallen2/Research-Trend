    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This project is designing and implementing an innovative laboratory course that integrates components of a sophomore analytical chemistry course with a first-semester biochemistry course. It focuses on student learning in four phases, combining directed and guided inquiry (GI) strategies with individual and team accountability in two weekly periods of progressively more complex and challenging laboratory sessions. The amount and type of learning support varies as the course proceeds. The protein cytochrome c (Cyt c) is selected as a central unifying theme, since it has been successfully used in undergraduate biochemistry curricula. Phase 1 adapts a set of experiments from the existing analytical course and the literature (about 12 laboratory periods). Students, working in pairs, are introduced to analytical equipment and techniques, Cyt c, and the expectations of a GI work environment. Phase 2 assigns students to learning teams and moves through a set of GI, project-based laboratories (about 9 periods). The students work at their own pace to apply the analytical techniques from Phase 1 to protein isolation, analysis, and characterization. Phase 3 allows the teams more independence in laboratory design, as they choose one of two final GI projects ( about 4 periods) incorporating molecular biology techniques, to study either oxidative damage of DNA by Cyt c or DNA isolation and sequencing of Cyt c. Phase 4 provides a capstone experience in which teams make presentations of research results (about 2 periods) to demonstrate their research expertise. The laboratory work is supported by the acquisition of an HPLC, a steady-state fluorimeter, and chromatography cabinets. Student learning is assessed at 5 stages, including entry-level, periodically during the course, at the end of the course, during their senior year, and post graduation. Assessments examine such learning outcomes as application of concepts, retention of content knowledge, retention and confidence in laboratory manipulative skills, use of scientific reasoning skills and higher-order cognition, and attitudes about methods and use of scientific research. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This innovative course design offers a unique opportunity for student learning in chemistry. Courses offering team-learning experiences and GI more realistically model the contemporary science workplace and actively engage students, and are expected to lead to greater student ownership of the learning process, increased content retention, and increased interest in a scientific career. Students are learning to relate techniques in one area of chemistry (analytical) directly to another (biochemistry), enlarging the scope of their career possibilities. The integration of modern analytical and biochemical techniques into Georgia Southern University's chemistry curriculum exposes students to a variety of techniques used in the rapidly expanding biotechnology industry. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The results gained from the detailed and specialized assessment built into this project are expected to contribute significantly to our understanding of GI and cooperative teaching and learning in STEM areas. The revised curriculum adapts to any institution with a chemistry major, as it does not require additional hours. Papers and presentations assure wide dissemination of the model. Due to Georgia Southern's demographics, a large proportion of the students are from underrepresented minority groups and the underserved rural population, contributing significantly to NSF's goal of diversifying the STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>
