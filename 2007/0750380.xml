    <AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Award in DRMS:&lt;br/&gt;Daily Diary Study of Hispanic Culture, Identity and Health&lt;br/&gt;Blair Johnson &lt;br/&gt;University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;0750380&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the question as to whether certain differences in risk taking behavior may be in part a consequence of cultural factors and, within immigrant subpopulations, a consequence of differences the degree of acculturation across group members. For example, a disproportionate number of Hispanics living and working in the United States are infected with HIV as compared to Whites, with young adults particularly at-risk for infection. Psychological pressures exerted as a result of discord between Hispanic and American cultures may be in part responsible for this health disparity as well as other differences in propensity to engage in risky activities. This research clarifies how a Hispanic individual's degree of acculturation relates to risky decision-making based on a "theory of planned behavior" framework. The study will collect data on participation in risky activities and acculturation with Hispanic young adults living in Hartford, CT via implementation of a three-week long daily measures (i.e., Palm Pilot) study. These data will be used to ascertain how daily fluctuations in "theory of planned behavior" variables (i.e., attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and intentions) predict risky behavior for Hispanics and examine the long-term predictive nature of subjective norms and past behavior. The study will also determine the extent to which daily changes in variables related to acculturation as well as endorsement of certain Hispanic cultural beliefs moderate HIV risk behavior for young Hispanics living in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
