    <AbstractNarration>The future of quantum information depends on the progress in quantum algorithms and material systems capable of implementing these algorithms. The two areas should develop in close cooperation. The goal of the proposed workshop is to bring together leading experts in these areas in order to discuss the future directions and the ways of strengthening collaboration between scientists working on quantum algorithms and nanosystems. The workshop should help to shape, focus, and potentially expand the interdisciplinary program on quantum information processing at the NSF. The workshop will last for two days. The program will include presentations by the invited speakers ? the experts on quantum algorithms and condensed matter theory and experiment. These presentations will be followed by the presentations of the scientists currently supported by the EMT program. A panel discussion will follow with the objective of formulating a broad program of research on quantum information processing and nanoscale systems.</AbstractNarration>
