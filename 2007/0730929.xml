    <AbstractNarration>General adoption of hydrogen as a vehicular fuel depends critically not only on the&lt;br/&gt;ability to store hydrogen on-board at high volumetric and gravimetric densities, but also&lt;br/&gt;on the ability to extract it at sufficiently rapid rates. Recent experimental and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;studies have identified several new complex hydrides with thermodynamic properties&lt;br/&gt;and material storage capacities approaching practical levels. However, all these&lt;br/&gt;materials suffer from extremely poor kinetics.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The focus of the proposed work is to develop a systematic, rational&lt;br/&gt;approach to designing novel nanostructured materials with fast (de)hydrogenation&lt;br/&gt;kinetics and favorable thermodynamics using state-of-the-art scientific computing. The&lt;br/&gt;accurate predictive power of first-principles modeling will be used to forecast and&lt;br/&gt;understand the microscopic kinetic processes involved in the hydrogen release and&lt;br/&gt;uptake and to design new material/catalyst systems with improved properties. An&lt;br/&gt;in-depth atomistic picture of the chemical reactions, diffusion pathways, and phase&lt;br/&gt;changes controlling the kinetics of hydrogen uptake and release will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental factors that control hydrogen-metal bond strength, the role of surface&lt;br/&gt;structure and finite size on the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydride nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;will also be investigated. The effect of dopants and nanoscale catalysts in achieving fast&lt;br/&gt;kinetics and reversibility will be elucidated at the atomic level.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The proposed work will aid in the development of computational&lt;br/&gt;materials science courses. In addition, there will be student exchange between&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern and UCLA, as students from each group will have the opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;extensive visits to the other. The results of the research will be disseminated through&lt;br/&gt;the education of graduate students, and introduction of undergraduate students to&lt;br/&gt;computational methods. It is expected that the skills acquired by the students, for&lt;br/&gt;example in the use of computational modeling and simulation, will prepare them for&lt;br/&gt;future work in the industrial and educational communities. Finally, successful&lt;br/&gt;completion of this research program will greatly assist the development of new&lt;br/&gt;hydrogen storage systems for clean, environmentally safe passenger vehicles.</AbstractNarration>
