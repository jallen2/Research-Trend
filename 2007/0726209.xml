    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of a workshop to foster and enhance direct interactions and partnerships between the tribal colleges and the EPSCoR state offices. The North Dakota EPSCOR Co-Project Directors and Tribal Colleges Liaison Program Coordinator will facilitate the workshop that brings together the EPSCoR state offices and tribal colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two and a half days workshop will focus on exchanging ideas and programmatic needs between tribal college presidents and EPSCoR state offices. The expectation is that this workshop will help increase and strengthen existing partnerships between Tribal Colleges and the EPSCoR state programs. The broader impact addressed is development of pathways of education and learning for tribal college students through collaborations between the EPSCoR state offices and the tribal colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The facilitation of the workshop will be performed by an experienced professional design and reporting agency who also has previous EPSCoR experience and will bring that knowledge to this workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop Objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Initiate dialogue and discussion among all participants representing the Tribal Colleges, EPSCoR jurisdiction personnel, and NSF EPSCoR personnel.&lt;br/&gt;2. Explore, using North Dakota as a model, how Tribal Colleges and EPSCoR can effectively work together to enhance human resource development in underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;3. Develop suggestions and guidelines from Tribal Colleges and EPSCoR jurisdictions, in consultation with NSF EPSCoR and TCUP representatives, for strengthening and growing additional programs and collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
