    <AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Single Molecular Devices for Molecular Nanocomputing: Synthesis, Device Fabrication and Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the current silicon complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology continues to increase the speed, capacity and computational power of modern computers, it approaches the fundamental limit at which processors can no longer be made smaller, faster and cheaper. This collaborative project will investigate single-molecule electronic devices as fundamental building blocks for molecular nanocomputing, an emerging technology for the next generation of information systems beyond CMOS integrated circuitry. By bringing together the complimentary expertises in organic synthesis (the Yu group at the University of Chicago), device fabrication and electrical characterization (the Tao group at the Arizona State University), and nanoscale theory/modeling (the Oleynik group at the University of South Florida) into a synergistic effort, the team will focus on the development of innovative computer technologies at the atomic and molecular levels using fundamental principles of nanoscience and engineering. This high-risk, high-return area of research promises revolutionary advances in developing faster and smaller computer chips beyond conventional silicon CMOS technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program includes three major thrusts: (1) to synthesize new "designer" molecules that will function as diodes, transistors, switches and information storage elements and with the help of theory/modeling to establish a structure/property relationship between a molecule's chemical nature and resulting electronic properties. (2) to assemble these "designer" molecules into nanocircuitry using STM, conducting AFM, and electrochemical break junctions for electrical characterization of single-molecule devices, and to control the electron transport in these molecules using electrochemical gating combined with the guidance from theory. (3) to develop fundamental operational principles of specific molecular devices using the theory of electron and hole resonant tunneling conduction, and to investigate molecule/electrode contacts, negative differential resistance switches, molecular field effect and bipolar transistors. The tightly coupled, vertically integrated research and educational activities will provide a unique opportunity to nurture the next generation of scientists and engineers who will put the science beyond Moore's law into practice.</AbstractNarration>
