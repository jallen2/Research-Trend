    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award supports US-participation in "China-US Polar Region Partnerships: The International Polar Year 2007-2008 and Beyond", a research roundtable to be held in Washington, DC from October 22-24, 2007. Leading China and US polar scientists will meet to exchange the latest scientific information on polar research and long term ecological observations, and have discussions aimed at strengthening US-China partnerships. The roundtable is part of the "George Bush China-U.S. Relations Conference". This annual conference promotes one of the US's most important global relationships, and expands both academic and business collaborations. The research roundtable is one and a half days in length and involves thirty participants that include senior government program administrators, scientific program managers, and academic researchers from China and the US. The format includes presentations and discussion panels. Topics include the importance of polar sciences to Chinese and US interests, China and US programs and plans for the International Polar year, the study of change in the Arctic, exploration of East Antarctica, and long term ecological research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this conference is a unique opportunity to encourage international collaboration. The meeting will foster partnerships based on mutual benefit and trust.</AbstractNarration>
