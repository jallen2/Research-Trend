    <AbstractNarration>The investigators propose creating a statistical model of engineering education that identifies difficult student stages for entry into the field. The study would use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including records of all degree-seeking undergraduate students for 9 institutions. They say that the proposal is intended to identify the "holes in the pipeline for the production of professional Engineers. It will provide an estimate of how big each hole is and how it developed. The intent of the study is to pave the way for increasing retention of minorities in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the ROLE program in the Division of Research, Evaluation and Communication and the STEP program in the Division of Undergraduate Education.</AbstractNarration>
