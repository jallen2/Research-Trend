    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this collaborative research project are to understand the physical and thermal aspects of the material removal process in machining titanium alloys and to improve machinability using novel cutting tools with variable micro-geometry design and nano-layered self lubricating coatings. The research approach would be to establish a methodology for physics-based prediction of cutting forces, temperatures, stresses and cyclical serrated chip formation in machining titanium alloys. Friction and heat flow at tool-chip-workpiece interfaces for various tool edge micro-geometry and nano-layered coatings will be identified by conducting cutting tests. Wear rate models that relate predicted process variables and contact conditions to tool wear under realistic machining conditions will be developed. These models will be utilized in determining optimum form and thickness of coating layers that will be applied on the variable micro-geometry cutting tools. These advanced coatings will be deposited using the electron beam physical vapor deposition process. Experimental testing will be performed in industrial scale test-beds to validate improved machinability and tool life at high speed machining regimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits and broader impacts of this research will be the use of novel cutting tools with variable micro-geometry and nano-layered self lubricating coatings in high speed machining of several exotic and difficult-to-machine alloys. It is expected that this advanced cutting tool design and simulation capability would reduce the cost in product design and development and improve productivity in aerospace, automotive, military, chemical and medical device industry where titanium alloys are utilized. The project will also provide exposure for graduate and undergraduate students to methods of physics-based simulation modeling in material removal processes and to understand thermal and wear behavior of nano-layered coatings. Participation of underrepresented student groups into the project tasks will be encouraged to provide diversity, teamwork and a discovery-based learning atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>
