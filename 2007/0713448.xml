    <AbstractNarration>Previous approaches to statistical machine translation (SMT) have&lt;br/&gt;employed phrase-based models which represent phrases as sequences of&lt;br/&gt;fully-inflected words, and are otherwise devoid of linguistic&lt;br/&gt;detail. Such approaches are unable to generalize and essentially&lt;br/&gt;rely on memorizing the translations of words and phrases that are&lt;br/&gt;observed in training data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to improve the quality of SMT through the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of more sophisticated models which represent phrases&lt;br/&gt;using multiple levels of information. This can include basic&lt;br/&gt;linguistic information such as part of speech, lemmas, and agreement&lt;br/&gt;information (case, number, person), as well as more sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;linguistic detail including semantic classes, argument structure,&lt;br/&gt;co-reference, phrase boundaries, and information propagated from&lt;br/&gt;syntactic heads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By annotating all data with this information and extending models&lt;br/&gt;appropriately, there is the potential to learn much more from&lt;br/&gt;training than was possible under previous approaches. There is now&lt;br/&gt;the potential to learn translations of unseen words if other forms of&lt;br/&gt;the words occur; it is now possible to learn general facts about a language's&lt;br/&gt;word order; it is now feasible to use linguistic context to generate&lt;br/&gt;grammatical output. Such generalization has the potential to result&lt;br/&gt;in much higher quality translation, especially for languages that&lt;br/&gt;only have small amounts of training data. It therefore represents a&lt;br/&gt;significant advance over previous approaches to SMT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-level models have the potential for wide-ranging impact on&lt;br/&gt;all language technologies. Simultaneous modeling of different&lt;br/&gt;levels of representation is an extremely useful and natural way of&lt;br/&gt;describing language. This project is developing a general framework&lt;br/&gt;for the creation of multi-level probabilistic models of language and&lt;br/&gt;translation, and exploring its application to tasks beyond&lt;br/&gt;translation including generation, paraphrasing, and the automatic&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of natural language technologies.</AbstractNarration>
