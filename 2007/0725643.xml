    <AbstractNarration>Proposal 0725643&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to construct 3-D cylindrical probe arrays with nanoscale spacing between the probes. This will provide a unique opportunity for nanoscale imaging without the challenges of using short wavelength radiation or the limitations of inferring 3-D structure from spectroscopic information. The approach is to use the interconnect available in current deep submicron CMOS integrated circuit technology to construct a near-field imaging 3-D cylindrical array of nanometer sized probes, into which nanoscale objects can be placed to be imaged using subwavelength electromagnetic radiation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research stems from challenges in the fabrication of the probe array and cavity, and development of the wetting technology to deliver nanoparticles and biomolecules to the imaging site. In addition, the decoding of the measured signals from the 3-D sensor probes, to produce structural information about nanometer-sized objects is mathematically challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have broad impact in proteomics and nanoparticle research. In the RCBS Protein Data Bank, there are a total of 25 diseases and 112 gene clusters without 3-D structural information available for the encoded proteins; many of the encoded proteins have never been found naturally and cannot yet be synthesized, due to inability to duplicate the protein folding conditions required. Developing the proposed probe device will allow the massively parallel screening necessary to find the protein folding conditions, potentially leading to many disease cures. Aspects of this research will be incorporated into K-12 educational initiatives, and participation of underrepresented groups will be actively sought.</AbstractNarration>
