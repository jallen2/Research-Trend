    <AbstractNarration>Recent Internet expansion, at least in terms of geographical coverage, has largely occurred using wireless technology. The goal of this research grant is to enable the deployment of service-capable and responsive wireless-based networks through real-time network diagnosis and dynamic adaptation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only through an integration of real-time measurement and analysis (localized, autonomous adaptation by network devices, and management though visualization and interactive analysis) can wireless networks achieve long-term utility and stability while also providing support for increasingly complex services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this project is divided into five areas: dynamic monitoring, which includes work to improve the accuracy of monitored data as well as the real-time capability to perform targeted high-fidelity monitoring; network health diagnosis, which attempts to determine the real-time operational status of a variety of metrics; dynamic provisioning, which uses status information to adjust network operation and protocol parameters in order to improve performance; interactive visualization, which attempts to aid network understanding through interactive and scalable display techniques; and finally, management and planning, which takes a longer-term view of wireless network operations and focuses on capabilities like additional resource placement. These projects provide intellectual merit through new designs for wireless networks, work to develop a clear set of design solutions, investigation of possible alternatives within each set, and evaluation of proposed solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will have a broad impact on research, industry, society, and education. It will offer new directions in research, impact wireless network design and deployment, and improve the robustness of wireless network deployments.</AbstractNarration>
