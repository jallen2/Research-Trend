    <AbstractNarration>Groups are routinely asked to perform tasks and to make important decisions. It is often assumed that groups are less biased and more capable than individuals when accomplishing goals. However, past research shows that sometimes groups can exaggerate existing biases and perform worse than individuals. Clearly, it is still necessary to investigate the processes associated with working in groups to understand how situational and social forces can enhance collective efforts. The proposed research attempts to further this aim by applying an approach and avoidance motivational framework to small group processes and behavior. When the approach motivational system is activated, individuals focus on rewarding cues in the environment, and respond eagerly and with stronger goal-directed efforts. The avoidance motivation system leads individuals to respond vigilantly to threat signals, and proceed with caution until safety is assured. A number of factors related to the approach and avoidance motivation systems are also associated with groups. Activation of the approach system increases in the presence of potential rewards, while activation of the avoidance system increases in the presence of potential threats. Because involvement in groups is seen as personally beneficial, people are predicted to feel more confident, eager, and effective working in groups. Also, because groups provide their members with a sense of safety and security, they are predicted to see threats as less severe. Across two studies the proposed research explores whether working in groups increases approach and decreases avoidance motivation. Due to their influences on a broad range of circumstances, integrating knowledge on approach and avoidance motivation systems will be helpful in explaining the processes and experiences of group involvement. In particular, this research will help uncover how groups systematically impact thoughts, feelings, decisions, and actions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge gained from the proposed research can enhance decision making processes and outcomes across a variety of important contexts. If decision-making groups heighten approach motivation, then they may eagerly pursue rewarding outcomes and goals. If group involvement decreases avoidance motivation, then group members may be less sensitive than individuals to threats and less likely to be concerned with potential negative consequences. These propositions can help explain group overconfidence, perceived invulnerability to threats, and group risk taking. A main aim of the proposed research is to increase the effectiveness of group decisions to prevent disastrous outcomes and to utilize the strengths of groups to achieve better solutions. In addition to these societal benefits, this research provides valuable teaching, training, and learning experiences for the undergraduate and graduate students involved in all stages of the research process.</AbstractNarration>
