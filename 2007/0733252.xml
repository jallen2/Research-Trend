    <AbstractNarration>The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) researches the use of cyberinfrastructure to implement a strategy for using online telescopes as a laboratory to engage middle and high school students in cutting edge science research while providing them with significant new opportunities to apply STEM concepts, practice inquiry, and design and learn about the nature of scientific discovery. Two laboratory modules, tailored specifically for Earth science, astronomy and physics classrooms explore a range of outstanding mysteries such as the search for habitable worlds and the search for the origins of the universe. These studies emphasize national standards on the behavior of light and the nature of gravity. Students' own work with online telescopes provides a conceptual foundation from which they can explore cutting edge science supplementing their own work with professional images and data from research activities. Laboratory modules are used as embedded assessments to reveal students' mastery of core concepts and skills. Students can share data in a collaborative online journal and scientists from SAO serve as virtual guides - drawing connections between student work and research activities and suggesting additional research challenges. The project develops materials that can be used in both formal and informal settings and investigates the use of techniques from informal science in formal settings. New strategies for assessing student understanding of the nature of scientific discovery are developed. The project builds upon previous development efforts that include working with students underrepresented in the scientific workforce and upon previous professional development projects. Connections to other astronomy and space science projects are made.</AbstractNarration>
