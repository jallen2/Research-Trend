    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for EPS-0701812 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky proposes hosting the 19th Annual NSF EPSCoR National Conference, which&lt;br/&gt;will take place in Lexington, Kentucky on November 7-10, 2006. The agenda will&lt;br/&gt;address the theme, "Rising above the Gathering Storm: Innovating to Compete in a&lt;br/&gt;Global Economy." This conference topic is intended to expand upon the recent&lt;br/&gt;"Gathering Storm" report produced by the National Academy of Sciences. This is a&lt;br/&gt;timely topic demonstrated by the shift of industry in recent years to locating or relocating&lt;br/&gt;their manufacturing plants in geographical areas where there exists a well-educated&lt;br/&gt;workforce, and low-cost labor is readily available. In today's world, where advanced&lt;br/&gt;knowledge is widespread and low-cost labor is plentiful, U.S. advantages in the&lt;br/&gt;marketplace and in science and technology have begun to erode. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this topic is related to the exploration of how the EPSCoR community can contribute to advancing science and technology in a rapidly changing world so Americans can continue to benefit from a high standard of living and national security.&lt;br/&gt;The conference theme "Rising above the Gathering Storm" aligns with Federal priorities&lt;br/&gt;and the President's American Competitiveness Initiative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regard to broader impacts, the conference agenda will include a diverse range of topic areas that will be of interest to both EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR participants alike. The presentations and speakers have been strategically selected to represent a diverse group of view points and areas of expertise including: public sector; private sector; national laboratories;&lt;br/&gt;university administration; and many others. Student participation will allow these important insights to be further extended to the educational system.</AbstractNarration>
