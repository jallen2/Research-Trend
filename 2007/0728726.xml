    <AbstractNarration>This program is awarding scholarships to full-time students majoring in computer science who demonstrate both academic potential and financial need. A special effort is being made to attract academically talented students from underrepresented groups including women. Scholars are enrolling in a mentoring program designed to increase both the retention and graduation rates of STEM majors. They are participating in mentoring meetings, faculty-led undergraduate research projects, and internships sponsored by industrial partners. The project is increasing the quality, and scope, of student support structures available for recruitment, retention and career placement. The project is making an impact in undergraduate Computing education in the region.</AbstractNarration>
