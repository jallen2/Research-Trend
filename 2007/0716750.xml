    <AbstractNarration>The correct behavior and reliable operation of an information system&lt;br/&gt;relies not only on what users are permitted to do, but oftentimes on&lt;br/&gt;what users are required to do. Such obligatory actions are integral&lt;br/&gt;to the security procedures of many enterprises. The management of&lt;br/&gt;obligations in security policies imposes significant technical&lt;br/&gt;challenges since obligations bear quite different properties from&lt;br/&gt;traditional access control. For example, obligations assigned to&lt;br/&gt;users often cannot be enforced. Thus, even if a system¡¯s reference&lt;br/&gt;monitor is trusted, the failure of obligations must be considered,&lt;br/&gt;and appropriate remedies need to be an integral part of security&lt;br/&gt;policies. Also, the interaction between obligations and other&lt;br/&gt;components of security policies (e.g., access control) must be&lt;br/&gt;considered to ensure their consistency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a comprehensive framework for the management&lt;br/&gt;of obligations in security policies, which covers the full life&lt;br/&gt;cycle of obligations, including obligation modeling, specification,&lt;br/&gt;analysis, monitoring and discharges. Specifically, the project&lt;br/&gt;formally identifies the desirable security objectives that are&lt;br/&gt;characteristic of systems that involve obligations, and&lt;br/&gt;systematically investigates dynamic and static means to maintaining&lt;br/&gt;these objectives while such systems evolve. Though the framework is&lt;br/&gt;formal in nature, and is designed on purpose to be general, the&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of its usefulness and effectiveness is firmly grounded on&lt;br/&gt;real applications, in particular, in the context of privacy policy&lt;br/&gt;enforcement in health care systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to establish a solid foundation for the management&lt;br/&gt;of obligations, and significantly improve the understanding and&lt;br/&gt;practice of obligations in information systems. The societal benefit&lt;br/&gt;of the project also results from the development and dissemination&lt;br/&gt;of education resources on new types of security policies beyond&lt;br/&gt;traditional access control.</AbstractNarration>
